https://openalex.org/W3131460561,"T cells are critical effectors of cancer immunotherapies, but little is known about their gene expression programs in diffuse gliomas. Here, we leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to chart the gene expression and clonal landscape of tumor-infiltrating T cells across 31 patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma and IDH mutant glioma. We identify potential effectors of anti-tumor immunity in subsets of T cells that co-express cytotoxic programs and several natural killer (NK) cell genes. Analysis of clonally expanded tumor-infiltrating T cells further identifies the NK gene KLRB1 (encoding CD161) as a candidate inhibitory receptor. Accordingly, genetic inactivation of KLRB1 or antibody-mediated CD161 blockade enhances T cell-mediated killing of glioma cells in vitro and their anti-tumor function in vivo. KLRB1 and its associated transcriptional program are also expressed by substantial T cell populations in other human cancers. Our work provides an atlas of T cells in gliomas and highlights CD161 and other NK cell receptors as immunotherapy targets."
https://openalex.org/W3129807735,"Vaccine hesitancy could become a significant impediment to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and factors associated with vaccine intentions. A national panel survey by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) was designed to be representative of the US household population. Sampled respondents were invited to complete the survey between May 14 and 18, 2020 in English or Spanish. 1,056 respondents completed the survey—942 via the web and 114 via telephone. The dependent variable was assessed by the item “If a vaccine against the coronavirus becomes available, do you plan to get vaccinated, or not?” Approximately half (53.6%) reported intending to be vaccinated, 16.7% did not intend, and 29.7% were unsure. In the adjusted stepwise multinominal logistic regression, Black and Hispanic respondents were significantly less likely to report intending to be vaccinated as were respondents who were females, younger, and those who were more politically conservative. Compared to those who reported positive vaccine intentions, respondents with negative vaccine intentions were significantly less likely to report that they engaged in the COVID-19 prevention behaviors of wearing masks (aOR = 0.53, CI = 0.37–0.76) and social distancing (aOR = 0.22, CI = 0.12–0.42). In a sub-analysis of reasons not to be vaccinated, significant race/ethnic differences were observed. This national survey indicated a modest level of COVID-19 vaccine intention. These data suggest that public health campaigns for vaccine uptake should assess in greater detail the vaccine concerns of Blacks, Hispanics, and women to tailor programs."
https://openalex.org/W3131356212,"This study reports a comprehensive empirical investigation of the nature and correlates of anti-mask attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR; i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3132159056,"Mortality due to Covid-19 is highly associated with advanced age, owing in large part to severe lower respiratory tract infection. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection. Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to age-associated vulnerability is currently unknown. We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology. Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels. Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing. ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tissues were selected from the specimen inventory at a large teaching hospital collected between 2010–2020. Twelve samples were chosen from patients receiving mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). Twenty samples were selected from patients not requiring ventilation. We compared samples across age, ranging from 40–83 years old in the ventilated cohort and 14–80 years old in the non-ventilated cohort. Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II / AT2 cells) and alveolar macrophages. All 12 samples from our ventilated cohort showed histologic features of diffuse alveolar damage including reactive, proliferating AT2 cells. In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.004) or cellularity (p = 0.003), associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells. In non-ventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.231) or cellularity (p = 0.349). In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid-19 mortality in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3129541046,"Ivermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers.A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 μg/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Chemoprophylaxis has relevance in the containment of pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3129748389,"Purpose The 30-day mortality rate after hip fracture surgery has been considered as an indirect indicator of the quality of care. The aim of this work is to analyse preoperative and postoperative factors potentially related to early 30-day mortality in patients over 65 undergoing hip fracture surgery. Methods Prospective cohort study including all consecutive primary hip fracture patients over 65 admitted to Trauma and Orthopaedics department from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Bed-ridden, non- surgically treated patients, and high energy trauma or tumoral aetiology fractures were excluded. A total of 943 patients were eligible (attrition rate: 2.1%). Follow-up included 30-days after discharge. We noted the 30-day mortality after hip fracture surgery, analysing 130 potentially related variables including biodemographic, fracture-related, preoperative, and postoperative clinical factors. Qualitative variables were assessed by χ 2 , and quantitative variables by non-parametric tests. Odds ratio determined by binary logistic regression. We selected preventable candidate variables for multivariate risk assessment by logistic regression. Results A total of 923 patients were enrolled (mean age 86.22±6.8, 72.9% women). The 30-day mortality rate was 6.0%. We noted significant increased mortality on men (OR = 2.381[1.371–4.136], p = 0.002), ageing patients (OR year = 1.073[1.025–1.122], p = 0.002), and longer time to surgery (OR day = 1.183[1.039–1146], p&lt;0.001), on other 20 preoperative clinical variables, like lymphopenia (lymphocyte count &lt;10 3 /μl, OR = 1.842[1.063–3.191], p = 0.029), hypoalbuminemia (≤3.5g/dl, OR = 2.474[1.316–4.643], p = 0.005), and oral anticoagulant intake (OR = 2.499[1.415–4.415], p = 0.002), and on 25 postoperative clinical variables, like arrhythmia (OR = 13.937[6.263–31.017], p&lt;0.001), respiratory insufficiency (OR = 7.002[3.947–12.419], p&lt;0.001), hyperkalaemia (OR = 10.378[3.909–27.555], p&lt;0.001), nutritional supply requirement (OR = 3.576[1.894–6.752], p = 0.021), or early arthroplasty dislocation (OR = 6.557[1.206–35.640], p = 0.029). We developed a predictive model for early mortality after hip fracture surgery based on postoperative factors with 96.0% sensitivity and 60.7% specificity (AUC = 0.863). Conclusion We revealed that not only preoperative, but also postoperative factors have a great impact after hip fracture surgery. The influence of post-operative factors on 30-day mortality has a logical basis, albeit so far they have not been identified or quantified before. Our results provide an advantageous picture of the 30-day mortality after hip fracture surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3129948342,"Up to 30% of people who test positive to SARS-CoV-2 will develop severe COVID-19 and require hospitalisation. Age, gender, and comorbidities are known to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are generally considered independently without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effect on risk, potentially resulting in incorrect risk estimation. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC = 0.786; 95% confidence interval = 0.763 to 0.808) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC = 0.635; 95% confidence interval = 0.607 to 0.662). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors–not age and gender–that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone (or only clinical factors) to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3133395660,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of drastic shutdown measures worldwide. While quarantine, self-isolation and shutdown laws helped to effectively contain and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on trauma care in emergency departments (EDs) remains elusive. Methods All ED patient records from the 35-day COVID-19 shutdown (SHUTDOWN) period were retrospectively compared to a calendar-matched control period in 2019 (CTRL) as well as to a pre (PRE)- and post (POST)-shutdown period in an academic Level I Trauma Center in Berlin, Germany. Total patient and orthopedic trauma cases and contacts as well as trauma causes and injury patterns were evaluated during respective periods regarding absolute numbers, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and risk ratios (RRs). Findings Daily total patient cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 106.94 vs. 167.54) and orthopedic trauma cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 30.91 vs. 52.06) decreased during the SHUTDOWN compared to the CTRL period with IRRs of 0.64 and 0.59. While absolute numbers decreased for most trauma causes during the SHUTDOWN period, we observed increased incidence proportions of household injuries and bicycle accidents with RRs of 1.31 and 1.68 respectively. An RR of 2.41 was observed for injuries due to domestic violence. We further recorded increased incidence proportions of acute and regular substance abuse during the SHUTDOWN period with RRs of 1.63 and 3.22, respectively. Conclusions While we observed a relevant decrease in total patient cases, relative proportions of specific trauma causes and injury patterns increased during the COVID-19 shutdown in Berlin, Germany. As government programs offered prompt financial aid during the pandemic to individuals and businesses, additional social support may be considered for vulnerable domestic environments."
https://openalex.org/W3133076494,"Kelp forests form an important biogenic habitat that responds to natural and human drivers. Global concerns exist about threats to kelp forests, yet long-term information is limited and research suggests that trends are geographically distinct. We examined distribution of the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana over 145 years in South Puget Sound (SPS), a semi-protected inner basin in a fjord estuary complex in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We synthesized 48 historical and modern Nereocystis surveys and examined presence/absence within 1-km segments along 452 km of shoreline. Compared to the earliest baseline in 1878, Nereocystis extent in 2017 decreased 63%, with individual sub-basins showing up to 96% loss. Losses have persisted for decades, across a range of climate conditions. In recent decades, Nereocystis predominantly occurred along shorelines with intense currents and mixing, where temperature and nutrient concentrations did not reach thresholds for impacts to Nereocystis performance, and high current speeds likely excluded grazers. Losses predominated in areas with elevated temperature, lower nutrient concentrations, and relatively low current velocities. The pattern of long-term losses in SPS contrasts with stability in floating kelp abundance during the last century in an area of the Salish Sea with greater wave exposure and proximity to oceanic conditions. These findings support the hypothesis that kelp beds along wave-sheltered shorelines exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental stressors. Additionally, shorelines with strong currents and deep-water mixing may provide refugia within sheltered systems."
https://openalex.org/W3132588977,"Skin cancer patients often have tumorigenic lesions on their noses. Surgical resection of the lesions often results in nasal cartilage removal. Cartilage grafts taken from other anatomical sites are used for the surgical reconstruction of the nasal cartilage, but donor-site morbidity is a common problem. Autologous tissue-engineered nasal cartilage grafts can mitigate the problem, but commercially available scaffolds define the shape and sizes of the engineered grafts during tissue fabrication. Moreover, the engineered grafts suffer from the inhomogeneous distribution of the functional matrix of cartilage. Advances in 3D bioprinting technology offer the opportunity to engineer cartilages with customizable dimensions and anatomically shaped configurations without the inhomogeneous distribution of cartilage matrix. Here, we report the fidelity of Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogel (FRESH) bioprinting as a strategy to generate customizable and homogenously distributed functional cartilage matrix engineered nasal cartilage. Using FRESH and in vitro chondrogenesis, we have fabricated tissue-engineered nasal cartilage from combining bovine type I collagen hydrogel and human nasoseptal chondrocytes. The engineered nasal cartilage constructs displayed molecular, biochemical and histological characteristics akin to native human nasal cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W3132646743,"Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worst pandemic. The clinical characteristics vary from asymptomatic to fatal. This study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) levels and the severity of COVID-19. Methods and study design A cohort study included 147 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were categorized into 4 groups by BMI levels on admission: &lt;18.5 (underweight), 18.5–22.9 (normal weight), 23.0–24.9 (overweight), and ≥25.0 kg/m 2 (obese). Rates of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and ICU stay during hospitalization across BMI group was determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between BMI and severe pneumonia. Results Of the totals, patients having a BMI &lt;18.5, 18.5–22.9, 23.0–24.9, and ≥25.0 kg/m 2 were 12.9%, 38.1%, 17.7%, and 31.3%, respectively. The rates of pneumonia and severe pneumonia tended to be higher in patients with higher BMI, whereas the rates of AKI and ICU stay were higher in patients with BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 and ≥ 25 kg/m 2 , when compared to patients with normal BMI. After controlling for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia in the logistic regression analysis, having a BMI ≥25.0 kg/m 2 was associated with higher risk of severe pneumonia (OR 4.73; 95% CI, 1.50–14.94; p = 0.003) compared to having a BMI 18.5–22.9 kg/m 2 . During admission, elevated hemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase levels on day 7 and 14 of illness were associated with higher BMI levels. In contrast, rising of serum creatinine levels was observed in underweight patients on days 12 and 14 of illness. Conclusions Obesity in patients with COVID-19 was associated with severe pneumonia and adverse outcomes such as AKI, transaminitis and ICU stay. Underweight patients should be closely monitored for AKI. Further studies in body composition are warranted to explore the links between adiposity and COVID-19 pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3131934794,"The retinal output is the sole source of visual information for the brain. Studies in non-primate mammals estimate that this information is carried by several dozens of retinal ganglion cell types, each informing the brain about different aspects of a visual scene. Even though morphological studies of primate retina suggest a similar diversity of ganglion cell types, research has focused on the function of only a few cell types. In human retina, recordings from individual cells are anecdotal or focus on a small subset of identified types. Here, we present the first systematic ex-vivo recording of light responses from 342 ganglion cells in human retinas obtained from donors. We find a great variety in the human retinal output in terms of preferences for positive or negative contrast, spatio-temporal frequency encoding, contrast sensitivity, and speed tuning. Some human ganglion cells showed similar response behavior as known cell types in other primate retinas, while we also recorded light responses that have not been described previously. This first extensive description of the human retinal output should facilitate interpretation of primate data and comparison to other mammalian species, and it lays the basis for the use of ex-vivo human retina for in-vitro analysis of novel treatment approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3132612376,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the developed world. A more sensitive and specific detection strategy for lethal prostate cancer beyond serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) population screening is urgently needed. Diagnosis by canine olfaction, using dogs trained to detect cancer by smell, has been shown to be both specific and sensitive. While dogs themselves are impractical as scalable diagnostic sensors, machine olfaction for cancer detection is testable. However, studies bridging the divide between clinical diagnostic techniques, artificial intelligence, and molecular analysis remains difficult due to the significant divide between these disciplines. We tested the clinical feasibility of a cross-disciplinary, integrative approach to early prostate cancer biosensing in urine using trained canine olfaction, volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) artificial neural network (ANN)-assisted examination, and microbial profiling in a double-blinded pilot study. Two dogs were trained to detect Gleason 9 prostate cancer in urine collected from biopsy-confirmed patients. Biopsy-negative controls were used to assess canine specificity as prostate cancer biodetectors. Urine samples were simultaneously analyzed for their VOC content in headspace via GC-MS and urinary microbiota content via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing. In addition, the dogs’ diagnoses were used to train an ANN to detect significant peaks in the GC-MS data. The canine olfaction system was 71% sensitive and between 70–76% specific at detecting Gleason 9 prostate cancer. We have also confirmed VOC differences by GC-MS and microbiota differences by 16S rDNA sequencing between cancer positive and biopsy-negative controls. Furthermore, the trained ANN identified regions of interest in the GC-MS data, informed by the canine diagnoses. Methodology and feasibility are established to inform larger-scale studies using canine olfaction, urinary VOCs, and urinary microbiota profiling to develop machine olfaction diagnostic tools. Scalable multi-disciplinary tools may then be compared to PSA screening for earlier, non-invasive, more specific and sensitive detection of clinically aggressive prostate cancers in urine samples."
https://openalex.org/W3133305435,"There are strong interactions between an economic system and its ecological context. In this sense, livestock have been an integral part of human economies since the Neolithic, contributing significantly to the creation and maintenance of agricultural anthropized landscapes. For this reason, in the frame of the ERC-StG project ’ZooMWest’ we collected and analyzed thousands of zooarchaeological data from NE Iberia. By considering these data in comparison with ecological indicators (archaeobotanical remains) and archaeological evidence (settlement characteristics and their distribution) this paper seeks to characterize changes in animal production and the relationship between people, livestock, and their environment. These methods allow for an investigation of the topic at different scales (site, zone, territory) with a broad diachronic perspective, and for consideration of orography and cultural traditions alongside climatic factors. Through this integration of various streams of evidence, we aim to better understand the structure of ancient economic systems and the way they conditioned human decision-making on animal production. Results show a shifting relationship with the territory between the Bronze Age and Late Antiquity, in which market requirements and an economic model with a higher degree of integration increasingly influenced husbandry strategies. These processes are reflected in changes in land use and forms of territorial occupation, although along different rhythms and trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W3131131338,"Current strategies for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are based on anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory drugs. Those drugs have the potential to reduce the frequency of new lesions but do not directly promote remyelination in the damaged central nervous system (CNS). Targeting CXCR7 (ACKR3) has been postulated as a potential therapeutic approach in demyelinating diseases, leading to both immunomodulation by reducing leukocyte infiltrates and promyelination by enhancing myelin repair. ACT-1004-1239 is a potent, selective, insurmountable, and orally available first-in-class CXCR7 receptor antagonist. The effect of ACT-1004-1239 was evaluated in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse models. In addition, ACT-1004-1239 was assessed in a rat oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation assay in vitro. In the MOG-induced EAE model, ACT-1004-1239 treatment (10-100 mg/kg, twice daily, orally) showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in disease clinical scores, resulting in increased survival. At the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg, twice daily), ACT-1004-1239 delayed disease onset and significantly reduced immune cell infiltrates into the CNS and plasma neurofilament light chain concentration. Treatment with ACT-1004-1239 dose-dependently increased plasma CXCL12 concentration, which correlated with a reduction of the cumulative disease score. Furthermore, in the cuprizone model, ACT-1004-1239 treatment significantly increased the number of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and enhanced myelination in vivo. In vitro, ACT-1004-1239 promoted the maturation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes. These results provide evidence that ACT-1004-1239 both reduces neuroinflammation and enhances myelin repair substantiating the rationale to explore its therapeutic potential in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3132699092,"CYP4B1 belongs to the mammalian CYP4 enzyme family and is predominantly expressed in the lungs of humans. It is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. In this study, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, a secondary analysis was performed to explore the expression profile of CYP4B1 , as well as its prognostic value in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Based on the obtained results, a significantly decreased CYP4B1 expression was discovered in patients with LUAD when compared with their normal counterparts ( p &lt;0.05), and was linked to age younger than 65 years ( p = 0.0041), history of pharmaceutical ( p = 0.0127) and radiation ( p = 0.0340) therapy, mutations in KRAS/EGFR/ALK ( p = 0.0239), and living status of dead ( p = 0.0026). Survival analysis indicated that the low CYP4B1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of shorter survival in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with LUAD. The copy number alterations (CNAs) and sites of cg23440155 and cg23414387 hypermethylation might contribute to the decreased CYP4B1 expression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that CYP4B1 might act as an oncogene in LUAD by preventing biological metabolism pathways of exogenous and endogenous compounds and enhancing DNA replication and cell cycle activities. In conclusion, CYP4B1 expression may serve as a valuable independent prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in patients with LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W3131134650,"Background Libman-Sacks endocarditis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is commonly complicated with embolic cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or valve dysfunction for which high-risk valve surgery is frequently performed. However, the role of medical therapy alone for Libman-Sacks endocarditis and associated acute CVD remains undefined. Objective To determine in this cross-sectional and longitudinal study if conventional anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic therapy may be an effective therapy in SLE patients with Libman-Sacks endocarditis and associated acute CVD. Methods and materials 17 SLE patients with Libman-Sacks endocarditis detected by two-and-three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and complicated with acute CVD [stroke/TIA, focal brain injury on MRI, or cognitive dysfunction] were treated with conventional anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic therapy for a median of 6 months and then underwent repeat TEE, transcranial Doppler, brain MRI, and neurocognitive testing for re-assessment of Libman-Sacks endocarditis and CVD. Results Valve vegetations decreased in number, diameter, and area (all p ≤0.01); associated valve regurgitation significantly improved (p = 0.04), and valve thickening did not progress (p = 0.56). In 13 (76%) patients, valve vegetations or valve regurgitation resolved or improved in number and size or by ≥1 degree, respectively, as compared to 4 (24%) patients in whom vegetations or valve regurgitation persisted unchanged or increased in size or by ≥1 degree (p = 0.03). Also, cerebromicroembolism, lobar and global gray and white matter cerebral perfusion, ischemic brain lesion load, and neurocognitive dysfunction resolved or significantly improved (all p ≤0.04). Conclusion These preliminary data suggest that combined conventional anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic therapy may be an effective treatment for Libman-Sacks endocarditis and its associated CVD and may obviate the need for high-risk valve surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3131977856,"In response to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to reduce healthcare workers’ (HCWs’) exposure to tuberculosis (TB) in health settings, congregate settings, and households, the national TB control program of Bangladesh developed guidelines for TB infection prevention and control (IPC) in 2011. This study aimed to assess the implementation of the TB IPC healthcare measures in health settings in Bangladesh. Between February and June 2018, we conducted a mixed-method study at 11 health settings. The team conducted 59 key-informant interviews with HCWs to understand the status of and barriers impeding the implementation of the TB IPC guidelines. The team also performed a facility assessment survey and examined TB IPC practices. Most HCWs were unaware of the national TB IPC guidelines. There were no TB IPC plans or committees at the health settings. Further, a presumptive pulmonary TB patient triage checklist was absent in all health settings. However, during facility assessment, we observed patient triaging and separation in the TB specialty hospitals. Routine cough-etiquette advice was provided to the TB patients mentioned during the key-informant interviews, which was consistent with findings from the survey. This study identified poor implementation of TB IPC measures in health settings. Limited knowledge of the guidelines resulted in poor implementation of the recommendations. Interventions focusing on the dissemination of the TB IPC guidelines to HCWs along with regular training may improve compliance. Such initiatives should be taken by hospital senior leadership as well as national policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W3130233321,"<h2>Summary</h2> Normative theories and statistical inference provide complementary approaches for the study of biological systems. A normative theory postulates that organisms have adapted to efficiently solve essential tasks and proceeds to mathematically work out testable consequences of such optimality; parameters that maximize the hypothesized organismal function can be derived <i>ab initio</i>, without reference to experimental data. In contrast, statistical inference focuses on the efficient utilization of data to learn model parameters, without reference to any <i>a priori</i> notion of biological function. Traditionally, these two approaches were developed independently and applied separately. Here, we unify them in a coherent Bayesian framework that embeds a normative theory into a family of maximum-entropy ""optimization priors."" This family defines a smooth interpolation between a data-rich inference regime and a data-limited prediction regime. Using three neuroscience datasets, we demonstrate that our framework allows one to address fundamental challenges relating to inference in high-dimensional, biological problems."

However, the technique has two main limitations, namely the inability to consider interaction terms and the lack of a statistical test for determining the significance of selected features. This study proposes a High Dimensional Selection with Interactions (HDSI) algorithm, a new feature selection method, which can handle high-dimensional data, incorporate interaction terms, provide the statistical inferences of selected features and leverage the capability of existing classical statistical techniques. The method allows the application of any statistical technique like LASSO and subset selection on multiple bootstrapped samples; each contains randomly selected features. Each bootstrap data incorporates interaction terms for the randomly sampled features. The selected features from each model are pooled and their statistical significance is determined. The selected statistically significant features are used as the final output of the approach, whose final coefficients are estimated using appropriate statistical techniques. The performance of HDSI is evaluated using both simulated data and real studies. In general, HDSI outperforms the commonly used algorithms such as LASSO, subset selection, adaptive LASSO, random LASSO and group LASSO."
https://openalex.org/W3133014029,"Mosquito diversity and disease transmission are influenced by landscape modifications, i.e., vectors and pathogens previously found only in forests are now found close to human environments due to anthropic changes. This study determined the diversity and distribution of mosquitoes in forest environments in order to analyze the potential vectors of Amazonian forest arboviruses. Mosquitoes were collected by 1) vertical stratification from forest canopy and ground areas using Hooper Pugedo (HP) light traps and human attraction and 2) horizontal stratification using HP light traps in peridomicile, forest edge, and forest environments near the Rio Pardo rural settlement, Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 3,750 mosquitoes were collected, representing 46 species. 3,139 individuals representing 46 species were sampled by vertical stratification. Both the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H’) and equitability (J’) were higher in the canopy than on the ground. 611 individuals representing 13 species were sampled by horizontal stratification. H’ decreased in the following order: forest edge &gt; forest &gt; peridomicile, and J’ was greater at the forest edge and smaller in the peridomicile environment. Moreover, H’ was higher for the human attraction collection method than the HP traps. A total of 671 pools were analyzed by RT-qPCR; three species were positive for Oropouche-like viruses ( Ochlerotatus serratus , Psorophora cingulata , and Haemagogus tropicalis ) and the minimum infection rate was 0.8%. The composition of mosquito species did not differ significantly between anthropic and forest environments in Rio Pardo. Some mosquito species, due to their abundance, dispersion in the three environments, and record of natural infection, were hypothesized to participate in the arbovirus transmission cycle in this Amazonian rural settlement."
https://openalex.org/W3172400590,"In recent years, marine red yeasts have been increasingly used as feed diets for larviculture of aquatic animals mainly due to their rich nutrition and immunopotentiation, however little attention is given to their other probiotic profits. In this study, a marine red yeast strain YLY01 was isolated and purified from farming water and it was identified as a member of Rhodosporidiums sphaerocarpum by the phylogeny based on 18S rDNA sequence. The strain YLY01 could effectively remove ammonia nitrogen from an initial 9.8 mg/L to 1.3 mg/L in 48 h when supplemented with slight yeast extract and glucose in water samples and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was up to 86%. Shrimps ( Litopenaeus vannamei) in experimental group incubated with the yeast YLY01 exhibited a higher survival rate than those in blank control group and positive control group challenged by Vibrio harveyi , and it manifested that the strain has high biosecurity to at least shrimps. The strain YLY01 could inhibit the growth of Vibrio cells when a small quantity of carbon source was added into farming water. In addition, a nutrition composition assay showed the contents of protein, fatty acids, and total carotenoids of the yeast YLY01 were 30.3%, 3.2%, and 1.2 mg/g of dry cell weight, respectively. All these results indicated that the marine red yeast YLY01 has a great potential to be used as a versatile probiotic in aquaculture and to be developed as a microbial agent for high-ammonia tail water treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3130357402,"Background Intestinal Parasitic Infections are the most prevalent diseases in the world, predominantly in developing countries. It is estimated that more than two billion people are affected globally, mostly in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. Ethiopia is one of the countries in Africa with a high prevalence of intestinal parasites. However, there is a limited study conducted in the study area. Hence, this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of intestinal parasitosis among patients attending at Sanja Primary Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Sanja Primary Hospital from January 1 to August 20, 2019. Stool samples were collected from 1240 study participants and analyzed by direct wet mount and formal ether concentration techniques. Furthermore, sociodemographic and explanatory variables were collected using a face-to-face interview. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.4.2.1 and transferred to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of intestinal parasitic infections. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was considered to ascertain the significance of the association. Results The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was 52.9% (95% CI: 50.2%-55.5%). Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (21.5%) was the leading cause of intestinal parasitosis followed by Hookworm species (13.3%). Furthermore, the rate of double and triple parasitic infections was observed in 6.1% and 0.5% of study participants respectively. Being Illiterate (AOR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.06–7.47, p = 0.038), swimming habits of more than 4 times a month (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI 1.62–5.24, p&lt; 0.001) and not washing hands before a meal (AOR: 3.92, 95% CI: 1.74–8.83, p = 0.001) were the key factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infection. Conclusions The present study showed that the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis is high in the study area. Therefore, there is a need for an integrated control program, including improving personal, environmental sanitation and health education should be given to have a lasting impact on transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3131847273,"There is considerable heterogeneity in individuals' risk of disease and thus the absolute benefits and harms of population-wide screening programmes. Using colorectal cancer (CRC) screening as an exemplar, we explored how people make decisions about screening when presented with information about absolute benefits and harms, and how those preferences vary with baseline risk, between screening tests and between individuals.We conducted two linked studies with members of the public: a think-aloud study exploring decision making in-depth and an online randomised experiment quantifying preferences. In both, participants completed a web-based survey including information about three screening tests (colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and faecal immunochemical testing) and then up to nine scenarios comparing screening to no screening for three levels of baseline risk (1%, 3% and 5% over 15 years) and the three screening tests. Participants reported, after each scenario, whether they would opt for screening (yes/no).Of the 20 participants in the think-aloud study 13 did not consider absolute benefits or harms when making decisions concerning CRC screening. In the online experiment (n = 978), 60% expressed intention to attend at 1% risk of CRC, 70% at 3% and 77% at 5%, with no differences between screening tests. At an individual level, 535 (54.7%) would attend at all three risk levels and 178 (18.2%) at none. The 27% whose intention varied by baseline risk were more likely to be younger, without a family history of CRC, and without a prior history of screening.Most people in our population were not influenced by the range of absolute benefits and harms associated with CRC screening presented. For an appreciable minority, however, magnitude of benefit was important."
https://openalex.org/W3133369302,"The present research aimed to characterize the Persian Kurdish horse population relative to the Persian Arabian and American Thoroughbred populations using genome-wide SNP data. Fifty-eight Kurdish, 38 Persian Arabian and 83 Thoroughbred horses were genotyped across 670,796 markers. After quality control and pruning to eliminate linkage disequilibrium between loci which resulted in 13,554 SNPs in 52 Kurdish, 24 Persian Arabian and 58 Thoroughbred horses, the Kurdish horses were generally distinguished from the Persian Arabian samples by Principal Component Analyses, cluster analyses and calculation of pairwise F ST . Both Persian breeds were discriminated from the Thoroughbred. Pairwise F ST between the two Persian samples (0.013) was significantly greater than zero and several fold less than those found between the Thoroughbred and Kurdish (0.052) or Thoroughbred and Persian Arabian (0.057). Cluster analysis assuming three genetic clusters assigned the Kurdish horse and Thoroughbred to distinct clusters (0.942 in cluster 2 and 0.953 in cluster 3 respectively); the Persian Arabian was not in a distinct cluster (0.519 in cluster 1), demonstrating shared ancestry or recent admixture with the Kurdish breed. Diversity as quantified by expected heterozygosity was the highest in the Kurdish horse (0.342), followed by the Persian Arabian (0.328) and the Thoroughbred (0.326). Analysis of Molecular Variance showed that 4.47% of the genetic variation was present among populations ( P &lt;0.001). Population-specific inbreeding indices ( F IS ) were not significantly different from zero in any of the populations. Analysis of individual inbreeding based on runs of homozygosity using a larger SNP set suggested greater diversity in both the Kurdish and Persian Arabian than in the Thoroughbred. These results have implications for developing conservation strategies to achieve sound breeding goals while maintaining genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3129323619,"Background Several studies have reported that birth by caesarean section is associated with increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections in the child, but it is unclear whether this applies to any caesarean section or specifically to planned caesareans. Furthermore, although infections of the upper respiratory tract are very common during childhood, there is a scarcity of studies examining whether caesarean is also a risk factor for this site of infection. Methods We obtained data from two UK cohorts: the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) and linked administrative datasets of the population of Wales through the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. The study focused on term-born singleton infants and included 15,580 infants born 2000–2002 (MCS) and 392,145 infants born 2002–2016 (SAIL). We used information about mode of birth (vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, planned caesarean and emergency caesarean) from maternal report in the MCS and from hospital birth records in SAIL. Unplanned hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was ascertained from maternal report in the MCS and from hospital record ICD codes in SAIL. Information about admissions for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was available from SAIL only. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for each outcome and cohort separately while accounting for a wide range of confounders. Gestational age at birth was further examined as a potential added, indirect risk of planned caesarean birth due to the early delivery. Findings The rate of hospital admission for LRTI was 4.6 per 100 child years in the MCS and 5.9 per 100 child years in SAIL. Emergency caesarean was not associated with LRTI admission during infancy in either cohort. In the MCS, planned caesarean was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.03, 1.87) which further increased to 1.65 (95% CI 1.24, 2.19) when gestational age was not adjusted for. In SAIL, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.10 (95% CI 1.05, 1.15), which increased to 1.17 (95% CI 1.12, 1.22) when gestational age was not adjusted for. The rate of hospital admission for URTI was 5.9 per 100 child years in SAIL. Following adjustments, emergency caesarean was found to have a hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05, 1.14) for hospital admission for URTI. Planned caesarean was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 1.06, 1.16) which increased to 1.17 (95% CI 1.12, 1.22) when gestational age was not adjusted for. Conclusions The risk of severe LRTIs during infancy is moderately elevated in infants born by planned caesarean compared to those born vaginally. Infants born by any type of caesarean may also be at a small increased risk of severe URTIs. The estimated effect sizes are stronger if including the indirect effect arising from planning the caesarean birth for an earlier gestation than would have occurred spontaneously. Further studies are needed to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W3129334416,"This study aimed to identify Brazilian dietary patterns and their associations with health, lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. Data from the Brazilian National Health Survey conducted in 2013 were used. A questionnaire was applied containing 22 items related to dietary consumption. Dietary patterns were determined through factor analysis (FA). Poisson regression models, with robust variance, were used to identify associations between dietary patterns and independents variables. Statistical significance was defined as p-value&lt;0.05. Data were analysed for 60,202 adults (estimated population size: 146,308,458). FA identified three dietary patterns: healthy, protein, and western. The younger age group (18–24 years) had a lower adherence to the healthy pattern (PR:0.53; 95%CI:0.49–0.58) and greater adherence to the protein (PR:1.52; 95%CI:1.42–1.62) and western (PR:1.80; 95%CI:1.68–1.93) patterns compared to the elderly (≥60 years). Women had a greater association with the healthy pattern (PR:1.32; 95%CI:1.28–1.38) and lower association with the protein pattern (PR:0.80; 95%CI:0.77–0.82) compared to men. Illiterate participants showed lower adherence to the healthy (PR:0.58; 95%CI:0.53–0.63) and western (PR:0.54; 95%CI:0.48–0.62) patterns compared to those with higher educational levels. Smokers had lower adherence to the healthy (PR:0.76; 95%CI:0.71–0.81) and higher adherence to the protein (PR:1.14; 95%CI:1.11–1.19) patterns compared to non-smokers. Participants with poor/very poor self-rated health status had a lower adherence to the healthy (PR:0.79; 95%CI:0.73–0.86) and western (PR:0.81; 95%CI:0.73–0.89) patterns compared to those in a very good/good self-rated health status. Multimorbidity was positively associated with the healthy pattern (PR:1.18; 95%CI:1.11–1.26) and inversely associated with the protein pattern (PR:0.88; 95%CI:0.80–0.96) compared to participants without comorbidities. We suggest that strategies to promote healthy eating should consider health, lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics in the Brazilian population."
https://openalex.org/W3132837052,"Pharmaceutical care (PC) practice is still limited in the United Arab Emirates. It is crucial to understand pharmacy students’ attitudes and their perceived barriers towards PC provision, to evaluate the effectiveness of theoretical and practical curricula in creating positive attitudes toward PC. This study aims to assess attitudes of final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the barriers perceived by them to practice PC. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in February and March, 2020, involving colleges in UAE offering undergraduate pharmacy programs and having students in their final year. Participants filled a questionnaire covering attitudes’ items, based on the Pharmaceutical Care Attitudes Survey (PCAS), and several perceived barriers. A stratified sample of 193 students participated from six universities, 85% were females, 92.2% and 64.8% completed or engaged in community and hospital pharmacy training respectively, at the time of the study. Attitudes’ items receiving the highest agreement were PC will improve patient health (95.3%), all pharmacists should perform PC (93.3%) and PC would benefit pharmacists (92.7%). However, 44.6% agreed PC is not worth the additional workload. Females showed higher attitudes’ total scores, median (IQR): 55 (51–58) and 52 (49–55.5) for females and males respectively, P = 0.032. Having incomplete courses was also associated with lower scores, median (IQR): 55 (51–58) and 52 (48.5–55.5) for “No” and “Yes” respectively, P = 0.048. Poor image of the pharmacist’s role and lack of private counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the most perceived barriers, with around 78% agreement. In conclusion, final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the UAE have positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. The current curricula may be satisfactory in fostering positive attitudes among students. Poor image of the pharmacist’s role and lack of counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the main barriers identified, among other barriers."
https://openalex.org/W3131075183,"Coffee ( Coffea spp.) is one of the most popular refreshing beverages globally. Coffee lipid diversity has untapped potential for improving coffee marketability because lipids contribute significantly to both the health benefits and cup quality of coffee. However, in spite of its potential importance, there have not been extensive studies of lipids among C . canephora genotypes. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS) profiling of lipid molecules was performed for 30 genotypes consisting of 15 cultivated and 15 conserved genotypes of C . canephora in Southwestern Nigeria. We identified nine classes of lipids in the 30 genotypes which belong to the ‘Niaouli’, ‘Kouillou’ and ‘Java Robusta’ group: among these, the most abundant lipid class was the triacylglycerols, followed by the fatty acyls group. Although ‘Niaouli’ diverged from the ‘Kouillou’ and ‘Java Robusta’ genotypes when their lipid profiles were compared, there was greater similarity in their lipid composition by multivariate analysis, compared to that observed when their primary metabolites and especially their secondary metabolite profiles were examined. However, distinctions could be made among genotypes. Members of the fatty acyls group had the greatest power to discriminate among genotypes, however, lipids that were low in abundance e.g. a cholesterol ester (20:3), and phosphotidylethanolamine (34:0) were also helpful to understand the relationships among C . canephora genotypes. The divergent lipid profiles identified among the C . canephora genotypes, correlated with their Single Nucleotide Polymorphism grouping as assessed by genotype-by-sequencing, and will be exploited to improve coffee cup quality."
https://openalex.org/W3132459700,"Anurans have the greatest diversity of reproductive modes among tetrapod vertebrates, with at least 41 being currently recognized. We describe a new reproductive mode for anurans, as exhibited by the Paranapiacaba Treefrog, Bokermannohyla astartea, an endemic and poorly known species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest belonging to the B. circumdata group. We also describe other aspects of its reproductive biology, that are relevant to understanding the new reproductive mode, such as courtship behavior, spawning, and tadpoles. Additionally, we redescribe its advertisement call and extend its vocal repertoire by describing three additional call types: courtship, amplectant, and presumed territorial. The new reproductive mode exhibited by B. astartea consists of: (1) deposition of aquatic eggs in leaf-tanks of terrestrial or epiphytic bromeliads located on or over the banks of temporary or permanent streams; (2) exotrophic tadpoles remain in the leaf-tanks during initial stages of development (until Gosner stage 26), after which they presumably jump or are transported to streams after heavy rains that flood their bromeliad tanks; and (3) tadpole development completes in streams. The tadpoles of B. astartea are similar to those of other species of the B. circumdata group, although with differences in the spiracle, eyes, and oral disc. The vocal repertoire of B. astartea exhibits previously unreported acoustic complexity for the genus. Bokermannohyla astartea is the only bromeligenous species known to date among the 187 known species within the tribe Cophomantini. We further discuss evolutionary hypotheses for the origin of this novel reproductive mode."
https://openalex.org/W3132798516,"Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNN) in the human brain learn to perform a wide range of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks very efficiently in terms of energy consumption and requires very few examples. This motivates the search for biologically inspired learning rules for RSNNs to improve our understanding of brain computation and the efficiency of artificial intelligence. Several spiking models and learning rules have been proposed, but it remains a challenge to design RSNNs whose learning relies on biologically plausible mechanisms and are capable of solving complex temporal tasks. In this paper, we derive a learning rule, local to the synapse, from a simple mathematical principle, the maximization of the likelihood for the network to solve a specific task. We propose a novel target-based learning scheme in which the learning rule derived from likelihood maximization is used to mimic a specific spiking pattern that encodes the solution to complex temporal tasks. This method makes the learning extremely rapid and precise, outperforming state of the art algorithms for RSNNs. We demonstrate the capacity of our model to tackle several problems like learning multidimensional trajectories and solving the classical temporal XOR benchmark. Finally, we show that an online approximation of the gradient ascent, in addition to guaranteeing complete locality in time and space, allows learning after very few presentations of the target output. Our model can be applied to different types of biological neurons. The analytically derived plasticity learning rule is specific to each neuron model and can produce a theoretical prediction for experimental validation."
https://openalex.org/W3131745024,"Many factors impact earthquake-induced liquefaction, and there are complex interactions between them. Therefore, rationally identifying the key factors and clarifying their direct and indirect effects on liquefaction help to reduce the complexity of the predictive model and improve its predictive performance. This information can also help researchers understand the liquefaction phenomenon more clearly. In this paper, based on a shear wave velocity (V s ) database, 12 key factors are quantitatively identified using a correlation analysis and the maximum information coefficient (MIC) method. Subsequently, the regression method combined with the MIC method is used to construct a multiple causal path model without any assumptions based on the key factors for clarifying their direct and mediation effects on liquefaction. The results show that earthquake parameters produce more important influences on the occurrence of liquefaction than soil properties and site conditions, whereas deposit type, soil type, and deposit age produce relatively small impacts on liquefaction. In the multiple causal path model, the influence path of each factor on liquefaction becomes very clear. Among the key factors, in addition to the duration of the earthquake and V s , other factors possess multiple mediation paths that affect liquefaction; the thickness of the critical layer and thickness of the unsaturated zone between the groundwater table and capping layer are two indirect-only mediators, and the fines content and thickness of the impermeable capping layer induce suppressive effects on liquefaction. In addition, the constructed causal model can provide a logistic regression model and a structure of the Bayesian network for predicting liquefaction. Five-fold cross-validation is used to compare and verify their predictive performances."
https://openalex.org/W3132354683,"Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a leading cause of cancer death in northeastern Thailand. We reported on the incidence of CCA using only one method. In the current study, we used three different statistical methods to forecast future trends and estimate relative survival. Methods We reviewed the CCA cases diagnosed between 1989 and 2018 recorded in the population-based Khon Kaen Cancer Registry (KKCR). Annual percent change (APC) was calculated to quantify the incidence rate trends using Joinpoint regression. Age-period-cohort models (APC model) were used to examine the temporal trends of CCA by age, calendar year, and birth cohort. We projected the incidence of CCA up to 2028 using three independent approaches: the Joinpoint, Age-period-cohort, and Nordpred models. Survival assessments were based on relative survival (RS). Results The respective APC in males and females decreased significantly (-3.1%; 95%CI: -4.0 to -2.1 and -2.4%; 95%CI: -3.6 to -1.2). The APC model—AC-P for male CCA—decreased according to a birth-cohort. The CCA incidence for males born in 1998 was 0.09 times higher than for those born in 1966 (Incidence rate ratios, IRR = 0.09; 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.12). The relative incidence for female CCA similarly decreased according to a birth-cohort (IRR = 0.11; 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.17). The respective projection for the age-standardized rate for males and females for 2028 will be 7.6 per 100,000 (102 patients) and 3.6 per 100,000 (140 patients). The five-year RS for CCA was 10.9% (95%CI: 10.3 to 11.6). Conclusion The incidence rate of CCA has decreased. The projection for 2028 is that the incidence will continue to decline. Nevertheless, the survival of patients with CCA remains poor."
https://openalex.org/W3132438248,"Temporal asymmetry is a peculiar aspect of heart period (HP) variability (HPV). HPV asymmetry (HPVA) is reduced with aging and pathology, but its origin is not fully elucidated. Given the impact of respiration on HPV resulting in the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and the asymmetric shape of the respiratory pattern, a possible link between HPVA and RSA might be expected. In this study we tested the hypothesis that HPVA is significantly associated with RSA and asymmetry of the respiratory rhythm. We studied 42 middle-aged healthy (H) subjects, and 56 chronic heart failure (CHF) patients of whom 26 assigned to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II (CHF-II) and 30 to NYHA class III (CHF-III). Electrocardiogram and lung volume were monitored for 8 minutes during spontaneous breathing (SB) and controlled breathing (CB) at 15 breaths/minute. The ratio of inspiratory (INSP) to expiratory (EXP) phases, namely the I/E ratio, and RSA were calculated. HPVA was estimated as the percentage of negative HP variations, traditionally measured via the Porta’s index (PI). Departures of PI from 50% indicated HPVA and its significance was tested via surrogate data. We found that RSA increased during CB and I/E ratio was smaller than 1 in all groups and experimental conditions. In H subjects the PI was about 50% during SB and it increased significantly during CB. In both CHF-II and CHF-III groups the PI was about 50% during SB and remained unmodified during CB. The PI was uncorrelated with RSA and I/E ratio regardless of the experimental condition and group. Pooling together data of different experimental conditions did not affect conclusions. Therefore, we conclude that the HPVA cannot be explained by RSA and/or I/E ratio, thus representing a peculiar feature of the cardiac control that can be aroused in middle-aged H individuals via CB."
https://openalex.org/W3132513066,"Background Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a growing healthcare burden with increasing prevalence and comorbidities due to progressive aging society. Accumulating evidence suggest that low skeletal muscle mass has a negative impact on clinical outcome in elderly adult population. We sought to determine the significance of psoas muscle area as a novel index of low skeletal muscle mass in elderly patients with ADHF. Methods In this single-center retrospective observational study, we reviewed consecutive 865 elderly participants (65 years or older) who were hospitalized for ADHF and 392 were available for analysis (79 years [74–85], 56% male). Cross-sectional areas of psoas muscle at the level of fourth lumbar vertebra were measured by computed tomography and normalized by the square of height to calculate psoas muscle index (PMI, cm 2 /m 2 ). Results Dividing the patients by the gender-specific quartile value (2.47 cm 2 /m 2 for male and 1.68 cm 2 /m 2 for female), we defined low PMI as the lowest gender-based quartile of PMI. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed female sex, body mass index (BMI), and E/e’, but not left ventricular ejection fraction, were independently associated with PMI. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed low PMI was associated with higher rate of composite endpoint of all-cause death and ADHF re-hospitalization (P = 0.033). Cox proportional hazard model analysis identified low PMI, but not BMI, was an independent predictor of the composite endpoint (Hazard ratio: 1.52 [1.06–2.16], P = 0.024). Conclusions PMI predicted future clinical adverse events in elderly patients with ADHF. Further studies are needed to assess whether low skeletal muscle mass can be a potential therapeutic target to improve the outcome of ADHF."
https://openalex.org/W3129453634,"Infant birth weight affects neuromotor and biomechanical swallowing performance in infant pig models. Preterm infants are generally born low birth weight and suffer from delayed development and neuromotor deficits. These deficits include critical life skills such as swallowing and breathing. It is unclear whether these neuromotor and biomechanical deficits are a result of low birth weight or preterm birth. In this study we ask: are preterm infants simply low birth weight infants or do preterm infants differ from term infants in weight gain and swallowing behaviors independent of birth weight? We use a validated infant pig model to show that preterm and term infants gain weight differently and that birth weight is not a strong predictor of functional deficits in preterm infant swallowing. We found that preterm infants gained weight at a faster rate than term infants and with nearly three times the variation. Additionally, we found that the number of sucks per swallow, swallow duration, and the delay of the swallows relative to the suck cycles were not impacted by birth weight. These results suggest that any correlation of developmental or swallowing deficits with reduced birth weight are likely linked to underlying physiological immaturity of the preterm infant."
https://openalex.org/W3129939733,"Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), the etiological agent of Gumboro disease, causes mortality and immunosuppression in chickens and major losses to poultry industry worldwide. The IBDV major capsid protein VP2 is considered the best candidate for the production of novel subunit vaccines. This structural protein contains the major conformational epitopes responsible for the induction of IBDV neutralizing antibodies in chickens and has been demonstrated able to form supramolecular structures in yeast and insect cells. The aim of this study was to express an engineered version of the VP2 protein (His-pVP2) to verify its ability to self-assemble into virus-like particles in plants. The recombinant VP2 was transiently expressed by agroinfiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana and transmission electron microscopy of sucrose density gradient fractions revealed the presence of a mixed population of differently shaped particles ranging from spherical capsids, with a diameter between ~25 and ~70 nm, to tubular structures, with variable length (from 100 to 400 nm). The recombinant VP2-based particles when used for the intramuscular immunization of specific-pathogen-free chicks resulted able to induce the production of anti-IBDV specific antibodies at titers comparable to those induced by a commercial vaccine. Moreover, all the immunized birds survived to the challenge with a Moroccan very virulent IBDV strain with no major histomorphological alterations of the Bursa of Fabricius, similarly to what obtained with the commercial inactivated vaccine."

Moreover, cell counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils were measured in blood samples taken at the collection center and T0. In these same blood samples, different lymphocyte populations were characterized by flow cytometry, including CD14+ cells, NK cells, δγ+ T cells, CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells and CD21+ cells. Calves transported in the conditioned truck had higher amounts of white blood cell count (WBC) (Δ = 1.39 × 10 9 /l; P = 0.01), monocytes (Δ = 0.21 × 10 9 /l; P = 0.04), neutrophils (Δ = 0.93 × 10 9 /l; P = 0.003), than calves transported in the open truck regardless, of pre-transport diet or transport duration. The study showed that transport condition and duration influenced parts of the innate immune system of young veal calves. Cortisol, bilirubin and WBC seemed to be connected by similar underlying mechanisms in relation to transport conditions. However, it is unclear which specific pathways in the immune system of young calves are affected by different transport conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, draught)."
https://openalex.org/W3131252667,"Metabolites play a key role in plants as they are routing plant developmental processes and are involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Their analysis can offer important information on the underlying processes. Regarding plant breeding, metabolite concentrations can be used as biomarkers instead of or in addition to genetic markers to predict important phenotypic traits (metabolic prediction). In this study, we applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a wild barley nested association mapping (NAM) population to identify metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A set of approximately 130 metabolites, measured at early and late sampling dates, was analysed. For four metabolites from the early and six metabolites from the late sampling date significant mQTL (grouped as 19 mQTL for the early and 25 mQTL for the late sampling date) were found. Interestingly, all of those metabolites could be classified as sugars. Sugars are known to be involved in signalling, plant growth and plant development. Sugar-related genes, encoding mainly sugar transporters, have been identified as candidate genes for most of the mQTL. Moreover, several of them co-localized with known flowering time genes like Ppd-H1 , HvELF3 , Vrn-H1 , Vrn-H2 and Vrn-H3 , hinting on the known role of sugars in flowering. Furthermore, numerous disease resistance-related genes were detected, pointing to the signalling function of sugars in plant resistance. An mQTL on chromosome 1H in the region of 13 Mbp to 20 Mbp stood out, that alone explained up to 65% of the phenotypic variation of a single metabolite. Analysis of family-specific effects within the diverse NAM population showed the available natural genetic variation regarding sugar metabolites due to different wild alleles. The study represents a step towards a better understanding of the genetic components of metabolite accumulation, especially sugars, thereby linking them to biological functions in barley."
https://openalex.org/W3132698785,"Walking is a complex motor function requiring coordination of all body parts. Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor signs such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and impaired balance affect movements including walking. Here, we propose a computational method to objectively assess the effects of Parkinson’s disease pathology on coordination between trunk, shoulder and limbs during the gait cycle to assess medication state and disease severity. Movements during a scripted walking task were extracted from wearable devices placed at six different body locations in participants with PD and healthy participants. Three-axis accelerometer data from each device was synchronized at the beginning of either left or right steps. Canonical templates of movements were then extracted from each body location. Movements projected on those templates created a reduced dimensionality space, where complex movements are represented as discrete values. These projections enabled us to relate the body coordination in people with PD to disease severity. Our results show that the velocity profile of the right wrist and right foot during right steps correlated with the participant’s total score on the gold standard Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPRDS) with an r 2 up to 0.46. Left-right symmetry of feet, trunk and wrists also correlated with the total UPDRS score with an r 2 up to 0.3. In addition, we demonstrate that binary dopamine replacement therapy medication states (self-reported ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’) can be discriminated in PD participants. In conclusion, we showed that during walking, the movement of body parts individually and in coordination with one another changes in predictable ways that vary with disease severity and medication state."
https://openalex.org/W3129783092,"Companies are increasingly aware of their role with regard to social responsibility in its three pillars: economic, social and environmental, with their different stakeholders. Facing the dilemma of choosing the model of social responsibility they should adopt, taking care of their organizational culture and their employees, with a global vision that the business world requires. However, it is not an easy task for small and medium enterprises, mainly because of their economic shortcomings in human resources and knowledge of how to be a socially responsible company. But they are aware that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an opportunity for development and differentiation in the market. Therefore, the objective of this research is to build, identify and validate a model of Social Responsibility in small and medium enterprises in Guanajuato, Mexico (CSRSMEs), on a sample of 226 SMEs, using as a basis the methodology of the international standard of Ethical and Socially Responsible Management System (SGE21). A quantitative approach was used and, a descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis and the structural equation modeling was applied. The results determine that the most relevant variables for being socially responsible are human capital, clients, supply chain, social environment and impact on the community, and organizational governance: Legality and Management System. It is drawn from this work that the flexibility of the so-called Ethical and Socially Responsible Management System has the empirical foundations needed. That is, from the perspective of the company’s management to consider the CSRSMEs model an opportunity to adopt and evaluate the areas of social responsibility management of any business structure in the SMEs in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W3130161455,"FLT3 mutation is present in 25-30% of all acute myeloid leukemias (AML), and it is associated with adverse outcome. FLT3 inhibitors have shown improved survival results in AML both as upfront treatment and in relapsed/refractory disease. Curiously, a variable proportion of wild-type FLT3 patients also responded to these drugs.We analyzed 6 different transcriptomic datasets of AML cases. Differential expression between mutated and wild-type FLT3 AMLs was performed with the Wilcoxon-rank sum test. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify FLT3-mutation like AMLs. Finally, enrichment in recurrent mutations was performed with the Fisher's test.A FLT3 mutation-like gene expression pattern was identified among wild-type FLT3 AMLs. This pattern was highly enriched in NPM1 and DNMT3A mutants, and particularly in combined NPM1/DNMT3A mutants.We identified a FLT3 mutation-like gene expression pattern in AML which was highly enriched in NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations. Future analysis about the predictive role of this biomarker among wild-type FLT3 patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors is envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W3132463572,"The present study is set to explore the way the orthographic distributional properties of novel written words and the number of exposures to these words affect their incidental learning in terms of recall and recognition. To that end, two experiments were conducted using videos with captions. These videos included written nonwords (orthographically marked language-specific items) and pseudowords (orthographically unmarked items) as captions paired to the spoken targets, presented either in isolation (Experiment 1) or within sentences (Experiment 2). Our results consistently show that items containing legal letter combinations (i.e., pseudowords) are better recalled and recognized than those with illegal combinations (i.e., nonwords). Further analysis in the recall task indicate that frequency modulates the learning of pseudowords and nonwords in a different way. The learning of pseudowords increases linearly with repetitions, while nonwords are equally learned across frequencies. These differential effects found in the recall task do not show up in the recognition task. Although participants took more time to recognize nonwords in the recognition task, increased exposure to the items similarly modulated reading times and accuracy for nonwords and pseudowords. Additionally, higher accuracy rates were found in Experiment 2, which underscores the beneficial effect of supportive visual information."
https://openalex.org/W3129831797,"Background While weight gain during first year of university has been well documented in North America, literature on sex-specific effects is scarce and inconsistent. The objective of this investigation was to explore sex-specific changes in obesity traits during first year of university at McMaster University (Ontario, Canada). Methods 245 first-year students (80.4% females) were followed longitudinally with data collected early in the academic year and towards the end of the year. Obesity parameters including weight, waist and hip circumferences, BMI, and waist to hip ratio were investigated. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for pairwise comparison of traits in the absence of adjustments. Additionally, the repeated-measures ANOVA test was used with covariate adjustments to investigate the interaction between sex and time. Results Overall sample trends indicated a significant increase in mean weight by 1.55 kg (95% CI: 1.24–1.86) over the school year (p&lt;0.001). This was accompanied by significant gains in BMI, and waist and hip circumferences (p&lt;0.001) in the overall sample. At baseline, males presented with higher body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, and WHR, as compared to their females counterparts (p&lt;0.01). Additionally, sex-stratified analysis indicated significant gains in weight, BMI, and waist and hip circumferences in both males and females (p&lt;0.01). However, a comparison of the magnitude of change over time between the two sex groups revealed no significant difference for any of the investigated traits (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion While our study confirms significant weight gain in both male and female first year university students in Ontario, Canada, it does not show sex specific differences within this context. Our investigation highlights the importance of accounting for sex and gender in health research and supports the need of further studies in this area."
https://openalex.org/W3132904934,"Purpose We aim to estimate the future fertility of patient undergoing their first IVF cycle attempt with no oocyte retrieved, and to identify factors that might predict those who will conceive in subsequent IVF cycle attempt. Methods A cohort retrospective study of all consecutive women attending our IVF unit, for their first IVF cycle attempt, between January 2013 to December 2019, who reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage with zero oocyte retrieved. Patients’ characteristics and infertility-treatment-related variables in the first IVF cycle attempt were compared between those who conceived in a subsequent cycle and those who did not. Moreover, infertility-treatment-related variables during successful cycles resulting in pregnancy were compared to those without. Results 59 met the study inclusion criteria, yielding zero oocytes. During the follow-up period, 12 (20.3%) women conceived (one conceived twice), and 8 (14%) gave birth to a live infant. Cumulative live-birth rate per OPU and per patients were 4% and 14%, respectively. Clinical pregnancies were achieved after 3.61+1.4 cycle attempts (range: 1–6), with no live-births following the fifth IVF cycle attempt. No in-between group differences were observed in ovarian stimulation variables of their first IVF cycle attempt. Moreover, in those cycles resulting in pregnancy, patients achieved a significantly higher number of fertilized oocytes (2.15+1.5 vs 0.94+1.5, respectively; p&lt;0.01) and a higher mean top-quality embryos (TQE) (1.76+0.9 vs 0.73+1.2, respectively; p&lt;0.003). Conclusion Women yielding zero oocytes at their first IVF cycle attempt, may achieve 14% cumulative live-birth rate after 5 IVF cycle attempts. Moreover, those who conceived in subsequent IVF cycle attempts were those achieving 2 or more fertilized oocytes/TQE."
https://openalex.org/W3133306960,"Background To ensure patient-centered quality care for all citizens, Quality Improvement (QI) teams have been established across all public hospitals in Tanzania. However, little is known about how hospital staff perceive the performance of hospital QI teams in Tanzania. This study assessed the perceptions of hospital staff of the performance of QI teams in selected regional referral hospitals in Tanzania. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in four selected regional referral hospitals between April and August 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 385 hospital staff in the selected hospitals. Measures of central tendency, proportions and frequencies were used to assess level of perception of hospital staff. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to test the association between the perceptions of hospital staff of the performance of QI teams and their socio-demographic factors. Results The overall mean perception score of the performance of QI teams was 4.84 ± 1.25. Hospital staff aged 35 and over (n = 130; 68%), female hospital staff (n = 144; 64%), staff in clinical units (n = 136; 63%) and staff with post-secondary education (n = 175; 63%) perceived that the performance of QI teams was good. Improved hospital cleanliness was viewed as strength of QI teams, whilst inadequate sharing of information and inadequate reduction in patient waiting time were considered as weaknesses of QI team performance. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that there was no statistical association between the perceptions of hospital staff and their socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusion The overall perception of hospital staff of the performance of QI teams was good, with the main limitation being sharing of hospital QI plans with hospital staff. Hospital staff should be involved in the development and implementation of hospital QI plans, which would promote a positive perception of staff of the performance of QI teams and enhance sustainability of QI teams."

https://openalex.org/W3132088247,"Background Uganda is a low-income country with high fertility, adolescent birth, and maternal mortality rates. How Ugandan Ministry of Health antenatal education guidelines have been implemented into standardized health education and how pregnant women utilize health facilities remains unclear. Objective We aimed to determine how women obtain education during pregnancy, what guidelines health educators follow, and what barriers exist to receiving antenatal care in Lweza Village, Uganda. Methods Household surveys were conducted with women in Lweza who were or had previously been pregnant. Focus group discussions were conducted with community members and Lweza Primary School teachers. Interviews were conducted with key informants, including midwives, a traditional birth attendant, a community leader, and a Village Health Team member. Data collection was done in English along with a Luganda translator. Results Of the 100 household surveys conducted, 86% of women did not meet the WHO recommendation of 8 antenatal appointments during their pregnancies. Reasons cited for inadequate visits included facing long wait times (&gt;7 h) at health facilities, getting education from family or traditional healers, or being told to delay antenatal care until 6 months pregnant. Informant interviews revealed that no standardized antenatal education program exists. Respondents felt least educated on family planning and postpartum depression, despite 37% of them reporting symptoms consistent with postpartum depression. Education was also lacking on the use of traditional herbs, although most women (60%) reported using them during pregnancy. Conclusions Most women in Lweza do not receive 8 antenatal appointments during their pregnancies or any standardized antenatal education. Educational opportunities on family planning, postpartum depression, and the safety of traditional herbs during pregnancy exist. Future studies should focus on ways to overcome barriers to antenatal care, which could include implementing community-based education programs to improve health outcomes for women in Lweza Village."
https://openalex.org/W3132332995,"Health insurance and acute hospital-based claims have recently become available as real-world data after marketing in Japan and, thus, classification and prediction using the machine learning approach can be applied to them. However, the methodology used for the analysis of real-world data has been hitherto under debate and research on visualizing the patient journey is still inconclusive. So far, to classify diseases based on medical histories and patient demographic background and to predict the patient prognosis for each disease, the correlation structure of real-world data has been estimated by machine learning. Therefore, we applied association analysis to real-world data to consider a combination of disease events as the patient journey for depression diagnoses. However, association analysis makes it difficult to interpret multiple outcome measures simultaneously and comprehensively. To address this issue, we applied the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) Mapper to sequentially interpret multiple indices, thus obtaining a visual classification of the diseases commonly associated with depression. Under this approach, the visual and continuous classification of related diseases may contribute to precision medicine research and can help pharmaceutical companies provide appropriate personalized medical care."
