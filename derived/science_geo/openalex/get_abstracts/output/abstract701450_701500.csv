https://openalex.org/W4297473634,"Abstract Future quantum computers capable of solving relevant problems will require a large number of qubits that can be operated reliably 1 . However, the requirements of having a large qubit count and operating with high fidelity are typically conflicting. Spins in semiconductor quantum dots show long-term promise 2,3 but demonstrations so far use between one and four qubits and typically optimize the fidelity of either single- or two-qubit operations, or initialization and readout 4–11 . Here, we increase the number of qubits and simultaneously achieve respectable fidelities for universal operation, state preparation and measurement. We design, fabricate and operate a six-qubit processor with a focus on careful Hamiltonian engineering, on a high level of abstraction to program the quantum circuits, and on efficient background calibration, all of which are essential to achieve high fidelities on this extended system. State preparation combines initialization by measurement and real-time feedback with quantum-non-demolition measurements. These advances will enable testing of increasingly meaningful quantum protocols and constitute a major stepping stone towards large-scale quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W4297497801,"Combination therapy with PD-1 blockade and IL-2 is highly effective during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection1. Here we examine the underlying basis for this synergy. We show that PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy, in contrast to PD-1 monotherapy, substantially changes the differentiation program of the PD-1+TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells and results in the generation of transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct effector CD8+ T cells that resemble highly functional effector CD8+ T cells seen after an acute viral infection. The generation of these qualitatively superior CD8+ T cells that mediate viral control underlies the synergy between PD-1 and IL-2. Our results show that the PD-1+TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells, also referred to as precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells, are not fate-locked into the exhaustion program and their differentiation trajectory can be changed by IL-2 signals. These virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells emerging from the stem-like CD8+ T cells after combination therapy expressed increased levels of the high-affinity IL-2 trimeric (CD25–CD122–CD132) receptor. This was not seen after PD-1 blockade alone. Finally, we show that CD25 engagement with IL-2 has an important role in the observed synergy between IL-2 cytokine and PD-1 blockade. Either blocking CD25 with an antibody or using a mutated version of IL-2 that does not bind to CD25 but still binds to CD122 and CD132 almost completely abrogated the synergistic effects observed after PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy. There is considerable interest in PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy for patients with cancer2,3, and our fundamental studies defining the underlying mechanisms of how IL-2 synergizes with PD-1 blockade should inform these human translational studies. PD-1+TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells—precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells—are not fate-locked into the exhaustion program; their differentiation trajectory can be changed by IL-2 signals."

https://openalex.org/W4297497831,"Abstract Recent single-cell studies of cancer in both mice and humans have identified the emergence of a myofibroblast population specifically marked by the highly restricted leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) 1–3 . However, the molecular signals that underlie the development of LRRC15 + cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their direct impact on anti-tumour immunity are uncharacterized. Here in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we provide in vivo genetic evidence that TGFβ receptor type 2 signalling in healthy dermatopontin + universal fibroblasts is essential for the development of cancer-associated LRRC15 + myofibroblasts. This axis also predominantly drives fibroblast lineage diversity in human cancers. Using newly developed Lrrc15– diphtheria toxin receptor knock-in mice to selectively deplete LRRC15 + CAFs, we show that depletion of this population markedly reduces the total tumour fibroblast content. Moreover, the CAF composition is recalibrated towards universal fibroblasts. This relieves direct suppression of tumour-infiltrating CD8 + T cells to enhance their effector function and augments tumour regression in response to anti-PDL1 immune checkpoint blockade. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TGFβ-dependent LRRC15 + CAFs dictate the tumour-fibroblast setpoint to promote tumour growth. These cells also directly suppress CD8 + T cell function and limit responsiveness to checkpoint blockade. Development of treatments that restore the homeostatic fibroblast setpoint by reducing the population of pro-disease LRRC15 + myofibroblasts may improve patient survival and response to immunotherapy."

Here, to facilitate progress and improve communication with the scientific community and the public, we clarify and provide a basic framework for the nomenclature of human multicellular models of nervous system development and disease, including organoids, assembloids and transplants."
https://openalex.org/W4297497772,"Abstract Expansion and differentiation of antigen-experienced PD-1 + TCF-1 + stem-like CD8 + T cells into effector cells is critical for the success of immunotherapies based on PD-1 blockade 1–4 . Hashimoto et al. have shown that, in chronic infections, administration of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 triggers an alternative differentiation path of stem-like T cells towards a distinct population of ‘better effector’ CD8 + T cells similar to those generated in an acute infection 5 . IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25) was essential in triggering this alternative differentiation path and expanding better effectors with distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles. However, constitutive expression of CD25 on regulatory T cells and some endothelial cells also contributes to unwanted systemic effects from IL-2 therapy. Therefore, engineered IL-2 receptor β- and γ-chain (IL-2Rβγ)-biased agonists are currently being developed 6–10 . Here we show that IL-2Rβγ-biased agonists are unable to preferentially expand better effector T cells in cancer models and describe PD1-IL2v, a new immunocytokine that overcomes the need for CD25 binding by docking in cis to PD-1. Cis binding of PD1-IL2v to PD-1 and IL-2Rβγ on the same cell recovers the ability to differentiate stem-like CD8 + T cells into better effectors in the absence of CD25 binding in both chronic infection and cancer models and provides superior efficacy. By contrast, PD-1- or PD-L1-blocking antibodies alone, or their combination with clinically relevant doses of non-PD-1-targeted IL2v, cannot expand this unique subset of better effector T cells and instead lead to the accumulation of terminally differentiated, exhausted T cells. These findings provide the basis for the development of a new generation of PD-1 cis -targeted IL-2R agonists with enhanced therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer and chronic infections."
https://openalex.org/W4297497481,"Abstract Translation is the fundamental process of protein synthesis and is catalysed by the ribosome in all living cells 1 . Here we use advances in cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram analysis 2,3 to visualize the structural dynamics of translation inside the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae . To interpret the functional states in detail, we first obtain a high-resolution in-cell average map of all translating ribosomes and build an atomic model for the M. pneumoniae ribosome that reveals distinct extensions of ribosomal proteins. Classification then resolves 13 ribosome states that differ in their conformation and composition. These recapitulate major states that were previously resolved in vitro, and reflect intermediates during active translation. On the basis of these states, we animate translation elongation inside native cells and show how antibiotics reshape the cellular translation landscapes. During translation elongation, ribosomes often assemble in defined three-dimensional arrangements to form polysomes 4 . By mapping the intracellular organization of translating ribosomes, we show that their association into polysomes involves a local coordination mechanism that is mediated by the ribosomal protein L9. We propose that an extended conformation of L9 within polysomes mitigates collisions to facilitate translation fidelity. Our work thus demonstrates the feasibility of visualizing molecular processes at atomic detail inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W4297497488,"Abstract Integrated photonics has profoundly affected a wide range of technologies underpinning modern society 1–4 . The ability to fabricate a complete optical system on a chip offers unrivalled scalability, weight, cost and power efficiency 5,6 . Over the last decade, the progression from pure III–V materials platforms to silicon photonics has significantly broadened the scope of integrated photonics, by combining integrated lasers with the high-volume, advanced fabrication capabilities of the commercial electronics industry 7,8 . Yet, despite remarkable manufacturing advantages, reliance on silicon-based waveguides currently limits the spectral window available to photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Here, we present a new generation of integrated photonics by directly uniting III–V materials with silicon nitride waveguides on Si wafers. Using this technology, we present a fully integrated PIC at photon energies greater than the bandgap of silicon, demonstrating essential photonic building blocks, including lasers, amplifiers, photodetectors, modulators and passives, all operating at submicrometre wavelengths. Using this platform, we achieve unprecedented coherence and tunability in an integrated laser at short wavelength. Furthermore, by making use of this higher photon energy, we demonstrate superb high-temperature performance and kHz-level fundamental linewidths at elevated temperatures. Given the many potential applications at short wavelengths, the success of this integration strategy unlocks a broad range of new integrated photonics applications."

https://openalex.org/W4297498240,"Abstract Neurons in frontal cortex exhibit diverse selectivity representing sensory, motor and cognitive variables during decision-making. The neural circuit basis for this complex selectivity remains unclear. We examined activity mediating a tactile decision in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex in relation to the underlying circuits. Contrary to the notion of randomly mixed selectivity, an analysis of 20,000 neurons revealed organized activity coding behavior. Individual neurons exhibited prototypical response profiles that were repeatable across mice. Stimulus, choice and action were coded nonrandomly by distinct neuronal populations that could be delineated by their response profiles. We related distinct selectivity to long-range inputs from somatosensory cortex, contralateral anterior lateral motor cortex and thalamus. Each input connects to all functional populations but with differing strength. Task selectivity was more strongly dependent on thalamic inputs than cortico-cortical inputs. Our results suggest that the thalamus drives subnetworks within frontal cortex coding distinct features of decision-making."

https://openalex.org/W4297497806,"The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to neurodevelopment, plasticity and cognitive function. Although several studies have profiled transcription in the developing human brain, there is a gap in understanding of accompanying translational regulation. In this study, we performed ribosome profiling on 73 human prenatal and adult cortex samples. We characterized the translational regulation of annotated open reading frames (ORFs) and identified thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small ORFs that give rise to human-specific and/or brain-specific microproteins, many of which we independently verified using proteomics. Ribosome profiling in stem-cell-derived human neuronal cultures corroborated these findings and revealed that several neuronal activity-induced non-coding RNAs encode previously undescribed microproteins. Physicochemical analysis of brain microproteins identified a class of proteins that contain arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats and, thus, may be regulators of RNA metabolism. This resource expands the known translational landscape of the human brain and illuminates previously unknown brain-specific protein products. Duffy et al. profiled mRNA translation in 73 human prenatal and adult cortex samples and identified thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small open reading frames that give rise to human-specific and/or brain-specific microproteins."

https://openalex.org/W4297477295,"Paired fins are a major innovation1,2 that evolved in the jawed vertebrate lineage after divergence from living jawless vertebrates3. Extinct jawless armoured stem gnathostomes show a diversity of paired body-wall extensions, ranging from skeletal processes to simple flaps4. By contrast, osteostracans (a sister group to jawed vertebrates) are interpreted to have the first true paired appendages in a pectoral position, with pelvic appendages evolving later in association with jaws5. Here we show, on the basis of articulated remains of Tujiaaspis vividus from the Silurian period of China, that galeaspids (a sister group to both osteostracans and jawed vertebrates) possessed three unpaired dorsal fins, an approximately symmetrical hypochordal tail and a pair of continuous, branchial-to-caudal ventrolateral fins. The ventrolateral fins are similar to paired fin flaps in other stem gnathostomes, and specifically to the ventrolateral ridges of cephalaspid osteostracans that also possess differentiated pectoral fins. The ventrolateral fins are compatible with aspects of the fin-fold hypothesis for the origin of vertebrate paired appendages6-10. Galeaspids have a precursor condition to osteostracans and jawed vertebrates in which paired fins arose initially as continuous pectoral-pelvic lateral fins that our computed fluid-dynamics experiments show passively generated lift. Only later in the stem lineage to osteostracans and jawed vertebrates did pectoral fins differentiate anteriorly. This later differentiation was followed by restriction of the remaining field of fin competence to a pelvic position, facilitating active propulsion and steering."

https://openalex.org/W4297497790,"The paradigmatic example of a topological phase of matter, the two-dimensional Chern insulator1-5, is characterized by a topological invariant consisting of a single integer, the scalar Chern number. Extending the Chern insulator phase from two to three dimensions requires generalization of the Chern number to a three-vector6,7, similar to the three-dimensional (3D) quantum Hall effect8-13. Such Chern vectors for 3D Chern insulators have never been explored experimentally. Here we use magnetically tunable 3D photonic crystals to achieve the experimental demonstration of Chern vectors and their topological surface states. We demonstrate Chern vector magnitudes of up to six, higher than all scalar Chern numbers previously realized in topological materials. The isofrequency contours formed by the topological surface states in the surface Brillouin zone form torus knots or links, whose characteristic integers are determined by the Chern vectors. We demonstrate a sample with surface states forming a (2, 2) torus link or Hopf link in the surface Brillouin zone, which is topologically distinct from the surface states of other 3D topological phases. These results establish the Chern vector as an intrinsic bulk topological invariant in 3D topological materials, with surface states possessing unique topological characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4297373458,"The G protein-coupled receptor cascade leading to production of the second messenger cAMP is replete with pharmacologically targetable proteins, with the exception of the Gα subunit, Gαs. GTPases remain largely undruggable given the difficulty of displacing high-affinity guanine nucleotides and the lack of other drug binding sites. We explored a chemical library of 1012 cyclic peptides to expand the chemical search for inhibitors of this enzyme class. We identified two macrocyclic peptides, GN13 and GD20, that antagonize the active and inactive states of Gαs, respectively. Both macrocyclic peptides fine-tune Gαs activity with high nucleotide-binding-state selectivity and G protein class-specificity. Co-crystal structures reveal that GN13 and GD20 distinguish the conformational differences within the switch II/α3 pocket. Cell-permeable analogs of GN13 and GD20 modulate Gαs/Gβγ signaling in cells through binding to crystallographically defined pockets. The discovery of cyclic peptide inhibitors targeting Gαs provides a path for further development of state-dependent GTPase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4297497349,"CD4+ T cell differentiation requires metabolic reprogramming to fulfil the bioenergetic demands of proliferation and effector function, and enforce specific transcriptional programmes1–3. Mitochondrial membrane dynamics sustains mitochondrial processes4, including respiration and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism5, but whether mitochondrial membrane remodelling orchestrates CD4+ T cell differentiation remains unclear. Here we show that unlike other CD4+ T cell subsets, T helper 17 (TH17) cells have fused mitochondria with tight cristae. T cell-specific deletion of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), which regulates inner mitochondrial membrane fusion and cristae morphology6, revealed that TH17 cells require OPA1 for its control of the TCA cycle, rather than respiration. OPA1 deletion amplifies glutamine oxidation, leading to impaired NADH/NAD+ balance and accumulation of TCA cycle metabolites and 2-hydroxyglutarate—a metabolite that influences the epigenetic landscape5,7. Our multi-omics approach revealed that the serine/threonine kinase liver-associated kinase B1 (LKB1) couples mitochondrial function to cytokine expression in TH17 cells by regulating TCA cycle metabolism and transcriptional remodelling. Mitochondrial membrane disruption activates LKB1, which restrains IL-17 expression. LKB1 deletion restores IL-17 expression in TH17 cells with disrupted mitochondrial membranes, rectifying aberrant TCA cycle glutamine flux, balancing NADH/NAD+ and preventing 2-hydroxyglutarate production from the promiscuous activity of the serine biosynthesis enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). These findings identify OPA1 as a major determinant of TH17 cell function, and uncover LKB1 as a sensor linking mitochondrial cues to effector programmes in TH17 cells. OPA1 regulates the formation of the distinct mitochondrial morphology observed in T helper 17 cells, which influences cytokine expression via LKB1."
https://openalex.org/W4297498024,"To characterize the dysregulation of chromatin accessibility in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we generated 636 ATAC-seq libraries from neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei isolated from the superior temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex of 153 AD cases and 56 controls. By analyzing a total of ~20 billion read pairs, we expanded the repertoire of known open chromatin regions (OCRs) in the human brain and identified cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions. We show that interindividual variability in OCRs can be leveraged to identify cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) that capture the three-dimensional structure of the genome (3D genome). We identified AD-associated effects on chromatin accessibility, the 3D genome and transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks. For one of the most AD-perturbed TFs, USF2, we validated its regulatory effect on lysosomal genes. Overall, we applied a systematic approach to understanding the role of the 3D genome in AD. We provide all data as an online resource for widespread community-based analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4297373464,"Sleep disturbances are strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. Baroreflex, a basic cardiovascular regulation mechanism, is modulated by sleep-wake states. Here, we show that neurons at key stages of baroreflex pathways also promote sleep. Using activity-dependent genetic labeling, we tagged neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) activated by blood pressure elevation and confirmed their barosensitivity with optrode recording and calcium imaging. Chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of these neurons promoted non-REM sleep in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. GABAergic neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM)-a downstream target of the NST for vasomotor baroreflex-also promote non-REM sleep, partly by inhibiting the sympathoexcitatory and wake-promoting adrenergic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Cholinergic neurons in the nucleus ambiguous-a target of the NST for cardiac baroreflex-promoted non-REM sleep as well. Thus, key components of the cardiovascular baroreflex circuit are also integral to sleep-wake brain-state regulation."

https://openalex.org/W4297498009,"Filoviruses, including Ebola virus, pose an increasing threat to the public health. Although two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved to treat the Ebola virus disease1,2, there are no approved broadly reactive drugs to control diverse filovirus infection. Filovirus has a large polymerase (L) protein and the cofactor viral protein 35 (VP35), which constitute the basic functional unit responsible for virus genome RNA synthesis3. Owing to its conservation, the L-VP35 polymerase complex is a promising target for broadly reactive antiviral drugs. Here we determined the structure of Ebola virus L protein in complex with tetrameric VP35 using cryo-electron microscopy (state 1). Structural analysis revealed that Ebola virus L possesses a filovirus-specific insertion element that is essential for RNA synthesis, and that VP35 interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of L by three protomers of the VP35 tetramer. Notably, we captured the complex structure in a second conformation with the unambiguous priming loop and supporting helix away from polymerase active site (state 2). Moreover, we demonstrated that the century-old drug suramin could inhibit the activity of the Ebola virus polymerase in an enzymatic assay. The structure of the L-VP35-suramin complex reveals that suramin can bind at the highly conserved NTP entry channel to prevent substrates from entering the active site. These findings reveal the mechanism of Ebola virus replication and may guide the development of more powerful anti-filovirus drugs."

https://openalex.org/W4297475647,"Abstract The central regions of galaxy clusters are permeated by magnetic fields and filled with relativistic electrons 1 . When clusters merge, the magnetic fields are amplified and relativistic electrons are re-accelerated by turbulence in the intracluster medium 2,3 . These electrons reach energies of 1–10 GeV and, in the presence of magnetic fields, produce diffuse radio halos 4 that typically cover an area of around 1 Mpc 2 . Here we report observations of four clusters whose radio halos are embedded in much more extended, diffuse radio emission, filling a volume 30 times larger than that of radio halos. The emissivity in these larger features is about 20 times lower than the emissivity in radio halos. We conclude that relativistic electrons and magnetic fields extend far beyond radio halos, and that the physical conditions in the outer regions of the clusters are quite different from those in the radio halos."
https://openalex.org/W4297497467,"Oxidative genome damage is an unavoidable consequence of cellular metabolism. It arises at gene regulatory elements by epigenetic demethylation during transcriptional activation1,2. Here we show that promoters are protected from oxidative damage via a process mediated by the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA (also known as NUMA1). NuMA exhibits genomic occupancy approximately 100 bp around transcription start sites. It binds the initiating form of RNA polymerase II, pause-release factors and single-strand break repair (SSBR) components such as TDP1. The binding is increased on chromatin following oxidative damage, and TDP1 enrichment at damaged chromatin is facilitated by NuMA. Depletion of NuMA increases oxidative damage at promoters. NuMA promotes transcription by limiting the polyADP-ribosylation of RNA polymerase II, increasing its availability and release from pausing at promoters. Metabolic labelling of nascent RNA identifies genes that depend on NuMA for transcription including immediate–early response genes. Complementation of NuMA-deficient cells with a mutant that mediates binding to SSBR, or a mitotic separation-of-function mutant, restores SSBR defects. These findings underscore the importance of oxidative DNA damage repair at gene regulatory elements and describe a process that fulfils this function. The nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA helps to protect genes from oxidative damage by occupying regions around transcription start sites, binding DNA repair factors and promoting transcription following damage."
https://openalex.org/W4297521046,"Crystal strength and plastic flow are controlled by the motion and interaction of dislocations, the line defects carrying atomic shear increments. Whereas, in most crystals, deformation develops in the crystallographic planes in which the glide force acting on dislocations is maximum, plasticity in body-centred cubic metals is more complex. Slip systems in which the resolved shear stress is not the highest can dominate at low temperature, leading to anomalous slip1,2. Using in situ tensile tests in a transmission electron microscope we show that anomalous slip arises from the high mobility of multi-junctions3, that is, junctions between more than two dislocations, which glide at a velocity several orders of magnitude larger than single dislocations. These multi-junctions result from the interaction of a simple binary junction with a gliding dislocation. Although elasticity theory predicts that these binary junctions should be unstable in crystals with a weak elastic anisotropy such as tungsten, both experiments and atomistic simulations reveal that such junctions can be created under dynamic conditions, in agreement with the existence of anomalous slip in almost all body-centred cubic metals, including tungsten4,5."
https://openalex.org/W4297497487,"Entomopathogenic nematodes are widely used as biopesticides1,2. Their insecticidal activity depends on symbiotic bacteria such as Photorhabdus luminescens, which produces toxin complex (Tc) toxins as major virulence factors3–6. No protein receptors are known for any Tc toxins, which limits our understanding of their specificity and pathogenesis. Here we use genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout screening in Drosophila melanogaster S2R+ cells and identify Visgun (Vsg) as a receptor for an archetypal P. luminescens Tc toxin (pTc). The toxin recognizes the extracellular O-glycosylated mucin-like domain of Vsg that contains high-density repeats of proline, threonine and serine (HD-PTS). Vsg orthologues in mosquitoes and beetles contain HD-PTS and can function as pTc receptors, whereas orthologues without HD-PTS, such as moth and human versions, are not pTc receptors. Vsg is expressed in immune cells, including haemocytes and fat body cells. Haemocytes from Vsg knockout Drosophila are resistant to pTc and maintain phagocytosis in the presence of pTc, and their sensitivity to pTc is restored through the transgenic expression of mosquito Vsg. Last, Vsg knockout Drosophila show reduced bacterial loads and lethality from P. luminescens infection. Our findings identify a proteinaceous Tc toxin receptor, reveal how Tc toxins contribute to P. luminescens pathogenesis, and establish a genome-wide CRISPR screening approach for investigating insecticidal toxins and pathogens. A genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout screen in Drosophila cells identifies Visgun as a proteinaceous receptor for toxin complex toxins, demonstrating the utility of this approach for investigating insecticidal toxins and pathogens."

Evaluating changes in mortality over time enables evidence-based resource planning, thus improving patient outcome. Our aim was to describe baseline risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients and to compare mortality rates over time.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the largest referral hospital for COVID-19 patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We investigated risk factors associated with mortality during hospitalization. Independent variables included age group, sex, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, admission period according to the stage of the first wave of the epidemic (early, peak, and late), and intubation.We included 2949 consecutive COVID-19 patients. 1895 of them were admitted to the ICU, and 1473 required mechanical ventilation. Median length of stay in the ICU was 10 (IQR 5-17) days. Overall mortality rate was 35%, and the adjusted odds ratios for mortality increased with age, male sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity index, need for mechanical ventilation, and being admitted to the hospital during the wave peak of the epidemic. Being admitted to the hospital during the wave peak was associated with a 33% higher risk of mortality.In-hospital mortality was independently affected by the epidemic period. The recognition of modifiable operational variables associated with patient outcome highlights the importance of a preparedness plan and institutional protocols that include evidence-based practices and allocation of resources."
https://openalex.org/W4297463287,"Background Evidence seems to suggest that the risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) might vary across communities due to differences in population characteristics and movement patterns. However, little is known about these differences in the greater St Louis Area of Missouri and yet this information is useful for targeting control efforts. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate (a) geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk and (b) associations between COVID-19 risk and socioeconomic, demographic, movement and chronic disease factors in the Greater St. Louis Area of Missouri, USA. Methods Data on COVID-19 incidence and chronic disease hospitalizations were obtained from the Department of Health and Missouri Hospital Association, respectively. Socioeconomic and demographic data were obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey while population mobility data were obtained from the SafeGraph website. Choropleth maps were used to identify geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk and several sociodemographic and chronic disease factors at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) spatial scale. Global negative binomial and local geographically weighted negative binomial models were used to investigate associations between ZCTA-level COVID-19 risk and socioeconomic, demographic and chronic disease factors. Results There were geographic disparities found in COVID-19 risk. Risks tended to be higher in ZCTAs with high percentages of the population with a bachelor’s degree (p&lt;0.0001) and obesity hospitalizations (p&lt;0.0001). Conversely, risks tended to be lower in ZCTAs with high percentages of the population working in agriculture (p&lt;0.0001). However, the association between agricultural occupation and COVID-19 risk was modified by per capita between ZCTA visits. Areas that had both high per capita between ZCTA visits and high percentages of the population employed in agriculture had high COVID-19 risks. The strength of association between agricultural occupation and COVID-19 risk varied by geographic location. Conclusions Geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk exist in the St. Louis area and are associated with sociodemographic factors, population movements, and obesity hospitalization risks. The latter is particularly concerning due to the growing prevalence of obesity and the known immunological impairments among obese individuals. Therefore, future studies need to focus on improving our understanding of the relationships between COVID-19 vaccination efficacy, obesity and waning of immunity among obese individuals so as to better guide vaccination regimens and reduce disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4297474918,"Pharmacologic inhibition of LSD1 induces molecular and morphologic differentiation of blast cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients harboring MLL gene translocations. In addition to its demethylase activity, LSD1 has a critical scaffolding function at genomic sites occupied by the SNAG domain transcription repressor GFI1. Importantly, inhibitors block both enzymatic and scaffolding activities, in the latter case by disrupting the protein:protein interaction of GFI1 with LSD1. To explore the wider consequences of LSD1 inhibition on the LSD1 protein complex we applied mass spectrometry technologies. We discovered that the interaction of the HMG-box protein HMG20B with LSD1 was also disrupted by LSD1 inhibition. Downstream investigations revealed that HMG20B is co-located on chromatin with GFI1 and LSD1 genome-wide; the strongest HMG20B binding co-locates with the strongest GFI1 and LSD1 binding. Functional assays demonstrated that HMG20B depletion induces leukemia cell differentiation and further revealed that HMG20B is required for the transcription repressor activity of GFI1 through stabilizing LSD1 on chromatin at GFI1 binding sites. Interaction of HMG20B with LSD1 is through its coiled-coil domain. Thus, HMG20B is a critical component of the GFI1:LSD1 transcription repressor complex which contributes to leukemia cell differentiation block."

They are probably on their first passage on an infalling orbit towards our Galaxy1 and trace the continuing dynamics of the Local Group2. Recent measurements of a high mass for the LMC (Mhalo ≈ 1011.1-11.4 M⊙)3-6 imply that the LMC should host a Magellanic Corona: a collisionally ionized, warm-hot gaseous halo at the virial temperature (105.3-5.5 K) initially extending out to the virial radius (100-130 kiloparsecs (kpc)). Such a corona would have shaped the formation of the Magellanic Stream7, a tidal gas structure extending over 200° across the sky2,8,9 that is bringing in metal-poor gas to the Milky Way10. Here we show evidence for this Magellanic Corona with a potential direct detection in highly ionized oxygen (O+5) and indirectly by means of triply ionized carbon and silicon, seen in ultraviolet (UV) absorption towards background quasars. We find that the Magellanic Corona is part of a pervasive multiphase Magellanic circumgalactic medium (CGM) seen in many ionization states with a declining projected radial profile out to at least 35 kpc from the LMC and a total ionized CGM mass of log10(MH II,CGM/M⊙) ≈ 9.1 ± 0.2.

Based on the central bank written communication index measured by the Monetary Policy Implementation Report 2009-2019 and balanced panel data of 35 listed banks, we design an empirical PVAR model. This study finds that central bank communication regarding domestic easing economy and policy positively affects bank risk-taking, while central bank communication and mechanism exists in China. Moreover, the growth rate of shadow banking size also positively encourages bank risk-taking. Furthermore, central bank communication regarding foreign policy is negatively related to bank risk-taking in the robustness test, supporting the above findings. The analysis of equity heterogeneity shows that the positive effect of central bank communication on bank risk-taking in shadow banking is more pronounced in small and medium-sized shareholdings. Further analyzing the economic consequences of central bank communication and shadow banking on bank risk-taking, we find that banks' risk-taking positively affects their share of noninterest income and total asset size."
https://openalex.org/W4297459132,"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an essential contributor to a successful recovery for elderly cardiac patients. The motivation for physical activity is a psychological parameter seldom described in secondary prevention, and it is plausible that motivation contributes to the differential effect of CR.To investigate if motivation, measured using the behavioural regulation in an exercise questionnaire (BREQ-2), predicts VO2peak in elderly cardiac patients before and after CR.A prospective cohort study of elderly ischemic cardiac patients and patients with valvular disease participating in cardiac rehabilitation was used. Motivation was measured using BREQ-2, which measures five constructs of motivation and a summed score-the relative autonomy index (RAI). VO2peak was measured before and after CR using a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).Two hundred and three patients performed the baseline tests and initiated CR. One hundred and eighty-two completed CR and comprised the follow-up group. The mean VO2peak was 18 ml/kg/min (SD±5.1). VO2peak increased significantly with increasing motivation, 1.02 (.41-1.62) ml/kg/min pr. SD. Mean improvement from CR was 2.3 ml/kg/min (SD±4.3), the equivalent of a 12% increase. A change in VO2peak after CR was likewise positively associated with increased motivation, .74 (.31-1.17) pr. SD.The level of motivation predicts VO2peak before CR, and is also able to predict changes in VO2peak following CR. Motivation measured with the BREQ-2 questionnaire can be applied as a screening tool for elderly cardiac patients before they initiate CR to identify patients with need of specific attention."
https://openalex.org/W4297459563,"To facilitate long-term engagement with social robots, emerging evidence suggests that modelling robots on social animals with whom many people form enduring social bonds-specifically, pet dogs-may be useful. However, scientific understanding of the features of pet dogs that are important for establishing and maintaining social bonds remains limited to broad qualities that are liked, as opposed to specific behaviours. To better understand dog behaviours that are perceived as important for facilitating social bonds between owner and pet, we surveyed current dog owners (n = 153) with open-ended questions about their dogs' behaviours. Thematic analysis identified 7 categories of behaviours perceived as important to human-dog bonding, including: 1) attunement, 2) communication, 3) consistency and predictability, 4) physical affection, 5) positivity and enthusiasm, 6) proximity, and 7) shared activities. We consider the feasibility of translating these behaviours into a social robotic platform, and signpost potential barriers moving forward. In addition to providing insight into important behaviours for human-dog bonding, this work provides a springboard for those hoping to implement dog behaviours into animal-like artificial agents designed for social roles."

https://openalex.org/W4297517743,"Coal is the largest non-renewable energy as well as an important basic energy and industrial raw material. Thus, correctly understanding the molecular structure characteristics of coal has important theoretical value for realizing carbon neutralization. In this work, we clarified the molecular structure characteristics of anthracite, where the organic matter in anthracite was characterized and analyzed by industrial/elemental analysis, FTIR, XPS, XRD and solid 13C NMR. The ratio of bridge carbon to the perimeter carbon of anthracite was 0.38, and the degree of condensation in the aromatic structure was high. Nitrogen in coal primarily exists in the form of pyridine and pyrrole. Based on the information on functional group composition, the carbon skeleton structure, and surface element composition, a molecular structure model of Yangquan anthracite could be constructed, where the molecular formula was C208H162O12N4. This study may serve as a reference for researchers in this field to consult and refer to the construction ideas and methods of molecular structure models of different coal samples."
https://openalex.org/W4297457266,The heat resistance of Bacillus cereus spores inoculated in a rice substrate supplemented with insect chitosan as an alternative antimicrobial was studied. Two concentrations of insect chitosan were considered in order to assess the role of the insect chitosan concentration during the heat process. Results of the study indicated that the DT values were higher in the substrate without chitosan than in the substrate containing chitosan thus indicating a greater heat resistance to heat treatment of the microorganism inoculated in the substrate without chitosan. This behaviour was also evidenced in the survival curves. There were no great differences between either of the insect chitosan concentrations tested regarding the DT values. The z values were 9.8°C on rice substrate and8.9°C on rice substrate supplemented with insect chitosan at 150 μg/mL and 10.7°C on rice substrate supplemented with 250 μg/mL of insect chitosan. The chitosan concentration appears to affect the z value of the microorganism. Our results indicate that the combination of heat with insect chitosan as an antimicrobial on foodstuffs subjected to cooking is feasible and can improve the safety of rice derivatives.
https://openalex.org/W4297457541,"The number of migrant workers in Germany has increased over the last decades and will probably further increase in the context of a growing cultural diversity of the population and shortage of skilled professionals. Since migrant workers face different challenges, they may experience poorer psychosocial work environments than non-migrants. A negative psychosocial work environment can increase burnout and depression symptoms. To this date no study has investigated differences in the perceived psychosocial work environment in the mental health field. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a cross sectional study comparing the perceived psychosocial work environment of migrants and non-migrant workers in inpatient mental health centres in Germany. The study was conducted in four inpatient mental health centres in Germany using the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire. All staff members (N = 659) categorized in seven professional groups were invited to participate in the study. The feasibility of the study was determined by four criteria (1) Implementation of the study in inpatient mental health centres (2) Representativity of the sample (3) Reliability and usability of the questionnaire and (4) Variability of collected data. Three of four feasibility criteria were achieved. The study was successfully implemented in four mental health centres, the usability of the used questionnaire was confirmed as well as the variability of the data. The targeted response rate was partially met, and the total number of migrant workers could not be provided, which limits the representativity of the sample. In conclusion, a main study is feasible, but an effort must be put in an effective recruitment strategy to obtain valid results."
https://openalex.org/W4297458025,"Anemia is common in heart failure (HF) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with worse outcomes. Iron supplementation improves symptoms and is associated with reduced risk of hospitalization for HF in iron-deficiency HF patients. However, iron deficiency is present in <30% of anemic HF patients. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) improve symptoms but are associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events in anemic HF patients with CKD. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors are a new class of agents for the treatment of anemia. These agents work by stabilizing the HIF complex, thereby stimulating endogenous erythropoietin production. We hypothesized that HIF-PH inhibitors may be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular outcomes compared with ESAs in anemic HF patients with CKD. Accordingly, we aim to perform the meta-analysis of studies on the efficacy and safety of HIF-PH inhibitors compared with ESAs in anemic HF patients with CKD.This meta-analysis will include prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials on the effect of HIF-PH inhibitors compared with ESAs in anemic HF patients with CKD. Information of studies will be collected from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The primary outcome will be cardiovascular death. The secondary outcomes will be all-cause death, hospitalization for HF, HF symptoms, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and hemoglobin levels.This meta-analysis will evaluate the effect of HIF-PH inhibitors in anemic HF patients with CKD, providing evidence regarding the use of HIF-PH inhibitors in these patients.INPLASY202230103."
https://openalex.org/W4297459983,"This paper proposes a hybrid technique for data security. The computational model of the technique is grounded on both the non-linearity of neural network manipulations and the effective distortion operations. To accomplish this, a two-layer feedforward neural network is trained for each plaintext block. The first layer encodes the symbols of the input block, making the resulting ciphertext highly uncorrelated with the input block. The second layer reverses the impact of the first layer by generating weights that are used to restore the original plaintext block from the ciphered one. The distortion stage imposes further confusion on the ciphertext by applying a set of distortion and substitution operations whose functionality is fully controlled by random numbers generated by a key-based random number generator. This hybridization between these two stages (neural network stage and distortion stage) yields a very elusive technique that produces ciphertext with the maximum confusion. Furthermore, the proposed technique goes a step further by embedding a recurrent neural network that works in parallel with the first layer of the neural network to generate a digital signature for each input block. This signature is used to maintain the integrity of the block. The proposed method, therefore, not only ensures the confidentiality of the information but also equally maintains its integrity. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is proven through a set of rigorous randomness testing."
https://openalex.org/W4297461618,"Previous studies suggested that accessibility to others with useful health information depends on one's educational background. While Information and Communication Technology is thought to affect health information disparities, it remains unclear whether it widens or narrows them. We aimed to examine how four types of communication media-face-to-face/telephone, E-mail, LINE, social network service (SNS)-modify the association between educational background and accessibility to useful health information in the personal network of Japanese adults. We used data from the third-wave Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) survey conducted in 2017, which targeted middle-aged adults living in four municipalities within Japanese metropolitan areas. The results demonstrated that SNS use moderated the gap between educational backgrounds, suggesting that SNS can be an interventional leverage to close a health-related information gap between socioeconomic positions."
https://openalex.org/W4297463387,"The literature on social and wealth inequality has long acknowledged the importance of intergenerational wealth transmission (IWT) to inequality in homeownership tenure. However, it has paid insufficient attention to the institutional structures that moderate these inequalities. Therefore, in this study, we ask how institutional factors via differential housing finance systems and governmental housing policies, moderate the association between IWT and homeownership tenure. This is done by using the framework of housing regime configurations and mortgage market financialization. To do so, we pooled data for 20 European countries from the European Central Bank's Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) for 2010-2017, for household heads aged 25-40. Our main findings show consistent contradiction to the welfare state-homeownership ""trade-off"" hypothesis: that is, when the rental market is more heavily regulated, it is actually young adults who benefited from IWT or who received higher value of IWT have a higher probability of mortgaged homeownership. Paradoxically, when housing finance institutions are more active and generous, the wealthiest young adults hold an advantage in mortgaged homeownership. Therefore, liberal mortgage markets actually serve to enable wealthier young adults to reproduce and preserve their parental wealth status. Further, when housing prices are less affordable (median mortgage-to-income ratio), those who have received a higher amount of IWT hold an advantage in mortgaged homeownership. We discuss the implications of our findings, which cut across the socioeconomic, spatial, and demographical arenas."
https://openalex.org/W4297489990,"This paper presents a study based on Stevan Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory and deals specifically with resources and coping as predictors of the quality of life of persons threatened by social exclusion. They have no access to public psychosocial resources, the acquisition and accumulation of which are closely linked to the perceived quality of life.A cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire study. A sample of 1,074 individuals from various groups at risk of exclusion was surveyed using the Conservation of Resources-Evaluation Questionnaire, the Strategic Approach to Coping Scale, and the WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire. The research was done among people supported by Polish non-governmental organizations operating nationwide. Structural equation modeling was used to test mediational hypotheses in the analysis.The significant variables that determined the relationship between resource gains and losses and the quality of life included active-passive and prosocial-antisocial coping strategies. The results were generally robust, but the level of education moderated the relationship between active antisocial coping and quality of life.The obtained dependencies are consistent with Hobfoll's approach, confirming its usefulness. Prosocial coping mediates the effect of resource gain on the increase in quality of life and the effect of resource loss on the decline in quality of life, strengthening the former and weakening the latter."
