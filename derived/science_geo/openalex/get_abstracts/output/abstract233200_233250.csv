https://openalex.org/W2080498142,"DNA-binding transcriptional regulators interpret the genome's regulatory code by binding to specific sequences to induce or repress gene expression1. Comparative genomics has recently been used to identify potential cis-regulatory sequences within the yeast genome on the basis of phylogenetic conservation2,3,4,5,6, but this information alone does not reveal if or when transcriptional regulators occupy these binding sites. We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed. We find that environment-specific use of regulatory elements predicts mechanistic models for the function of a large population of yeast's transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2139610636,"Methylation of arginine (Arg) and lysine residues in histones has been correlated with epigenetic forms of gene regulation. Although histone methyltransferases are known, enzymes that demethylate histones have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that human peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) regulates histone Arg methylation by converting methyl-Arg to citrulline and releasing methylamine. PAD4 targets multiple sites in histones H3 and H4, including those sites methylated by coactivators CARM1 (H3 Arg 17 ) and PRMT1 (H4 Arg 3 ). A decrease of histone Arg methylation, with a concomitant increase of citrullination, requires PAD4 activity in human HL-60 granulocytes. Moreover, PAD4 activity is linked with the transcriptional regulation of estrogen-responsive genes in MCF-7 cells. These data suggest that PAD4 mediates gene expression by regulating Arg methylation and citrullination in histones."

The effect shows up as a drop in the resonant oscillation period as the sample cell is cooled below 230 millikelvin. Measurement of 17 solid samples allows us to map out the boundary of this superfluid-like solid or supersolid phase from the melting line up to 66 bars. This experiment indicates that superfluid behavior is found in all three phases of matter."
https://openalex.org/W2029542216,"During the 2003 to 2004 outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in Asia, there were anecdotal reports of fatal infection in domestic cats, although this species is considered resistant to influenza. We experimentally inoculated cats with H5N1 virus intratracheally and by feeding them virus-infected chickens. The cats excreted virus, developed severe diffuse alveolar damage, and transmitted virus to sentinel cats. These results show that domestic cats are at risk of disease or death from H5N1 virus, can be infected by horizontal transmission, and may play a role in the epidemiology of this virus."
https://openalex.org/W2133966054,"The redox poise of the mitochondrial glutathione pool is central in the response of mitochondria to oxidative damage and redox signaling, but the mechanisms are uncertain. One possibility is that the oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and the consequent change in the GSH/GSSG ratio causes protein thiols to change their redox state, enabling protein function to respond reversibly to redox signals and oxidative damage. However, little is known about the interplay between the mitochondrial glutathione pool and protein thiols. Therefore we investigated how physiological GSH/GSSG ratios affected the redox state of mitochondrial membrane protein thiols. Exposure to oxidized GSH/GSSG ratios led to the reversible oxidation of reactive protein thiols by thiol-disulfide exchange, the extent of which was dependent on the GSH/GSSG ratio. There was an initial rapid phase of protein thiol oxidation, followed by gradual oxidation over 30 min. A large number of mitochondrial proteins contain reactive thiols and most of these formed intraprotein disulfides upon oxidation by GSSG; however, a small number formed persistent mixed disulfides with glutathione. Both protein disulfide formation and glutathionylation were catalyzed by the mitochondrial thiol transferase glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2), as were protein deglutathionylation and the reduction of protein disulfides by GSH. Complex I was the most prominent protein that was persistently glutathionylated by GSSG in the presence of Grx2. Maintenance of complex I with an oxidized GSH/GSSG ratio led to a dramatic loss of activity, suggesting that oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool may contribute to the selective complex I inactivation seen in Parkinson's disease. Most significantly, Grx2 catalyzed reversible protein glutathionylation/deglutathionylation over a wide range of GSH/GSSG ratios, from the reduced levels accessible under redox signaling to oxidized ratios only found under severe oxidative stress. Our findings indicate that Grx2 plays a central role in the response of mitochondria to both redox signals and oxidative stress by facilitating the interplay between the mitochondrial glutathione pool and protein thiols."
https://openalex.org/W2145328180,"Copper ions, either alone or in copper complexes, have been used for centuries to disinfect liquids, solids, and human tissue. Today copper is used as a water purifier, algaecide, fungicide, nematocide, molluscicide, and antibacterial and antifouling agent. Copper also displays potent antiviral activity. We hypothesized that introducing copper into clothing, bedding, and other articles would provide them with biocidal properties. A durable platform technology has been developed that introduces copper into cotton fibers, latex, and other polymeric materials. This study demonstrates the broad-spectrum antimicrobial (antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal) and antimite activities of copper-impregnated fibers and polyester products. This technology enabled the production of antiviral gloves and filters (which deactivate HIV-1 and other viruses), antibacterial self-sterilizing fabrics (which kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci), antifungal socks (which alleviate symptoms of athlete's foot), and anti-dust mite mattress covers (which reduce mite-related allergies). These products did not have skin-sensitizing properties, as determined by guine pig maximization and rabbit skin irritation tests. Our study demonstrates the potential use of copper in new applications. These applications address medical issues of the greatest importance, such as viral transmissions; nosocomial, or healthcare-associated, infections; and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1965666333,"It is known that proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) during disease conditions and affect several brain functions including memory and learning. In contrast to these effects observed during pathological conditions, here we describe a physiological function of IL-6 in the ""healthy"" brain in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. During long-term potentiation (LTP) in vitro and in freely moving rats, IL-6 gene expression in the hippocampus was substantially increased. This increase was long lasting, specific to potentiation, and was prevented by inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors with (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5). Blockade of endogenous IL-6 by application of a neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody 90 min after tetanus caused a remarkable prolongation of LTP. Consistently, blockade of endogenous IL-6, 90 min after hippocampus-dependent spatial alternation learning resulted in a significant improvement of long-term memory. In view of the suggested role of LTP in memory formation, these data implicate IL-6 in the mechanisms controlling the kinetics and amount of information storage."

https://openalex.org/W2049969188,"The molecular mechanisms by which mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases are negatively regulated remain largely unexplored. Previous genetic and biochemical studies indicate that Kekkon-1, a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeats and an immunoglobulin-like domain in its extracellular region, acts as a feedback negative regulator of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling in Drosophila melanogaster development. Here we tested whether the related human LRIG1 (also called Lig-1) protein can act as a negative regulator of EGF receptor and its relatives, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. We observed that in co-transfected 293T cells, LRIG1 forms a complex with each of the ErbB receptors independent of growth factor binding. We further observed that co-expression of LRIG1 with EGF receptor suppresses cellular receptor levels, shortens receptor half-life, and enhances ligand-stimulated receptor ubiquitination. Finally, we observed that co-expression of LRIG1 suppresses EGF-stimulated transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and that the inducible expression of LRIG1 in PC3 prostate tumor cells suppresses EGF- and neuregulin-1-stimulated cell cycle progression. Our observations indicate that LRIG1 is a negative regulator of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and suggest that LRIG1-mediated receptor ubiquitination and degradation may contribute to the suppression of ErbB receptor function.

Full-Text PDF Open Access The four members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; NRG1, neuregulin-1; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; Ig, immunoglobulin; Kek1, Kekkon-1; FCS, fetal calf serum; HA, hemagglutinin. receptor, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) play key roles in mediating the development of a variety of tissues, and the aberrant activation of these receptors contributes to the growth and progression of numerous tumor types (1Holbro T.

Phys. 2004; 58: 903-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Binding of EGF-like family ligands to ErbB receptors stimulates receptor dimerization, kinase activation, autophosphorylation, and the engagement of multiple intracellular growth signaling pathways. Although considerable effort over the past two decades has gone into understanding mechanisms by which ErbB receptors are activated and signals are propagated, our understanding of the variety of molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression of growth factor receptor activity remains in its infancy. Growth factor-stimulated receptor down-regulation, involving receptor internalization and the cbl-mediated ubiquitination and trafficking of receptors to lysosomes (3Shtiegman K. Yarden Y. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), represents one mechanism for preventing hypersignaling by the ErbB receptors. However, whereas EGF receptor (ErbB1 or EGFR) efficiently couples to cbl following stimulation with its ligand EGF, the ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors do not efficiently couple to cbl following stimulation with neuregulin-1 (NRG1) (5Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar) and do not undergo efficient NRG1-stimulated down-regulation (6Baulida J. Kraus M.H.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hence, other negative regulatory mechanisms may play major roles in suppressing ErbB receptor activity. Studies from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster point to the existence of several classes of proteins that negatively regulate EGF receptor activity in flies (8Sweeney C. Carraway III, K.L. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Argos is a secreted protein that bears some homology with EGF family growth factors and possibly acts as an antagonist of EGF receptor stimulation by activating ligands (9Vinos J. Freeman M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3560-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Jin M.H. Sawamoto K. Ito M. Okano H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2098-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus far, a mammalian functional homolog of Argos has not been identified. Kekkon-1 (Kek1) is a transmembrane protein whose extracellular region contains a domain of six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain (11Musacchio M. Perrimon N. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Kek1 physically associates with Drosophila EGF receptor through its LRR domain to specifically suppress receptor signaling (12Ghiglione C. Carraway III, K.L. Amundadottir L.T. Boswell R.E. Perrimon N. Duffy J.B. Cell. 1999; 96: 847-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Ghiglione C. Amundadottir L. Andresdottir M. Bilder D. Diamonti J.A. Noselli S. Perrimon N. Carraway III, K.L. Development. 2003; 130: 4483-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly Drosophila Kek1 can physically associate with each of the four mammalian ErbB family members and potently suppresses the growth rate of mammary tumor cells whose growth is dependent on ErbB signaling (13Ghiglione C. Amundadottir L. Andresdottir M. Bilder D. Diamonti J.A. Noselli S. Perrimon N. Carraway III, K.L. Development. 2003; 130: 4483-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that human proteins containing extracellular LRR domains are candidate suppressors of ErbB activity. The human genome encodes dozens of transmembrane proteins from different families that contain extracellular LRR domains. The functions of the vast majority of these remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that mice lacking LRIG1, a protein possessing a domain of 15 LRRs and 3 Ig domains in its extracellular region (14Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A.

Ozawa K. Inui S. Nakata A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. Yoshikawa K. Itami S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of ErbB receptor signaling is commonly observed in keratinocytes of psoriatic lesions, and expression of EGF-like growth factors in keratinocytes of transgenic mice results in a psoriatic phenotype (17Piepkorn M. Pittelkow M.R. Cook P.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 715-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These observations point to the possibility that LRIG1 might act as a negative regulator of ErbB receptor signaling. Here we have examined whether LRIG1 can suppress ErbB-mediated growth regulation. Materials and Cell Culture—EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and glutathione S-transferase-fused NRG1β EGF-like domain was produced in bacteria and purified by glutathione affinity. Plasmids expressing human ErbB receptors have been previously described (18Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Myc and HA tags were from Oncogene Sciences, and receptor antibodies from NeoMarkers or Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used as described previously (19Sweeney C. Fambrough D. Huard C.

Anti-ErbB2 antibody 3E8 used in immunofluorescence was from Genentech. Antibodies to LRIG1 were raised in rabbit to peptide acetyl-QTRKKSEEYSVTNTDETC-amide located in the intracellular domain. Antibodies were affinity purified prior to use in immunoprecipitation and blotting experiments. FuGENE 6 was from Roche Applied Science. All cell lines were from ATCC. NIH3T3, 293T, SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-361, and BT474 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum (FCS). All prostate tumor cell lines and T47D cells were cultured in RPMI/10% FCS. The PC3-LRIG1 cell line was created by the simultaneous transfection of tTA plasmid (Clontech) and LRIG1 subcloned into pTRE2-Hyg plasmid and selection with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B and 0.4 mg/ml G418 in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Individual colonies were screened for tetracycline-suppressed LRIG1 expression. Cloning of Human LRIG1 cDNA—A partial clone encompassing the carboxyl-terminal half of human LRIG1 cDNA was obtained from ATCC (IMAGE:4310439). The amino-terminal half was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of total RNA from human MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. The parts were joined using the unique internal restriction site SphI. Sequencing revealed that the cloned fragment represents a splice variant in which 1 leucine-rich repeat encoded by a 72-nucleotide exon is inserted after the first leucine-rich repeat of the published sequence (14Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22522-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Nilsson J. Vallbo C. Guo D. Golovleva I. Hallberg B.

LRIG1 was epitope tagged immediately carboxyl-terminal to its leader sequence by cutting the cDNA with NaeI and ligating in annealed oligonucleotides encoding the Myc epitope. Northern blotting of 20 μg of total RNA from human breast and prostate cancer cell lines was carried out using previously established procedures (20Yen L. Benlimame N. Nie Z.R. Xiao D. Wang T.

Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—293T cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with each ErbB receptor without or with LRIG1 using FuGENE 6 according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were serum starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.1% FCS overnight prior to growth factor treatment. Dishes were treated with nothing, 50 nm NRG1β, or 33 nm EGF as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (19Sweeney C. Fambrough D. Huard C. Diamonti A.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22685-22698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of anti-Myc or anti-receptor antibodies. Proteins in lysates were blotted with Myc, HA, or receptor antibodies. For immunoprecipitation experiments from mouse brain lysates, a single mouse brain was obtained immediately after sacrifice and was homogenized in 3 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. 1 ml of supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of rabbit anti-IgM or rabbit anti-LRIG1 and blotted with anti-receptor and anti-LRIG1 antibodies. Detection was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Images were captured using an Alpha Innotech imaging station and FluorChem software. Biotinylation Experiments—293T cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with cDNAs encoding ErbB receptors or LRIG1, and proteins were allowed to express for 30 h. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and precipitated with appropriate anti-Myc or anti-receptor antibodies. Precipitates were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies). Ubiquitination Experiments—293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGF receptor or ErbB4, without or with LRIG1. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above except that cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (19Sweeney C. Fambrough D. Huard C. Diamonti A.J. Lander E.S.

Ubiquitinated receptors in 293T cells were detected by blotting with anti-HA antibodies. Ubiquitinated receptors in PC3-LRIG1 cells were detected by blotting with anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Covance). Immunofluorescence—COS7 cells were seeded onto cover slips, transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding LRIG1 and ErbB2 for 24 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells on cover slips were permeabilized and blocked as previously described (18Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and incubated with 1/500 dilutions of anti-Myc IgG1 and anti-ErbB2 3E8 IgG2a in blocking buffer. Proteins were detected using secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG2a and AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG1. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope to capture 12 z-plane images at 0.25-μm intervals; Slidebook software was used to deconvolve images. Soft Agar Assays—NIH3T3 cells in 60-mm plates were transfected with combinations of vector alone, EGF receptor, H-Ras, or LRIG1. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and counted. 2 × 103 cells were seeded in triplicate into 1.5 ml of plating agar (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and 33% agar, with or without 3 nm EGF) and plated on top of 60-mm Petri dishes precoated with 2 ml of underlay agar (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and 50% agar, with or without 3 nm EGF). Cells were fed once a week for 3.5 weeks and then stained with thiazolyl blue (Sigma). Colonies on plates were counted using an Alpha Innotech imaging station and FluorChem software. Cell Cycle Analysis—PC3-LRIG1 cells were simultaneously serum starved and treated with and without tetracycline for 12 h and then treated with 1 mm hydroxyurea for an additional 12 h. Cells were then treated with 10% serum, 50 nm NRG1β, or 33 nm EGF for various times, collected, and fixed in 70% ethanol/phosphate-buffered saline for a minimum of 2 h at 4 °C. They were then stained with 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide staining solution (0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mg/ml RNase A) for 1 h at 4 °C. The fluorescence intensities of the samples were measured by quantitative flow cytometry using a BD PharMingen FACScan scanner. Analysis was based on 20,000 cells and was linearly scaled. To determine whether LRIG1 might influence the properties of human ErbB receptors, we first examined the association of the proteins by co-immunoprecipitation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, 293T cells were transiently transfected with human ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases in the absence or presence of human LRIG1 tagged in the extracellular domain with the Myc epitope. Following treatment with appropriate growth factor, lysates from cells were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibodies, and precipitates were examined for the presence of receptors by immunoblotting. We observed that EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 each co-immunoprecipitated with the 145-kDa LRIG1, but co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous insulin receptor was not observed. These observations indicate that LRIG1 is capable of forming a specific complex with each of the receptors of the ErbB family. Because previous studies have demonstrated that LRIG1 is prominently expressed in glial cells of mouse brain (14Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22522-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we used the co-immunoprecipitation assay to examine the association of LRIG1 and EGFR in mouse brain lysates. We observed that EGFR could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with LRIG1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that the two proteins are associated in a complex in vivo. Interestingly, when lysates from co-transfection experiments were blotted with anti-receptor antibodies, a loss of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 was observed in the presence of LRIG1, but no loss of insulin receptor was observed despite very efficient transfection of these cells (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 3 in all panels). These observations suggest that a functional consequence of LRIG1 interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases may be suppression of receptor levels to lower the efficiency of signaling. As a transmembrane protein, LRIG1 could be present in the plasma membrane and interact with receptors at the cell surface, or it could be located within membranous intracellular compartments and interact with receptors during their transit to or from the cell surface. To determine whether LRIG1 is present at the cell surface, we first examined its reactivity with sulfo-biotin-X-NHS, an amine-reactive, membrane-impermeant form of biotin commonly employed to biotinylate cell surface proteins. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 2A, 293T cells were transfected with LRIG1 or each of the ErbB receptors, cells were biotinylated, and expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with their respective antibodies and blotted with anti-biotin. We observed that each of the proteins could be biotinylated, indicating that some fraction of each is present at the cell surface. To determine the subcellular location of LRIG1 and possible sites of LRIG1-receptor interaction, we examined the localization of receptors and LRIG1 in co-transfected COS7 cells by three-dimensional indirect immunofluorescence followed by deconvolution of the resulting z-plane images. As an example, Fig. 2B illustrates the localization of LRIG1 and ErbB2 in co-transfected cells. LRIG1 is found largely in perinuclear intracellular compartments and is particularly concentrated in a region to one side of the nucleus. A fraction of LRIG1 is also found at the cell periphery. ErbB2 exhibited a similar distribution, although its presence in intracellular structures was less pronounced. Merging of the images demonstrated that LRIG1 and ErbB2 signals overlap at both peripheral and intracellular locations, suggesting that these are sites of LRIG1-ErbB2 interaction. Similar co-localization patterns were observed with the other ErbB receptors (not shown). Previous studies have shown that the attachment of a single ubiquitin moiety to the EGF receptor is sufficient to decrease its stability and to suppress cellular receptor levels (21Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 22Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, one mechanism that could account for the observed LRIG1-induced loss of receptors is promotion of receptor ubiquitination and degradation by LRIG1. To test this, we examined the basal and ligand-stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR and ErbB4. In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3, 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and either EGFR or ErbB4. Cells were treated without and with their respective growth factors for 5 min, receptors were immunoprecipitated, and precipitates were blotted for the presence of HA. The ratio of HA immunoreactivity to receptor immunoreactivity was then determined after quantifying the respective bands. We observed that for both receptors in the absence of added ligand, LRIG1 reduced the ratio of ubiquitinated receptor to total receptor. Consistent with previous reports, we observed that growth factor treatment promoted the rapid ubiquitination of receptors. Interestingly, for both receptors LRIG1 markedly potentiated the ratio of ubiquitinated receptor to total receptor following growth factor stimulation. The observations illustrated in Fig. 3 suggest that the functional consequence of LRIG1 interaction with ErbB receptors may be to promote receptor ubiquitination both in the presence and absence of growth factor. The apparent loss of ubiquitinated receptors in the presence of LRIG1 and in the absence of added ligand could be because of the relatively rapid loss of the ubiquitinated population. Alternatively, LRIG1-mediated receptor degradation in the absence of ligand may occur through a mechanism independent of receptor ubiquitination. For example, because LRIG1 is more rapidly degraded than are the ErbB receptors (not shown) the population of receptors associated with LRIG1 would undergo accelerated degradation, resulting in lower basal receptor levels. On the other hand, LRIG1 clearly augments EGF-stimulated receptor ubiquitination, suggesting that LRIG1 also facilitates receptor interaction with the ubiquitination machinery. To examine the role of LRIG1 in receptor degradation and to determine the impact of LRIG1 expression on ErbB-mediated cellular growth properties, we established an inducible expression system using a cell line that does not express significant endogenous levels of LRIG1. We first surveyed a series of breast and prostate cancer cell lines for LRIG1 expression. We observed that three of six breast cancer cell lines and one of four prostate cancer cell lines detectably express LRIG1 by Northern blotting (Fig. 4A). We chose these cell lines for inducible LRIG1 expression studies because cells express the EGF receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3 (23Grasso A.W. Wen D. Miller C.M. Rhim J.S. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2705-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and proliferation of the cells may be stimulated by EGF receptor ligands (24Hofer D.R. Sherwood E.R. Bromberg W.D. Mendelsohn J. Lee C. Kozlowski J.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2780-2785PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that PC3 cells express extremely low levels of LRIG1 when compared with normal prostate tissue as assessed by real-time RT-PCR (25Hedman H. Nilsson J. Guo D. Henriksson R. Acta Oncol. 2002; 41: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A clone of PC3 cells (PC3-LRIG1) was established using the Tet-Off system to repress LRIG1 expression. Tetracycline withdrawal from these cells resulted in efficient induction of expression of Myc-tagged LRIG1 (Fig. 4B). Induction of LRIG1 expression in these cells resulted in the ligand-independent loss of 30–60% of endogenous EGFR and ErbB2, consistent with the LRIG1-induced loss of receptors observed in 293T cell co-transfectants (Fig. 1B). The lower efficiency of receptor loss in these cells relative to 293T co-transfectants may result from lower LRIG1 expression levels. To determine whether LRIG1 expression influences the ubiquitination and degradation rate of ErbB receptors in the inducible expression system, we focused on the effect of LRIG1 expression on the properties of EGFR in the PC3-LRIG1 cells. Similar to the results with transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3), we observed that the induction of LRIG1 expression markedly augmented the ubiquitination of EGFR in response to EGF treatment (Fig. 5A). This potentiation of ligand-stimulated EGFR ubiquitination correlated with a suppression of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor levels after growth factor treatment. In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5B, PC3-LRIG1 cells were treated with and without tetracycline to induce LRIG1 expression, and a time course of EGF stimulation of the cells was carried out. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-EGFR antibodies. In the presence of LRIG1, EGFR responded less efficiently to EGF as determined by blotting autophosphorylated receptors with anti-phosphotyrosine. Interestingly, LRIG1 expression also resulted in an accelerated loss of EGFR. Anti-EGFR blots revealed that in the absence of LRIG1 expression an immediate loss of receptor occurred after 3–15 min of stimulation, followed by a recovery at 30–60 min. However, stimulation of cells expressing LRIG1 also resulted in a loss of receptor after 3–15 min but with little if any recovery, suggesting that the presence of LRIG1 accelerates the degradation of EGFR after ligand stimulation. The LRIG1-induced loss of ErbB receptors in the absence of growth factor suggests that its presence may also affect basal receptor degradation rate. To examine the impact of LRIG1 expression on basal EGF receptor stability, PC3-LRIG1 cells were treated with and without tetracycline to induce LRIG1 expression and then treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. The levels of EGF receptor remaining at various times following inhibition of protein synthesis were then determined by immunoblotting and quantitatively compared for cells with and without LRIG1 expression. As shown in Fig. 5C, the presence of LRIG1 accelerated the rate at which EGF receptor was degraded by cells. Taken together, the results depicted in Fig. 5 suggest that LRIG1 negatively regulates ErbB receptors by promoting receptor ubiquitination and increasing the basal and ligand-stimulated rates of receptor degradation. The suppression of ErbB receptor levels by LRIG1 raises the question as to whether LRIG1 might also suppress ErbB-mediated cellular growth properties. To test this, we first examined the impact of LRIG1 expression on ligand-dependent EGF receptor-mediated transformation of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 6A, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with control vector alone, EGF receptor, or EGF receptor together with LRIG1. Cells were treated without or with EGF, and colonies were counted after 3.5 weeks of growth. Consistent with numerous previous reports, we observed that EGF stimulated colony formation in this assay. This effect was completely blocked when LRIG1 was co-expressed, but LRIG1 expression was not able to suppress transformation induced by H-Ras (not shown). To determine whether LRIG1 modulates the ability of ErbB receptors to promote cell cycle progression, EGF- and NRG1-stimulated progression of PC3-LRIG1 cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary to S-phase was examined in the presence or absence of LRIG1. In these experiments, cells were first treated with or without tetracycline to induce LRIG1 expression and then treated with hydroxyurea to synchronize cells to the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. At time 0, cell cycle block was removed and growth factors were added. Cells were then stopped at various time points and their cell cycle distribution determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We observed that induction of LRIG1 expression in the absence of growth factors had a negligible impact on the synchronization of cells at the G1/S boundary, reflected in the accumulation of the vast majority of cells at G0/G1 under both conditions (Fig. 3B). Stimulation with EGF or NRG1β resulted in a dramatic shift of cells into S-phase in the absence of LRIG1 expression. However, the presence of LRIG1 markedly suppressed these effects. In contrast, LRIG1 expression had no effect on serum-stimulated cell cycle progression (not shown). These observations indicate that LRIG1 acts as a negative regulator of ErbB-mediated cellular growth regulation. Our observations point to the following model for the role of LRIG1 in modulating signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases. LRIG1 forms a complex with each of the mammalian ErbB receptors and promotes receptor ubiquitination, leading to a loss of steady state and ligand-stimulated receptor levels and a suppression of receptor ability to mediate mitogenic responses. Consistent with this, previous studies have reported an inverse link in the expression levels of LRIG1 and EGF receptor in human renal cell carcinomas (26Thomasson M. Hedman H. Guo D. Ljungberg B. Henriksson R. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 89: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that LRIG1 might act as a suppressor of tumor cell growth (25Hedman H. Nilsson J. Guo D. Henriksson R. Acta Oncol. 2002; 41: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) by limiting the extent of receptor activation. It will be of interest to expand the analysis of the extent to which LRIG1 is lost in human tumors and to determine whether LRIG1 loss enhances the rate of tumor formation and progression in cultured cell and mouse models of human cancer. It is noteworthy that the physical mechanisms by which Kek1 and LRIG1 act may differ significantly. The physical interaction of Kek1 with mammalian ErbB receptors interferes with ligand binding and may also interfere with receptor dimerization or activation (13Ghiglione C. Amundadottir L. Andresdottir M. Bilder D. Diamonti J.A. Noselli S. Perrimon N. Carraway III, K.L. Development. 2003; 130: 4483-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LRIG1 appears to suppress ErbB signaling by promoting receptor degradation, leading to lower basal receptor levels and suppressed mitogenic capacity. Interestingly, other LRR domain-containing proteins have also been demonstrated to interact with receptor tyrosine kinases. Decorin, a secreted proteoglycan containing nine LRRs, has been shown to interact with the EGF receptor and ErbB2 to initially enhance their activities (27Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Decorin interaction with receptors has been suggested to mediate prolonged receptor down-regulation and the inhibition of cellular growth through enhanced expression of p21waf1 (29De Luca A.

FLRT3, a transmembrane protein containing 11 LRRs and a fibronectin type III domain (30Lacy S.E. Bonnemann C.G. Buzney E.A. Kunkel L.M. Genomics. 1999; 62: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to interact with fibroblast growth factor receptors to stimulate receptor signaling specifically through the Erk pathway in Xenopus laevis (31Bottcher R.T. Pollet N. Delius H. Niehrs C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that some LRR proteins may serve as modulators of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, to either suppress activity or to selectively regulate subsets of downstream signaling pathways. While this report was under revision, an article presenting similar observations and conclusions was published by Gur et al. (32Gur G. Rubin C. Katz M. Amit I. Citri A. Nilsson J. Amariglio N.

https://openalex.org/W1985496701,Removal of apoptotic cells by neighboring viable cells or professional phagocytes is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostastis. Here we show that the phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat T cells by mouse epithelial cells (HC-11) and peritoneal macrophages leads to the secretion of growth and survival factors. We characterized VEGF as one of these factors which subsequently promote the proliferation of endothelial cells. Further we demonstrate that the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies inhibits both spontanous and UV-irradiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial and epithelial cells. These effects were not observed when phagocytes had been exposed to viable or necrotic Jurkat T cells. We conclude that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells leads to secretion of growth and survival factors by phagocytes that represents a new form of life-promoting cell-cell interaction.

Recent studies show that murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)) uses a spike-mediated membrane fusion mechanism similar to that of so-called class I virus fusion proteins (14Xu Y. Liu Y.

Class I viral fusion proteins, including the hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus, gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), glycoprotein of Ebola virus, and fusion protein (F protein) of paramyxovirus (16Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 17Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), are all type I transmembrane glycoproteins that are displayed on the surface of viral membrane as oligomers. Most of these glycoproteins are synthesized as single chain precursors containing a protease cleavage site, and these precursors are cleaved into two noncovalently associated subunits: S1 and S2 in coronavirus, hemagglutinin 1 and 2 in influenza virus, gp120 + gp41 in HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus, glycoprotein-1 and -2 in Ebola virus, and F1 and -2 in paramyxovirus. Class I viral fusion proteins also contain a fusion peptide and at least two heptad repeat regions, termed HR1 and HR2. After binding to the receptor or induced by low pH, the fusion proteins undergo a series of conformational changes to mediate membrane fusion. The first step involves exposure of the fusion peptide, a hydrophobic region in the membrane-anchored subunit, which then inserts into the cellular lipid bilayer. Subsequently, HR1 and HR2 peptides form a trimer-of-hairpins-like structure via a transient pre-hairpin intermediate to facilitate juxtaposition of the viral and cellular membranes followed by virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry. Biochemical and structural analysis of these fusion cores from class I viral fusion proteins shows that these complexes of two heptad repeat regions form a stable six-helix bundle, which is designated as a fusion core in which three HR1 helices form a central coiled coil surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique, antiparallel manner (18Bullough P.A.

Agents that prevent conformational changes in the fusion protein by stabilizing the intermediate state are expected to prevent fusion activation and, thus, inhibit viral entry. In the case of HIV-1 gp41, peptides derived from C peptides can effectively inhibit infection in a dominant-negative manner by binding to the transiently exposed hydrophobic grooves of central coiled coil in the intermediate state and consequently blocking the formation of the fusion-active six-helix bundle structure (30Chan D.C.

These studies also propose the binding regions between HR1 and HR2 and identify the inhibition efficiency of peptides derived from the HR2 region. However, the detailed three-dimensional structure of the HR1/HR2 complex remains unknown. To verify that the SARS-CoV spike protein indeed forms a trimer-of-hairpins structure and to provide a structural basis for the design of viral fusion inhibitors, we characterized the binding of the two HR regions of the SARS-CoV spike protein and solved the crystal structure of this fusion core complex to 2.8 Å of resolution. The structure shows a similar conformation to other class I viral fusion proteins, especially MHV spike protein fusion core, suggesting that a similar approach might be used in identifying inhibitors of SARS-CoV infection effectively. This structure also provides important detailed structural information and target site for structure based drug design. Construction, Expression, and Purification—The SARS spike gene was cloned from SARS coronavirus GZ02 (GenBank™ accession number AY390556). Two peptides (HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein) interact, and their binding regions were characterized by recent biochemical studies and sequence alignment with MHV fusion core complex. 2Y.

The HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein consist of residues 900–948 and residues 1145–1184, respectively, corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 regions in new MHV structure (14Xu Y. Liu Y.

The fusion core of SARS-CoV spike protein was prepared as a single chain (termed SARS 2-Helix) by linking the HR1 and HR2 domains via a 22-amino acid linker (LVPRGSGGSGGSGGLEVLFQGP), which is flexible and long enough to facilitate a natural interaction between the HR1 and HR2 peptides and allows for easy expression and purification of the fusion core complex (Fig. 1A). The PCR-directed gene was inserted into pET22b (Novagen) vector, and the SARS 2-Helix protein was expressed in LB culture medium in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The product was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75™, Amersham Biosciences). Crystallization and Structure Determination—The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl and then concentrated to 15 mg ml-1. Crystals with good diffracting quality could be obtained after 2 weeks by using the hanging drop method by equilibrating a 2-μl drop (protein solution mixed 1:1 with reservoir solution) against a reservoir containing 0.1 m citric acid, pH 2.5, 10–15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.02 m spermidine tetra-HCl. The SARS 2-Helix crystal was mounted on nylon loops and flash-frozen in cold nitrogengas stream at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems coldstream with 0.1 m citric acid, pH 2.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 4000 as the cryoprotectant. The crystals have unit-cell parameters a = 121.2 Å, b = 66.3 Å, c = 70.0 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 107.4° and belong to space group C2. The crystals contain 6 SARS 2-Helix molecules in one asymmetric unit, and the diffraction pattern extends to 2.8 Å of resolution. Data collection was performed in-house on a Rigaku RU2000 rotating copper-anode x-ray generator operated at 48 kV and 98 mA (Cu Kα; λ = 1.5418 Å) with a MAR 345 image-plate detector. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure of SARS 2-Helix was determined by molecular replacement with the MHV 2-Helix structure (PDB code 1WDF) as a search model.

The linker and several terminal residues could not be traced in the electron density map due to their disordered nature. Here, we chose A, B, and C molecules as the SARS spike protein fusion core for the following structure description. In the SARS 2-Helix three-dimensional structure, the fusion core has a rod-shaped structure with a length of ∼70 Å and a diameter of ∼28 Å. Similar to MHV 2-Helix and other class I viral fusion proteins, the SARS spike protein fusion core is a six-helix bundle comprising a trimer of 2-Helix molecules. The center of the fusion core consists of a parallel trimeric coiled coil of three HR1 helices surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique, antiparallel manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Residues 902–947 in HR1 fold into a 12-turn α-helix stretching the entire length of the fusion core. As in MHV 2-Helix and other class I viral fusion proteins, the residues in positions a and d of HR1 are predominantly hydrophobic (Fig. 1B). Residues 1160–1177 in HR2 form a 5-turn α-helix, whereas residues 1150–1159 at the N terminus and residues 1178–1184 at the C terminus of HR2 form two extended conformations, respectively. Three HR2 helices pack against the grooves formed by the interface of the central three HR1 helices, and no interaction was observed between individual HR2 regions. The N terminus of HR2 starts with Ile1150, which is aligned with Gln947 of HR1. The C terminus of HR2 ends with Leu1184, which is aligned with Gln902 of HR1 (see Fig. 4).Fig. 4Comparison between fusion core structure of SARS-CoV and MHV. A, side view showing a structural comparison between SARS-CoV spike protein fusion core (colored in green) and MHV spike protein fusion core (colored in purple). The columns at both sides of the map represent two HR1 and HR2 regions of MHV and SARS fusion cores. The numbers at the end of these columns represent the specific boundaries of the HR1-HR2 interaction region in the two structures. B, surface map showing the comparison between hydrophobic grooves on the surface of three central HR1 regions of MHV (left side) and SARS-CoV (right side). The figure on the right side shows the deep and relatively shallow grooves on the surface of central HR1 coiled coil of SARS-CoV. Three numbers, 1–3, in circles represent three deep cavities, composing the deep grooves. The residues represent the boundaries of the grooves and cavities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interactions between HR1 and HR2—Three HR2 helices interact with HR1 helices mainly through hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic residues in HR2 regions and the grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil. Similar to those in MHV 2-Helix, HR2 helices in SARS 2-Helix also contain OXO motifs, in which O represents a hydrophobic residue, and X represents any residue but is generally hydrophobic. 1153IN-ASVVNI1160 and 1178LIDL1181 in HR2 regions are both composed of OXO motifs; the side chains of the O residues inset into or align with the hydrophobic grooves of the central coiled coil, whereas the side chains of the X residues are directed into solvent (Fig. 3B). As described in our previous paper (14Xu Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Qin L. Li X. Bai Z. Pang H. Tien P. Gao G.F. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30514-30522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the OXO motifs are responsible for the partially extended conformation of HR2, and this pattern also makes the fusion core stable in solvent, as most of the hydrophobic residues in HR2 helices are packed against the central coiled coil, leaving the hydrophilic residues exposed to solvent. Comparison with MHV 2-Helix Structure—Among coronavirus spike proteins, only the structure of the MHV spike protein fusion core has been determined (14Xu Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Qin L. Li X. Bai Z. Pang H. Tien P. Gao G.F. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30514-30522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In general, the fusion core from SARS-CoV and MHV adopt a similar fold, consistent with their high sequence identity and similarity between the two proteins. The structure of SARS spike protein fusion core was compared with that of MHV spike protein (Fig. 4). These structures can be superimposed with a root mean square difference of 0.91 Å for all Cα atoms. Alignments of the peptides derived from HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein and those of other coronaviruses reveal high sequence identity and similarity, suggesting that structures of spike protein fusion cores from other coronavirus might share significant similarity with those of MHV and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1B). Although the main chains of the MHV 2-Helix and SARS-CoV"

Sequence alignment was used to investigate the occurrence of related motifs in other human fibrillar collagens, and located a conserved array of novel GER motifs within their triple helical domains. We compared the integrin binding properties of synthetic triple helical peptides containing examples of such sequences (GLSGER, GMOGER, GAOGER, and GQRGER) or the previously identified motifs. Recombinant inserted (I) domains of integrin subunits α1, α2 and α11 all bound poorly to all motifs other than GFOGER and GLOGER. Similarly, α2β1 -containing resting platelets adhered well only to GFOGER and GLOGER, while ADP-activated platelets, HT1080 cells and two active α2I domain mutants (E318W, locked open) bound all motifs well, indicating that affinity modulation determines the sequence selectivity of integrins. GxO/SGER peptides inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen monomers with order of potency F ≥ L ≥ M > A. These results establish GFOGER as a high affinity sequence, which can interact with the α2I domain in the absence of activation and suggest that integrin reactivity of collagens may be predicted from their GER content.

These results establish GFOGER as a high affinity sequence, which can interact with the α2I domain in the absence of activation and suggest that integrin reactivity of collagens may be predicted from their GER content. Collagen, the most abundant structural protein of the vertebrate organism, currently has 27 reported family members (1Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Plumb D.A. Rock C.F. Poulsom R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31067-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As either a mechanical support or as a bioactive surface, collagen plays a crucial role in processes as diverse as morphogenesis, wound repair, inflammation, tumor metastasis, hemostasis, and thrombosis. The tensile strength of the fibrillar collagens, types I-III, V, XI, and XXVII, is crucial to the function of connective tissues including the blood vessel wall. The non-fibrillar collagens, such as types IV and VI, provide a flexible support for endothelial and epithelial cell attachment and development. Integrins, heterodimeric adhesion molecules, form an important subgroup of receptors, which mediate interaction between collagen and cells. Four α-subunits, α1, α2, α10, and α11, which associate non-covalently with β1, constitute the native collagen-binding integrin family (2Gullberg D.E. Lundgren-Akerlund E. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 37: 3-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Integrin α2β1 is a well characterized and widespread receptor for collagen, laminin, and other non-matrix ligands among nucleated cells including epithelial and endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and mast cells (3Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Edelson B.T. Li Z. Pappan L.K. Zutter M.M. Blood. 2004; 103: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), mediating a wide range of cellular activities. α2β1 is the only collagen binding integrin in platelets, and is crucial for deposition on collagens exposed in damaged arterial walls (5Siljander P.R. Munnix I.C. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H. Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W. Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6He L. Pappan L.K. Grenache D.G. Li Z. Tollefsen D.M. Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3652-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the expression levels of α2β1 have been associated with myocardial infarction and stroke (7Kunicki T.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, knockout studies suggested that the platelet activatory collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is mandatory for the initiation of integrin-mediated adhesion (8Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), but this concept was challenged by further mouse studies (9Kato K. Kanaji T. Russell S. Kunicki T.J. Furihata K. Kanaji S. Marchese P. Reininger A. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. Blood. 2003; 102: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro studies suggest that soluble collagen binding to α2β1 requires a change in the conformation of the integrin (10Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8016-8026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore the mechanism by which α2β1 acts as a primary adhesive receptor and yet is subject to affinity modulation remains to be reconciled. The native collagen binding integrins contain within their α-subunit an inserted (I) domain (αI), which binds collagen through its metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), 1The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance; mAb, monoclonal antibody; O, hydroxyproline; LO, locked open; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl.1The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance; mAb, monoclonal antibody; O, hydroxyproline; LO, locked open; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. perhaps the only site of interaction, although in integrins lacking an αI domain, the I-like domain of the β-subunit constitutes the ligand binding site (11Xiong J.P.

Use of collagen-derived triple helical peptides identified the sequence GFOGER (where O is hydroxyproline) as the minimal recognition motif for α1I, α2I, and α11I (12Knight C.G. Morton L.F.

Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), which revealed the crucial interaction of the MIDAS and the GER sequence. The peptide glutamate residue is directly coordinated to the divalent cation bound to the MIDAS, whereas the arginine forms a salt bridge to the α2I aspartate, 219. Changing Glu to Asp abolishes binding, while Arg to Lys reduces the binding by 50% (13Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol.

In contrast, the phenylalanine may be less important, since two other collagen type I α1 chain sequences, GLOGER and GASGER, were found to bind α1I and α2I, when I-domain-interacting areas were mapped within collagen by rotary shadowing (16Xu Y.

No other recognition sequences have been unequivocally identified hitherto, although collagens I and III contain 11 and 14 GER triple helical motifs respectively some of which occur within cyanogen bromide-cleaved peptides, which support integrin binding (17Fitzsimmons C.M.

We used bioinformatics to locate and identify novel GXXGER sequences within the collagen triple helices, and examined the affinity of synthetic peptides representing examples from them for α2β1 in different cell types, and for recombinant α1, α2, and α11 I domains.

We identified new sequences analogous to GFOGER at conserved loci within the collagen helix that can bind integrin, and confirmed the reactivity of GLOGER and GASGER. Competition experiments established an affinity series for the recognition motifs: GFOGER > GLOGER > GLS-GER > GMOGER > GAOGER ≈ GASGER ≈ GQRGER. The cellular context was found to be crucial in determining the binding to these sequences, since, in contrast to adhesion of α2β1-containing HT1080 cells (a constitutively adherent cell line), α2β1-mediated platelet adhesion was poor to GER sequences other than GFOGER unless the peptide also contained GPVI recognition motifs (GPOn) (25Farndale R.W.

This concept was confirmed by non-selective binding of active α2I mutants to all sequences. Materials—Human platelets were isolated from citrate-anticoagulated whole blood, provided by the National Blood Service (Cambridge, UK). Pepsin-digested monomeric collagen type I from bovine skin has been previously described (19Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Zijenah L.S. Goodall A.H. Humphries M.J. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

GR144305F was a gift from Glaxo Wellcome (Stevenage, UK). Anti-GPVI Ab 10B12 was generated as previously described (28Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody was from Amersham Biosciences UK Limited (Buckshire, UK). Unless otherwise stated, other reagents were from Sigma. Sequence Alignment—Fibrillar collagen sequences CA11, CA21, CA12, CA13, CA15, CA25, CA1B, CA2B, and CA1R were downloaded from the Swiss-Prot data base (ca.expasy.org/sprot/), and non-helical parts of the sequences were removed before alignment using ClustalX. Small modifications to the alignment were made manually before assigning loci of GER sequences. Residue 1 of the type 1 collagen helix was denoted residue 1 of the alignment and of the first D-period of 234 residues. Subsequently, all 90 non-cuticle collagen sequence in the Swiss-Prot data base with the “CA” prefix encompassing all collagen types across a number of species were downloaded using the sequence retrieval system (srs.embl-heidelberg.de:8000/srs5/). These were analyzed for the frequency of GXXGER sequences (see Supplementary Data). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—The peptides synthesized for this study are shown in Table I. Peptides were made as C-terminal amides on Tentagel R RAM resin (0.1 mmol) in an Applied Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc protocols (29Chan W. White P. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1999Google Scholar). Briefly, Fmoc amino acids (0.4 mmol) were activated with O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or O-(6-chlorobenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU) (0.4 mmol) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (0.8 mmol). Fmoc deprotection was with a mixture of 2% (v/v) piperidine and 2% (v/v) 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. Peptides were released from the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (9.5 ml), thioanisole (0.5 ml) and triisopropylsilane (0.25 ml), containing dithiothreitol (0.25 g) for 4–5 h. Ammonium iodide (0.15 g) was added when cleaving methionine peptides to suppress oxidation (30Vilaseca M. Nicolás E. Capdevila F. Giralt E. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 15273-15286Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Crude peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LC200) using ACE diphenyl columns (Hichrom Ltd, Theale, Berkshire, UK). The identity of the purified peptides was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility (Cambridge Centre for Molecular Recognition).Table IProperties of synthetic triple helical GXXGER peptides used in this study: chemical structure, molecular weight, melting point, and location in collagenNameSequenceMrTmCollagen loci (human 1-12,15,16,18,19)GFOGER in GPPaBold text indicates amino acid changes in the peptide set.H-GPC(GPP)5GFOGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23704.245Iα1 680 IVα1 385 II 702 IVα3 756 XIα1 1027 IVα4 915 XIα2 985 IVα5 400 VIIα1 1997GFOGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GFOGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22795.143GLOGER in GPPH-GPC(GPP)5GLOGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23670.250Iα1 305 Iα2 217,640 II 327 VIIα1 1925GLOGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GLOGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22761.145GASGER in GPPH-GPC(GPP)5GASGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23602.142Iα1 989GASGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GASGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22692.934GAOGER in GPPH-GPC(GPP)5GAOGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23628.150II 528, 819 III 303,678 IVα2 1251 IXα3 98 VIα1 419 VIα3 2258 VIIα1 1740, 2760GAOGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GAOGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22719.048GLSGER in GPPH-GPC(GPP)5GLSGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23644.239III 987GLSGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GLSGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22735.033GMOGER in GPPH-GPC(GPP)5GMOGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23688.256Iα1 728 II 750 III 726 IXα3 373 Vα2 339, 759GMOGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GMOGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22779.144GQRGER in GPPH-GPC(GPP)5GQRGER(GPP)5GPC-NH23738.246Iα1 965 II 987 Vα5 996GQRGER in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GQRGER(GPO)3GPC-NH22819.141(GPP)10H-GPC(GPP)10GPC-NH23044.551ControlsGPPGPP in GPOH-GPC(GPO)3GPPGPP(GPO)3GPC-NH22637.955a Bold text indicates amino acid changes in the peptide set. Open table in a new tab Cell Adhesion and Spreading—Human fibrosarcoma cells, HT1080, obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, UK) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 international unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed, and suspended at 0.3 × 106/ml in platelet adhesion buffer, supplemented with glucose at 1 g/liter and 2 mm EDTA or MgCl2. 100 μl of cells were allowed to adhere at 20 °C for 30 min for standard adhesions and 20 min in the presence of 6F1. Adhesion (% of total number of added cells) was determined as for platelets. Cells were allowed to spread on GER substrates for 90 min, then fixed and stained with 2% Crystal Violet in PBS, then ×200 bright-field images from a Nikon TMS microscope were analyzed using a Leica Q550C image analyser and QWIN software (Leica, Cambridge UK). The area of at least 100 cells was measured for each peptide. Platelet Adhesion—Platelet (1.25 × 108/ml) adhesion was determined colorimetrically (absorbance 405 nm), as described (31Onley D.J. Knight C.G. Tuckwell D.S. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24560-24564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Peptides or collagen were coated at 10 μg/ml on Immulon-2 HB 96-well plates (Thermo Life Sciences, Basingstoke, UK), at which concentration platelet binding reached a maximum. When peptides were used to inhibit platelet adhesion to collagen, they were added to the platelets prior to plating with 2 μm GR144305F, which prevents platelet aggregation. Stimulation by 30 μm ADP was carried out in the presence of 2 μm GR144503F 5 min prior to the addition of platelets to peptide-coated wells. Data Analysis—Data from each donor platelet batch used for competitive inhibition of platelet binding to collagen (shown in Figs. 4 and 8) were fitted to the ligand binding Equation 1 (32DeLean A.

Inhibition of platelet binding was assayed and data analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Pooled data from 4–5 experiments with different donors are shown (Table II). GQRGER data were omitted for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The maximal inhibition of platelet binding, I(max), for each peptide was expressed as a percentage defined in Equation 2.I(max)=(P(min)−P(max))/P(min)(Eq. 2) As P(min) varied between patients, datasets for any one peptide were normalized such that variance was evenly distributed between peptide concentration points and that the average P(min) value across them all was 1. Mean and S.E. values for pA50, nH, and I(max) were determined. Values for pA50 were converted to A50 values in micromolar units, and divided by 3 to give the concentration of triple helix.

For integrin α11I expression plasmid, a DNA fragment corresponding to the integrin α11I was generated by PCR using the truncated human α11-fos HMT vector (a kind gift from D. Gullberg, Uppsala, Sweden) as template. The forward and reverse primers with an additional BamHI and EcoRI sites were (5′-ATCATCAATTGGATCCCTGGATGGCTCCAACAGCAT-3′) and (5′-TCGATATTGAATTCCAGGGCATCGACAATGTCCT-3′), respectively. The fragment was digested with the above mentioned enzymes, ligated into pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), and used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21. The I-domain sequence from transformants was sequenced and compared with the published sequence (37Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of α2I—pGEX-2T containing the α2I DNA was used to generate the I-domain mutant “locked open” (LO) containing cysteine at 172 and 322 positions (G172C and L322C) by site-directed mutagenesis essentially as describe previously for αLI (38Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The underlying rationale was to secure helix 7 in the position defined in the I-domain:peptide co-crystal, so that the MIDAS remained open. The primers used were: GGAAAAATTTGTACAATGCCTTGATATAGGCCCCACAAAGACACAGG, CCTGTGTCTTTGTGGGGCCTATATCAAGGCATTGTACAAATTTTTCC, GTCTGATGAAGCAGCTCTATGCGAAAAGGCTGGGACATTAGGAG, and CTCCTAATGTCCCAGCCTTTTCGCATAGAGCTGCTTCATCAGAC. Expression of I Domains—For protein expression and purification of α1, α2, α11, αM, LO, and E318W I domains, a 40-ml overnight culture of transformants was used to innoculate 400 ml of Luria Broth, 50 mg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown for 1 h at 37 °Cand then induced for 4 h with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,500 × g, 10 min), and pellets resuspended in PBS without divalent cations (PBS–). Suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged (2,500 × g, 10 min), and the supernatants were adjusted to 1% Triton X-100. Pellets were resuspended in PBS–, sonicated, and centrifuged twice more, and the supernatants pooled. The lysate was passed down a glutathione-agarose column equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), the column washed with 10 volumes of TBS and the glutathione S-transferase-I domain fusion proteins eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The proteins were then dialyzed against TBS and concentrated using a Microcon 3 microconcentrator (Amicon, Stonehouse, Gloucester, UK). The I domains were checked for purity and degradation by 10% SDS-gel and by Western blotting. Nitrocellulose blot were probed with HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-GST antibody. I-domain Binding—Immulon-2 96-well plates were coated as described for platelet adhesion, and blocked for 2 h with 200 μl of TBS with 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Wells were washed four times with 200 μl of the adhesion buffer (TBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) before adding 100 μl of adhesion buffer containing 5 μg/ml of recombinant GST I domains in the presence of either 2 mm MgCl2 or EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. This concentration of I domains provides optimal detection at a submaximal level of binding (39Lahav J. Wijnen E.M. Hess O. Hamaia S.W. Griffiths D. Makris M. Knight C.G. Essex D.W. Farndale R.W. Blood. 2003; 102: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Wells were washed five times with 200 μl of adhesion buffer containing MgCl2 or EDTA, before adding 100 μl of adhesion buffer containing the anti-GST horseradish peroxidase-conjugate (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, color was developed using an ImmunoPure TMB Substrate Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—The absorbance values for the adhesion of cells or I domains to peptide substrates were compared using either 1- or 2-way ANOVA. Specific comparisons were performed using the Neumann-Keuls (1-way) or Bonferroni (2-way) post-tests. Student's t tests were used where single conditions were compared in adhesion assays and to compare parameters of peptide inhibition (Figs. 4 and 8). Collagen primary amino acid sequences GFOGER, GLOGER, and GASGER were previously shown to bind α2β1-containing cells, the purified integrin and recombinant α1, α2, and α11 I domains (13Knight C.G.

A bioinformatic approach was taken to analyze the presence of GER sequences in human fibrillar collagens. An alignment of individual α-chains from collagens I, II, III, V, and XI suggested that GXXGER sequences occur at conserved loci within triple helical collagen domains, and these sites contain novel GXXGER sequences (Fig. 1). Three conserved loci for GFOGER and GLOGER in collagen types I, II, and XI, started at residues 127, 502, and 550 in the alignment. When other sequences occur in these loci, they are usually GMOGER or GAOGER, a previously proposed recognition sequence (25Farndale R.W. Siljander P.R. Onley D.J. Sundaresan P. Knight C.G. Barnes M.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; 70: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal GASGER, at residue 811, occupied a less conserved site and was shown to be of poor affinity at best (16Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we also identified another C-terminal GXXGER locus nearby at 787, which contains several GXXGER sequences each having a polar rather than a hydrophobic residue within the first triplet. From this locus we chose to test GQRGER. Peptides containing these novel sequences were synthesized in addition to the other previously identified integrin recognition sequences using two different hosts, (GPP)5 and (GPO)3 (Table I). As controls, (GPP)10, or the GPPGPP sequence in a (GPO)3 host were used. All the peptides had stable triple helices at room temperature with GER peptides lacking hydroxyproline as their third amino acid exhibiting lower melting points, demonstrating its important role in stabilizing the peptide helix. To assess cellular function of these recognition sequences, two different cell types, human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and human platelets, each of which express no collagen-binding integrin other than α2β1, were assayed to determine for their capacity to adhere to the peptides in the (GPP)5 host. HT1080 cells bound well to all GER peptides, whereas the binding was poor to (GPP)10 (Fig. 2). The HT1080 expressed a distinct binding profile: while GFO did not differ from GLO, GLS, or GMO, nor GAS from GAO, GMO, and GLS, significantly greater binding occurred to GFO or GLO than to GAO and GAS (Fig. 2A). Adhesion to (GPP)10 was significantly lower than to each GXXGER sequence. In separate experiments, the binding of HT1080 to the polar GQRGER motif was found to be within the same range as to GAO/GAS (data not shown). Integrin specificity of the adhesion to these sequences was demonstrated by their Mg2+ dependence (Fig. 2B), and by blocking with an α2 inhibitory mAb 6F1 (Fig. 2C). To detail the differential binding of HT1080 cells, we also measured their spreading. HT1080 cells expressed peptide preference for spreading, which paralleled their adhesion levels and which was clearly observed as a reduction in number of fully spread cells on GAO, GAS, and GQR and (GPP)10 control (Fig. 2D). GFOGER supported greater spreading, cell area being 150% of that obtained on GQR (p < 0.001), with cell area on other substrates decreasing in order GFO, GLO > GLS, GMO > GAO, GAS, GQR (data not shown). Finally, we assayed adhesion of another cell type, platelets, to the GXXGER peptide set. In striking contrast to the HT1080 cells, divalent cation-dependent binding of platelets to all sequences except GFOGER was reduced, and platelet binding to GAS, GAO, and GQR was almost negligible, paralleling the lower affinity observed with HT1"

Conditional double knock-out mice lacking both presenilins in the postnatal forebrain (PS cDKO mice) exhibit memory and synaptic plasticity impairments followed by progressive neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex. Here we further investigate the molecular events that may underlie the observed phenotypes and identify additional neuropathological markers in the PS cDKO brain. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis showed reduced levels of the toxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice. Interestingly, the reduction in Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides is similar in PS1 conditional knock-out and PS cDKO mice. We further examined the gene expression profile by oligonucleotide microarrays in the PS cDKO cerebral cortex and found that a high number of genes are differentially expressed, most notably a group of up-regulated inflammatory genes. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and Western analyses confirmed the elevated levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, complement component C1q, and cathepsin S, up-regulation of which has been associated with inflammatory responses in various neurodegenerative processes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the increase in complement component C1q is confined to the hippocampal formation, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein and cathepsin S are up-regulated throughout the entire neocortex and hippocampus. In addition, strong microglial activation occurs in the hippocampus and the deeper cortical layers of PS cDKO mice. These results indicate that the memory impairment and neurodegeneration in PS cDKO mice are not caused by Aβ accumulation and that loss of PS function leads to differential up-regulation of inflammatory markers in the cerebral cortex.

To study PS function in the adult cerebral cortex, which is the most relevant experimental system with respect to AD pathogenesis, we have previously generated presenilin conditional double knock-out (PS cDKO) mice lacking both presenilins in excitatory neurons of the forebrain after about postnatal day 18 (10Yu H.

These impairments are associated with reductions in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated responses and in the expression of CBP and of CREB/CBP downstream genes (11Saura C.A. Choi S.-Y.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate further what alterations at the molecular level underlie the impairments caused by presenilin inactivation in the adult brain and to search for additional neuropathological markers in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice. Because β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which have neurotoxic properties at increased levels, are products of the presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage of APP, we examined Aβ levels in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice and found a significant decrease of both Aβ40 and Aβ42. As an approach to search for gene expression changes in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis and found that a high number of genes are differentially regulated. We further confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western analyses the increase in the levels of a group of genes that are involved in inflammatory responses, and we characterized histologically their up-regulation pattern in the brain of PS cDKO mice.

Western Blot—Mouse cerebral cortex was dissected and homogenized in cold buffer (for Fig. 1A: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors; for Fig. 2B: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Same amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (10Yu H. Saura C.A. Choi S.-Y. Sun L.D. Yang X. Handler M.

For Fig. 2B, blots were incubated with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:100,000; Sigma), cathepsin S (1:1000; kind gift of Guo-Ping Shi, Boston, MA), or complement component C1q (1:1000; Quidel) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For Fig. 2B, blots were re-probed with an antibody against α-tubulin (1:100,000; Sigma) as a loading control. Films exposed by blots probed for cathepsin S were subjected to densitometric analysis using NIH Image software, values were normalized to α-tubulin, and significance was tested post hoc using one-factor analysis of variance with Scheffe's S test.Fig. 2Increased mRNA and protein levels of GFAP, cathepsin S, and complement component C1q in PS cDKO mice.

In brief, NUNC Maxisorb immunoassay plates (96-well) were coated with the antibodies 2G3 (anti-Aβ40) or 21F12 (anti-Aβ42) at 0.3 μg/well in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were subsequently blocked with Block ACE (1:4 dilution of original solution; Snow Brand Milk Products) for 2 h at room temperature and washed with PBS-Tween 20 briefly. The samples were loaded in the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-Tween 20, the plates were incubated in a solution of biotinylated 4G8 for 2 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBS-Tween 20 twice followed by alkaline phosphatase treatment (streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase, 1:5000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The signal was amplified by adding 100 μl of AttoPhos and measured with a Fluoroskan (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The detection limits are 3.125 pg/ml for both Aβ40 and Aβ42. The final values were normalized to the loading amount of wet tissue and analyzed for significance using the Student's t test. Aβ Extraction from Brain Tissue—Tissue was dissected, weighed, and homogenized in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 5 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and incubated at room temperature for 10–30 min. The suspension was then diluted 1:10 with loading buffer (10% Block ACE) and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was subjected to Aβ detection. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was purified from the cerebral cortex of a PS cDKO and a control mouse using the TRI reagent (Sigma). RNA was reverse-transcribed, biotin-labeled, and hybridized onto murine MG-U74A GeneChip probe arrays (Affymetrix) following the protocol detailed by Affymetrix. Analysis of differential expression was performed using DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) (15Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Genes with mean value >60 were analyzed further by cross-comparison between PS cDKO and control. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed as described (11Saura C.A. Choi S.-Y. Beglopoulos V. Malkani S. Zhang D. Rao B.S.S. Chattarji S. Kelleher III, R.J. Kandel E.R. Duff K. Kirkwood A. Shen J. Neuron. 2004; 42: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cortical RNA was treated with DNase I and reverse transcribed in the presence of random hexamers. PCR reactions were performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) with 10 μl of diluted (1:25) cDNA and gene-specific primers. Reactions were performed in duplicate, and threshold cycle values were normalized to 18 S RNA. All procedures were carried out together for PS cDKO and control in gender-matched pairs. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis to confirm their correct sizes. Significance was tested post hoc using one-factor analysis of variance with a Scheffe's S test. Immunohistochemistry—For cathepsin S, complement component C1q, and CD45 immunostainings, mice were sacrificed with CO2 and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected, post-fixed for 2 h at room temperature, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 48 h at 4 °C. Cryostat sagittal sections were cut (10 μm for cathepsin S and 30 μm for complement component C1q and CD45 immunostaining) and incubated with antibodies against cathepsin S (1:30, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), complement component C1q (1:100, HyCult Biotechnology), or CD45 (1: 1000, Serotec). For GFAP immunostaining, mice were sacrificed with CO2 and perfused with PBS, brains were fixed in 10% formalin for 2 h at room temperature and paraffin-embedded, and 10-μm sagittal sections were cut and incubated with an antibody against GFAP (1:500; Sigma). For all immunostaining, detection was performed using an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) kit (Vectastain) and a 3,3-diaminobenzimide (DAB) substrate kit for peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) without Ni2+ (brown color) for GFAP and C1q detection or with Ni2+ (black color) for cathepsin S and CD45 detection. Images were captured using an Olympus BX40 light microscope. To evaluate the potential involvement of altered APP processing in the phenotypes observed in PS cDKO mice, we examined APP processing in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice. The substrates for γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP are the APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs), which are products of α- and β-secretase activities and accumulate in the absence of γ-secretase cleavage. To determine the levels of CTFs in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice, we performed Western analysis using an antiserum (Saeko) that detects the C-terminal region of APP (13Kawarabayashi T. Shoji M. Sato M. Sasaki A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Prada C.M. Younkin S.G. Kobayashi T. Tada N. Matsubara E. Iizuka T. Harigaya Y. Kasai K. Hirai S. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At 2 and 6 months of age we observed accumulation of CTFs in PS cDKO mice in comparison with control and PS2–/– mice (Fig. 1A). The degree of accumulation was slightly higher than that seen in PS1 cKO mice, with similar patterns at 2 and at 6 months of age (Fig. 1A). Next, we used an ELISA to determine the levels of Aβ peptides in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice. We first measured generation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides in the cerebral cortex of 6-month-old mice and found a significant reduction of both species in PS cDKO as compared with control and PS2–/– mice (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, similar reductions were found in PS cDKO and PS1 cKO mice (Fig. 1B). Given the difference in the severity of the phenotypes between 2-month-old and 6-month-old PS cDKO mice (11Saura C.A. Choi S.-Y. Beglopoulos V. Malkani S. Zhang D. Rao B.S.S. Chattarji S. Kelleher III, R.J. Kandel E.R. Duff K. Kirkwood A. Shen J. Neuron. 2004; 42: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), we next asked whether the degree of reduction in Aβ levels is also different between these two time points. ELISA measurements at the age of 2 months also showed a significant decrease of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the PS cDKO cerebral cortex, as compared with control, at similar levels as the decrease observed at 6 months (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that the reduction in the presenilin-mediated γ-secretase cleavage of APP in PS cDKO mice is similar to that in PS1 cKO mice and is age-independent. Because a small amount of Aβ was still detected in the cortex of PS cDKO mice, which could be due to expression of PS1 in glial cells and/or interneurons, we measured Aβ levels in another line of nervous system-specific PS cDKO mice (NPC-PS cDKO mice) in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the nestin promoter (12Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar); thus, PS1 expression is inactivated in neural progenitor cells and NPC-derived neurons and glia. We found that Aβ40 peptides could no longer be detected in whole brain extracts from NPC-PS cDKO embryos at day 15.5 (Fig. 1D). However, a small amount of Aβ42 was still detected (Fig. 1D), suggesting that its production may not be entirely regulated by presenilins. We next aimed to determine what changes in gene expression are potentially associated with the progressive development of neuropathology in PS cDKO mice. We performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis using RNA from the cerebral cortex of 6-month-old mice as an approach to search for differentially expressed genes in large scale. At 6 months of age, PS cDKO mice have lost 18% of their cortical neurons and display very severe impairments of learning and memory and synaptic plasticity (11Saura C.A. Choi S.-Y. Beglopoulos V. Malkani S. Zhang D. Rao B.S.S. Chattarji S. Kelleher III, R.J. Kandel E.R. Duff K. Kirkwood A. Shen J. Neuron. 2004; 42: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The gene expression profiles of a PS cDKO and a control mouse were compared using oligonucleotide microarrays representing ∼12,500 murine characterized genes and expressed sequence tags. Analysis of differential expression was performed using DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip), a model-based approach computing expression levels for oligonucleotide arrays (15Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). This algorithm assigns proper weight to each probe within the set of 16 probes that interrogate each gene and influences the calculation of the fold change. 37 characterized genes and expressed sequence tags were found to be >2-fold up-regulated in PS cDKO mice (Table I). Classification showed that ∼25% of these genes are involved in inflammatory or immune responses, such as GFAP, chains of complement component C1q, and members of the cathepsin family. Ion and gap junction channels, transport/cytoskeleton-related genes, and genes involved in oxidation, signal transduction, or transcription were also among the genes that showed increased levels of expression. There were 26 characterized genes and expressed sequenced tags that were >2-fold down-regulated in PS cDKO mice (Table II). As in the case of the up-regulated genes, functional groups included ion channels, transport/cytoskeleton-related genes, and genes involved in transcription. In addition, genes involved in cell growth or metabolism were also decreased. 2The PS cDKO and control lists of hybridization values for all genes included in the microarrays can be accessed through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) web site at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo under accession number GSE1375.Table IUp-regulated genes in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO miceClassificationGene descriptionFold changeGenBank™ accession no.aThe RefSeq transcript identifier is given, wherever available.Inflammation/immune responsesGlial fibrillary acidic protein6.0NM_010277Killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily A, member 33.3NM_010648CD93.2NM_007657Complement component C1q, β polypeptide3.0NM_009777Cathepsin C2.4NM_009982Ia-associated invariant chain2.1NM_010545Complement component 3a receptor 12.1NM_009779Complement component C1q, α polypeptide2.1NM_007572Cathepsin Z2.0NM_022325Ion/gap junction channelsNa+ channel, voltage-gated, type X, α polypeptide2.2NM_009134Gap junction membrane channel protein α12.1NM_010288OxidationGlutathione peroxidase 52.6NM_010343Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIIIa2.0NM_007750Signal transductionGuanine nucleotide binding protein, β16.9NM_008142TranscriptionMetal response element binding transcription factor 13.1NM_008636Sp1002.3NM_013673LIM homeobox protein 82.1NM_010713Heart and neural crest derivatives expressed transcript 12.1NM_008213Transport/cytoskeletonProtein regulator of cytokinesis 13.2NM_145150Kinesin family member 5B3.0NM_008448ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 62.8NM_018795Adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 12.2NM_007598Solute carrier family 38, member 22.0NM_175121MiscellaneousStabilin 12.6NM_138672RIKEN cDNA 2700097O09 gene2.5NM_028314Murine retrovirus readthrough RNA sequence2.5AF014454Tyrosinase-related protein 12.3NM_031202Tenascin XB2.1NM_031176Imprinted and ancient (Impact)2.0NM_008378Signaling molecule ATTP2.0NM_016855Glucosidase β22.0NM_172692Expressed sequence tagsESTbExpressed sequence tag.3.1AA536968ESTbExpressed sequence tag.2.5AA725931ESTbExpressed sequence tag.2.1AW122725ESTbExpressed sequence tag.2.1AV138114ESTbExpressed sequence tag.2.1AV361852ESTbExpressed sequence tag.2.0AI639614a The RefSeq transcript identifier is given, wherever available.b Expressed sequence tag.

Based on the PS cDKO gene expression profile as revealed by microarray analysis, we investigated further what additional molecular alterations that have been associated with neurodegenerative processes are present in the cerebral cortex of PS cDKO mice. GFAP, an intermediate filament protein, is abundantly expressed during astrocytic activation and is present at increased levels in the brain of AD patients (16Overmyer M. Helisalmi S. Soininen H.

https://openalex.org/W2117711773,"The cellular prion protein (PrPc) resides in lipid rafts, yet the type of raft and the physiological function of PrPc are unclear. We show here that cross-linking of PrPc with specific antibodies leads to 1) PrPc capping in Jurkat and human peripheral blood T cells; 2) to cocapping with the intracellular lipid raft proteins reggie-1 and reggie-2; 3) to signal transduction as seen by MAP kinase phosphorylation and an elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration; 4) to the recruitment of Thy-1, TCR/CD3, fyn, lck and LAT into the cap along with local tyrosine phosphorylation and F-actin polymerization, and later, internalization of PrPc together with the reggies into limp-2 positive lysosomes. Thus, PrPc association with reggie rafts triggers distinct transmembrane signal transduction events in T cells that promote the focal concentration of PrPc itself by guiding activated PrPc into preformed reggie caps and then to the recruitment of important interacting signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2107455091,"The R2R3 MYB transcription factor C1 requires the basic helix-loop-helix factor R as an essential co-activator for the transcription of maize anthocyanin genes. In contrast, the R2R3 MYB protein P1 activates a subset of the C1-regulated genes independently of R. Substitution of six amino acids in P1 with the C1 amino acids results in P1*, whose activity on C1-regulated and P1-regulated genes is R-dependent or R-enhanced, respectively. We have used P1* in combination with various promoters to uncover two mechanisms for R function. On synthetic promoters that contain only C1/P1 binding sites, R is an essential co-activator of C1. This function of R is unlikely to simply be the result of an increase in the C1 DNA-binding affinity, since transcriptional activity of a C1 mutant that binds DNA at a higher affinity, comparable with P1, remains R-dependent. The differential transcriptional activity of C1 fusions with the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain in yeast and maize cells suggests that part of the function of R is to relieve C1 from a plant-specific inhibitor. A second function of R requires cis-regulatory elements in addition to the C1/P1 DNA-binding sites for R-enhanced transcription of a1. We hypothesize that R functions in this mode by binding or recruiting additional factors to the anthocyanin regulatory element conserved in the promoters of several anthocyanin genes. Together, these findings suggest a model in which combinatorial interactions with co-activators enable R2R3 MYB factors with very similar DNA binding preferences to discriminate between target genes in vivo. The R2R3 MYB transcription factor C1 requires the basic helix-loop-helix factor R as an essential co-activator for the transcription of maize anthocyanin genes.

Together, these findings suggest a model in which combinatorial interactions with co-activators enable R2R3 MYB factors with very similar DNA binding preferences to discriminate between target genes in vivo. Flowering plants express a large number of proteins containing the conserved R2R3 MYB DNA-binding domain. About 125 R2R3 Myb genes are present in the Arabidopsis genome (1Stracke R. Werber M. Weisshaar B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), and many more are predicted to be expressed in maize and related monocots (2Rabinowicz P.D. Braun E.L. Wolfe A.D. Bowen B. Grotewold E. Genetics. 1999; 153: 427-444PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jiang C. Gu J. Chopra S. Gu X. Peterson T. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 326: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar to other transcription factor families, the R2R3 MYB factors show exquisite regulatory specificity in vivo, while recognizing very similar DNA sequences in vitro (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E.

Thus, mechanisms other than discrimination between similar DNA-binding sites are at play in the control of specific sets of target genes by each R2R3 MYB transcription factor in vivo. The regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic gene expression by the cooperation of R2R3 MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; ARE, anthocyanin regulatory element; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. transcription factors provides one of the best described examples of combinatorial gene regulation in plants (10Mol J.

Phytochem. 2003; 38: 59-78Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Anthocyanin accumulation in maize is controlled by two classes of regulatory proteins that act in concert: C1 or PL1, two closely related R2R3 MYB domain proteins (12Cone K.C. Cocciolone S.M. Burr F.A. Burr B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and R or B, which are members of the R/B family of bHLH domain proteins (13Ludwig S.E. Wessler S.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 849-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Extensive genetic and molecular studies have shown that the C1 or Pl1 genes require a member of the bHLH-containing R or B gene family to activate transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (10Mol J. Grotewold E. Koes R. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 212-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The C1- and R/B-encoded proteins physically interact, and this interaction is mediated by the MYB domain of C1 and the N-terminal region of B (14Goff S.A. Cone K.C. Chandler V.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 864-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) or R (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The maize P1 gene, encoding another R2R3 MYB transcription factor, controls the accumulation of 3-deoxyflavonoids and red phlobaphene pigments by activating a subset of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes controlled by C1 and R, without a need for a known bHLH partner. P1 and C1 activate the expression of some common genes in the flavonoid pathway such as a1, and they interact with different affinities to the same cis-acting regulatory elements in the a1 gene promoter (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar, 6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The a1 promoter has a modular structure in which the proximal high affinity P1 binding sites (haPBS) and the distal low affinity P1-binding sites (laPBS) are separated by the anthocyanin regulatory element (ARE) (16Lesnick M.L. Chandler V.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In transient expression experiments, these three elements contribute to the regulation of a1 by P1 or by C1 + R (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar, 6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 17Tuerck J.A. Fromm M.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1655-1663PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, transposon insertions and mutations in the ARE differentially affect the in vivo regulation of a1 by P1 or C1 + R (18Pooma W. Gersos C. Grotewold E. Genetics. 2002; 161: 793-801PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike P1, C1 activates the transcription of the a2, bz1, and bz2 genes, which are specific for the anthocyanin branch of the pathway (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar, 6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 16Lesnick M.L. Chandler V.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The a2, bz1, and bz2 gene promoters are also modular (16Lesnick M.L. Chandler V.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19.Lesnick, M. L. (1997) Analysis of the cis-acting Sequences Required for C1/B Activation of the Maize Anthocyanin Biosynthetic Pathway. Ph.D. thesis, pp. 32-53, University of Oregon, Eugene, ORGoogle Scholar), containing ARE and C1-binding sites. Although the MYB domains of P1 and C1 are over 70% identical (20Grotewold E. Athma P. Peterson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and they recognize very similar DNA sequences (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar), only C1 has an absolute requirement for the bHLH factor R to activate transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (R-dependent transcription). In contrast, P1 controls gene expression independently of R (R-independent transcription). The substitution of six residues in the MYB domain of P1 with the corresponding residues from C1 generates the P1* protein (Fig. 1A), which, unlike P1, is able to physically interact with R (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Similar to P1, P1* activates a1 but not bz1 in the absence of R, indicating that the DNA-binding properties of P1* have not been altered. Interestingly, however, in the presence of R, P1* mediates a robust activation of the bz1 promoter (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The cooperation between bHLH and R2R3 MYB transcription factors is not limited to the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis by C1- and R-like proteins. The GL1 R2R3 MYB protein interacts with the GL3 and EGL3 bHLH factors to regulate the accumulation of trichomes in Arabidopsis (21Payne T. Zhang F. Lloyd A.M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1349-1362PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhang F. Gonzalez A. Zhao M. Payne C.T. Lloyd A. Development. 2003; 130: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Similarly, the bHLH rd22BP1 and R2R3 MYB AtMYB2 Arabidopsis proteins cooperate for drought- and abscisic acid-regulated gene expression (23Abe H. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Urao T. Iwasaki T. Hosokawa D. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1859-1868PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the Arabidopsis genome contains more than 120 genes encoding bHLH proteins (24Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 25Buck M.J. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 56: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Heim M.A. Jakoby M.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1749-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), the factors that cooperate with R2R3 MYB proteins belong to a small subgroup of bHLH proteins that share a common motif in their N termini. 2E. L. Braun and E. Grotewold, unpublished observations. This motif corresponds to the region in R that interacts with C1 (14Goff S.A. Cone K.C. Chandler V.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 864-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a general mechanism of cooperation between R2R3 MYB proteins and bHLH factors in transcriptional regulation. How this cooperation contributes to the regulatory specificity of R2R3 MYB proteins is the subject of this study. Herein, we have investigated the cooperation between C1 and R for the regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic genes. Using P1*, we uncovered two components for this synergy. One component, manifested by the R-enhanced activity of C1 and P1* on the a1 promoter requires, in addition to the high affinity P1-binding sites, cis-regulatory sequences within the ARE. The second component is manifested by the R-dependent activity of C1 on promoters containing only the haPBS. We generated a mutant of C1 (C1SH) that binds DNA with a higher affinity than C1 and comparable to P1. Using C1SH, we demonstrate that the R-dependent activity of C1 is not solely due to the intrinsic low DNA-binding affinity of C1, since the C1SH transcriptional activity continues to be R-dependent. The differential activity in yeast and maize cells of chimeras of C1 with the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain suggests that part of the function of R is to relieve C1 from an inhibitor. Together, our findings uncover two distinct and separable mechanisms by which R cooperates with C1 for transcriptional activity. In addition, our results provide a model to explain how R2R3 MYB factors with related DNA binding preferences achieve regulatory specificity through combinatorial interactions with accessory factors. Plasmids Used in Yeast Experiments—The P1 and C1 cDNAs (20Grotewold E. Athma P. Peterson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Paz-Ares J. Ghosal D. Weinland U. Peterson P.A. Saedler H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) were cloned under the control of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter in the YEplac112 vector (29Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). A control vector was also constructed with the GAPDH promoter with no downstream gene. The fusions of the MYB domains of P1 and C1 to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) were constructed by synthesizing the MYB domains and the Gal4 activation domain by PCR and then ligating them at an engineered NotI site. The fusion was then cloned under the GAPDH promoter in YEplac112. The yeast expression constructs corresponding to the N-terminal region of R fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD-R1–252) was the previously described fusion (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), but with the yeast selection marker changed from TRP1 to LEU2 by replacing the Gal4AD with the Gal4DBD-R1–252 fusion in pADGAL4 (Stratagene). The yeast strain used for the two-hybrid experiments was PJ69.4a, Mat a trp1–901 leu2–3, ura3–52 his3–200 gal 4D gal 80D LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met::GAL7-lacz (30James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the yeast one-hybrid experiments, a strain (YEG102) was constructed by transforming strain AY926 (31Doseff A.I. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 141: 857-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a PvuII-linearized pTH plasmid (32Flick J.S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4757-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in which the double-stranded oligonucleotide primer APB1X2 (5′-GATCGT GTA CCT ACC AAC CTT AAA CGT GTA CCT ACC AAC CTT AAA C-3′), containing two copies of the haPBS, was cloned upstream of a minimal GAL1 yeast promoter driving the expression of the HIS3 gene. Transformations were done using the method described on the World Wide Web at tto.trends.com. Plasmids Used in Transient Expression Experiments—As previously described, all P1 and C1 plant expression vectors include the CaMV 35S promoter, the TMV Ω′ leader, the first intron of maize Adh1-S in the 5′-untranslated region, and the potato proteinase II (pinII) termination signal. Plasmids described previously include p35SP1, p35SC1, p35SR, p35SP1* (corresponding to p35SPI77L,K80R,A83R,T84L,S94G,H95R (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar)); pBz1Luc, containing 2.3 kb of the bz1 promoter and intron upstream of luciferase; and pA1Luc, containing 1.4 kb of the a1 promoter and the Adh1-S intron (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar, 6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T.

A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The p35SC1SH construct was generated by PCR mutagenesis of p35SC1 using the QuikChange® XL kit (Stratagene). p35SBAR (33Grotewold E. Chamberlain M. St. Claire G. Swenson J. Siame B.A. Butler L.G. Snook M. Bowen B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was used for normalizing the concentration of the 35S promoter delivered in each bombardment. The p35SGal4DBD-C1C-term construct was previously described (36Goff S.A. Cone K.C. Fromm M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The pBz2Luc construct was also previously described (34Bodeau J.P. Walbot V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Bodeau. The pA2Luc construct was obtained from Dr. Lesnick (16Lesnick M.L. Chandler V.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The construct containing three copies of the haPBS present in the a1 gene upstream of the luciferase reporter (p(haPBS)3Luc) corresponds to the 3×APB1–35S construct previously described (6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The pGal4BSLuc reporter construct consists of four CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAG motifs in tandem upstream of a minimal CaMV 35S promoter. The pA1315LLuc construct is identical to pA1Luc, except for the 6-bp insertion present in the a1315L allele, left as a consequence of the excision of Spm from the a1-m2–7991A::Spm-s allele (18Pooma W. Gersos C. Grotewold E. Genetics. 2002; 161: 793-801PubMed Google Scholar). pUbiGUS (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) was used to normalize the efficiency of each bombardment. Microprojectile Bombardment and Gene Expression Experiments— Bombardment conditions of maize black Mexican sweet (BMS) suspension cells and transient expression assays for luciferase and GUS were performed essentially as previously described (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For each micro-projectile preparation, the mass of DNA was adjusted to 10 μg with p35SBAR (33Grotewold E. Chamberlain M. St. Claire G. Swenson J. Siame B.A. Butler L.G. Snook M. Bowen B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) to equalize the amount of 35S promoter in each bombardment. One μg of each of the regulators and 3 μg of reporter plasmid were used in each bombardment. To normalize luciferase activity to GUS activity, 3 μg of pUbiGUS was included in every bombardment. Each treatment was done in triplicate, and entire experiments were repeated at least twice. The assays for luciferase and GUS, and the normalization of the data were done as described (6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the ratio of arbitrary luciferase light units to arbitrary GUS light units. -Fold activation is calculated as the ratio between the Luc/GUS units of the reporter construct with transcriptional activator divided by the Luc/GUS ratio without the activator. Luciferase for a typical bombardment with just pA1Luc (no activator) gives between 1,000 and 5,000 units, and GUS (from pUbiGUS) gives between 150,000 and 700,000 units. Expression and Purification of Proteins Expressed in Bacteria—The plasmids for the expression of the MYB domains of P1, C1, and C1SH in Escherichia coli were obtained by cloning into the pTYB2 vector (New England Biolabs). The MYB domains (residues 1–119) were synthesized by PCR, adding an NdeI restriction site at the N terminus and an XhoI restriction site at the C terminus, which adds a Cys residue at the N terminus of the protein splicing element intein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For expression, E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlyS cells bearing the corresponding plasmids were grown, induced, and purified essentially as described (35Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After induction of a 1-liter culture with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C until further use. The cells were resuspended in 40 ml of resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed twice through a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min; the supernatant was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem). The chitin beads (New England Biolabs) were equilibrated in CB1 (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended to give a 50% slurry. Ten ml of chitin bead slurry was added to the cell lysate supernatant and incubated for 2.5 h with rocking at 4 °C. The beads were gently pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellet was then resuspended with 5 ml of CB2 (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100), loaded onto a column, and washed twice with the same buffer. The column was washed three additional times with CB3 (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was incubated in CB3 plus 50 mm dithiothreitol overnight in order to allow the self-cleavage of the intein and therefore allow elution of the target protein. The elution was then dialyzed against A-0 buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C until further use. Each wash and elution fraction was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Brillant Blue R-250. Generation of C1 Monoclonal Antibodies and Western Analyses— Monoclonal antibodies were generated using affinity-purified N10His-C1 protein by the Antibody Facility at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. For Western analyses, PJ69.4a yeast cultures were grown in 1.5 ml of SC-Leu-Trp medium at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and washed once with 1.5 ml of distilled water. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of SDS loading buffer (0.06 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and 15 μl of extract was loaded and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell in 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris-HCl, and 20% methanol. The transfer was done at 4 °C and 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were stained with Ponceau Red to verify transfer and then blocked in 1% nonfat dried milk dissolved in 1× TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in 1% nonfat dried milk dissolved in 1× TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The C1 monoclonal antibody C1 40/1–249 was used at 1:150 dilution. For normalization, the blot was probed with an antibody that recognizes the yeast DED1p protein at a dilution of 1:4000. After washing the blots three times for 10 min in 1× TBS, blots were incubated in anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for DED1p and anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for C1 40/1–249 diluted 1:2000 in 1% nonfat dried milk dissolved in 1× TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then rinsed again with 1× TBS as before, and then they were visualized by using the Amersham ECL kit. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—End labeling of synthetic oligonucleotide probes (APB01, APB05) was carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) in the presence of a 2 m excess of [γ-32P]ATP (>8,000 Ci/mmol; ICN). The labeled oligonucleotides were then annealed to equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides (APB10, APB50) by heating to 95 °C and slowly cooling to room temperature. The oligonucleotide pairs APB01-APB10 and APB05-APB50 were annealed to generate APB1 and APB5, respectively. The oligonucleotides were then precipitated on glass filters for quantification in a scintillation counter. The probes used correspond to the following: for APB1, APB10 (5′-GATCCGGGTCAGTGTACCTACCAACCTTAAACAC-3′) and APB01 (5′-GATCGTGTTTAAGGTTGGTAGGTACACTGACCCG-3′); for APB5, APB50 (5′-GATCCGGGTCAGTGTACCCGATCGTCTTAAACAC-3′) and APB05 (5′-GATCGTGTTTAAGACGATCGGGTACACTGACCCG-3′). DNA binding assays were performed on ice for 30 min in a 25-μl total volume in A-0 buffer with 0.8 μg poly(dI/dC) and 1 mm dithiothreitol (unless otherwise indicated). After incubation on ice, ∼10,000 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe was added and incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (80:1, acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) with 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA running buffer at 415 V for 55 min at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, gels were dried onto Whatman paper and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C overnight, using x-ray film or a Kodak phosphor imager for 2 h and quantified using a Bio-Rad imaging system. The apparent dissociation constants were estimated by carrying out the DNA binding assays as described above with a fixed amount of protein (35 ng) and in the presence of varying amounts of cold double-stranded oligonucleotide (ranging from 0 to 5.240 nmol). After incubation on ice, ∼10,000 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe was added and incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. Quantification of the free and bound APB1 oligonucleotide was estimated from the radioactivity present in each of the corresponding bands and calibrated against known standards. To compare our studies with others (4Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar, 35Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), data were assumed to fit to a linear relationship, although comparable RMS values are obtained using a hyperbolic fit (not shown). It should be noted that the APB1 probe is formed by two overlapping binding sites (6Grotewold E. Drummond B. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and whereas only one protein can bind to APB1 at a time, thus ruling out a cooperative interaction (not shown), our studies cannot rule out the possibility that each binding site is recognized with different affinities by the different proteins. The ARE Is Required for R-enhanced Activity—Previously, we showed that transferring the interaction with R from C1 to P1 resulted in the P1* protein with novel regulatory activities (15Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the absence of R, P1* activated the a1 promoter (pA1Luc; Fig. 1B) just like P1 (Fig. 2A) (R-independent transcription; Table I) but not the bz1 promoter (Fig. 2B). In the presence of R, P1* activated bz1, similar to C1 (R-dependent transcription; Table I) (Fig. 2B), and induced anthocyanin accumulation (not shown). P1* displayed a 2–3-fold enhanced activity on the pA1Luc in the presence of R (Fig. 2A, compare P1* and P1* + R). To ascertain whether this R-enhanced activity required cis-elements other than the MYB binding sites, we tested whether P1* displays R-enhanced activity on a promoter containing three copies of the haPBS upstream of a minimal CaMV 35S promoter (p(haPBS)3Luc; Fig. 1B). This synthetic promoter is activated by P1 and C1 + R but not by C1 alone (Fig. 2C). On this promoter, however, the activity of P1* is not enhanced by R (Fig. 2C, compare P1* and P1* + R). These results suggest that other cis-regulatory elements in the a1 promoter participate in the R-enhanced transcription of a1 by P1*.Table IParticipation of R in the regulation of the maize flavonoid biosynthetic genes a1 and bz1Regulatora1bz1P1R-independentNo activationC1R-dependentR-dependentP1*R-enhancedR-dependent"
https://openalex.org/W2155243614,"To determine the effect of glycogen availability and contraction on intracellular signaling and IL-6 gene transcription, eight males performed 60 min of exercise on two occasions: either with prior ingestion of a normal (Con) or low carbohydrate (LCHO) diet that reduced pre-exercise muscle glycogen content. Muscle biopsies were obtained and analyzed for IL-6 mRNA. In addition, nuclear proteins were isolated from the samples and analyzed for the mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPK) c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 and 2 and p38 MAPK. Nuclear fractions were also analyzed for the phosphorylated forms of JNK (p-JNK) and p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) and the abundance of the nuclear transcription factors nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF-kappabeta). No differences were observed in the protein abundance of total JNK 1/2, p38 MAPK, NFAT, or NF-kappabeta before exercise, but the nuclear abundance of p-p38 MAPK was higher (P<0.05) in LCHO. Contraction resulted in an increase (P<0.05) in nuclear p-JNK 1/2, but there were no differences when comparing CON with LCHO. The fold increase in IL-6 mRNA with contraction was potentiated (P<0.05) in LCHO. A correlation between pre-exercise nuclear phosphorylated p38 MAPK and contraction-induced fold increase in IL-6 mRNA was performed, revealing a highly significant correlation (r=0.96; P<0.01). We next incubated L6 myotubes in ionomycin (a compound known to induce IL-6 mRNA) with or without the pyridinylimidazole p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Treatments did not affect total nuclear p38 MAPK, but ionomycin increased (P<0.05) both nuclear p-p38 MAPK and IL-6 mRNA. The addition of SB203580 to ionomycin decreased (P<0.05) nuclear p-p38 MAPK and totally abolished (P<0.05) the ionomycin- induced increase in IL-6 mRNA. These data suggest that reduced carbohydrate intake that results in low intramuscular glycogen leads to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at the nucleus. Furthermore, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the nucleus appears to be an upstream target for IL-6, providing new insights into the regulation of IL-6 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2063162933,"Stimulation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to the production of cytokines that elicit massive liver apoptosis. We investigated the in vivo role of stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs) in this process focusing on the precipitating events that are sensitive to a cell-permeant peptide inhibitor of SRTF nuclear import (cSN50). In the absence of cSN50, mice challenged with LPS displayed very early bursts of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, tumor necrosis factor α (1 h), interleukin 6 (2 h), interleukin 1 β (2 h), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (2 h). Activation of both initiator caspases 8 and 9 and effector caspase 3 was noted 4 h later when full-blown DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation were first observed (6 h). At this time an increase of pro-apoptotic Bax gene expression was observed. It was preceded by a decrease of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and BclXL gene transcripts. Massive apoptosis was accompanied by microvascular injury manifested by hemorrhagic necrosis and a precipitous drop in blood platelets observed at 6 h. An increase in fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products and a rise in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 occurred between 4 and 6 h. Inhibition of SRTFs nuclear import with the cSN50 peptide abrogated all these changes and increased survival from 7 to 71%. Thus, the nuclear import of SRTFs induced by LPS is a prerequisite for activation of the genetic program that governs cytokines/chemokines production, liver apoptosis, microvascular injury, and death.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is the major mechanism of embryonic development and remodeling of tissues and organs, homeostatic control of immune cells that recognize self and non-self antigens, and removal of virally infected cells (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3991) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of hepatocytes may occur in fulminant hepatitis, an inflammatory process that is caused by viral and non-viral agents (2Jaeschke H. Gujral J.S. Bajt M.L. Liver Int. 2004; 24: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For example, recent gene therapy approaches to correct an inborn error of metabolism led to fulminant liver failure (3Raper S.E. Yudkoff M. Chirmule N. Gao G.P. Nunes F. Haskal Z.J. Furth E.E.

Similarly, activation of macrophages with their Toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin), induces massive liver apoptosis when animals are treated with ethanol or d-Gal (9Deaciuc I.V.

By reversibly depleting hepatic stores of uri-dine triphosphate (UTP), d-Gal sensitizes hepatocytes to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (10Galanos C.

These in vivo models of liver apoptosis offer an excellent way to study fulminant liver injury mediated by inflammatory cytokines because they provide a well defined and reliable end point, which is relevant to human disease states.The genetic programs for inflammation and apoptosis are regulated by stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs) either alone or in various combinations (15Hawiger J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 99-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These SRTFs include nuclear factor κB (NFκB), nuclear factor of activated T cells, activator protein 1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. In response to proinflammatory stimuli, SRTFs are translocated to the nucleus via a set of adaptor proteins known as importins/karyopherins α, which in tandem with their β subunit ferry the cargo to the nucleus (15Hawiger J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 99-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Importin/karyopherin α2 (Rch1, KPNA2) is the target for a cell-permeant peptide-cyclized form of SN50 (cSN50), which prevents the nuclear import of SRTFs (17Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar, 18Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

Here we report in vivo studies with cSN50 showing that this cell permeant peptide prevents liver apoptosis and death in a murine model of LPS toxicity. These findings demonstrate a key role for SRTFs in the development of fulminant liver injury induced by LPS and mediated by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis and Purification—cSN50 and SM were synthesized, purified, filter-sterilized, and analyzed as described elsewhere (7Liu D. Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Burnett C. Jackson C. Seele L. Veach R.A. Downs S. Collins R.D. Ballard D.W. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing no detectable LPS (<0.006 ng/ml as determined by the manufacturer, Atlanta Biological, Norcross, GA), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The viability of RAW cells was >80% in all experiments. RAW cells were placed in 96-well plates (200 μl/well at 2 × 106/ml) and treated with different concentrations of cSN50 and SM peptides (0, 5, 10, 30, and 50 μm) 30 min before stimulation by 2 ng/ml LPS from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (Sigma). Each experimental sample was run in duplicate or triplicate. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Supernatant samples from the medium of RAW cells treated with LPS and/or peptide were collected and frozen at -80 °C until assayed for cytokine levels.Animal Treatment Protocols—Female C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks old, ∼20 g) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 μg of LPS (5 μg/ml, Sigma) and 20 mg of d-Gal (100 mg/ml, Sigma), both in pyrogen-free saline. Mice were randomly divided into two groups; diluent control, which received 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in sterile H2O, or a treatment group that received the cSN50 peptide (0.7 mg in 200 μl of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in sterile H2O as diluent). The treatment group received seven intraperitoneal injections before (30 min) and after (30, 90, 150, and 210 min and 6 and 12 h) LPS and d-Gal challenge. However, the control group usually received five intraperitoneal injections of diluent because of the worsening condition of the animals and their rapid death. An additional group of 15 mice received the SM peptide (cell-permeant but functionally inactive analog of cSN50) in a dose of 2 mg given intraperitoneally before (30 min) and after (30, 90, 150, and 210 min). Due to the rapid demise of these mice, two additional injections at 6 and 12 h could not be administered. Animals were observed at hourly intervals for signs of acute toxicity (piloerection, ataxia, and the lack of reaction to cage motion) that herald imminent death. Inactive animals were euthanized. Animals without apparent signs of disease (survivors) were euthanized at 72 h after LPS and d-Gal. Some survivors were observed for an additional 7 days and then were euthanized. The blood samples from the saphenous vein were collected in heparinized tubes for plasma separation and in regular tubes for serum separation before and after LPS and d-Gal challenge at the indicated times. Some experimental animals were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 6 h for collection of organs. The liver was removed, and some pieces were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for caspase assay and RNA isolation. Other parts of the liver as well as other organs (spleen, kidney, lung, and heart) were immersed in 10% formalin for histologic analysis. Animal handling and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Cytokine Assays of Plasma and Cultured Cell Supernatants— Supernatant levels of TNFα, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in cultured RAW cells and plasma levels of IL-1β were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (ELISA, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). TNFα and IL-6 in plasma, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in plasma, and in cultured RAW cell supernatant were measured by a Cytometric Bead Array (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions (7Liu D. Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Burnett C. Jackson C. Seele L. Veach R.A. Downs S. Collins R.D. Ballard D.W. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 45: 1693-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of Liver Enzymes—Activities of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured in serum according to the modified manufacturer's instructions (Catachem Inc., Bridgeport, CT). Briefly, ALT or AST-working reagent and serum samples on ice were mixed at 12:1 ratio in cuvettes and then incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. After incubation, the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored at 1-min intervals for at least 5 min, and the decrease in absorbance per minute was calculated (ΔA). ALT or AST concentration (unit/liter) in samples was calculated using the formula, unit/liter = ΔA × 1929.Caspase Assays—Caspase 3, 8, and 9 activities in liver tissue were measured using a Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega) and modified protocol. Briefly, the proluminescent substrate containing the DEVD, LETD, or LEHD (sequences are in a single-letter amino acid code) is cleaved by caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, respectively. After caspase cleavage, a substrate for luciferase (aminoluciferin) is released; this results in the luciferase reaction and the production of luminescent signal. Cytosolic extracts from liver tissue were prepared by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Pefablock, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and subsequently centrifuged (15 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C) (19Chen R. Lowe L. Wilson J.D. Crowther E. Tzeggai K. Bishop J.E. Varro R. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1693-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of supernatant was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with extraction buffer and stored at -80 °C. An equal volume of reagents and 10 μg/ml cytosolic protein were added to a white-walled 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The luminescence of each sample was measured in a plate-reading luminometer.RNA Preparation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver tissue with Versagene RNA tissue kit (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and treated with DNase (Versagene DNase treatment kit, Gentra Systems, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of RNA preparations was assessed using a NanoDrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer and agarose gel electro-phoresis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with a High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was used as the template for synthesis of cDNA in a 50-μl reaction and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by 37 °C for 120 min.RNA Quantification with Specific Probes by Real-time PCR—Detection of mRNA expression levels by real-time PCR with a reporter probe has been established in amplification kinetics studies using reverse-transcribed transcripts as template (20Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 21Yajima T. Yagihashi A. Kameshima H. Kobayashi D. Furuya D. Hirata K. Watanabe N. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 2441-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RNA quantification of specific genes was performed using a TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems). A probe for eukaryotic 18 S rRNA endogenous control (product 4319413E) was VIC/minor groove binder-labeled. The primers and FAM/minor groove binder-labeled probes for the following genes were purchased from ABI (TaqMan Assay-on-Demand): Bcl2 (assay ID Mm00477631_m1), BclXL (assay ID Mm00437783_m1), and Bax (assay ID Mm00432050_m1). Eukaryotic 18 S rRNA was used as an endogenous control in a multiplex PCR reaction with a primer/probe of the gene of interest. For each reaction, 2× TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm primers, and 250 nm probes in 10 μl were added to 384-well plate. Real-time PCR and subsequent analysis were performed with the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (SDS v2.1) (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C denaturation for 15 s, 60 °C annealing/extension for 1 min). All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample and were repeated three times.Platelet Count, Detection of Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs), and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) Total Antigen—Heparinized fresh blood was diluted 1:60 in 1% ammonium oxalate (EM Science) and rocked for 20 min. The sample was added to hemacytometer, and after 20 min, platelets were counted. FDPs in serum were detected by staphylococcal clumping test as described elsewhere (22Hawiger J. Niewiarowski S. Gurewich V. Thomas D.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1970; 75: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus sp. aureus ATCC 25904) that express clumping factor were grown and processed to prepare a standardized smooth bacterial suspension for determining a clumping titer in serum samples. The clumping titer was expressed as a reciprocal of the highest dilution of tested serum giving a positive clumping reaction. PAI-1 total antigen in plasma was measured by an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Innovations, Inc., Southfield, MI).Histology Analyses—Organ samples (liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and heart) were collected from mice showing typical signs of acute toxicity shortly before death or from surviving mice that were euthanized after 72 h or at the indicated times. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff and hematoxylin to assess injury and hemorrhage. Apoptosis of the liver was evaluated by characteristic cytologic changes and by TdT-dependent dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay using the Apop Tag reagent (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical Analysis—All experimental data except survival were expressed as the mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance, a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance, and Student's t test were used to determine the significance of the difference. A log rank test was used for analysis of survival.RESULTSIn Vivo System for Studying Apoptosis in the Liver—Mice challenged with a high dose of LPS (40 mg/kg) do not manifest hepatocyte apoptosis despite excessive production of TNFα (18Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This tolerance of hepatocytes to TNFα can be dramatically lowered by administering LPS (50 μg/kg) in combination with d-Gal (10Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Reutter W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 23Freudenberg M.A. Keppler D. Galanos C. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 891-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lehmann V. Freudenberg M.A. Galanos C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), which leads to massive liver apoptosis. This striking shift in LPS toxicity led us to explore the mechanism of LPS action on the apoptotic process in sensitized mice. As shown in Fig. 1A, sequential analysis of liver apoptosis, manifest by DNA fragmentation detected by TUNEL assay and chromatin condensation, indicates the lack of major changes until 4 to 6 h after the administration of LPS and d-Gal. Concomitant with massive apoptosis, the livers displayed hemorrhagic necrosis at 6 h, an apparent consequence of a break-down of endothelial integrity. This form of microvascular injury is presumably responsible for platelet thrombi as shown in Fig. 1B. Thus, the development of massive apoptosis of the liver is accompanied by hemorrhagic necrosis, a consequence of microvascular injury. The lack of DNA fragmentation and a paucity of other detectable changes in liver architecture during the first 4 h raise a series of questions about the dynamics of liver apoptosis induced by LPS. First, is this process regulated by nuclear import of SRTFs? Second, would blockade of nuclear import result in (a) cytoprotection against the leakage of liver enzymes, (b) suppression of initiator and effector caspases, (c) maintenance of the balance between the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes, and (d) prevention of hemorrhagic necrosis? To address these mechanistic questions, we performed time course studies and monitored markers of inflammation, hepatocyte dysfunction, apoptosis, and microvascular injury.LPS-induced Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and Chemokines in Murine Macrophages Depends on Nuclear Import of SRTFs—Macrophages comprise an estimated 20–40% of the liver cells in rats and mice and display TLR4, a receptor for LPS (23Freudenberg M.A. Keppler D. Galanos C. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 891-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Song Y. Shi Y. Ao L.H. Harken A.H. Meng X.Z. World J.

In response to TLR4-generated signals, NFκB and other SRTFs are deployed to the nucleus, where they regulate a myriad of genes encoding mediators of inflammation and apoptosis (15Hawiger J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 99-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cell-permeant nuclear import inhibitor, cSN50 peptide, was developed by us to suppress the deployment of SRTFs in the nucleus (18Liu X.Y.

This bipartite inhibitor contains a membrane-translocating motif, which allows rapid penetration of cell membrane, and a “cargo” comprised of a cyclized nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that enables this peptide to competitively inhibit cytoplasmic/nuclear import of NLS-containing SRTFs. To validate the dependence of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines/chemokines production on nuclear import of SRTFs, we evaluated the potency of cSN50 peptide as compared with its mutated analog, SM peptide, in cultured murine macrophage RAW cells stimulated with LPS. As shown in Fig. 2, the cSN50 peptide in a range of concentrations from 5 to 50 μm significantly inhibited LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines TNFα (p < 0.0001), IL-6 (p < 0.0001), IL-1β (p < 0.0001), and chemokine MCP-1 (p < 0.0001). In contrast, the cell-permeant SM peptide that contains mutated NLS as cargo was without effect on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression, attesting to the specificity of a nuclear import inhibitory sequence. Importantly, these two peptides, cSN50 and SM, did not affect the viability of LPS-stimulated RAW macrophages (>80% under these experimental conditions). These results extend our previous findings of inhibition of SRTF nuclear import in LPS-stimulated macrophages (18Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

Supernatant samples from the medium were collected after 6 h of culture and analyzed by ELISA for levels of cytokines TNFα (A), IL-6 (B), and IL-1β (C) or by Cytometric Bead Array for chemokine MCP-1 (D). Error bars in panels A–D indicate the ± S.E. of the mean value from three independent experiments. p values represent the significance of difference between the SM peptide and cSN50 peptide-treated groups (two-way ANOVA) as well as the cytokine level with or without cSN50 peptide (one-way ANOVA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Time Course of Inflammatory Cytokines and Chemokine Expression—We serially monitored the levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in blood to investigate the sequence of events preceding massive apoptosis of the liver, which was not fully apparent until 6 h after administration of LPS and d-Gal (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3, TNFα levels rose very rapidly in the circulation, reaching a peak in plasma at 1 h. Bursts of IL-6 and chemokine MCP-1 at 2 h followed a very early rise in TNFα. On the other hand IL-1β showed a more progressive rise in systemic levels. Administration of LPS alone induced similar response of inflammatory cytokines and chemokine, but d-Gal alone did not have a detectable effect on inflammatory cytokines and chemokine production in vivo (data not shown), thereby confirming the requirement for LPS to induce an inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response. This response was suppressed significantly by the cSN50 peptide, affirming the dependence of the in vivo production of inflammatory mediators on the nuclear import of SRTFs.Fig. 3Time-dependent expression of inflammatory cytokines and a chemokine in control and cSN50 peptide-treated mice. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were treated with cSN50 peptide (0.7 mg in 200 μl of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or diluent (200 μl) in 7 intraperitoneal injections before (30 min) and after (30, 90, 150, and 210 min and 6 and 12 h) intraperitoneal administration of LPS with d-Gal. Blood plasma levels of cytokines TNFα (A), IL-6 (B), IL-1β (C), and chemokine MCP-1 (D) were measured in diluent controls (circles) and cSN50 peptide-treated animals (triangles) over the 6-h time period after LPS/d-Gal challenge.

https://openalex.org/W1988009064,"We have previously demonstrated that vasopressin increases the water permeability of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) by inducing trafficking of aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane and that this response is dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization and calmodulin activation. Here, we address the hypothesis that this water permeability response is mediated in part through activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and regulation of non-muscle myosin II. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of MLCK, the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC), and the IIA and IIB isoforms of the non-muscle myosin heavy chain in rat IMCD cells. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identified two isoforms of MLC, both of which also exist in phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. <sup>32</sup>P incubation of the inner medulla followed by autoradiography of two-dimensional gels demonstrated increased <sup>32</sup>P labeling of both isoforms in response to the V<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist [deamino-Cys<sup>1</sup>,d-Arg<sup>8</sup>]vasopressin (DDAVP). Time course studies of MLC phosphorylation in IMCD suspensions (using immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MLC antibodies) showed that the increase in phosphorylation could be detected as early as 30 s after exposure to vasopressin. The MLCK inhibitor ML-7 blocked the DDAVP-induced MLC phosphorylation and substantially reduced [Arg<sup>8</sup>]vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated water permeability. AVP-induced MLC phosphorylation was associated with a rearrangement of actin filaments (Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin) in primary cultures of IMCD cells. These results demonstrate that MLC phosphorylation by MLCK represents a downstream effect of AVP-activated calcium/calmodulin signaling in IMCD cells and point to a role for non-muscle myosin II in regulation of water permeability by vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W1990839004,"Caveolae-mediated endocytosis in endothelial cells is stimulated by the binding of albumin to gp60, a specific albumin-binding protein localized in caveolae. The activation of gp60 induces its cell surface clustering and association with caveolin-1, the caveolar-scaffolding protein. This interaction leads to Gi-induced Src kinase activation, which in turn signals dynamin-2-mediated fission and directed migration of caveolae-derived vesicles from apical to basal membrane. In this study, we investigated the possible role of the Gβγ heterodimer in signaling Gi-induced Src activation and subsequent caveolae-mediated endocytosis. We observed using rat lung microvascular endothelial cells that expression of the C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (ct-βARK), an inhibitor Gβγ signaling, prevented gp60-dependent Src activation as well as caveolae-mediated endocytosis and transcellular transport of albumin and uptake of cholera toxin subunit B, a specific marker of caveolae internalization. Expression of ct-βARK also prevented Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and dynamin-2 and the resultant phosphorylation-dependent association of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1. Also, the direct activation of Gβγ using a specific cell-permeant activating peptide (myristoylated-SIRKALNILGYPDYD) simulated the effects of gp60 in inducing Src activation, caveolin-1, and dynamin-2 phosphorylation as well as caveolae-mediated endocytosis of cholera toxin subunit B. The myristoylated-SIRKALNILGYPDYD peptide-induced responses were inhibited by the expression of ct-βARK.

Plasma albumin functions as a carrier protein in delivering the bound fatty acids, hormones, and drugs across the capillary wall.

Another important characteristic of the endothelial vesicular transport pathway is that, although gp60 activation triggers the transport of the receptor-bound albumin, the bulk of albumin carried in caveolae is in the fluid phase (9John T.A.

Albumin binding studies showed that specific binding sites for albumin on the endothelial cell surface are occupied at physiologic plasma albumin concentration (9John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C.

Herein, we demonstrate that Gβγ signals Src kinase activation in endothelial cells and the subsequent release of caveolae from the plasma membrane, thereby inducing the transcytosis of albumin. Cell Culture and Adenoviral Infection—Rat lung microvessel endothelial cells (RLMVECs) were grown on tissue culture-treated culture dishes (Corning). For transcytosis experiments (i.e. transcellular permeability assay), cells were grown on Transwell filter inserts with polypropylene membranes (12-mm diameter, 1-cm2 growth area, 0.4-μm pore size, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA), and for confocal imaging experiments, cells were grown on number 1.5 glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (9John T.A.

Reagents—All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Hanks' balanced salt solution containing NaHCO3 (4.2 mm) and HEPES (10 mm) was adjusted to pH 7.4. PP2 and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V, 99% pure, endotoxin-free, cold alcohol-precipitated) was dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution.

Monolayers of RLMVEC were serum-deprived for 12 h to which 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μm mSIRK or L9A-mSIRK was added for 0–5 min at 37 °C. Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.2% Me2SO was used as vehicle control for the 10 μm dose. Antibodies and Fluorescent Probes—The antibodies (Abs) and fluorescent probes used in these studies were obtained from the following sources. Monoclonal Abs for dynamin-2, caveolin-1, and PY20 were from Transduction Laboratories. pY416-Src, 42/44, and p42/44 polyclonal Abs were from Cell Signaling. α-Tubulin monoclonal Ab was from Sigma. c-Src polyclonal Ab, βARK1 (GRK2) polyclonal Ab, myc monoclonal Ab, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 and Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated albumin or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) were from Molecular Probes. Anti-gp60 Ab was generated as described previously (37Tiruppathi C. Finnegan A. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, lysates were prepared as previously described (7Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, the lysates were incubated with 1–10 μg/ml primary antibodies for 4 h at 4°C followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (7Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Malik A.B. J.

Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Confluent RLMEVCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 12 h in serum-free medium, and incubated with Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated albumin or CTB in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with pH 2.5 buffer (0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl) to remove non-internalized/membrane-associated albumin. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with βARK1 Ab (1 μg/ml) or gp60 Ab (4 μg/ml) and the nuclear marker, DAPI (1 μg/ml), as previously described (7Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C.

A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used for confocal microscopy with 488- and 543-nm excitation laser lines. Non-confocal DAPI images were acquired using Hg lamp excitation and UV filter set. Fluorescence emission was detected in optical sections <1 μm in thickness (pinhole set to achieve 1 Airy unit) separately for each fluorophore using a multi-track 4-frame average configuration. Cellular fluorescence intensity (per pixel average) in the acquired confocal images was determined using Zeiss LSM 510 META software.

Tracer 125I-albumin transport in the presence of 100 mg/ml unlabeled albumin was subtracted from 125I-albumin transport in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml unlabeled albumin (9John T.A. Vogel S.M.

Tracer albumin permeability in the presence of a 1000-fold excess unlabeled albumin thought to represent the “leakiness” of the monolayer (9John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D.

Thus, this transendothelial permeability assay quantifies receptor-mediated and receptor-associated fluid phase albumin transport through the vesicular pathway (9John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C.

To determine whether Gβγ is upstream of Src in this signaling pathway, we investigated whether endothelial cell expression of ct-βARK1, the carboxyl-terminal 194 amino acids of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 that sequesters Gβγ and thereby prevents activation of its downstream effectors (45Drazner M.H. Peppel K.C. Dyer S. Grant A.O. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), interferes with gp60-activated phosphorylation of Src, dynamin-2, and caveolin-1. Confluent monolayers of RLMVEC were infected with Adv-EV, type 5, or Adv-ct-βARK. Cells were infected for 48 h, the last 12 h of which serum was withdrawn from the cells. Fig. 1A shows the expression of ct-βARK at a molecular mass of 28–30 kDa by βARK1 Western blot, whereas this band was not present in EV-infected cells. Endogenous βARK1 (molecular mass of 80 kDa) shown in Fig. 1A, top panel, did not change in cells infected with Adv-ct-βARK. As shown in Fig. 1B, ct-βARK inhibited gp60 activation-dependent phosphorylation of Src (pY416-Src immunoblot), caveolin-1 (pY14-caveolin-1 immunoblot), and dynamin-2 (PY20 immunoblot after dynamin-2 immunoprecipitation). In other experiments, we examined the effects of inhibition of dynamin-2 phosphorylation by ct-βARK on the association between dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 (as assessed by a co-immunoprecipitation study) because dynamin-2 phosphorylation has been shown to facilitate this interaction (12Shajahan A.N.

As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, the infection of cells with Adv-ct-βARK prevented phosphorylation-dependent association of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation with dynamin-2 Ab (Fig. 1C) or caveolin-1 Ab (Fig. 1D). In a control experiment, we showed (as evident from confocal images shown in Fig. 1E) that ct-βARK expression did not affect the pattern or intensity of anti-gp60 Ab immunostaining (top panels), indicating that a change in gp60 expression could not account for the differences noted. βARK1 Ab immunostaining was prominent in greater than 90% RLMVECs infected with Adv-ct-βARK (bottom right panel), whereas endogenous βARK1 expression (bottom left panel; see also Fig. 2A) was weakly detected at the same amplifier gain and offset settings used for non-saturated fluorescence detection of the overexpressed ct-βARK (βARK1 Ab is directed against the C terminus of βARK1 and thus is able to recognize the expressed ct-βARK and endogenous βARK1 (Fig. 2A)).

https://openalex.org/W1965394044,"Human neutrophil granulocytes die rapidly, and their survival is contingent upon rescue from programmed cell death by signals from the environment. We now show that a novel signal for delaying neutrophil apoptosis is unmethylated CpG motifs prevalent in bacterial DNA (CpG- DNA). Human neutrophils express toll-like receptor 9 that recognizes these motifs. CpG-DNA, but not mammalian DNA or methylated bacterial DNA, markedly enhanced neutrophil viability by delaying spontaneous apoptosis. Endosomal maturation of CpG-DNA is prerequisite for these actions and was coupled to concurrent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways, leading to phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 and Ser136, respectively, and to prevention of decreases in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of either ERK or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase partially reversed these actions of CpG-DNA; however, they did not produce additive inhibition. Furthermore, intravenous injection of CpG-DNA (200 microg/kg) into rats evoked slight decreases in blood pressure and induced a modest leukocytosis, whereas it effectively suppressed neutrophil apoptosis as assayed ex vivo. Our results indicate that unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA promote neutrophil survival by suppressing the apoptotic machinery and may therefore contribute to prolongation and amplification of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2123365887,"The sinusoidal endothelia of liver, spleen, and lymph node are major sites for uptake and recycling of waste macromolecules through promiscuous binding to a disparate family of scavenger receptors. Among the most complex is stabilin-1, a large multidomain protein containing tandem fasciclin domains, epidermal growth factor-like repeats, and a C-type lectin-like hyaluronan-binding Link module, which functions as an endocytic receptor for acetylated low density lipoprotein and advanced glycation end products. Intriguingly, stabilin-1 has also been reported to mediate both homing of leukocytes across lymph node high endothelial venules and adhesion of metastatic tumor cells to peritumoral lymphatic vessels. Currently, however, it is not clear how stabilin-1 mediates these distinct functions. To address the issue, we have investigated the tissue and subcellular localization of stabilin-1 in detail and assessed the functional status of its Link module. We show that stabilin-1 is almost entirely intracellular in lymph node high endothelial venules, lymphatic sinus endothelium, and cultured endothelial cells but that a finite population, detectable only by fluorescent antibody or fluorescein-labeled (Fl)-acetylated low density lipoprotein uptake, cycles rapidly between the plasma membrane and EEA-1+ve (early endosome antigen 1) early endosomes. In addition, we show using full-length stabilin-1 cDNA and a stabilin-1/CD44 chimera in HeLa cells that intracellular targeting is influenced by the transmembrane domain/cytoplasmic tail, which contains a putative dileucine (DXXLL) Golgi to endosomal sorting signal. Finally, we provide evidence that the stabilin-1 Link domain binds neither hyaluronan nor other glycosaminoglycans.

Nevertheless, its function appears to be significantly different. For example, there is no clear evidence for the involvement of stabilin-1 in HA binding or uptake (7Politz O. Gratchev A. McCourt P.A.G. Schledzewski K. Guillot P. Johansson S. Svineng G. Frankes P. Kannicht C. Kzhyshkowska J. Longate P. Velten F.W. Johansson S. Goerdt S. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), although the receptor does appear to mediate uptake of acetylated LDL, whole bacteria, and advanced glycation end products (8Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34264-34270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, some earlier reports have indicated that stabilin-1 (unlike stabilin-2) may be concentrated in intracellular vesicles rather than present at the cell surface (7Politz O. Gratchev A. McCourt P.A.G. Schledzewski K. Guillot P. Johansson S. Svineng G. Frankes P. Kannicht C. Kzhyshkowska J. Longate P. Velten F.W. Johansson S. Goerdt S. Biochem.

Therefore, the ligand-binding specificity of stabilin-1 and its subcellular localization are unclear. Recently, an intriguing paper by Irjala et al. (19Irjala H. Elima K. Johansson E.-L. Merinen M. Kontula K. Alanen K. Grenman R. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) has reported a new and potentially exciting role for stabilin-1 (termed CLEVER-1 (common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor-1)) as a homing receptor that mediates the adhesion of leukocytes to lymph node post-capillary venules (HEVs) and lymph node sinuses (19Irjala H. Elima K. Johansson E.-L. Merinen M. Kontula K. Alanen K. Grenman R. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These workers have also reported the expression of stabilin-1 in lymphatic vessel endothelium and presented evidence for its involvement in adhesion of metastatic tumor cells to intratumoral vessels (19Irjala H. Elima K. Johansson E.-L. Merinen M. Kontula K. Alanen K. Grenman R. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Irjala H. Alanen K. Grenman R. Heikkilä P. Joensuu H. Jalkanen S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4671-4676PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, these potential functions are rather analogous to those of the HA receptor CD44, which mediates the homing and transmigration of leukocytes at inflamed vascular endothelium (21Stoop R.

To study these aspects of stabilin-1 biology in more detail, we embarked on a careful investigation of its subcellular localization in lymph node sinus/HEV and isolated lymphatic endothelial cells and the functional status of its putative HA-binding link module. Our findings revealed a predominantly intracellular localization for stabilin-1 in each cell type and are more consistent with a role as a rapidly recycling scavenger receptor than as an adhesion/homing receptor. Cells, Antibodies, Plasmids, and Reagents—The transformed human primary embryonal kidney cell line 293T was obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cell Bank (Clare Hall, London, United Kingdom). Primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) isolated using CD31 as marker were kindly provided by Dr. David Adams (Liver and Hepatobiliary Unit, University of Birmingham) and grown in human endothelium SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human serum and 10 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 10 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), both from R&D systems. HeLa cells were from the Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit Cell Bank (Oxford, United Kingdom). Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were derived from human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (purchased from PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) essentially as described by Nisato et al. (24Nisato R.E. Harrison J.A. Buser R. Orci L. Rinsch C. Montesano R. Dupraz P. Pepper M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were from Totem Biologicals. The eukaryotic expression vectors pRcCMV and pGFP-N3 were from Invitrogen and Clontech, respectively. The pCDM7Ig vector for soluble IgG fusion protein expression was kindly provided by Dr. Alejandro Aruffo (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Seattle, WA). Mouse anti-human EEA-1 was from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-human CD63 (clone H5C6) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, and sheep anti-human TGN46 was from Serotec. Mouse anti-human protein-disulfide isomerase was kindly donated by Dr. Rick Thorne (London, United Kingdom). Anti-CLEVER-1 (mAb 3-372) was kindly donated by Dr. Sirpa Jalkanen (Turku, Finland). Rat anti-peripheral lymph node addressin (clone MECA79) and rat anti-mouse or human CD44 (clone IM7) were from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-human LYVE-1 antibody was generated against a soluble fusion protein of the LYVE-1 extracellular domain and human IgG Fc domain (25Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) and purified from hybridoma culture supernatants (details of this mAb will be described elsewhere). 2R. Prevo and D. G. Jackson, manuscript in preparation. Mouse anti-human CD31, clone JC/70A, and peroxidase-conjugated avidin were from DAKO. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG was from Pierce. FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM was from Southern Biotechnologies. Alexa 488-, Alexa 568-, and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig or goat anti-mouse Ig as well as the Alexa 488-conjugated acetylated LDL were from Molecular Probes. R-phycoerythrin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig was from Sigma. High molecular weight hyaluronan (Hylumed Medical) was from Genzyme. Cloning and Expression of Full-length Stabilin-1—Full-length stabilin-1 was cloned by combining two overlapping cDNAs. The first, HD-PLM44, supplied by Human Genome Sciences contained the full coding sequence but was interrupted by a premature stop codon at position nucleotide 4911. The second, KIAA0246 (GenBank™ accession number D87433), supplied by the Kazusa organization in Japan, lacked the first 1030 bp from the 5′ end but contained an uninterrupted reading frame as far as the C terminus. To obtain a full-length cDNA, the 5′ end of HDPLM44 was combined with the 3′ end of KIAA0246 through a mutual NdeI site (position 4713 in HDPLM44). The HDPLM44 clone in the pCMVSport plasmid was digested with SalI and NdeI to yield a 4713-bp fragment containing the 5′ end. The pBlueScript vector containing KIAA0246 was also digested with SalI and NdeI removing the 5′ end of the KIAA0246 insert (>3589 bp). The 5′ fragment from HDPLM44 was subsequently ligated into this same vector yielding full-length stabilin-1 containing the native N-terminal leader and a full uninterrupted reading frame. The full-length stabilin-1 in pBlueScript was then subcloned using SalI-NotI into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N3, deleting the enhanced green fluorescent protein coding insert from vector pEGFP-N3. Cloning and Expression of a CD44-Stabilin-1 Chimera—The extracellular domain of human CD44H (Met1-Ile266) was fused to the predicted transmembrane (TM) domain and cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-1 (Ala2467-Lys2570) through a SalI site. The stabilin-1 TM and cytoplasmic tail were amplified by PCR from stabilin-1 HDPLM44 cDNA in pCMVSport (supplied by Human Genome Sciences) using Pfu polymerase and 7453F Sal (5′-CGCGCGTCGACGCAGTGCTGGCGCCTGAAGC-3′) as the forward primer and T7F (5′-AGCCTGGAGCTTTTCTGGCTAAC-3′) as the reverse primer. The restriction sites in each case are underlined. The PCR product was purified and digested with SalI and NotI. The CD44 extracellular domain was amplified by PCR from CD44H in pRcCMV (26Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) using the T7F and CD44 798R Sal primers (5′-CGCGCGTCGACAATTTGGGGTGTCCTTATAGGAC-3′). The CD44 PCR product was purified and digested with HindIII, which cuts 155 bp upstream of the ATG start codon, and SalI. The CD44 and stabilin-1 inserts were cloned through a three-way ligation into a HindIII NotI-digested pRcCMV vector. Cloning and Expression of Stabilin-1 Link Module and Seventh Fasciclin Domain (Stabilin-1 Link Fc)—A protein comprising amino acids 2191–2473 of stabilin-1 (spanning the Link domain and seventh fasciclin domain) fused to the C terminus of human IgG1 Fc was generated by PCR amplification of a 849-bp fragment from stabilin-1 (position Cys2191 through Ala2473) using the primers 6624F Asp (5′-CATGCTGGTACCCTGCCACTCAGATGCCATGTGC-3′) and 7472R Bam (5′-GGTCGGGATCCGCTTCAGGCGCCAGCACTG-3′) cloned into the Asp718/BamH1 sites of pCDM7Ig. After expression in 293T fibroblasts and purification by protein A affinity chromatography (27Prevo R. Banerji S. Ferguson D. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19420-19430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the fusion protein was used for HA-binding assays as described below. (A) Stabilin-1 Link Module (Anti-stabilin-1 LINK)—An immunogen comprising the stabilin-1 Link module alone (residues Gly2208-Val2305) was generated by PCR amplification of a 293-bp fragment from stabilin-1 cDNA using the primers 6676F Nco (5′-GGATGGCCATGGGCGTTTTCCACCTCCAGGCC-3′) and 6969R Bam (5′-GGTCGGGATCCTCACACATCTTGCACACGGAAGCAG-3′) and cloned into the NcoI/BamH1 sites of pET19b. Production of the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli BL21DE3pLysS and purification was performed as described previously (28Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The purified immunogen was injected into New Zealand White rabbits. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using immobilized immunogen and LYVE-1 Fc protein (25Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) as negative control. (B) Fasciclin Domains 3–4 (Anti-stabilin Fasc3–4)—An immunogen comprising the third and fourth Fasciclin domains of stabilin-1 (Glu994-Gly1256) fused to human IgG Fc was generated by PCR amplification using the primers 3033F Asp (5′-CGACGAGGTACCGGAGCTGGAGGCAAATGCCCAC-3′) and 3891R Bam (5′-GGTCGGGATCCCCCACCGTCAGGACCCCCG-3′) and cloned into the Asp718/BamHI site of pCDM7Ig vector. The Fc fusion protein was produced in 293T cells as described previously (27Prevo R. Banerji S. Ferguson D. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19420-19430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Injection into rabbits and determination of antibody specificity was the same as described in A. (C) Stabilin-1 Cytoplasmic Tail (Anti-stabilin-1 CT)—The synthetic peptide-(CEEDFPDTQRILTVK) encompassing the last 14 residues from the cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-1 preceded by a cysteine residue was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the Imject maleimide-activated immunogen conjugation kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized as described in A. The same peptide conjugated to ovalbumin was immobilized on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates to assess reactivity. An irrelevant peptide conjugated to ovalbumin was used as a negative control. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Human 293T cells stably expressing LYVE-1 (transfected using Lipofectin from Invitrogen) were transiently transfected with stabilin-1 using calcium phosphate precipitation and subjected to cell surface biotinylation with or without prior permeabilization in 2 mg/ml saponin in PBS (10 min at room temperature). Cells were biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. EZ-Link sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were subsequently washed three times with PBS to remove any remaining biotinylation reagent. Cells (8.8 × 106 cells in 1 ml) were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS in PBS). Stabilin-1 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-stabilin-1 C terminus and protein A, and LYVE-1 was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-human LYVE-1 and protein G as described previously (26Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). After Western blotting, membranes were stained with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (DAKO) and developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For analysis of stabilin-1 in primary LSECs, cells were lifted in PBS, 5mm EDTA and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates equivalent to 1.5 × 105 cells/lane were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel). For analysis in whole liver (kindly provided by Dr. David Adams), tissue (4 mm3) was first solubilized in 200 μl of sample buffer and 10 μl of samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-stabilin-1 LINK (5 μg/ml). Hypotonic Lysis and Crude Cell Fractionation—Transient calcium phosphate stabilin-1-transfected 293T fibroblasts or primary LSECs were lifted in PBS, 5 mm EDTA and pelleted by brief centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors, Roche Applied Science), and membranes were ruptured by three cycles of freeze-thawing. The membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was concentrated 10 × to 50 μl using an Amicon Microcon concentrator (10-kDa cutoff, Millipore) before the addition of 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE (equivalent to 3 × 105 cells/lane for 293T cells or 4 × 105 for LSEC) and Western blotting. Immunofluorescent Antibody Staining of Cells—Human 293T cells stably expressing LYVE-1 or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with full-length stabilin-1 using calcium phosphate precipitation (293T only) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells grown in 8-well chamber slides were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature) and permeabilized with 2 mg/ml saponin in PBS, pH 7.5, containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 5% (v/v) goat serum (30 min at room temperature). Wells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (stabilin-1 CT (1/400), stabilin-1 LINK (5 μg/ml), anti-Fasc3–4 (1/100), monoclonal anti-human LYVE-1 (10 μg/ml), anti-CD44 (IM7; 10 μg/ml), EEA-1 (1/100), or anti-human CD31 (1/20)) followed by Alexa 488-, Alexa 594-, or Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (1/500) as appropriate. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with argon and green helium/neon lasers and analyzed using LaserSharp2000 software. All of the images were taken in sequential scanning mode. LSECs, LECs, and HUVECs were grown on collagen-coated 8-well chamber slides, fixed and permeabilized as above, and stained with mouse anti-human CD31 (1/20) and anti-stabilin-1 CT (1/200). Slides were mounted in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination. To assess the subcellular localization of the CD44-stabilin-1 chimera, HeLa cells were transfected with the CD44-stabilin-1 chimera using FuGENE 6. The following day, cells were lifted, transferred to 8-well chamber slides, and stained the next day. Cells were fixed and permeabilized in ice-cold (-20 °C) methanol for 5 min on ice and subsequently blocked with PBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 5% (v/v) goat serum and stained and viewed as described above. For the flow cytometry of LECs, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with mouse anti-human CD31 or anti-stabilin-1 (CLEVER-1 mAb 3-372) diluted in PBS, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 0.1% (w/v) azide followed by R-phycoerythrin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig. Internalization of Acetylated LDL, Antibody, and Fluorescein-labeled HA—HeLa or 293T cells transiently transfected with full-length stabilin-1 were grown in 8-well chamber slides. Cells were washed with prewarmed culture medium and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated acetylated LDL (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes), anti-stabilin-1 (3 μg/ml, CLEVER-1 mAb 3-372), or fluorescein-labeled HA (Fl-HA, 6 μg/ml) (prepared as described previously (29de Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydrate Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) at 37 °C for different time periods, washed in PBS, fixed and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol, and stained with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig or stained with anti-stabilin-1 CT (1/500) followed by Alexa 59"
https://openalex.org/W2104092642,"Currently, only limited insight into mechanisms promoting the differentiation and specification of the mammalian cardiac conduction system is available. Therefore, we established a murine embryonic stem (ES) cell line stably expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the transcriptional control of the human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) promoter to further characterize the development of very early stages of the mammalian cardiac conduction tissue. The cardiac nature of ANP-EGFP positive cells was confirmed by immunostaining. In ANP-EGFP expressing ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes, a distinct sublineage of pacemaker cells could be identified. Pacemaker cells displayed a spindle shape and exhibited a higher spontaneous beating rate, faster If current activation and larger If current densities compared with triangular atrial-like cardiocytes. Exposure to endothelin-1 significantly increased the percentage of pacemaker-like cells without affecting their electrophysiological properties. These findings were corroborated by immunostaining with antibodies against connexin 40 and connexin 45, known markers for cardiac conduction tissue. Conversely, treatment of ANP-EGFP expressing ES cells with neuregulin-1 exhibited no effect on differentiation. These results indicate that ANP-EGFP expression enables the identification of ES cell-derived pacemaker cells by their fluorescence and morphology and that endothelin-1 promotes the development of ANP-EGFP positive cardiomyocytes to a pacemaker-like phenotype."

Vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptor cells are highly polarized neurons that consist of morphologically and functionally distinct cellular compartments. Light-sensitive outer segments are linked via a non-motile connecting cilium with inner segments that contain the organelles typical for the metabolism of eukaryotic cells (see Fig. 6A). The outer segments are characterized by specialized disklike membranes where one of the best studied examples of a G-protein transduction cascade is arranged (1Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T. Stavenga D.G.

This releases the α-subunit of transducin (Gtα), which in turn activates a phosphodiesterase, catalyzing cGMP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm and closure of cGMP-gated channels localized in the plasma membrane (2Okada T.

The closure of these channels leads to a drop of the circulating cationic current, resulting in the hyperpolarization of the cell membrane (4Molday R.S. Kaupp U.B. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J.

The recovery phase of the enzymatic machinery of visual transduction and rapid light adaptation of photoreceptor cells (time scale of subseconds) rely on a feedback mechanism. This depends on changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i, affecting the phototransduction cascade through Ca2+-binding proteins (5Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, massive bidirectional translocation of transduction cascade components between the functional compartments of photoreceptor cells can also contribute to a much slower adaptation of rod photoreceptor cells (6Sokolov M.

Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The G-protein subunits return to the outer segments in the dark in a more leisurely time course of hours. In contrast, arrestin translocates under these light conditions in an exactly reciprocal way (8Philp N.J. Chang W. Long K.

Since any intracellular exchange between the inner and outer segmental compartments of photoreceptor cells should occur through the slender non-motile connecting cilium (13Besharse J.C. Horst C.J. Bloodgood R.A. Ciliary and Flagellar Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 389-417Crossref Google Scholar), this represents a suitable domain for potential regulation of intersegmental molecular exchange (14Wolfrum U. Salisbury J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our initial studies revealed that transducin is translocated through the photoreceptor connecting cilium and further indicated that the Ca2+-induced assembly of a protein-protein complex of the G-protein transducin and the cytoskeletal protein centrin 1 regulates ciliary G-protein translocation (12Giessl A.

The assembly of this centrin 1-G-protein complex strictly depends on Ca2+ and is mediated by the Gtβγ complex.Centrin 1 is a member of the centrin protein family, a subfamily of the parvalbumin superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins (17Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 18Schiebel E. Bornens M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Centrins were first described in unicellular green algae where they form filamentous structures that contract in response to an increase of [Ca2+]i (17Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin.

As a consequence of the isoform diversity in the mammalian genome, the four mammalian centrins should exhibit differences in their subcellular localization as well as in their cellular function. Little is known about the specific subcellular localization of the different centrin isoforms in diverse cell types and tissues. Most studies on the localization of centrins in mammalian cells and tissues have been performed with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against green algae centrins that do not discriminate between the mammalian centrin isoforms. Using these antibodies, centrins were detected in the centrioles of centrosomes and in the pericentriolar matrix (28Salisbury J.L. Baron A.T. Sanders M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Baron A.T. Greenwood T.M. Salisbury J.L. Cell Motil.

In previous studies on the mammalian retina, centrins were localized in two basically distinct subcellular domains (12Giessl A. Trojan P. Pulvermüller A. Wolfrum U. Williams D.S. Cell Biology and Related Disease of the Outer Retina. World Scientific Publishing Company Pte. Ltd., Singapore2004: 195-222Google Scholar, 14Wolfrum U. Salisbury J.L. Exp.

As in other animal cells, centrins are components of centrosomes and basal bodies in retinal neurons but were also found to be present in the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells (14Wolfrum U. Salisbury J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol.

Although our recent studies provided evidence that isoform Cen1 is localized in the connecting cilium, a ciliary expression of other centrin isoforms remained elusive (16Wolfrum U. Giessl A. Pulvermüller A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 514: 155-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Here we show by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, size exclusion chromatography, and kinetic light-scattering experiments that all four centrin isoforms bind to the Gtβγ complex with different affinities. In the present study, we also demonstrated retinal expression of the four centrin isoforms. Furthermore we were able to show for the first time that the centrins are co-expressed in the same cell type, particularly in highly specialized photoreceptor cells. Nevertheless there they are localized in different subcellular domains. The localization of the centrin isoforms Cen1 to Cen3 in the photoreceptor connecting cilium suggests that these centrins can be part of the centrin-transducin complex. In contrast, the centriolar localization of centrin isoforms 2-4 indicates an additional function of these centrin isoforms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Tissue Preparation—All experiments described herein conform to the statement by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology as to the care and use of animals in research. Adult Sprague-Dawley albino rats and C57BL76 mice were maintained on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle with lights on at 6 a.m. with food and water ad libitum. After sacrifice of the animals in CO2, retinas were removed through a slit in the cornea prior to fixation and embedding for microscopy or further molecular biological and biochemical analysis. Bovine eyes were obtained from the local slaughter houses and were kept on ice in the dark until further processing.Antibodies—Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the α- and β-subunit of G-proteins were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and a second affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against the β-subunit of G-proteins (T-20) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody against centrin (clone 20H5) and a monoclonal antibody against HsCen2p (clone hCetn2.4) have been characterized previously (30Baron A.T. Greenwood T.M. Bazinet C.W. Salisbury J.L. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Hart P.E. Poynter G.M. Whitehead C.M. Orth J.D. Glantz J.N. Busby R.C. Barrett S.L. Salisbury J.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera from rabbit or goat against recombinantly expressed mouse centrins 1-4 (MmCen1 to MmCen4) were generated and affinity-purified on high trap N-hydroxysuccinimide columns (Amersham Biosciences).SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—For Western blots, isolated retinas or GST pull-down complexes were homogenized and placed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205874) Google Scholar) using 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with primary and secondary antibodies (32Wolfrum U. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1995; 32: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Recombinant Expression of Centrin Isoforms—Cloning of a mouse centrin 1 cDNA into the pGEX-4T3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) was described previously by Pulvermüller et al. (15Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mouse centrin 2, 3, and 4 cDNAs were cloned from reverse transcription (RT)-PCR products into the pGEX-4T3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Expression and purification of the GST fusion protein was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin on the column, centrin was eluted in 20 mm BTP (pH 7.5) containing 130 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2 and passed over a benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) column to remove thrombin.Membrane and Protein Preparations—Rod outer segments were prepared from frozen bovine retinas using a sucrose gradient procedure as described previously (35Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Hypotonically stripped disk membranes were prepared from rod outer segments by the Ficoll floating procedure similar to the procedure described previously (36Smith Jr., H.G. Stubbs G.W. Litman B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) except that 2% (w/v) Ficoll instead of 5% was used. This method yielded osmotically intact disk vesicles with a vesicle size >400 nm. Contamination by vesicle aggregates was removed by a 2-μm filter (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Membranes were either kept on ice and used within 4 days without any loss of activity or stored at -80 °C until use. Rhodopsin concentration was determined from its absorption spectrum using ϵ500 = 40,000 m-1 cm-1. Transducin (Gtholo) was isolated from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas according to Ref. 3Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. Subunits were further purified on Blue Sepharose (1 ml of HiTrap Blue, Amersham Biosciences) using a salt gradient (15Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Gtholo, Gtα, and Gtβγ concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (212995) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The amount of intact, activable Gtα was determined precisely by fluorometric titration with GTPγS (38Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).GST-Centrin Pull-down Assay—Bacteria expressing GST-centrin fusion proteins were resuspended in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.3)). Cells were lysed by lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and sonicated. Cleared lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of glutathione-S-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in a final volume of 500 μl. Sepharose beads with fusion proteins were washed with NETN buffer and buffer F (20 mm Na-Hepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 11 mm CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with retina extracts in buffer F for 2 h at 4 °C (final volume, 600 μl). Beads were washed three times with buffer F, and proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation for 20-30 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 15 mm glutathione and 11 mm CHAPS.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography is a very useful tool to determine protein-protein interaction (15Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Schröder K. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

To determine the binding of the centrins to transducin the molecular weight shift of the complex was used. 10 μg of each recombinant centrin isoform and 10 μg of Gtholo (or Gt subunits Gtα and Gtβγ) were incubated in 50 mm BTP (pH 7.0) containing 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and either 100 μm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA for 5 min at room temperature. As controls, all samples (MmCen1 to MmCen4, Gt, and Gt subunits) were incubated alone. The reaction mixtures were loaded on a Superose™ 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer using the Smart System (Amersham Biosciences; flow rate, 40 μl/min). Elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and 40-μl fractions were collected for the subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis.Kinetic Light Scattering—The gain or loss of membrane-bound protein mass can be readily measured by light-scattering changes using a setup described in detail in Heck et al. (40Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in 10-mm path cuvettes with 300-μl volumes in 50 mm BTP (pH 7.5) containing 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and either 100 μm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA at 20 °C (15Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reactions were triggered by flash photolysis of rhodopsin with a green (500 ± 20 nm) flash attenuated by appropriate neutral density filters. The flash intensity was quantified photometrically by the amount of rhodopsin bleached and expressed in the mole fraction of photoexcited rhodopsin (Rh*/Rh = 32%). The scattering signal is interpreted as a gain of protein mass bound to disk membranes and quantified as described previously (40Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Heck M. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Light-scattering binding signals were corrected by a reference signal (N-signal) measured on a sample without added Gtholo as described previously (42Pulvermüller A. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14082-14088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mouse and rat retinas using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples of purified total RNA were treated with DNase I (Sigma) for 15 min to remove genetic DNA. To stop the reaction the samples were treated for 15 min at 75 °C. Poly(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis (reverse transcriptase reaction) was performed using the Invitrogen cDNA Cycle™ kit and 5 μg of total RNA according to the directions. In control preparations, total RNA (DNase-treated or -untreated) was amplified by PCR without prior reverse transcriptase reactions using the MmCen1 primers. PCR was performed in a volume of 50 μl using 2.5 μl of prepared cDNA according to directions and 0.25 μg of each primer/reaction. Cycling conditions were 39 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min followed by a 10-min 72 °C extension. PCR product lengths were determined on 0.8% agarose gels. As DNA markers, a 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was used. Sequencing of PCR products was performed by Genterprise (Mainz, Germany). For sequence comparisons and oligonucleotide generation the computer program Omiga™ Version 2.0 (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, UK) was used.PCR Primers Used for RT-PCR and DNA Sequencing—Primers specific for mouse centrin isoforms were as follows: MmCen1 primers, the forward primer MmCen1-forw (5′-GTACGGATC CATGGCGTCCACCTTCAGGAAG-3′) and the reverse primer MmCen1-EF3,4-rev (5′-GCGGCTCGAGTTAATCTTTCTCGGCCATCTT-3′); MmCen2 primers, the forward primer MmCen2-EF1,2-forw (5′-GTACGGATCCACTAAAGAAGAAATCCTGAAA-3′) and the reverse primer MmCen2-rev (5′-GCGGCTCGAGTTACAGACAAGCTGTGACCGT-3′); MmCen3 primers: the forward primer MmCen3-forw (5′-GTACGGAT CCGAGAACTGTCTGAGGAACAGA-3′) and the reverse primer MmCen3-rev (5′-GCGG CTCGAGTATGTCACCAGTCATAATAGC-3′); MmCen4 primers, the forward MmCen4-Nterm-forw (5′-GTACGGATCCCAAGAAGTTCGGGAAGCCTTT-3′) and the reverse primer MmCen4-rev (5′-GCGGCTCGAGCTAATAAAGGCTGGTCTTCTT-3′).Peptide Preadsorption of pMmC Centrin Antibodies with Recombinant Expressed Centrins—To increase antibody specificity, the polyclonal antibodies pMmC1 to pMmC4 were preincubated with the appropriate recombinant centrin isoform proteins. For this purpose centrin isoform proteins were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated with the affinity-purified antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C in blocking solution (0.5% cold-water fish gelatin (Sigma) plus 0.1% ovalbumin (Sigma) in PBS). The following protein amounts were used: pMmC1: 200 μg of MmCen2, 350 μg of MmCen3, and 150 μg of MmCen4; pMmC2: 400 μg of MmCen1, 300 μg of MmCen3, and 200 μg of MmCen4; pMmC3: 100 μg of MmCen1 and 30 μg of MmCen4; pMmC4: 300 μg of MmCen1, 200 μg of MmCen2, and 400 μg of MmCen3. The supernatants containing the “preabsorbed” antibodies were subsequently used in Western blots or immunocytochemical experiments, respectively.Fluorescence Staining of Retinal Cryosections—Immunofluorescence studies were essentially performed as described previously (15Pulvermüller A.

Briefly eyes from adult mice were prefixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed, soaked with 30% sucrose in PBS overnight, and cryofixed in melting isopentane. Cryosections were placed on poly-l-lysine-precoated coverslips (44Wolfrum U. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 231-238Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Wolfrum U. Schmitt A. Cell Motil.

Specimens were incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and blocked with blocking solution (0.5% cold-water fish gelatin (Sigma) plus 0.1% ovalbumin (Sigma) in PBS). The sections were incubated with antibodies or, in the case of double labeling, with a mixture of antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The specimens were washed and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa® 488 or Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Washed sections were mounted in Mowiol 4.88 (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany) containing 2% n-propyl gallate and, in the case of triple staining, 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Mounted retinal sections were examined with a Leica DMRP microscope. Images were obtained with a Hamamatsu Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu City, Japan) and processed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).Immunoelectron Microscopy—After 12-h dark or light adaptation, respectively, isolated rat or mouse retinas were fixed, embedded in LR White resin, and further processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (45Wolfrum U. Schmitt A. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 2000; 46: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nanogold™ labeling (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY) was silver-enhanced according to Ref. 46Danscher G.

https://openalex.org/W2141472672,"Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a 140-amino acid presinaptic protein whose mutations A30P and A53T have been linked to familiar Parkinson's disease (PD). Many data suggest that alpha-syn aggregation is the key event that triggers alpha-syn-mediated neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, other lines of evidence proposed a protective role of alpha-syn against oxidative stress (a major feature of PD), even if the exact mechanism of this protective action and the role of the pathogenetic mutations to this respect have not been elucidated yet. To address these points, we developed an in vitro model of oxidative stress by exposing PC12 cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (150 microM) for 72 h, and we evaluated alpha-syn-mediated protection delivering increasing amounts of alpha-syn (wild type [WT] or mutated) inside cells using the fusion proteins TAT-alpha-syn (WT, A30P, and A53T). We found that nanomolar amounts of TAT-alpha-syn-mediated protected against oxidative stress and other cellular injuries (6-hydroxydopamine and serum deprivation), whereas micromolar amounts of the fusion proteins were intrinsically toxic to cells. The protective effect was independent from the presence of the mutations A30P and A53T, but no protection occurred when cells were challenged with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132. We verified that the protection mechanism required the presence of the C-terminal domain of alpha-syn, as nanomolar amounts of the C-terminal truncated fusion protein TAT-alpha-syn (WT[1-97]) failed in preventing H2O2 toxicity. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms at the basis of alpha-syn protection, we investigated the possible involvement of the chaperone protein HSP70 that is widely implicated in neuroprotection. We found that, at nanomolar concentrations, TAT-alpha-syn was able to increase HSP70 protein level, whereas at the micromolar scale, TAT-alpha-syn decreased HSP70 at the protein level. These effects on HSP70 were independent from the presence of alpha-syn pathogenetic mutations but required the alpha-syn C-terminal domain. The implications for alpha-syn-mediated neurotoxicity and for PD pathogenesis and progression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1982352462,"Mucus hypersecretion is a hallmark of asthma that contributes to airway obstruction. While the etiology is not well understood, hypersecretion has been linked to the presence of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 in the inflamed airway. The presence of adenosine has also been noted in asthmatic airways, and adenosine-mediated signaling in mast cells has been implicated in the severe bronchoconstriction and inflammation prevalent in these patients (1, 2). Here we examine the possibility that adenosine also contributes to mucus hypersecretion by airway epithelial cells. Results in cultured airway epithelial cells showed that MUC2 mucin expression increased in response to adenosine. This appeared to be mediated by a pathway initiated at the adenosine A1 receptor that transduced signals through a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel and EGFR. That this signaling cascade is relevant to asthmatic hypersecretion was indicated by results showing that mucin induction by asthmatic tracheal aspirates was reduced by A1, CLCA1, and EGFR inhibitors. These results suggest that adenosine cooperates with inflammatory cytokines to stimulate mucin production in the asthmatic airway and supports the use of A1, CLCA1, and EGFR inhibitors in the treatment of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1995989097,"Polyglutamine proteins that cause neurodegenerative disease are known to form proteinaceous aggregates, such as nuclear inclusions, in the neurons of affected patients. Although polyglutamine proteins have been shown to form fibrillar aggregates in a variety of contexts, the mechanisms underlying the aberrant conformational changes and aggregation are still not well understood. In this study, we have investigated the hypothesis that polyglutamine expansion in the protein ataxin-3 destabilizes the native protein, leading to the accumulation of a partially unfolded, aggregation-prone intermediate. To examine the relationship between polyglutamine length and native state stability, we produced and analyzed three ataxin-3 variants containing 15, 28, and 50 residues in their respective glutamine tracts. At pH 7.4 and 37 °C, Atax3(Q50), which lies within the pathological range, formed fibrils significantly faster than the other proteins. Somewhat surprisingly, we observed no difference in the acid-induced equilibrium and kinetic un/folding transitions of all three proteins, which indicates that the stability of the native conformation was not affected by polyglutamine tract extension. This has led us to reconsider the mechanisms and factors involved in ataxin-3 misfolding, and we have developed a new model for the aggregation process in which the pathways of un/folding and misfolding are distinct and separate. Furthermore, given that native state stability is unaffected by polyglutamine length, we consider the possible role and influence of other factors in the fibrillization of ataxin-3.

The polyglutamine diseases are now well established as a group of genetic neurodegenerative disorders arising from the expansion of a repeated glutamine tract in specific proteins (1Margolis R.L.

Each of the nine currently identified polyglutamine diseases is associated with a particular protein, with the manifestation of disease generally observed when the polyglutamine tract of the relevant protein is elongated to over a threshold of ∼40 residues. The protein ataxin-3, which has recently been associated with ubiquitin binding and deubiquitinating functions (3Chai Y. Berke S.S. Cohen R.E. Paulson H.L. J. Biol.

Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimmura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar), in which the polyglutamine tract of ataxin-3 is expanded to over 45 residues. 1A. Srivastava, personal communication.1A. Srivastava, personal communication. The different polyglutamine proteins share little or no structural or functional homology outside of the glutamine tract, yet fundamental similarities are consistently observed in the various disease states, with progressive dysfunction and death of neurons resulting in neurodegeneration and eventual death. The expanded polyglutamine tract is generally accepted to be the key causal element of the disease process, especially because increasingly longer polyglutamine proteins are associated with earlier onset and more severe manifestation of the disease state (2Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Another striking feature of polyglutamine diseases is the formation of aggregates such as nuclear inclusions (NIs), 2The abbreviations used are: NI, nuclear inclusion; Atax3, ataxin-3; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ThioT, thioflavin T.2The abbreviations used are: NI, nuclear inclusion; Atax3, ataxin-3; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ThioT, thioflavin T. which contain the expanded form of disease-associated protein, within the neurons of affected patients (8DiFiglia M.

The exact role and significance of NIs is as yet uncertain; however, they are inseparably associated with the manifestation of polyglutamine disease. The mechanisms of polyglutamine toxicity are still largely unelucidated; however, an increasing number of reports indicate that the polyglutamine disorders belong to a wider range of diseases that associated with protein misfolding, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and a range of amyloidoses (11Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 12Chow M.K. Lomas D.A. Bottomley S.P. Curr. Med.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 3362-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All of these disorders involve the formation and deposition of protein aggregates within diseased tissues and/or cells. One of the most commonly observed forms of such aggregates is that of amyloid plaques, or fibrils, which have a characteristic cross-β-sheet structure (15Dobson C.M. Sem. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In the case of polyglutamine diseases, the formation of NIs and the presence of proteasomal proteins in aggregates suggest that similar protein misfolding processes take place. In vivo, NIs display a range of morphologies, including granular, fibrillar, and amorphous forms (8DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N.

Recent work from our laboratory and others have shown that destabilization of the native state of nonpathological variants of ataxin-3 by various stresses such as chemical denaturation and heat can result in the formation of fibrillar aggregates (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Shehi E. Fusi P. Secundo F. Pozzuolo S. Bairati A. Tortora P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31554-31563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on various results, we and others have proposed that in the pathological state, the elongation of the polyglutamine tract disrupts the stability of the native conformation of the ataxin-3 (19Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that the loss of native state stability leads to the formation and accumulation of a partially unfolded, aggregation-prone species, resulting in fibrillization. This is supported by an earlier study showing that expansion of a polyglutamine tract inserted into myoglobin results in a progressive loss of conformational stability of the protein (22Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is also concordant with the generalized model of protein misfolding associated with a wider variety of conformational diseases (11Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 12Chow M.K. Lomas D.A. Bottomley S.P. Curr. Med.

Invest. 2002; 110: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although expanded polyglutamine proteins have been shown to form fibrillar aggregates much more rapidly than shorter length proteins (22Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Chen S. Berthelier V. Yang W. Wetzel R. J. Mol.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), to date, no study has examined the relative stabilities of variants ranging into the pathological length of ataxin-3 or any other polyglutamine protein. We have successfully produced milligram quantities of a pathological length variant, Atax3(Q50), which contains 50 glutamine repeats. This has allowed us to perform a comparative study with two other nonpathological variants, containing 15 and 28 residues in their polyglutamine tract (Atax3(Q15) and Atax3(Q28)) (see Fig. 1A). Building on previous results (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we have performed a comprehensive investigation into the effects of polyglutamine length on the conformational changes involved in folding, unfolding, and native state stability of ataxin-3. Interestingly, our results show that upon polyglutamine expansion, the unfolding and folding transitions of ataxin-3 are essentially unchanged, indicating that the hypothesized mechanism of native state destabilization upon polyglutamine expansion in fact does not apply to ataxin-3. This has led us to consider other alternative pathways, mechanisms, and factors that may be significant in the pathogenic processes of aggregation and fibrillization. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and thioflavin T (ThioT) were obtained from Sigma. The serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. 4,4′-Dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Atax3(Q15)—A construct encoding Atax3(Q15) was engineered by modification of the pQE30 Atax3(Q28) vector that had been created previously (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) from a vector encoding the MJD1a gene variant (7Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S. Kawakami H.

EcoN1 sites flanking the polyglutamine-encoding region were introduced using the QuikChange technique sites coupled with a cassette mutagenesis approach allowing for the manipulation of the length of the polyglutamine tract without introducing or substituting amino acids within the protein. The following oligonucleotides were used: N-terminal end of the polyglutamine-coding region, sense, 5′-gaagcctactttaggaaacagcagcag-3′, and antisense, 3′-cttcggatgaaatcctttgtcgtcgtc-5′; and C-terminal of the polyglutamine-coding region, sense, 5′-cagcagcagcagcacctgcagcagggggacctatca-3′, and antisense, 3′-gtcgtcgtcgtcgtggacgtcgtccccctggatagt-5′. A Q15 cassette was then created with EcoNI restriction sites at either end using the following complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-tttgaaaaacagcagcaaaagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagc-3′ and 3′-aactttttgtcgtcgttttcgtcgtcgtcgtcgtcgtcgtcgtcgtcgt-5′. The oligonucleotides were allowed to anneal slowly prior to their ligation into the EcoN1 digested vector. The nature of the sites allowed for directional cloning of the cassette, with the disappearance of the EcoNI sites as proof of successful ligation. DNA sequencing was used to verify the integrity of the construct. Atax3(Q50)—The cDNA encoding human Atax3(Q50) was a gift from Henry Paulson. A HindIII digestion site was engineered into the 3′ end of the gene. By exploiting this HindIII site and the 5′ BamHI site, the cDNA was then subcloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). All of the variants were expressed and purified as described previously (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with two modifications as outlined below. Firstly, an extra purification step was performed to aid removal of contaminating proteases. Following centrifugation of the sonicated cells, prior to binding to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin, the supernatant was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 ml of p-aminobenzamidine-agarose previously equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The unbound protein, containing the relevant ataxin-3 variant, was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. All other stages of the purification were the same as previously described, except that glycerol (10% v/v) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) were also present in all of the buffers prior to the gel filtration chromatography stage. All of the fluorescence measurements were performed in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 10.1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.76 mm KH2PO4), pH 7.4. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer with a thermostated cuvette holder at 25 °C, using a 1-cm-path length quartz cuvette. An excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used, with measurement of spectra from 300 to 400 nm. Emission and excitation slit widths were set at 4.0 nm, and a scan speed of 25 nm/min was used. ThioT fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 445 nm, with the emission recorded at 480 nm. The excitation slit width used was 5.0 nm, and the emission slit width was 10.0 nm. The assay buffer contained PBS, pH 7.4. 15 μl of the relevant protein sample was mixed with 485 μl of assay buffer; these samples were analyzed immediately, with the fluorescence emission signal averaged over a 10-s period. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using a thermostatted cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. The spectra were recorded from 190 to 250 nm, using a scan speed of 20 nm/min, with 5 s/point signal averaging, and θ222 measurements were recorded with the signal averaged over 30 s. The CD spectra were analyzed by spectral deconvolution using the CONTINLL algorithm (31van Stokkum I.H. Spoelder H.J. Bloemendal M. van Grondelle R. Groen F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 32Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar) as provided by the DICHROWEB on-line facility (33Lobley A. Wallace B.A. Biophys.

For the variant length comparative assay under native conditions, protein solutions at 65 μm were prepared at pH 7.4 using PBS buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 2 mm), EDTA (final concentration, 5 mm), glycerol (10% v/v), and dithiothreitol (final concentration, 1 mm). The mixtures were incubated at a constant temperature of 37 °C. For monitoring potential fibrillogenesis under acidic conditions, the proteins were incubated at 25 °C in a 1:1 mixture of PBS (pH 7.4) with 50 mm HCl to give a final pH of 1.9; the final concentration of protein was 10.5 μm. For both fibrillogenesis assays, the samples were incubated in air tight containers, and at specific time points, a 15-μl aliquot of each protein sample was removed and added to 485 μl of 25 μm ThioT solution in PBS at pH 7.4. The change in fluorescence signal was then monitored as previously described (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy images were obtained using a Jeol JEM-200CX transmission electron microscope. The acceleration voltage was 100 kV. The samples were adsorbed onto a carbon-coated grid and stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Different stock buffers, passed through a 0.22-μm filter, were used at different pH ranges in equilibrium unfolding experiments. 50 mm Tris-HCl was used between pH 7 and 8, 50 mm sodium phosphate was used between pH 6 and 7, 50 mm sodium acetate was used between pH 4 and 6, 50 mm sodium citrate was used between pH 2 and 4, and 50 mm HCl was used below pH 2. The protein, in PBS buffer, was diluted with equal part stock buffers of the desired pH. The reaction mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at 25 °C before fluorescence analysis, and the final pH was measured. More extensive equilibration for longer time periods up to 12 h showed no difference in results following spectroscopic analysis. The experiments were performed using final protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μm. The samples were analyzed by recording the fluorescence emission spectra between 300 and 400 nm (λex = 280 nm) or monitoring the change in far-UV CD signal at 222 nm. For each sample, the absorbance of all solutions at the excitation wavelength was also measured and recorded. For the pH-induced fibrillogenesis assay, samples across a range of different pH values were prepared as for the equilibrium folding analysis, with a final protein concentration of 10.5 μm. Following overnight incubation at 25 °C, each sample was vortexed, and 50 μl was removed and incubated with ThioT; the change in fluorescence signal was then monitored as previously described (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics SF.18MV stopped flow apparatus. Unfolding was monitored by measuring the changes in fluorescence intensity at 360 nm using an excitation wave-length of 278 nm. Unfolding at pH 1.9 was performed by rapidly mixing one volume of 0.1 mg/ml protein solution in PBS, pH 7.4, with an equal volume of 50 mm HCl buffer, pH 1.3, at 25 °C. Refolding experiments were performed by initially preincubating the protein for 30 min at 25 °C at a concentration of 2.5 μm in 50 mm HCl at pH 1.9. The protein was refolded by rapidly mixing one volume of the unfolded reaction mixture with an equal part of 20× PBS, pH 7.4; the final pH of refolding was 7.2. The data collected from unfolding and refolding experiments were collected from 10 experiments, which were averaged and fitted to either single or double exponential functions as appropriate. Characterization of Ataxin-3 Variants—We have successfully purified milligram quantities of ataxin-3 variants containing 15, 28, and 50 glutamine repeats, as shown in Fig. 1.

All three purified proteins were in a soluble monomeric form as judged by gel filtration analysis, and mass spectrometry showed that they contained the correct number of glutamine residues within their respective polyglutamine tracts (data not shown). The far-UV CD spectrum of Atax3(Q28) was concordant with previously reported data (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol.

This suggested that there were no major differences in secondary structure, an observation that was confirmed by spectral deconvolution of the far-UV spectra (Fig. 2, inset). Rapid Fibrillization of Ataxin-3 Containing an Expanded Glutamine Repeat—A key behavioral feature of polyglutamine-expanded proteins is the ready formation of fibrils, as shown for a range of different proteins (17Scherzinger E.

In the case of ataxin-3, it has been shown that a variant containing 78 glutamine residues will readily fibrillize under native conditions (19Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas shorter variants are also capable of forming fibrillar aggregates under partially denaturing conditions (24Chow M.K. Paulson H.L. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Shehi E. Fusi P. Secundo F. Pozzuolo S. Bairati A. Tortora P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14626-14632Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined the behavior and propensity of ataxin-3 of different lengths to form fibrils. The threshold of disease length polyglutamine tracts for ataxin-3 is ∼45 glutamine residues,1 and as such, it is not surprising to observe that under native conditions, Atax3(Q50) forms fibrils much more quickly than both Atax3(Q15) and Atax3(Q28). When incubated at 37 °C at 65 μm, following a lag phase of 3–4 h, Atax3(Q50) exhibits a significant increase in ThioT fluorescence, which continues to increase for up to and beyond 24 h. In contrast, Atax3(Q15) and Atax3(Q28) show no increase in ThioT fluorescence for up to 24 h (Fig. 3A). The faster fibrillization of longer variants is consistent with previously reported results for other polyglutamine-containing proteins and peptides (22Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Examination of the samples by electron microscopy after 24 h of incubation revealed that Atax3(Q50) formed filamentous aggregates with a fibrillar-like morphology, ranging from 20 to 45 nm in diameter (Fig. 3, B and C). Closer inspection of these fibrils suggested that they had a banded texture, suggestive of protofilament species that have assembled and aligned in a lateral manner (Fig. 3C). Inspection of Atax3(Q15) and Atax3(Q28) by electron microscopy at the same time point showed no formation of aggregates (data not shown). Acid Denaturation of Ataxin-3—The propensity of nonpathological length variants of ataxin-3 to aggregate under denaturing conditions has suggested that native state destabilization by an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a key role in polyglutamine aggregation and fibrillization (19Bevivino A.E.

https://openalex.org/W2062007063,"Glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHRs) differ from the other seven transmembrane receptors mainly through a complex activation mechanism that requires the binding of a large hormone toward a large N-terminal ectodomain. The intramolecular mechanism of the signal transduction to the serpentine domain upon hormone binding at the ectodomain is not understood. To identify determinants at the GPHR ectodomain that may be involved in signal transduction, we first searched for homologous structural features. Based on high sequence similarity to the determined structures of the Nogo-receptor ectodomain and the intermolecular complex of the Interleukin-8 ligand (IL8) and the N-terminal peptide of the IL8 receptor (IL8RA), the hypothesis was developed that portions of the intramolecular components, Cysteine-box-2 and Cysteine-box-3, of the GPHR ectodomain interact and localize at the interface between ectodomain and serpentine domain. Indeed, point mutations within the D403EFN406 motif at Cysteine-box-3 of the thyrotropin receptor resulted in increased basal cAMP levels, suggesting that this motif may be important for transduction of the signal from the ectodomain to the transmembrane domain. New indications are provided about the tight spatial cooperation and relative location of the new epitope and other determinants at the thyrotropin receptor ectodomain, such as the leucine-rich repeat motif Ser281 and the cysteine boxes. According to the high sequence conservation, the results are of general relevance for the signal transduction mechanism of other glycoprotein hormone receptors such as choriogonadotrophic/luteinizing hormone receptor and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor.

The glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPHR, glycoprotein hormone receptor; hCG/LHR, human choriogonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor; hLH, human lutropin; hFSHR, human follicle-stimulating hormone receptor; hTSHR, human thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor; C-b1, C-b2, C-b3, Cysteine-box-1, -2, -3; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; TMH, transmembrane helix; SCA, specific constitutive activity; IL, interleukin; PDB, Protein Data Bank; wt, wild type; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; IP, inositol phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. CG/LHR, FSHR, TSHR, and the leucine-rich repeat-containing glycoprotein receptors constitute a subfamily of family A of G-protein-coupled receptors (1Szkudlinski M.W. Fremont V. Ronin C. Weintraub B.D. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 473-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Understanding the specific molecular mechanisms, starting with binding of the heterodimeric hormone to the large ectodomain, and knowledge about the changes in interactions between the ectodomain and transmembrane domain are prerequisites for understanding the specific activation mechanism of GPHRs. Furthermore, it is instrumental in generating new ideas for pharmacological intervention. An x-ray structure of the large ectodomain is not yet available. Based on sequence similarities, the large N-terminal portion of the TSHR seems to consist of five structural components: (i) an N-terminal C-b1 (hTSHR: 1-54), (ii) a 230-amino acid-spanning LRR motif (hTSHR: 55-279) with nine repeats back-to-back followed by (iii) the central C-b2 (hTSHR: 280-316), (iv) the TSHR-specific insertion region (hTSHR: 317-366), and (v) the C-b3 (hTSHR: 370-410) located close to TMH1 (2Themmen A.P.N. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 551-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For GPHRs it has been demonstrated that the major binding region for the large hormones hCG/hLH, hTSH, and hFSH is located in the extracellular leucine-rich repeat region (3Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of 14 proteins containing LRR motifs show that LRRs fold into a curved shape with a parallel β-sheet on the concave face and with various secondary structures, including α-helix, 3-10 helix, and pII helix, on the convex face (4Enkhbayar P. Kamiya M. Osaki M. Matsumoto T. Matsushima N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinf. 2003; 54: 394-403Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Exposed side chains on the concave face are supposed to contact the ligands and provide selective interaction patterns for hormone receptor binding (5Smits G. Campillo M. Govaerts C. Janssens V. Richter C. Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2692-2703SCrossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The structures of hCG (PDB accession number 1QFW (6Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar)) and hFSH (PDB accession number 1FL7 (7Fox K.M. Dias J.A. Van Roey P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) have been determined. Data of peptide studies and mutagenesis provide established knowledge about direct interaction of the hormone β-subunits and the LRRs (8Hong S.H. Ji I.H. Ji T.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1285-1294PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mishra A.K. Mahale S.D. Iyer K.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas the hormone α-subunit is supposed to be oriented toward the serpentine domain and to be involved in ligand-induced signaling (10Yoo J. Zeng H. Ji I. Murdoch W.J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13034-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zeng H. Ji I. Ji T.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2948-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the LRR sequence is only one portion in the middle of the complete N-terminal sequence, and there are additional structural components between the LRRs and the TMH1 of the serpentine domain whose three-dimensional structure is unknown. Moreover, it is not completely understood how the intramolecular signal transduction toward the serpentine domain of the GPHR takes place. The central C-b2 is located back-to-back following the LRR region. Mutants at Ser281, directly preceding the first cysteine in C-b2, are known to act as a switch for constitutive activity (12Duprez L. Parma J. Costagliola S. Hermans J. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The structural interrelation between the constitutive active mutant S281N and the necessary presence of the complete LRR motif has been shown by deletion studies for the hCG/LHR (13Sangkuhl K. Schulz A. Schultz G. Schoneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47748-47755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncations of the TSHR ectodomain (14Vlaeminck-Guillem V. Ho S.C. Rodien P. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and mutational studies at corresponding positions of the leucine-rich repeat-containing glycoprotein receptor 2, the CG/LHR, and the FSHR demonstrated the importance of the Ser281 region for the maintenance of a conformational switch in all four glycoprotein hormone receptors (15Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Hsueh A.J. Maruo T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 202: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Nishi S. Nakabayashi K. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3958-3964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that amino acids Pro276 and Ser277 in CG/LHR (TSHR: Pro280, Ser281) are constituents of a loop-like epitope that can act as an activation switch (15Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Hsueh A.J. Maruo T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 202: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by substitution of a proline residue, Pro276, (TSHR: Pro280) adjacent to Ser277 (TSHR: Ser281) of the CG/LH receptor with a glycine that exerts less structural restraint and leads to constitutive receptor activation and higher agonist affinity. Mutations of the TSHR cysteines Cys283 and Cys284 to serine led to a 2-fold increase of basal TSHR activity (17Ho S.C. Van Sande J. Lefort A. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds are involved in the quaternary structure of the TSHR (18Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Although there are currently no direct data to indicate which of the single cysteines form pairs, a number of indirect lines of evidence permit global assignments of disulfide bridges (19Bozon V. Couture L. Pajot-Augy E. Richard F. Remy J.J. Salesse R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Zhang R. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5755-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations of Cys283, Cys284 (C-b2) and Cys398, Cys408 (C-b3) have dramatic effects on the TSHR structure and TSH binding. The hypothesis that Cys301 (C-b2) and Cys390 (C-b3) are paired is supported by recent evidence that intramolecular cleavage of the TSHR releases a “C peptide” located between these two residues (21Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further evidence is provided by the fact that mutation of either Cys301 or Cys390 produces the identical effect of reduced hTSH binding affinity (22Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the CG/LH receptor of New World monkey Callithrix jacchus (23Gromoll J. Wistuba J. Terwort N. Godmann M. Muller T. Simoni M. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is missing exon 10 encoding the particular cysteine corresponding to Cys301 of TSHR. Additionally, this receptor is simultaneously also missing the cysteine corresponding to Cys390 TSHR. Taken together, the two neighboring cysteines Cys283 and Cys284 of C-b2 are very likely paired either to Cys398 and Cys408 of C-b3 or in reversed order to Cys408 and Cys398, whereas the Cys301 (C-b2) is very likely paired with Cys390 (C-b3). For the large extracellular N-terminal tail of GPHRs, only molecular models for the LRR have been suggested (24Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. el Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), based on the first available LRR crystal structure of the ribonuclease inhibitor (26Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To provide support for the molecular understanding of the signal transduction process upon hormone binding at the glycoprotein hormone receptor ectodomain, we decided to determine how the LRR region cooperates with other fragments of the ectodomain, like C-b2 and C-b3. To identify determinants in the ectodomain that may be involved in the intramolecular signal transduction and to obtain indications for their spatial cooperation, we searched for an optimal structural LRR template and for additional homologous structural motifs in the ectodomain. Sequence similarities between the central C-b2 and C-b3 with the IL8/CXCL8 chemokine and IL8RA/CXCR1 in a structure complex (PDB accession number 1ILQ (27Skelton N.J. Quan C. Reilly D. Lowman H. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) of an IL8-IL8RA fragment, respectively, led us to propose a tightly packed model of the ectodomain. In this ectodomain model, C-b3 is located at a prominent interface position between ectodomain and serpentine domain, close to the transmembrane domain, and is therefore very likely a necessary transducer of the intramolecular signal transduction. Based on the proposed model, Asp403, Glu404, Asn406 in C-b3 were targeted for mutagenesis and shown to play a role in the signal transduction mechanism. They resulted in the identification of new residues within C-b3 (Asp403, Glu404, Asn406) that are significantly involved in the intramolecular signal transduction. These residues are located in close spatial proximity to Ser281. In this study we have demonstrated that the combination of comparative modeling and site-directed mutagenesis at the ectodomain of the TSHR allowed the localization of a new site within C-b3 that is involved in intramolecular signal transduction toward the serpentine domain by acting as a conformational switch for constitutive TSHR activity. Structural Bioinformatics and Comparative Modeling—To select an optimal structural template for the LRRs of the GPHR ectodomain, 14 different protein structures with LRR motifs available in the Protein Data Bank (28Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27938) Google Scholar) were analyzed. The LRR templates were ranked according to the closest number of repeats, residues/repeat, and highest sequence similarity compared with TSHR, CG/LHR, and FSHR (ranked PDB entries 1OZN, 1FQV, 2BNH, 1YRG, 1D0B, 1M0Z, 1O6T, 1G9U, 1H6U, 1DCE, 1DS9, 1A9N, 1IO0, 1FT8). The best matching template from the recently deposited hNogo-receptor ectodomain (PDB entry 1OZN (29He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) was used for comparative modeling, constructing LRR motifs of TSHR (residues 23-279), CG/LHR (residues 40-275), and FSHR (residues 28-271) containing N- and C-terminal flanking residues. For model building, the Sybyl program package (TRIPOS Inc., St. Louis, MO) and the AMBER 7.0 (30Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham T.E. II I Wang J. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A.

University of California, San Francisco2002Google Scholar) force field were used. To reveal new homologous structural templates in the ectodomain of the TSHR, in addition to the LRR motif, extensive systematic sequence similarity searches of fragmented sequence portions of different lengths of the ectodomain were conducted in the Protein Data Bank by means of FASTA. Because of the lack of structural templates for the TSHR-specific region containing two cleavage sites, a polyglycine loop was used to link the structural components of C-b2 and C-b3. One putative disulfide bridge between Cys283 (C-b2) and Cys408 (C-b3) for the TSHR resulting from the structural template IL8-IL8RA fragment complex (PDB entry 1ILQ (27Skelton N.J. Quan C. Reilly D. Lowman H. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) was used as a model constraint. For the TSHR ectodomain model, the following disulfide bridges were formed: Cys24/Cys31, Cys29/Cys41, Cys283 or Cys284/Cys408, Cys284 or Cys283/Cys398, Cys301/Cys390. Structures of hCG (PDB entry 1QFW (6Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar)) and hFSH (PDB entry 1FL7 (7Fox K.M. Dias J.A. Van Roey P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) are available. The TSH was modeled by homology using the hFSH structure as template. For the hTSH model, disulfide bridges between cysteines were incorporated based on the template: α-subunit, Cys31/Cys55, Cys34/Cys84, Cys52/Cys106, Cys56/Cys108, Cys83/Cys111; β-subunit, Cys22/Cys72, Cys36/Cys87, Cys39/Cys125, Cys47/Cys103, Cys51/Cys105, and Cys108/Cys115. Conjugate gradient minimizations were performed until it converged at a termination gradient of 0.05 kcal/(mol*Å). The AMBER 7.0 force field was used. The geometric quality of the models was controlled by the PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) software. Modeling of Hormone-Receptor Ectodomain Interactions—Components of homologous models were assembled manually or by constrained molecular dynamic simulations using functional data and complementary side chain properties with the biopolymer module or automatically using the docking module FlexX of the Sybyl program package. The electrostatic potentials (calculated by a probe radius of 2.0 Å) were created at the Connolly surface of all three GPHR LRRs and corresponding hormones by the MolCad module of the Sybyl program package. The hormones hTSH, hCG, and hFSH were initially placed close to the corresponding GPHR LRRs according to their complementary electrostatic potentials. The hormones were docked during a constrained molecular dynamics simulation. Putative interaction pairs TSHR Lys209-Asp111TSH, CG/LHR Glu206-Arg115CG, FHSR Lys179-Asp108FSH were used as constraints according to experimental data (5Smits G. Campillo M. Govaerts C. Janssens V.

The models were scored according to their consistency to available experimental binding data. All assembling calculations were performed in a vacuum. The assembled ectodomain-ligand models of the three GPHRs were soaked with water in a periodic boundary box. Initially the ectodomain atoms were kept fixed to relax the water during minimization. Later on, the entire system was studied. Minimizations were performed as described above. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed at 300 K for 1 ns. For both, the AMBER 7.0 force field was used; the geometric quality of the model was controlled by the PROCHECK software (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into the human TSHR via a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). TSHR-pSVL (33Libert F. Lefort A. Gerard C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1250-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was used as template. PCR products containing the mutations were digested with BspTI and Eco91I (MBI Fermentas) and used to replace the analogous BspTI/Eco91I fragment in the wild type TSHR-pSVL vector. Sequences of mutated TSH receptors were verified by dideoxy sequencing with Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing chemistry (ABI Advanced Biotechnolgies, Inc., Columbia, MD). Sequencing reactions were analyzed on a genetic analyzer ABI 310 (ABI Advanced Biotechnologies). The mutated receptors were cloned in the expression vector pSVL and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Characterization of the constructs was performed by determination of cAMP and phospholipase C-inositol phosphate accumulation, TSH binding, and cell surface expression. The wt receptor and empty pSVL vector were used as controls. Levels for cell surface expression were determined by flow cytometry. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transiently transfected in 24-well plates (0.5 × 105 cells/well) with 0.5 μg of DNA/well for cAMP accumulation and TSH binding analysis. For determination of inositol phosphate (IP) formation, cells were transiently transfected in 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) with 1 μg of DNA/well. COS-7 cells were transfected using FuGENE™6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). FACS Analysis—48 h after transfection, nonpermeabilized cells were detached from the dishes using 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA in PBS and transferred in Falcon 2054 tubes. Before incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3. For permeabilized cell assay, in the first step cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice following an incubation with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, and 0.2% saponin for 30 min. Saponin was supplemented in all subsequent buffers. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 1 h with a mouse anti-human TSHR antibody (10 μg/ml, 2C11; Serotec, Oxford, UK). Cells were washed twice and incubated for 1 h in the dark with a fluorescein-conjugated F(ab′)2 rabbit antimouse IgG (Serotec). Before FACS analysis (FACscan; BD Biosciences), cells were washed twice and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Receptor expression was determined by fluorescence intensity; the percentage of signal positive cells corresponded to transfection efficiency. Radioligand Binding Assay—Competitive binding studies were performed as previously described (34Wonerow P. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Paschke R.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7900-7905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed assuming a one-site binding model using the fitting module of SigmaPlot 2.0 for Windows (35Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-2003PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP Accumulation Assay—Measurement of cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation was performed 48 h after transfection as previously described (34Wonerow P. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Paschke R.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7900-7905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Stimulation of IP Formation—Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml myo[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 8 h. Thereafter, cells were preincubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl2 for 30 min. Stimulation with bTSH for 1 h was performed with the same medium supplemented with 100 milliunits/ml bTSH. Evaluation of basal and TSH-induced increases in intracellular IP levels was performed by anion exchange chromatography as described (36Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). IP values are expressed as the percentage of radioactivity incorporated from [H]inositol phosphates (IP1-3) over the sum of radioactivity incorporated in IPs and phosphatidylinositols. Specific Constitutive Activity (SCA)—The assays for determination of Bmax values and basal cAMP accumulation were performed as follows: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected in 24-well plates (0.5 × 105 cells/well) with various concentrations of wt and mutant DNA (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ng/well). For radioligand binding assays, cells were incubated in the presence of 180,000-200,000 cpm of 125I bovine thyrotropin (bTSH) supplemented with 5 milliunits/ml nonlabeled bTSH. The effect of expression level on basal cAMP accumulation was analyzed according to Ballesteros et al. (37Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G.F. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were seeded on coverslips into 6-well plates (2.5 × 105 HEK 293 cells/well). The cells were incubated 36 h before transfection with plasmid constructs (2.5 μg of DNA/well) containing the coding sequence of the wt or mutated TSHRs. 48 h after transfection, coverslips were rinsed two times with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (for permeabilization) for 30 min at 4 °C. After two 5-min wash steps with cold PBS, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. TSHR was detected using the anti-human TSHR antibody (2C11; Serotec; 1:500 in PBS). The cells were washed two times for 5 min with cold PBS, and the primary antibody was detected by incubation with an Alexa-Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 1:1000 in PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C. After four final 5-min wash steps, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides. Confocal analysis was performed on a confocal laser scanning system (TCS SP2; Leica) attached to a microscope (DM IRBE; Leica) with a ×100 oil immersion lens (PL Fluotar 1.3; Leica). Sections (0.45 μm) were taken, and representative sections corresponding to the middle section of the cells are presented in Fig. 3B. After indirect immunofluorescence staining, no specific fluorescence was observed in untransfected HEK 293 cells or in transfected HEK 293 cells treated only with secondary Alexa-Fluor® 488-conjugated antibody. Hormone-bound LRR Complex—Studies were carried out to examine the optimal structural template for the LRR domain of the GPHR. The LRR motif from the Nogo-receptor ectodomain (PDB entry 1OZN) (29He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was identified from 14 different LRR structures (4Enkhbayar P. Kamiya M. Osaki M. Matsumoto T. Matsushima N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinf. 2003; 54: 394-403Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as the best matching template to the LRR features of all three human GPHRs (Table I, hNogo-receptor: hCG/LHR, hFSHR, hTSHR).Table ILRR repeat-wise sequence alignments of N-terminal Cysteine-box-1, LRR motifs of GPHRs from the hNogo-receptor ectodomain Open table in a new tab Not only did the nine typical repeats match best to the sequence of the three receptors but also the cysteine box of the Nogo-receptor structure, which is N-terminal directly attached to the LRR, showed a best fit to C-b1 of the GPHR sequences. The putative disulfide bridges between the cysteines Cys24, Cys29, Cys31, and Cys41 in the homologous TSHR model (Fig. 1, a and b) stabilize an anti-parallel and parallel β-strand as integral parts of the LRR, where the latter participates as an additional parallel strand (LRR0) to the convex binding face. According to the LRR pattern rule, an additional β-strand (named β-strand X) is adopted at the C-terminal side for all three GPHRs. Based on this match, nine complete LRRs (LRRIIX) plus one additional β-strand (LRR0) at the N terminus plus one at the C-terminal side (LRRX) form 9 + 2 β-strands lining the inner convex surface of the hormone-binding region (Fig. 1a). The TSHR LRR sequence not only shows fewer sequence similarities (PAM250 matrix) to the previous RI template (22%) and other LRR templates compared with the new Nogo-receptor template (34%) but the new LRR model for the GPHRs also offers, as the only one, a much larger radius for the inner convex arch of the hormone-binding region. This resulting radius is a shallow deflection like a “scythe blade” shape rather than a “horseshoe” shape, as demonstrated by the superimposition of TSHR models using both templates (Fig. 1b). The LRR structure of the Nogo-receptor ectodomain contains inside the LRR a “Phe spine” (green aromatic rings) for the stabilization of the fold, instead of the missing helices at the concave outer face (Fig. 1a and Table I). The importance of phenylalanines from such a Phe spine for the overall fold of LRRs, as well as for the GPHRs, is demonstrated by a homozygous mutation at the CG/LHR, where a F194V mutant causes male pseudohermaphroditism by lost trafficking to the membrane (38Gromol"

In this study, we have used gene expression profiling of Escherichia coli supported by phenotypic analysis to investigate how cells respond to a defect in the Tat pathway. Previous work has demonstrated that strains mutated in genes encoding essential Tat pathway components are defective in the integrity of their cell envelope because of the mislocalization of two amidases involved in cell wall metabolism (Ize, B., Stanley, N. R., Buchanan, G., and Palmer, T. (2003) Mol. Microbiol. 48, 1183–1193). To distinguish between genes that are differentially expressed specifically because of the cell envelope defect and those that result from other effects of the tatC deletion, we also analyzed two different transposon mutants of the ΔtatC strain that have their outer membrane integrity restored. Approximately 50% of the genes that were differentially expressed in the tatC mutant are linked to the envelope defect, with the products of many of these genes involved in self-defense or protection mechanisms, including the production of exopolysaccharide. Among the changes that were not explicitly linked to envelope integrity, we characterized a role for the Tat system in iron acquisition and copper homeostasis. Finally, we have demonstrated that overproduction of the Tat substrate SufI saturates the Tat translocon and produces effects on global gene expression that are similar to those resulting from the ΔtatC mutation.

The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli is composed of an inner (or cytoplasmic) membrane and an outer membrane, which delimits the periplasm and contains the murein layer. A central process in the construction of a bacterial cell is the localization of proteins to the different cellular compartments. In most bacteria, protein translocation across the inner membrane toward the periplasm proceeds by one of two pathways. The majority of proteins are translocated by the general Sec (secretory) protein export pathway. This system transports proteins in an unfolded state and is driven by a combination of ATP hydrolysis and the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, a growing subset of proteins, often containing bound redox cofactors and playing important roles in energy conservation, are transported by the more recently discovered Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway (3Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 4Wu L.-F. Ize B. Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol.

Proteins are specifically targeted to the Tat system by cleavable N-terminal signal peptides harboring a distinctive (S/T)RRXFLK motif, in which the consecutive arginine residues are almost invariant (6Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The Tat machinery translocates fully folded proteins, or even enzyme complexes, using the energy provided by the transmembrane protonmotive force (7Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Alami M. Trescher D. Wu L.-F. Muller M. J. Biol.

Recently, it was shown than the Tat system is also involved in the post-translational biogenesis of certain integral membrane proteins (9Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).In E. coli, the Tat translocase consists of the integral inner membrane proteins TatA, TatB, TatC, and TatE (10Sargent F.

(19DeLisa M.P. Lee P. Palmer T. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showed recently that PspA (phage shock protein A) may increase Tat translocation efficiency in vivo. Genes encoding the Tat proteins are expressed constitutively, indicating a role for Tat under all growth conditions (20Jack R.L. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria functions as a selective barrier: the lipopolysaccharide leaflet prevents the diffusion of toxic compounds through the outer membrane (21Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar), whereas porins and other specific receptors allow passive or active transport of nutrients. Cell protection is also mediated by efflux systems that pump toxic compounds out into the extracellular medium (22Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 29-47Google Scholar). The murein layer determines the shape of the cell envelope and provides resistance to osmotic and mechanical stresses. It has been observed that those E. coli tat mutants that are completely defective in Tat-dependent protein translocation have impaired outer membrane integrity (23Stanley N.R. Findlay K. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These tat mutant strains leak periplasmic proteins, are hypersensitive to drugs and detergents, and display a distinctive chain-forming phenotype when visualized by microscopy. Inspection of the long chains of cells suggests that cell division is retarded at a relatively late stage in the ΔtatC mutant because the murein septa are fully formed (23Stanley N.R. Findlay K. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We (25Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and others (24Bernhardt T.G. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have recently shown that two of the three E. coli N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases, AmiA and AmiC, are substrates of the Tat pathway. Amidases are involved in splitting the murein septum at a late stage in cell division, physically separating the two new daughter cells (26Heidrich C. Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Merdanovic M. Berger J. Schwarz H. de Pedro M.A. Holtje J.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Failure of these proteins to be correctly localized accounts for the cell envelope defect of tat mutant strains, and thus, a combined chromosomal deletion of the genes encoding amiA and amiC or of DNA covering just the signal peptide coding regions closely mimics the tat envelope phenotype (24Bernhardt T.G. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 25Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overproduction of the Sec-targeted AmiB protein can compensate for the outer membrane and cell division defects of the ΔtatC mutant (25Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Genome sequencing studies indicate that the Tat system is found in many bacterial pathogens of animals and plants, including E. coli pathotypes K1 and 0157, Salmonella typhimurium, Neisseria meningitidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that the Tat system makes an important contribution to the virulence of at least some of these organisms (27Crooke H. Kidgell C. Boles J. Kraus A. Everest P. Tang C. Abstract of Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Response. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 28Pradel N. Ye C.

In P. aeruginosa, the Tat system operates in parallel with the Sec system to secrete virulence factors via the type II secretion pathway (31Voulhoux R. Ball G. Ize B. Vasil M.L. Lazdunski A. Wu L.-F. Filloux A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6735-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For example, the P. aeruginosa Tat system is required for the translocation of two phospholipases and of proteins involved in iron siderophore biosynthesis and uptake and in biofilm formation (29Ochsner U.A. Snyder A. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Voulhoux R. Ball G. Ize B. Vasil M.L. Lazdunski A. Wu L.-F. Filloux A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6735-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Additionally, if, as predicted (25Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases of P. aeruginosa are Tat-dependent, then defects in the integrity of the cell envelope would also be expected to reduce the virulence of the P. aeruginosa tat mutant. Indeed, Ochsner et al. (29Ochsner U.A. Snyder A. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported abnormal flagellum and pilus function in the tat mutant, a phenotype that could be the result of cell envelope defects.In this study, we have used gene expression profiling supported by phenotypic analysis to investigate the global effects of a tat null mutation on E. coli. We found that ∼50% of the differential gene regulation observed is a consequence of the cell envelope defect of the tat mutant strain. Some of the remaining genes that are not affected by the defective cell envelope encode proteins involved in iron acquisition and copper homeostasis, and we demonstrate that the Tat system is required for these types of metal ion metabolism. Finally, we show that overexpression of a native Tat substrate protein saturates the transport capacity of the Tat pathway, leading to effects on global gene expression similar to those found in a tat null mutant.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The strains and plasmids used and constructed in this work are listed in Table I.

Pasteur (Paris). 1956; 91: 693-720PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose and 0.4% (w/v) TMAO.RNA Isolation—For the microarray and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR experiments, total bacterial RNA was isolated from mid-log cultures with the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to themethoddescribed(www.ifr.bbsrc.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/protocols.html). The quality of RNA was checked using the RNA nanochip (Labchip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. One A260 unit corresponds to 40 μg/ml RNA. The RNA was then precipitated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol and resuspended in sterile RNase-free distilled H2O to obtain a concentration of 2 μg/μl. RNA samples were stored at –80 °C.cDNA Preparation, Hybridization, and Data Analysis—We used a common reference (E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA) as the co-hybridized control for one channel on all microarrays (37DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar), as this method has the advantage of allowing the direct comparison of multiple samples and has been shown to be comparable with the traditional comparison of two cDNA samples on one microarray. 2Speed, T. P., and Yang, Y. H. (2002) Stanford Microarray Repository; available at genome-www5.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD/helpindex.html. Total RNA was used to generate cDNA according to the protocol described (www.ifr.bbsrc.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/protocols.html). Fluorescently labeled cDNA probes were prepared by random priming. A total of 16 μg of total RNA was transcribed and labeled with Cy5-conjugated dUTP (Amersham Biosciences) using 200 units of Stratascript (Stratagene) and random primers (Invitrogen). RNA strands were removed by addition of 0.1 m NaOH at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by neutralization with 0.1 m HCl. cDNA was purified further with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and then dried by vacuum centrifugation in a Speedvac Plus 210C. E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA (2 μg), isolated using a QIAGEN genomic DNA kit, was labeled with Cy3-conjugated dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using 1 μl of Klenow enzyme and random primers from the BioPrime DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen). The reactions were then incubated overnight at 37 °C, cleaned using the QIAquick PCR purification kit, and dried in a Speedvac Plus 210C. Finally, dried labeled chromosomal DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. Labeled reference and test cDNAs were then combined and hybridized to the microarrays. RNAs from two biological replicates were hybridized to microarrays. The E. coli microarrays used in this study have been described previously (39Anjum M.F. Lucchini S. Thompson A. Hinton J.C. Woodward M.J. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).After hybridization and washing, slides were scanned using an Axon 4000A scanner. The location and intensity of each spot were determined for both channels (Cy3 and Cy5) using the software GenPix Pro 3.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The local background intensity was then substracted from the spot intensity for each spot for both channels. Spots with a signal for the reference channel below the background plus 3 standard deviations of the background as well as spots showing obvious blemishes were not considered for subsequent analysis (denoted nd in Fig. 3). Finally, the Cy5/Cy3 ratio was calculated. To compensate for unequal dye incorporation, the Cy5/Cy3 ratios were centered using the median Cy5/Cy3 ratio. The data centering was performed separately for each block, one block being defined as a group of DNA spots deposited by the same pin on the slide using Excel. Data visualization and data mining were performed using GeneSpring 6.1 (Silicon Genetics)RT-PCR—Total RNA was converted to cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA was then used directly as a template for PCR. The total number of PCR cycles ranged from 15 to 35. RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was also used directly (without reverse transcription) as a template for PCR to ensure that there was no contaminating DNA. 3Primer sequences for RT-PCRs are available upon request.Kolter Assay for Biofilm Formation—The capacity of E. coli strains to form biofilms was assayed as described previously (40Pratt L.A. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, bacteria were grown overnight in colonizing factor antigen medium at 37 °C with agitation and standardized to A600 = 0.175, which is equivalent to 107 cells/ml. This culture was then diluted by 1:10 to make a total volume of 100 μl for aerobic cultures and of 350 μl for anaerobic cultures. Cultures were grown at 30 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate. After incubation periods of 24, 48, and 72 h, the plates were washed three times with sterile deionized water and dried in a 60 °C oven for 30 min. To observe biofilm formation, 130 μl of a 1% crystal violet solution was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The crystal violet solution was withdrawn, and the plates were washed extensively with deionized H2O until all unbound crystal violet was removed. Plates were dried at 37 °C for ∼1 h, after which wells were filled with 150 μl of 20% acetone in ethanol and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. To visualize the amount of cells attached to the surface, which reflects the formation of biofilm, absorbance was measured at 590 nm. Blank values were obtained from wells containing only medium.Copper Sensitivity Determination—For the copper sensitivity assay, overnight cultures of the various strains were diluted to A600 = 0.05 with LB medium containing various concentrations of copper chloride. Cells were grown at 250 rpm, and a final A600 measurement was taken after 15 h of growth. 100% survival is defined as the absorbance of each strain after 180 min of growth in LB medium without CuCl2. The LD50 is defined as the concentration of CuCl2 that killed 50% of the cells after 15 h of growth.Growth Promotion Test on Agar Plates—The growth experiments with different iron sources were assayed as described previously (41Nienaber A. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. The strains were grown overnight in LB medium. The cultures were diluted to ∼107 cells/ml, and 100 μl of the diluted cells was mixed with 3 ml of nutrient broth soft agar (0.3% agar; Oxoid) and poured onto nutrient broth plates (1.5% agar), both containing the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl (0.2 mm; Fluka). Sterile filter disks (6-mm diameter) were placed onto the plates, onto which 10 μl of either 10 mm ferric citrate (Sigma) or 10 mm ferrichrome (Sigma) was then spotted. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h before photographing.Protein Methods—Subcellular fractions were prepared by lysozyme/EDTA/cold osmotic shock (42Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-hexahistidine tag antiserum was obtained from Invitrogen. Protein concentration was estimated according to the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. TMAO-benzyl-viologen oxidoreductase activity was measured as described previously (45Silvestro A. Pommier J. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExperimental Design and Rationale—The goal of our experiments was to ascertain, at a global level, how E. coli responds to a defect in the Tat protein export pathway. To this end, we compared the transcriptional profiles of E. coli strain MC4100 with those of a derivative (B1LK0) that lacks a functional Tat pathway because of an in-frame deletion of the tatC gene. Bioinformatic analyses have suggested that there are at least 27 substrates of the E. coli Tat system, 13 of which have been experimentally confirmed (5Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2003; 47: 187-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Approximately two-thirds of the E. coli Tat substrates are predicted to be cofactor-containing proteins, many of which contribute to the anaerobic respiratory flexibility of the organism. Therefore, it was important to perform our comparative analyses under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. The most striking phenotypes of E. coli tat mutants are the formation of long chains of cells and the compromised outer membrane integrity, both of which arise because of the failure to transport AmiA and AmiC, two sequence-related N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases. Because these phenotypes might be expected to mask other, more subtle effects of the tat mutation, we additionally undertook global analysis of two transposon insertion mutants of the ΔtatC strain that are repaired, to differing degrees, in the integrity of their outer membrane and in their ability to divide. Strain BMI1 (B1LK0 yjeF::Tn10) overproduces the Sec-targeted cell wall amidase AmiB, a functional homolog of the two Tat-targeted amidases, and this results in the restoration of cell envelope integrity. In strain BMI6 (B1LK0 fimH::Tn10), the transposon is inserted into the fimH gene, which encodes a receptor-recognizing element of type 1 fimbriae (25Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is not clear how an insertion in this gene, which encodes a component of the pilus fiber (46Schembri M.A. Kjaergaard K. Sokurenko E.V. Klemm P. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: S28-S31Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), can reduce the severity of the cell envelope defect of a ΔtatC mutant, and we note that this insertion provides only a partial repair phenotype (25Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).To compare gene expression profiles of E. coli strains with and without severe envelope defects, it was important to determine the growth rates for each strain. Cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal MOPS mediu"
https://openalex.org/W2051572255,"To date 22 different polypeptides, including Abeta in Alzheimer's disease and PrP(Sc) in prion disorders, are known to re-fold and assemble into highly organized fibrils, which associate with heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans to form tissue deposits called amyloid. Mononuclear phagocytes have long been thought to be involved in this process, and we describe a monocytic cell culture system that can transform the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA1.1) into AA-amyloid and appears to recapitulate all the main features of amyloidogenesis observed in vivo. These features in common include nucleation-dependent kinetics, identical proteolytic processing of SAA1.1, and co-deposition of HS with the fibrils. Heparin and polyvinylsulfonate previously reported to block AA-amyloidogenesis in mice are also effective inhibitors in this cell culture model. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide (27-mer) corresponding to a HS binding site of SAA, blocks amyloid deposition at a concentration that is several-orders-of-magnitude lower than any other peptide-based inhibitor previously reported. The 27-mer's inhibitory activity may target the amyloidogenic pathway specifically as it does not interfere with the binding of SAA to monocytes. These data provide direct evidence that SAA1.1:HS interactions are a critical step in AA-amyloidogenesis and suggest a novel treatment strategy for other amyloidoses."
https://openalex.org/W2089718643,"The death receptor CD95 (APO-1/Fas) induces apoptosis in many tissues. However, in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells, stimulation of CD95 induces up-regulation of a defined number of mostly anti-apoptotic genes, resulting in increased motility and invasiveness of tumor cells. The majority of these genes are known NF-κB target genes. We have identified one of the CD95-regulated genes as the serine/threonine kinase (SNF1/AMP kinase-related kinase (SNARK)), which is induced in response to various forms of metabolic stress. We demonstrate that up-regulation of SNARK in response to CD95 ligand and tumor necrosis factor α depends on activation of NF-κB. Overexpression of SNARK rendered tumor cells more resistant, whereas a kinase-inactive mutant of SNARK sensitized cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SNARK increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to CD95 ligand- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Importantly, cells with reduced expression of SNARK also showed reduced motility and invasiveness in response to CD95 engagement. SNARK therefore represents an NF-κB-regulated anti-apoptotic gene that contributes to the tumor-promoting activity of CD95 in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells.

SNARK therefore represents an NF-κB-regulated anti-apoptotic gene that contributes to the tumor-promoting activity of CD95 in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells. CD95 (APO-1/Fas) is best known as a death receptor, inducing apoptosis in various tissues by recruiting initiator caspases to the death-inducing signaling complex leading to their activation (1Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 2Peter M.E. Barnhart B.C. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Lotze M.T. 4th Ed. The Cytokine Handbook. 2. Academic Press, London2003: 885-911Google Scholar). It has been known for many years that CD95 can also activate nonapoptotic pathways such as the NF-κB, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways Erk1/2, JNK1/2, and p38, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (3Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become clear that activation of a combination of these pathways in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells can increase their motility and invasiveness (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), providing an explanation for experiments that identified CD95 as a tumorigenic factor when expressed on certain tumor cells grown in vivo (5Lee J.K. Sayers T.J. Back T.C. Wigginton J.M. Wiltrout R.H. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We recently identified a defined number of genes that were up-regulated in response to CD95 stimulation that could be involved in the nonapoptotic activities of CD95 (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the nature of most of the genes that mediate the tumor-promoting activity of CD95 remains unknown. Members of the AMP kinase family are serine/threonine kinases that play a role in tumorigenesis (6Kato K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Minegishi Y. Nakajima N. Miyazaki M. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6082-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This activity is believed to be due to their activation by various forms of metabolic stress such as glucose deprivation, a condition to be expected within solid tumors. Currently, five members of this family are known: AMK-α1, AMPK-α2 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP kinase; SNARK, SNF1/AMPK-related kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siSNARK, small interfering SNARK; FB, Fas-Bcl-xl; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LzCD95L, leucine zipper-tagged CD95 ligand; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; huSNARK, human SNARK.1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP kinase; SNARK, SNF1/AMPK-related kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siSNARK, small interfering SNARK; FB, Fas-Bcl-xl; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LzCD95L, leucine zipper-tagged CD95 ligand; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; huSNARK, human SNARK.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The fourth member of the family, SNARK, was originally cloned from a rat kidney library but was recently isolated from a human testis cDNA library after identification through BLAST searches (10Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Minegichi Y. Ogura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SNARK is activated by glucose starvation and under these conditions induces acute cell-cell detachment (10Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Minegichi Y. Ogura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have recently identified human SNARK in a gene screen as one of only 17 genes that were up-regulated more than 2-fold in CD95-stimulated MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL(FB) cells (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We now show that SNARK is up-regulated by CD95 stimulation on the mRNA as well as the protein level and requires the activation of NF-κB. SNARK was found to have anti-apoptotic activities, as it protected cells from CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and a kinase-dead mutant of SNARK sensitized cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Down-modulation of SNARK using SNARK-specific siRNAs demonstrated that SNARK is also involved in the CD95-induced increase in motility and invasiveness of MCF7-FB cells. SNARK is therefore one of the anti-apoptotic genes that is induced in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells triggered through CD95, which causes increased invasiveness of tumor cells, identifying SNARK as a possible target for cancer therapy. Cell Lines and Reagents—MCF7-FB cells were cultured as described (13Stegh A.H. Barnhart B.C. Volkland J. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Ke N. Reed J.C. Peter M.E. J. Biol.

The embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma) containing penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The breast tumor cell line MCF7, the cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, and the renal adenocarcinoma cell lines, CAKI-1 and ACHN, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma) containing penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For transfection, cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at 2 × 105/well, and 2 μg of DNA or 100 pmol of siRNA were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method. The anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody, anti-APO-1, has been described previously (14Peter M.E. Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Kischkel F.

Leucine zipper-tagged CD95 ligand (LzCD95L) was generated as described previously (12Algeciras-Schimnich A. Pietras E.M. Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Vijayan S. Holbeck S.L. Peter M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TNFα was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and used at a concentration of 1000 units/ml. The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Z-IETD-fmk were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from different stimuli-induced cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). An equal amount of total RNA (2 μg) isolated from cells at each of the stimulated conditions was reverse transcribed using Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For each PCR target, only the dilution that yielded visible products within the linear amplification range for the untreated cDNA was shown. 107 MCF7-FB cells were preincubated with or without 40 μm Z-IETD-fmk and then treated or untreated for 8 h with anti-APO-1 (1 μg/ml). Real time PCR was performed as described (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, reverse-transcribed cDNA was made from 1 μg of each RNA sample and used for all subsequent real time PCR reactions. 2Specific primer sequences are available upon request. Cycles were run on an ABI 7700, and SYBR® green was used for fluorescent detection of double-stranded DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Normalization of the initial RNA composition was calculated from concurrent runs with primers specific for actin. Triplicates were performed with each primer set for each RNA sample. The mid-linear range was used to establish the threshold for each oligonucleotide set. After normalization and the calculation of differences within each time point experiment subset, all data from each time point were pooled to calculate differences. SNARK Cloning, Plasmid Construction, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and siRNAs—Human SNARK was isolated from the IMAGE clone (ID: 5088037) (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G.

PCR product was digested by EcoRI/XbaI and subcloned in EcoRI/XbaI-opened pcDNA3. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequence was added in the 3′ primer, and the EcoRI/XbaI-digested PCR product (huSNARK-HA) was subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate the kinase-dead SNARK by changing the Lys-82 to Arg using the pcDNA3-huSNARK wild-type vector as a template. The oligonucleotide used was gcgcctggtggccatcaggtcaatccggaaggac. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The control, Cys-3-bound luciferase siRNA, was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette). SNARK-targeting siRNA SMARTpool (SMART) was designed and produced by Dharmacon from the accession number NM_030952.1. We designed a second SNARK siRNA called siSNARK, which targets the sequence aacagaguuguccaccgagau in SNARK and is manufactured by Dharmacon. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates (100 μg) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with the indicated antibodies. Anti-caspase-8 (clone C-15) antibody was described previously (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the anti-HA (clone HA.11) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA), and the rabbit polyclonal anti-huSNARK antibody was generated by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) by immunizing rabbits with the SNARK sequence RQRESGYYSSPEPSES. GST-SAMS Peptide—SAMS sequence (full sequence: HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) was cloned in the pGEX-4T-1 vector. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. GST-SAMS was purified from BL21 Escherichia coli lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pierce) and eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 5 mm glutathione. Protein purity (>95%) and integrity were assessed by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Cell Death Assay—Cell viability was assessed using MTS assay according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). In brief, 24 h after transfection, 2 × 104 cells were cultured for 16 h in flat-bottom, 96-well plates with the indicated concentrations of the apoptosis inducer in a final volume of 100 μl. 15 μl of MTS solution were added, and after 2–4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm wavelength using a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Autophosphorylation and GST-SAMS Phosphorylation Assay—Immediately after stimulating MCF7-FB cells with LzCD95L or TNFα for 48 h after the transfection of 293T cells, cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4. Human SNARK was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of protein containing lysate by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of either anti-huSNARK or anti-HA (clone HA.11) antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed extensively in lysis buffer. An autophosphorylation assay was performed with these immunoprecipitates as described previously (9Lefebvre D.L. Bai Y. Shahmolky N. Sharma M. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Rosen C.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immune complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (15 mm HEPES (pH 7), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 15 mm MnCl2, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, washed three times, resuspended in standard reducing sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to film. pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-huSNARK-transfected 293T cell extracts (100 μg of protein) were used to determine the phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (full sequence: HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) fused to glutathione S-transferase. The lysates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 μg of GST-SAMS (or control GST) in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The samples were then boiled in a standard reducing buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography was performed on the dried gel. Motility and Invasiveness Assay—These assays were performed as described previously (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For invasion assays, Biocat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) containing 8-μm pore-size membranes were used. After rehydration of the matrigel, 75,000 cells were added to the top chamber in serum-free medium. The bottom chamber was filled with 10% serum-containing medium. LzCD95L or control supernatant was added to both chambers of each well. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. For motility assays, Transwell insert chambers of 8 μm were used and the cells were treated and loaded as described above. To quantify invasion or motility, cells were removed from the top side of the membrane mechanically using a cotton-tipped swab, invading or migrating cells were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa stain, and a minimum of five representative fields were counted for each insert. SNARK Is a CD95-regulated Gene—We recently demonstrated that stimulating the death receptor CD95 does not induce apoptosis in multiple apoptosis-resistant tumor cells but instead triggers five apoptosis-independent pathways, three of which are important for increased motility and invasiveness of tumor cells in response to CD95 triggering (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An Affymetrix gene chip analyses identified only 17 genes that were up-regulated more than 2-fold in CD95-stimulated MCF7-FB cells (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 12 of these genes were known NF-κB target genes, which is consistent because NF-κB activation is required for the novel nonapoptotic function of CD95 as a tumor-promoting factor. One of these CD95-induced genes had an unknown open reading frame. After cloning this gene, we determined that it codes a 628-amino acid putative serine/threonine kinase. It was identical to the recently cloned human ortholog of the rat SNARK (10Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Minegichi Y. Ogura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SNARK is widely expressed in both normal tissues and tumor cells (9Lefebvre D.L. Bai Y. Shahmolky N. Sharma M. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Rosen C.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because we identified SNARK as part of a gene screen performed with CD95-stimulated cells, we first tested whether SNARK was indeed a CD95-inducible gene. Semiquantitative RT-PCR confirmed that SNARK was transcriptionally up-regulated in MCF7-FB cells as early as 30 min after stimulation with anti-APO-1 (Fig. 1A). Induction of SNARK mRNA was kinetically similar to induction of other genes that were identified in the gene chip analysis, such as ICAM-1 and A20, which are bona fide NF-κB target genes. Induction of SNARK mRNA was also confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 1B). To exclude SNARK as a CD95-induced target gene only in MCF7-FB cells that express large amounts of exogenous CD95, we tested MCF7 and HeLa cells, which are naturally CD95 apoptosis-resistant (Fig. 1C). In both cases, CD95 stimulation caused a marked induction of SNARK mRNA when cells were treated LzCD95L. Up-regulation of SNARK in response to death receptor signaling was not limited to the mRNA level. The induction of endogenous SNARK protein was also detected in cells treated with LzCD95L or TNFα using an affinity-purified rabbit antibody we generated against a peptide located at the C terminus of SNARK in a region with high sequence diversity among different AMP kinase family members (Fig. 1D). This up-regulation of SNARK also caused a parallel increase in SNARK activity in cells, which was determined by performing an in vitro kinase assay on immunoprecipitated SNARK from LzCD95L- or TNFα-stimulated cells (Fig. 1E). SNARK Is an NF-κB-regulated Gene—Induction of SNARK mRNA was direct because it could not be inhibited by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 2A). Also, the increase of SNARK mRNA was because of direct transcriptional activation rather than stabilization of mRNA because induction of SNARK could efficiently be blocked by actinomycin D (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, similar to TNFα and CD95 ligand treatment of MCF7-FB cells, TRAIL induced NF-κB activation in MCF7-FB cells (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) but only weakly induced SNARK mRNA (Fig. 2B). Because 12 of 17 induced genes in the gene screen were known NF-κB-regulated genes, we tested whether inhibition of NF-κB would prevent up-regulation of SNARK (Fig. 2C). MCF7-FB cells were pretreated with the specific membrane-permeable NF-κB inhibitor, Tat-IκBmut, described recently (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). CD95-induced up-regulation of SNARK was completely abolished by this reagent, confirming that activation of NF-κB is required for CD95-induced transcriptional activation of SNARK. This regulation was similar to a classical NF-κB target gene, ICAM-1. Finally, we found that the caspase-8 activity induced in the apoptosis-resistant MCF7-FB cells (13Stegh A.H. Barnhart B.C. Volkland J. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Ke N. Reed J.C. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4351-4360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) does not play a significant role in the induction of SNARK; this is because preincubation of cells with the oligo caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit up-regulation of SNARK mRNA (Fig. 2D, upper panel), although it blocked processing of caspase-8 in this experiment (Fig. 2D, lower panel). In summary, we have identified SNARK as a transcriptionally induced gene in CD95-stimulated cells. Its activation depends critically on activation of NF-κB, making it a potential mediator of the novel CD95 tumorigenic activities. Kinase-inactive SNARK Sensitizes Cells to CD95-mediated Apoptosis—We overexpressed the cloned human SNARK kinase in 293T cells and determined that it is an active kinase with typical autophosphorylation properties and with an apparent size of 70 kDa (Fig. 3A). In this experiment we also detected a phosphorylated protein in control-transfected cells that comigrated with immunoprecipitated untagged SNARK, which was likely corresponding to active endogenous SNARK in these cells (Fig. 3A, lane 5). To determine the function of endogenous SNARK in apoptosis, we generated a kinase-inactive mutant (Fig. 3B). This mutant was generated by replacing lysine 82, a highly conserved position in the AMP kinase family, with arginine, causing it to act in a dominant negative fashion when overexpressed (17Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Viollet B. Andreelli F. Jorgensen S.B. Perrin C. Geloen A. Flamez D. Mu J. Lenzner C. Baud O. Bennoun M. Gomas E. Nicolas G. Wojtaszewski J.F. Kahn A. Carling D. Schuit F.C. Birnbaum M.J. Richter E.A. Burcelin R. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The kinase function of the K82R mutant of SNARK was inactive, as it did not undergo autophosphorylation (Fig. 3B). It also did not phosphorylate a substrate comprising a fusion protein of GST with the SAMS peptide, which is the optimal sequence for phosphorylation by members of the AMP kinase family (19Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). We then overexpressed either SNARK or SNARK K82R in the renal cell carcinoma cell line ACHN (12Algeciras-Schimnich A. Pietras E.M. Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Vijayan S. Holbeck S.L. Peter M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which expressed endogenous SNARK (data not shown) and induced apoptosis with either anti-APO-1 or LzCD95L. ACHN cells were significantly protected by the expression of SNARK. This inhibition was dependent on the kinase activity of SNARK because SNARK K82R could not protect cells from CD95-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, SNARK K82R rendered cells even more susceptible to CD95-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that endogenous SNARK, which is induced upon triggering these cells through CD95 (data not shown), was inhibited in a dominant negative manner by the overexpressed mutant of SNARK. Transient overexpression of SNARK also protected another renal cell carcinoma cell line, CAKI-1 (12Algeciras-Schimnich A. Pietras E.M. Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Vijayan S. Holbeck S.L. Peter M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), from both CD95 ligand and TRAIL-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, our data suggested that SNARK is an NF-κB-regulated, CD95-inducible kinase that renders cells resistant to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. This activity is consistent with other CD95-induced genes that we recently found were up-regulated in CD95-stimulated, apoptosis-resistant cells (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Many of these genes were anti-apoptotic and/or potentially tumorigenic. SNARK Is an Anti-apoptotic Gene Required for CD95-induced Increase of Motility and Invasiveness of CD95 Apoptosis-resistant Tumor Cells—To directly determine the function of SNARK as a CD95-regulated gene, we reduced the expression of SNARK using siRNAs. Using RT-PCR, ACHN cells were found to express endogenous SNARK (Fig. 4A, lane 1); however, expression could be enhanced by treating cells with LzCD95L (Fig. 4, lane 2). Treating the cells with two independent siRNAs (siSNARK and an siRNA SMARTpool) for 24 h resulted in a significant reduction of SNARK mRNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). ACHN cells treated with either of the SNARK siRNAs rendered them more sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4B). SNARK also inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis. ACHN cells treated with SNARK siRNA were significantly more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). These experiments confirmed the anti-apoptotic activity of endogenous SNARK for death receptor-induced apoptosis. SNARK was one of only 17 CD95-induced genes in MCF7-FB cells, which respond to CD95 triggering with increased motility and invasiveness. We therefore tested whether the loss of SNARK would inhibit the CD95-mediated migration and invasiveness characteristics of these cells. As reported previously, MCF7-FB cells responded to stimulation with LzCD95L with up-regulation of typical NF-κB target genes such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), A20, and SNARK (Fig. 4D, lanes 1 and 2). Treating the cells with either of the siRNAs directed at the SNARK mRNA resulted in a significantly reduced up-regulation of SNARK without affecting induction of uPA or A20 (Fig. 4D, lanes 3 and 4). We then subjected siRNA SNARK-treated MCF7-FB cells to motility and invasiveness assays, as described recently (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Both CD95-induced motility and invasiveness were severely reduced in siSNARK-treated cells without affecting the general viability of these cells (data not shown), identifying SNARK as a gene that regulates this novel non-apoptotic activity of CD95. Stress induced by treatment with AMP or glucose deprivation activates human and rat SNARK (9Lefebvre D.L. Bai Y. Shahmolky N. Sharma M. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Rosen C.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Minegichi Y. Ogura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We incubated MCF7 cells with 200 μm AMP but did not observe activation of SNARK (data not shown). Both AMPK and another member of the AMPK family, ARK5, which shows 55% overall homology with SNARK including 84% identity within the N-terminal kinase domain, were recently described as having anti-apoptotic activity (11Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Blazquez C. Geelen M.J. Velasco G. Guzman M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ARK5 rendered cells more resistant to TNFα, TRAIL, and glucose deprivation. It was therefore postulated that ARK5 could promote tumor cell survival during nutrient starvation. The recent recognition that CD95 has a tumorigenic activity on tumor cells both in vitro (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) as well as in vivo (5Lee J.K. Sayers T.J. Back T.C. Wigginton J.M. Wiltrout R.H. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggests the existence of protumorigenic genes that are induced in response to CD95 stimulation. SNARK induction requires activation of NF-κB, which is critical for the CD95 protumorigenic activities (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that uPA, one of the NF-κB-regulated genes induced by CD95, is critical for the CD95-induced motility and invasiveness of apoptosis-resistant tumor cells. Blocking the activity of uPA blocked the ability of cells to invade in response to CD95 stimulation (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). SNARK is the second of the recently identified CD95-induced genes tested, and siRNA-induced down-modulation of SNARK demonstrated that SNARK, too, is important for the novel CD95-dependent tumorigenic activities. Knocking down SNARK seemed to render cells more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis then apoptosis triggered through CD95. Although SNARK is induced by CD95 stimulation, it may not play its role as an anti-apoptotic factor predominantly in CD95-mediated apoptosis. CD95 apoptosis resistance can be achieved in many ways by tumor cells. 3M. E. Peter, P. Legembre, and B. C. Barnhart, submitted for publication. Our data suggest that stimulating CD95 on tumor cells that are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis with whatever mechanism can up-regulate tumorigenic genes, such as SNARK, may give these cells further protection to CD95-mediated apoptosis. This stimulation can also give tumor cells resistance to other apoptosis inducers (e.g. TRAIL) and induce tumorigenic pathways that can cause increased motility and invasiveness. Reducing the expression of SNARK did not affect the expression of uPA, suggesting that SNARK is not required for the induction of uPA. The fact that CD95 activates at least five different nonapoptotic signaling pathways independently (4Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E.M. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), resulting in the induction of multiple genes, suggests that the regulation of these activities is complex. Future work will have to determine how many genes and pathways are involved in the regulation of these activities, ultimately giving a better understanding of the nonapoptotic functions of CD95 in cancer cells. We thank Drs. P. Krammer, H. Walczak, S. Nagata, and G. Franzoso for providing anti-APO-1, LzCD95L, Lz-TRAIL, the sCD95L construct, and the NF-κB inhibitor, respectively. We are grateful to X.

B Enzym. 1999; 6: 199-214Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, epoxides are frequently found as intermediates in the catabolic pathways of various xenobiotics, including unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (2Zou J. Hallberg B.M.

Academic Press, New York1982: 207-208Google Scholar). These intermediates are potentially harmful as the oxirane moiety of epoxides is electrophilically reactive and can form adducts with various cellular components including DNA, RNA, proteins, and other small molecules (5Archelas A. Furstoss R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 108-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6van Hylckama Vlieg J.E.T. Janssen D.B. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 85: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); hence, it is vital for the biological system to detoxify these reactive species. Together with the conjugation reaction catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases, conversion of epoxides by EHs into chemically and toxicologically less active diols constitutes the major mechanism for detoxification in mammalian systems (5Archelas A. Furstoss R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 108-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although mammalian EHs have been extensively studied for detoxification, interest in microbial EHs has arisen primarily because of the potential of the enzymes as enantioselective biocatalysts (1Weijers C.A.G.M. de Bont J.A.M. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 1999; 6: 199-214Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Faber K. Mischitz M. Kroutil W. Acta Chem. Scand. 1996; 50: 249-258Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Steinreiber A. Faber K. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is also of interest to investigate the detoxification role of microbial EHs and genetically adapt this universally successful detoxification strategy to the process of aerobic, cometabolic biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes in which toxic epoxides form as the primary intermediates (6van Hylckama Vlieg J.E.T. Janssen D.B. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 85: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Chlorinated ethenes, such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE), constitute a large group of priority pollutants (126 chemicals from the U.S. Clean Water Act) (9Bradley P.M.

Because they are toxic, it is critical to remediate these compounds (11Henschler D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1920-1935Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whereas reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes under anaerobic conditions has the risk of accumulation of the well known carcinogen, vinyl chloride (11Henschler D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

TOM-Green originated from the first DNA shuffling of a non-heme monooxygenase and has enhanced activity for both TCE degradation and naphthalene oxidation due to a single amino acid substitution, V106A, in TomA3 (26Canada K.A.

In contrast to glutathione S-transferases, which require glutathione as the cofactor for their enzymatic activity (27Vuilleumier S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EHs do not require a cofactor (1Weijers C.A.G.M. de Bont J.A.M. J. Mol. Catal.

Nevertheless, a number of microorganisms contain EHs with various substrate ranges (28Jacobs M.H. Van den Wijngaard A.J. Pentenga M. Janssen D.B. Eur. J.

Hence, it was investigated here whether an epoxide hydrolase could be tuned to accept chlorinated epoxyethanes as a substrate. The EH from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (EchA, Gen-Bank™ accession number Y12804) (35Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was chosen for protein engineering because its physiological substrate, epichlorohydrin (2-chloropropylene oxide), resembles chlorinated epoxyethanes. EchA (294 amino acids) contains a core domain with typical α/β hydrolase fold topology formed by an eight-stranded β-sheet sandwiched by α-helices and an α-helical cap domain protruding from the core domain (36Nardini M.

The catalytic triad residues Asp-107, Asp-246, and His-275 are located in a hydrophobic internal cavity between the two domains (36Nardini M. Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Rink R. Janssen D.B.

The catalytic reaction follows a two-step mechanism involving an alkyl-enzyme ester intermediate, which is further hydrolyzed via the attack of a water molecule (36Nardini M. Ridder I.S.

We reasoned that the substrate range of the enzyme may be tailored to accept a chlorinated epoxyethane based on the three-dimensional structure of EchA (PDB accession code 1EHY) (36Nardini M.

Saturation mutagenesis was used rather than site-directed mutagenesis to introduce all possible mutations at one site to explore a larger fraction of the protein sequence space (41Sakamoto T. Joern J.M. Arisawa A. Arnold F.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3882-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is the first report of targeted mutagenesis of epoxide hydrolases at these positions, of an epoxide hydrolase with activity toward chlorinated epoxyethanes, and of enhancement of cis-DCE degradation by combining an evolved monooxygenase and evolved epoxide hydrolase to detoxify the reactive intermediates. Chemicals, Organisms, and Growth Conditions—All materials were of highest purity available and purchased from Fisher Scientific Company (Pittsburgh, PA) except for epichlorohydrin (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ), betaine (Sigma), and cis-DCE (TCI America, Inc., Portland, OR). E. coli TG1 (42.Gibson, T. J. (1984) Studies on the Epstein-Barr Virus Genome. Ph.D. thesis, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar) was used for cloning and gene expression. Recombinant strains were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with kanamycin (Kan, 100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (Cam, 50 μg/ml) to maintain plasmids unless otherwise stated. All whole-cell experiments used LB + Kan + Cam cultures inoculated from single, fresh colonies; exponential phase cells were harvested at an optical density at 600 nm (A) of ∼1.5. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.5 mm) was used to induce TOM-Green that was under control of the tac-lacUV5 tandem promoter in plasmid pMMB206 (44Morales V.M. Backman A. Bagdasarian M. Gene. 1991; 97: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and also to induce EchA under control of the lac promoter in pBS(Kan) (26Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); IPTG was added at an A of 0.2–0.3 for 2 h. The exponentially grown cells were washed three times with one volume of Tris-HNO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) to remove interfering byproducts and trace chloride (26Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis and Molecular Techniques—Total cellular protein for the exponentially growing culture was determined with the Total Protein kit (Sigma), and expression of recombinant proteins was analyzed with standard Laemmli discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Midi or Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified with a Wizard® PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.). E. coli was transformed using electroporation with a Gene Pulser/Pulse Controller (Bio-Rad) at 15 kV/cm, 25 μF, and 200 Ω. PCR Amplification and Plasmid Construction—To stably and constitutively express the EH from A. radiobacter AD1, the echA gene was amplified by PCR using plasmid pEH20 (35Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as the template with the forward primer 5′-ATAGCGGTACCACAACGGTTTCCCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTGCTGTCGACCAGTCATGCTAGCC-3′, where underlining indicates the KpnI and SalI restriction enzyme sites, respectively. The PCR amplification was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using a PCR program of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR fragment was double digested with KpnI and SalI and ligated into pBS(Kan) at the same restriction sites, yielding pBS(Kan)EH (Fig. 2). The six genes, tomA0-tomA5, of TOM-Green were obtained from plasmid pBS(Kan)TOM-Green (26Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) after EcoRI and PvuI restriction digestion and purification from an agarose gel. The resulting 5345-bp fragment was ligated into pMMB206 after digestion with the same restriction enzymes, resulting in pMMB206-TOM-Green (Fig. 2). Saturation Mutagenesis of EchA—A gene library encoding all possible amino acids at positions Phe-108, Ile-111, Ile-219, and Cys-248 of EchA in pBS(Kan)EH was constructed by replacing the target codon with NNN via overlap extension PCR (41Sakamoto T. Joern J.M. Arisawa A. Arnold F.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3882-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Four pairs of degenerate primers, Phe-108 Front/Phe-108 Rear, Ile-111 Front/Ile-111 Rear, Ile-219 Front/Ile-219 Rear, and Cys-248 Front/Cys-248 Rear (Table I) were designed to randomize codons Phe-108, Ile-111, Ile-219, and Cys-248 in the nucleotide sequence, respectively. Two additional primers for cloning were EH Front and EH Rear (Table I), which were upstream and downstream of the natural KpnI and SacI restriction sites flanking the echA gene (Fig. 2). To minimize random point mutations, Pfu DNA polymerase was used in the PCR. Addition of betaine (1 m) in the PCR mixture was used to improve the amplification of DNA by reducing the formation of secondary structure in the GC-rich region when necessary (45Baskaran N. Kandpal R.P. Bhargava A.K. Glynn M.W. Bale A. Weissman S.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the first round of saturation mutagenesis, pBS(Kan)EH was used as the template, and mutagenesis was performed individually at sites Phe-108, Ile-111, Ile-219, and Cys-248. In the second round of mutagenesis, pBS(Kan)EH C248I (containing amino acid substitution Cys-248I in EchA) was used as the template and sites Phe-108 and Ile-219 were randomized individually. In the third round, pBS(Kan)EH F108L/C248I (containing amino acid substitutions F108L and C248I in EchA) was used as the template and site Ile-219 was subjected to saturation mutagenesis. Two degenerate PCR fragments were produced for each site with 463 and 749 bp for site Phe-108, 457 and 754 bp for site Ile-111, 800 and 414 bp for site Ile-219, and 853 and 327 bp for site Cys-248. After purifying from agarose gels, the two fragments for each site were combined at a 1:1 ratio as templates to obtain the full-length PCR product with the EH Front and EH Rear primers. The resulting randomized PCR product (1167 bp) was cloned into pBS(Kan)EH after double digestion with KpnI and SacI, replacing the corresponding fragment in the original plasmid.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for saturation mutagenesis at positions Phe-108, Ile-111, Ile-219, and Cys-248 of EchAPrimerSequencesPhe-108 FrontAGGCGTACGTCGTTGGCCATGACNNNGCGGCCATCPhe-108 RearTTATGGAGGACGATGGCCGCGNNNTCATGGCCAACIle-111 FrontACGTCGTTGGCCATGACTTCGCGGCCNNNGTCCTCCIle-111 RearATGAATTTATGGAGGACNNNGGCCGCGAAGTCATGIle-219 FrontCTTCAACTACTATCGTGCCAACNNNAGGCCCGATGIle-219 RearACAGAGCGGCATCGGGCCTNNNGTTGGCACGATAGCys-248 FrontATATGGGGTTTGGGAGATACTNNNGTGCCCTATGCCys-248 RearTCAATGAGTGGAGCATAGGGCACNNNAGTATCTCCEH FrontaUtilizing the natural KpnI restriction site upstream of echA.AGCTATGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCEH RearbUtilizing the natural SacI restriction site downstream of echA.CGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAa Utilizing the natural KpnI restriction site upstream of echA.b Utilizing the natural SacI restriction site downstream of echA. Open table in a new tab Screening for Enhanced cis-DCE Degradation—Evolved EchA activity toward cis-DCE epoxide was found indirectly by monitoring the concentration of chloride ion released from cis-DCE epoxide (generated by TOM-Green oxidation of cis-DCE) degradation by the evolved EchA (Fig. 1). TG1 cells harboring plasmids pMMB206-TOM-Green and pBS(Kan)EH variants were grown in 96-well plates, washed three times with Tris-HNO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0), and contacted with shaking at 37 °C in an airtight chamber, 23 × 20 × 23 cm, with cis-DCE vapor (2 ml) for 18 h. The inorganic chloride ions generated from the mineralization of cis-DCE by whole cells were detected by adding 40 μl of 0.25 m Fe(NH4)(SO4)2 in 9 m HNO3 and 40 μl of saturated Hg(SCN)2 in 95% ethanol to the 200 μl of supernatant in each well of the 96-well plate and measured at 450 nm (26Canada K.A. Iwashita S. Shim H. Wood T.K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Extent and Kinetics of cis-DCE Mineralization—For determining the extent of mineralization of cis-DCE (as indicated by Cl– production) from the best colonies identified by the 96-well screening, the exponentially growing cells were washed three times with Tris-HNO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0). Then the cell suspension (2.5 ml) was adjusted to an A of 3, sealed in 15-ml glass serum vials, and contacted with cis-DCE at an initial liquid concentration of 540 μm (based on a Henry's Law constant of 0.17 (46Dolfing J. van den Wijngaard A.J. Janssen D.B. Biodegradation. 1993; 4: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). 2.5 μmol of cis-DCE was injected into the cells in 5 μl of dimethyl formamide (DMF) at 0.2 vol%. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added along with 5 mm sodium succinate (as a substrate to produce NADH). After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C and 250 rpm, the whole-cell reaction was quenched by heating the vials in boiling water for 90 s and centrifuging (16,000 × g, 4 min) to collect the supernatant. Chloride ion concentrations in 500 μl of supernatant were measured spectrophotometrically at 460 nm as indicated above. Cells contacted with the same amount of DMF were used as the negative control, and at least three independent experiments were analyzed. To determine the kinetics of cis-DCE mineralization, the A of the cell culture was 1.2, and the initial cis-DCE concentrations were 6.8 to 540 μm (using different stock solutions of 6.25, 25, 125, and 500 mm in DMF at 0.2–0.4 vol%). The supernatant chloride ion concentrations generated from mineralizing cis-DCE for each concentration were measured at 9 min for 6.8 and 13.5 μm, 15 min for 27 μm, 21 min for 54 μm, 38 min for 135 μm, 56 min for 270 μm, and 67 min for 540 μm. The contacting times were varied to detect significant Cl– while maintaining the mineralization rate in the linear range for each cis-DCE concentration. Parallel experiments determining the cis-DCE degradation rate were conducted using gas chromatography (GC) to monitor cis-DCE depletion as described previously (25Shim H. Wood T.K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 70: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Headspace samples from the same cell suspensions contacted with cis-DCE at various concentrations in the cis-DCE kinetics experiments were analyzed before the cells were quenched to determine Cl– production. Purification of EchA—Both wild-type EchA and variant F108L/I219L/C248I were expressed in TG1/pBS(Kan) for enzyme purification, and the method of Rink et al. (35Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was adopted with modification. Exponentially growing precultures were diluted 1:100 in 3 liters of fresh Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml Kan and incubated with shaking at 37 °C. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added when the cell A reached 0.3, and the culture was incubated at 25 °C overnight with aeration. Cells were harvested, washed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min with TEMAG buffer (10 mm Tris-SO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% sodium azide, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5), and resuspended in 30 ml of the same buffer. Cells were disrupted by a French® pressure cell press (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min. Anion exchange was performed by applying 30 ml of the supernatant to 30 ml of DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) (47Spelberg J.H.L. Rink R. Kellogg R.M. Janssen D.B. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and proteins were eluted with a continuous gradient ammonium sulfate in TEMAG (0–1 m). Fractions with the highest enzymatic activity were pooled and dialyzed against TEMAG buffer overnight at 4 °C and were further purified via size exclusion chromatography by adding 1.5 ml to 80 ml of Sephacryl S-100 HR (Sigma). Fractions with purified EchA (with the highest EH activity and the highest purity as visualized on SDS-PAGE) were pooled and dialyzed against TEMAG buffer overnight. The final product was stored at –20 °C with glycerol (10% v/v) for future use; variant F108L/I219L/C248I and wild-type enzyme were purified from 10% to 80 and 90%, respectively. Activity of column fractions was determined using a polypropylene 96-well plate format with styrene oxide (5 mm) as the substrate rather than the reported epichlorohydrin (35Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Column fractions (10 μl) were added to 136 μl of TE buffer and incubated with 5 mm styrene oxide at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by the sequential addition of 100 mm 4-nitrobenzylpyridine (75 μl) and triethylamine (75 μl). The chromogenic reaction of styrene oxide with 4-nitrobenzylpyridine was measured at 620 nm with a Multiskan reader (Fisher Scientific), and disappearance of the blue color indicated the disappearance of styrene oxide. EH Assays—As a preliminary assay, whole cells of TG1/pBS(Kan)EH (grown in Luria-Bertani broth + 100 μg/ml Kan) were tested for EchA activity in E. coli using a chromogenic reaction of the epoxide epichlorohydrin with 4-nitrobenzylpyridin (35Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes with 100 μl of exponentially grown cells contacted with 10 mm epichlorohydrin in 400 μl of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-SO4, 1 mm EDT"

Acting in concert with transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP, the Smads mediate TGF-β stimulation of collagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts. Little information exists regarding positive and negative modulation of physiological TGF-β responses. Because the tumor suppressor p53 is implicated in connective tissue homeostasis, here we examined the regulation of collagen gene expression by p53. Forced expression of ectopic p53 in dermal fibroblasts repressed basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen gene expression, whereas the absence of cellular p53 was associated with significantly enhanced transcriptional activity of the Type I collagen gene (COL1A2) and collagen synthesis. Ectopic expression of p53 also repressed TGF-β stimulation of promoter activity driven by minimal Smad-binding elements, suggesting that p53 modulated Smad-dependent intracellular signaling. Inhibition was not due to altered levels, phosphorylation, or nuclear translocation of cellular Smads. Treatment of fibroblasts with etoposide, a potent inducer of cellular p53, abrogated TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 promoter activity and collagen synthesis in a p53-dependent manner. Overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator p300 rescued TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 promoter activity in fibroblasts overexpressing p53. Furthermore, the ligand-induced interaction of cellular Smad3 with p300 or with its cognate Smad-binding DNA element and recruitment of p300 to the DNA-protein complex assembled on the Smad-binding element were markedly reduced in p53-overexpressing fibroblasts. Collectively, these results indicate, for the first time, that p53 is a potent and selective endogenous repressor of TGF-β-regulated collagen gene expression in dermal fibroblasts. The ligand-dependent interaction of Smad3 with p300 may be one of the targets of p53-mediated inhibition of TGF-β responses.

In a variety of mesenchymal cells, TGF-β induces the synthesis of collagens and other extracellular matrix components and is thus a pivotal contributor to pathological fibrosis (1Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of major extracellular matrix gene expression in response to TGF-β are the subject of intense investigation (2Ghosh A.K. Exp. Biol.

Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1703-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and references therein). The Smad family consists of eight members that can be classified into three subgroups based on their structure and function. Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8 are receptor-activated Smads, or R-Smads; Smad4 is a co-Smad; and Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory (4Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Smad3 was responsible for mediating TGF-β-induced stimulation of collagen synthesis in skin fibroblasts, whereas Smad7 abrogated this response (5Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator p300 physically and functionally interacted with Smad3 in a ligand-dependent manner and played a major role in Smad-dependent stimulation of collagen gene expression (6Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S-J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control the magnitude or duration of Smad-dependent TGF-β-mediated cellular responses are only partially understood. Because deregulated TGF-β signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in scleroderma and related conditions (8Varga J. Mori Y. Takagawa S. Semin. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 2: 15-29Google Scholar), identification and characterization of transcriptional cofactors that modulate this process is important. The tumor suppressor p53 is a short lived nuclear phosphoprotein that is mutated in a majority of human cancers. It plays important roles in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and senescence (9Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 424-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gudkov A.V. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1196-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These activities of p53 are mediated through inhibition or stimulation of target gene expression during cell cycle (11Levine A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 113: 1661-1670Google Scholar, 12Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Whereas activation of transcription by p53 is generally due to its direct interaction with regulatory cis-elements of target genes, repression involves protein-protein interaction between p53 and other transcription factors, modulation of the activity of the transcriptional coactivator p300, or recruitment of histone deacetylase in the transcriptional complex (9Somasundaram K.

Recent studies suggest that the tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in regulating extracellular matrix homeostasis. Ectopic expression of p53 in fibroblasts inhibited the formation of fibronectin fibrils (21Alexandrova A. Ivanov A. Chumakov P. Kopnin B. Vasiliev J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of p53 expression in HeLa cells resulted in increased fibronectin synthesis (22Iotsova V. Stehelin D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 629-634PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 has been shown to repress plasminogen activator (PA) and stimulate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene expression in mesenchymal cells (13Kunz C. Pebler S. Otte J. von der Ahe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3710-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In mouse skin fibroblasts, wild type p53, but not its mutants, repressed the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-13, while stimulating the synthesis of MMP-2 (23Bian J. Sun Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Sun Y. Sun Y. Wegner L. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cheung H.S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transcription of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) gene was repressed by p53 (27Loging W.T. Reisman D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7608-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results, indicating that p53 can positively or negatively modulate the expression of multiple extracellular matrix genes, suggest a novel function for p53 in physiological regulation of connective tissue homeostasis. The significance and molecular mechanisms underlying p53 regulation of extracellular matrix gene expression are largely unknown. The p53 protein undergoes activation via site-specific phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and acetylation in response to different forms of cellular stresses (9Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 424-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.F. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of p53 is also regulated via its degradation and subcellular localization (29Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Complex interactions between p53 and the TGF-β signaling pathway have been demonstrated. It has been shown that p53 modulates TGF-β-mediated stimulation or inhibition of cellular proliferation (30Miyazaki M. Ohashi R. Tsuji T. Mihara K. Gohda E. Namba M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Dkhissi F. Raynal S. Jullien P. Lawrence D.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although p53 is known to modulate the expression of extracellular matrix protein genes and regulate TGF-β responses, the physiologic role of p53 in Smad-dependent TGF-β regulation of collagen gene expression has not been examined. We now report that expression of ectopic p53 in normal dermal fibroblasts resulted in repression of TGF-β-stimulated collagen gene transcription and Smad-dependent responses. In contrast, the TGF-β-induced PAI-1 promoter activity was enhanced by overexpressed p53, in agreement with a previous report (32Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Type I collagen gene (COL1A2) promoter activity and collagen synthesis were significantly increased in murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53, indicating the physiological significance of cellular p53 in regulation of collagen gene expression. Etoposide, an inducer of p53 expression, repressed collagen synthesis in wild type but not in p53-null fibroblasts. Repression of Smad-dependent TGF-β responses was not due to alteration in the expression levels, phosphorylation, or nuclear translocation of Smads. Transient overexpression of p300 rescued TGF-β-induced COL1A2 promoter stimulation in the presence of p53. Furthermore, induction of cellular p53 resulted in repression of TGF-β-induced Smad3 interaction with the Smad-binding element and with p300. Collectively, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that cellular p53 is a potent negative modulator of TGF-β signaling, with potentially important role in regulating fibrotic responses in normal dermal fibroblasts. These results extend the range of biological activities attributed to p53. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of human dermal fibroblasts were established from anonymous newborn foreskin specimens (5Chen S-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from p53-null and wild type mice were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% vitamins, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Primary fibroblasts were used at passages 3–8. Plasmids—The COL1A2-CAT reporter constructs containing human COL1A2 promoter fragments with 5′ end points at –772, –353, –186, and –108 have been described previously (33Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The p53-luc reporter construct contains 14 copies of the minimal p53 response element in front of a basic promoter element and luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The –460 PAI-1-CAT construct contains –460 bp of the human PAI-1 promoter (34Vulin A.G. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20169-20176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The SBE4-TK-luc construct contains four copies of the consensus Smad-binding elements in front of TK and luciferase reporter (35Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The COL1A2-CAGA-TK-luc construct contains six copies of the COL1A2 CAGACA element in front of the TK promoter and luciferase reporter (36Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The pCI p300 construct contains the full-length p300 cDNA (37Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-N-FLAG-Smad3 encodes full-length Smad3 in the pEGFPN1 expression vector (38Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Wild type CMV-pC53-SN3 and mutant CMV-p53–175 (Arg to His at 175), CMV-p53–248 (Arg to Trp at 248), and CMV-p53–273 (Arg to His at 273) p53 constructs were made by inserting wild type or mutant p53 cDNA in the pCMVNeo-Bam expression vector (14Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The p53–213 (Arg to stop codon at 213) and p53–239 (Asp to Ser at 239) constructs were made by inserting rheumatoid synovium-derived mutant p53 cDNA in pCI vector (39Han Z. Boyle D.L. Shi Y. Green D.R. Firestein G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1088-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections and Reporter Assays—Dermal fibroblasts or MEFs grown in 6-well or 12-well clusters were transiently transfected using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions, and CAT or luciferase assays were performed as described previously (40Ghosh A.K. Bhattacharyya S. Lakos G. Chen S.-J. Mori Y. Varga J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs were transfected along with expression vectors or appropriate empty vectors and Renilla luciferase expression vector pRLTK-LUC as an internal standard. Transfected cells were incubated in fresh Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without TGF-β2 (12.5 ng/ml) (Genzyme Corp., Framingham, MA) or etoposide (0.1–1 μm) (Sigma). Following a further 48-h incubation, fibroblasts were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared using 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp, Madison, WI) and used for determination of CAT or luciferase activities. The results were normalized with protein concentrations, and transfection efficiency was monitored by measuring Renilla luciferase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated two or three times with consistent results. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared from dermal fibroblasts or MEFs using lysis buffer (Promega) or M-Per mammalian protein extraction buffer (Pierce) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. Nuclear extracts or cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from transfected or etoposide-treated dermal fibroblasts as described previously (41Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins (10–25 μg) or conditioned media (40 μl) were resolved by electrophoresis on 4–20% Tris/glycine gradient gels (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated as described previously (7Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S-J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 10% fat-free milk in TBST buffer and incubated with antibodies against human Type I collagen (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), PAI-1 (H-135), p53 (DO-1), Smad7 (N-19), Smad4 (B8), Smad1/2/3 (H2), or actin (C-2) or p300 (C-20) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or Smad 3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or p-Smad2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The membranes were washed with TBST buffer and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with TBST, membranes were treated with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR5 film. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Confluent fibroblasts were incubated with TGF-β in the presence or absence of etoposide (1 μm). At the end of incubation, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described (7Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S-J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For this purpose, equal aliquots (5 μg) were incubated for 30 min in binding buffer in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitors. Antibody super-shift assays were performed using anti-Smad3 antibody (I-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control IgG. Radiolabeled Smad-binding element (SBE) probes were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for another 30 min, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were then dried and exposed for autoradiographs. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assays—The presence of Smad3 and p300 in the DNA-binding complex assembled on the SBE probe was examined by DNA-protein interaction assays (42Deng W.-G. Zhu Y. Montero A. Wu K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts incubated with TGF-β for 1 h in the presence or absence of etoposide (1 μm) were harvested, nuclear extracts were prepared, and equal amounts of protein (∼200 μg) were incubated with biotin-labeled double-stranded SBE probes for 30 min. At the end of incubation, 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (4%) with 50% slurry (Sigma) were added, and mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. The streptavidin-agarose beads were precipitated by centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and bead-bound proteins were resuspended in SDS-loading buffer followed by electrophoresis on 4–20% denaturing gels. Gels were processed for immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Smad3 and p300 as above. The p53 levels in nuclear extract were determined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against p53 or Smad4. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical differences between experimental and control groups were determined by analysis of variance, and a value of p < 0.05 by Student's t test was considered significant. Forced Expression of p53 Selectively Inhibits Type I Collagen Synthesis and Abrogates Its Stimulation by TGF-β—In addition to its well characterized role as a tumor suppressor, p53 is increasingly recognized as a regulator of extracellular matrix synthesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying these important effects of p53 are largely unknown. To characterize the effects of p53 on collagen synthesis, normal dermal fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression vector for p53 or empty vector, followed by incubation with TGF-β (12.5 ng/ml). At the end of the 48-h incubation, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The results showed that whereas TGF-β induced a marked increase in collagen, as expected, ectopic expression of p53 resulted in significantly reduced cellular levels of collagen both in the presence and absence of TGF-β (Fig. 1A). The cellular levels of actin remained unaltered, and no effect on cell viability and protein concentration was seen. To investigate the mechanism of collagen gene regulation by p53, fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression vector for p53 or appropriate empty vector, along with the 772COL1A2-CAT or 460PAI-1-CAT reporter constructs or p53-luc as positive controls. After a 48-h incubation with TGF-β, cultures were harvested, and CAT or luciferase activities were determined. The results of transient transfection assays showed that ectopic expression of p53 resulted in repression of basal COL1A2 promoter-driven transcriptional activity and prevented its stimulation induced by TGF-β (Fig. 1B, left panel). The inhibitory effect of p53 appeared to be specific for the COL1A2 promoter, since under identical experimental conditions, the basal and TGF-β-induced activities of PAI-1 promoter (containing a consensus p53 binding element) were stimulated by p53 (Fig. 1B, middle panel). The activity of p53-luc, a minimal reporter construct driven by p53 response elements, was increased by 2-fold (Fig. 1B, right panels), and no effect on TK promoter activity was noted (data not shown). In order to investigate the mechanistic basis for p53-mediated transcriptional repression, well characterized mutants of p53 were used in transiently transfected fibroblasts. The results showed that forced expression of tumor-derived p53 mutants unable to bind to DNA (14Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) resulted in a substantial decrease in TGF-β-induced stimulation of COL1A2 promoter activity (Fig. 1C, left panel). In contrast, ectopic expression of dominant negative mutants derived from rheumatoid synovium (39Han Z. Boyle D.L. Shi Y. Green D.R. Firestein G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1088-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) failed to abrogate TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 1C, right panel), despite comparable expression levels of wild type and mutant p53. Because these p53 mutants are also unable to bind to DNA (43Kaku S. Albor A. Kulesz-Martin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the results indicate that repression of COL1A2 by p53 is independent of direct DNA interaction. Etoposide-induced Cellular p53 Abrogates TGF-β Stimulation of COL1A2 Promoter Activity and Collagen Synthesis— Etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, is a potent stimulus for p53 accumulation in a variety of cell types. Etoposide has been shown to regulate the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, p21, and other p53 target genes (23Bian J. Sun Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Sun Y. Sun Y. Wegner L. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cheung H.S. J. Biol.

In order to examine the role of cellular p53 in regulation of collagen gene expression, fibroblasts transiently transfected with 772COL1A2-CAT reporter construct were incubated with etoposide (0.1–1 μm) in the presence and absence of TGF-β. After 48 h, fibroblasts were harvested, and CAT activities were determined. Etoposide by itself had only minimal effect on the activity of transfected 772COL1A2-CAT, but it abrogated TGF-β-induced stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Next, the effect of etoposide on cellular collagen levels was examined. The results showed that treatment of fibroblasts with etoposide for 48 h substantially attenuated TGF-β-induced stimulation of collagen synthesis (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the levels of basal as well as TGF-β-induced PAI-1 were elevated in fibroblasts incubated with etoposide (Fig. 2B). The expression of p53 was induced by etoposide, as expected. At the concentrations used, etoposide had no effect on cellular viability, protein levels, or pRLTK promoter activity (data not shown). Together, these results indicated that etoposide-induced stimulation of cellular p53 was associated with selective repression of basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen gene expression in dermal fibroblasts. Etoposide has multiple effects in addition to enhancing cellular p53. To further investigate the physiological significance of cellular p53 in the regulation of COL1A2 promoter activity, MEFs lacking p53 were used. For this purpose, wild type or p53-null MEFs were transiently transfected with 772COL1A2-CAT and incubated with etoposide (1 μm) in the absence or presence of TGF-β. At the end of a 48-h incubation, cells were harvested, and CAT activities were determined. The results of transient transfection assays revealed that in unstimulated p53-null MEFs, COL1A2 promoter activity was 3-fold higher than in wild type controls (Fig. 3A). Forced expression of ectopic p53 repressed basal and TGF-β-induced promoter activity to a comparable degree in both wild type and p53-null MEFs (data not shown). In contrast, whereas etoposide caused significant inhibition of TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 promoter activity in wild type MEFs (∼90%), in p53-null MEFs etoposide was completely unable to reduce TGF-β stimulatory response (Fig. 3A). The regulation of endogenous collagen synthesis by cellular p53 was next studied in wild type and p53-null MEFs. The MEFs were incubated with etoposide in the presence and absence of TGF-β for 48 h, and culture supernatants were analyzed by Western immunoblot. The results showed that levels of basal and TGF-β-induced Type I collagen were significantly higher in p53-null MEFs compared with wild type controls. Furthermore, incubation of MEFs with etoposide failed to repress the basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen synthesis in the absence of cellula"

Prior studies identified the human ATR and showed that defects in its encoding gene underlie cblB methylmalonic aciduria. Here two common polymorphic variants of the ATR that are found in normal individuals are expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and partially characterized. The specific activities of ATR variants 239K and 239M were 220 and 190 nmol min–1 mg–1, and their Km values were 6.3 and 6.9 μm for ATP and 1.2 and 1.6 μm for cob(I)alamin, respectively. These values are similar to those obtained for previously studied bacterial ATRs indicating that both human variants have sufficient activity to mediate AdoCbl synthesis in vivo. Investigations also showed that purified recombinant human methionine synthase reductase (MSR) in combination with purified ATR can convert cob(II)alamin to AdoCbl in vitro. In this system, MSR reduced cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin that was adenosylated to AdoCbl by ATR. The optimal stoichiometry for this reaction was ∼4 MSR/ATR and results indicated that MSR and ATR physically interacted in such a way that the highly reactive reaction intermediate [cob(I)alamin] was sequestered. The finding that MSR reduced cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin for AdoCbl synthesis (in conjunction with the prior finding that MSR reduced cob(II)alamin for the activation of methionine synthase) indicates a dual physiological role for MSR.

In this system, MSR reduced cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin that was adenosylated to AdoCbl by ATR. The optimal stoichiometry for this reaction was ∼4 MSR/ATR and results indicated that MSR and ATR physically interacted in such a way that the highly reactive reaction intermediate [cob(I)alamin] was sequestered. The finding that MSR reduced cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin for AdoCbl synthesis (in conjunction with the prior finding that MSR reduced cob(II)alamin for the activation of methionine synthase) indicates a dual physiological role for MSR. The vitamin B12 coenzymes, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; CH3Cbl, methylcobalamin; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; MS, methionine synthase; MSR, methionine synthase reductase; HOCbl, hydroxycobalamin; ATR, ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CMCbl, carboxymethylcobalamin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; CH3Cbl, methylcobalamin; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; MS, methionine synthase; MSR, methionine synthase reductase; HOCbl, hydroxycobalamin; ATR, ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CMCbl, carboxymethylcobalamin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and methylcobalamin (CH3Cbl), are required cofactors for at least 15 different enzymes that have a broad but uneven distribution among living forms (1Schneider Z. Stroinski A. AAAAComprehensive B12. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1987Crossref Google Scholar, 2Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). In humans, two B12-dependent enzymes are known (3Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Mellman I.S.

AdoCbl-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (5Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar). MCM is found in the mitochondrial matrix and it is required for the complete catabolism of compounds degraded via propionyl-CoA including branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol (Fig. 1) (5Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar). The second B12-dependent enzyme known in humans is CH3Cbl-dependent methionine synthase (MS). This enzyme is found in the cytoplasm where it catalyzes the conversion of methyltetrahydrofolate and homocysteine to tetrahydrofolate and methionine (6Matthews R.G. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar). In mammals, methionine is an essential amino acid, and MS plays a role in recycling the S-adenosylhomocysteine formed from S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions (7Weissbach H. Peterkofsky A. Redfield B.G. Dickerman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3318-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Humans are incapable of synthesizing AdoCbl and CH3Cbl de novo and depend on dietary sources of complex cobalamin precursors, such as vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) and hydroxycobalamin (HOCbl). The pathway by which these precursors are metabolized to the coenzyme forms is thought to be similar in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Fig. 1). For AdoCbl synthesis, cyanocobalamin is proposed to be converted to glutathionylcobalamin, reduced successively to cob(II)alamin and cob(I)alamin, respectively, and finally, adenosylated to AdoCbl (Fig. 1) (8Friedmann H.C.

For the synthesis of CH3Cbl, cob(II)alamin associated with MS is reductively methylated to form CH3Cbl (6Matthews R.G. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12.

For this reaction (which is also used for the reductive activation of MS following adventitious oxidation of the cobalamin cofactor), S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl-group donor and methionine synthase reductase (MSR) reduces cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin (16Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In humans, inherited defects in the MCM or MS structural genes or in the genes needed for the synthesis of B12 coenzymes result in methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, or combined disease. These rare disorders, which are often fatal in the first year of life, result from recessive autosomal mutations that fall into nine complementation groups (mut, cblABCDEFGH) (18Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar, 19Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. The Endocrinologist. 2001; 11: 98-104Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). cblF, cblC, and cblD defects lead to combined disease. Prior studies indicated that cblF mutations affect cobalamin transport from the lysosome to the cytoplasm, whereas cblC and cblD mutations impair the conversion of complex precursors to cob(II)alamin (20Vassiliadis A. Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Bergeron J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Mellman I. Willard H.F. Youngdahl-Turner P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11847-11853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cblE and cblG complementation groups correspond to the genes for MSR (MTRR) and MS (MTR), respectively, and defects in either gene results in homocystinuria (22Gulati S. Baker P. Li Y.N. Fowler B. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Leclerc D. Campeau E. Goyette P. Adjalla C.E. Christensen B. Ross M.

The mut group corresponds to the gene that encodes MCM (MUT) (24Nham S.U. Wilkemeyer M.F. Ledley F.D. Genomics. 1990; 8: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cblA group (MMAA gene) encodes a protein proposed to protect MCM from inactivation (25Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and recent studies have shown that the cblB complementation group (MMAB gene) encodes the mitochondrial ATP: cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR) (26Dobson C.M.

Mutations in the cblH complementation group also result in methylmalonic aciduria, but the nature of the underlying defect and the corresponding gene are unknown (28Watkins D. Matiaszuk N. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The human enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of cob(II)-alamin to cob(I)alamin for AdoCbl synthesis has not been identified. Recent studies showed that MSR mediates cob(II)alamin reduction for MS activation (17Olteanu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35558-35563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Leclerc D. Odievre M. Wu Q. Wilson A. Huizenga J.J. Rozen R. Scherer S.W. Gravel R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that this enzyme might play a similar role in AdoCbl synthesis. Here we describe the purification and initial biochemical characterization of the human ATR from recombinant E. coli and demonstrate that in vitro recombinant human MSR can reduce cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin for AdoCbl synthesis by the ATR enzyme. Chemicals and Reagents—Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Titanium III citrate was prepared as previously described (30Bobik T.A. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AdoCbl, HOCbl, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH), iodoacetic acid, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, ultrapure ammonium sulfate, ATP, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH. Pefabloc SC PLUS was from Roche Diagnostics. All other chemicals and reagents were from Fisher Scientific. Bacterial Strains and Growth Media—The bacterial strains used were E. coli DH5α and BL21 DE3 RIL (Stratagene). Luria-Bertani (LB) was the rich medium used (Difco) (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). LB was supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol or as indicated. General Molecular and Protein Methods—Agarose gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digests were performed using standard protocols (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar, 33Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PCR products and plasmid DNA were gel purified using a QIAquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). DNA ligation was accomplished using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Bacterial transformation and SDS-PAGE were performed as described (33Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ATP:Cob(I)alamin Adenosyltransferase Assays—ATR assays were performed as previously reported with some modifications (33Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.05 mm HOCbl, 0.4 mm ATP, and 1 mm titanium(III)citrate in a total volume of 2 ml. Reaction components (except for the ATR) were dispensed into cuvettes inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI). The cuvettes were sealed, removed from the chamber, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Reactions were initiated by addition of purified recombinant ATR, and AdoCbl formation was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 388 nm (Δϵ388 = 24.9 cm–1 mm–1). Construction of ATR Expression Strains—Plasmid pNL166 (27Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9227-9234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was restricted with BglII and HindIII to release the 645-bp fragment that encodes the ATR enzyme. This fragment was gel purified and ligated into a modified pET-41a expression vector, pTA925 (33Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ligation mixtures were used to transform E. coli DH5α by electroporation and transformants were selected by plating on LB kanamycin medium. Pure cultures were prepared from selected transformants and plasmid DNA isolated from these strains was analyzed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Clones with the expected DNA sequence were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 DE3 RIL (Stratagene) for highlevel protein production. PCR was used to construct the ATR 239M polymorphic variant. Plasmid pNL166 (27Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9227-9234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) provided the template DNA. The primers used for amplification were 5′-GCCGCCAGATCTTATGCCTCAGGGCGTGGAAGACGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCGCCAAGCTTTCAGAGTCCCTCAGACTCGGCCGATGGGTCATTTTTCATGTATATTTTCTCTTGATTCCC-3′ (reverse). These primers introduced BglII and HindIII restriction sites into the PCR product and were designed to change the lysine at position 239 to methionine. Ligation, transformation, and analysis of plasmid DNA were performed as described above. Clones with the expected DNA sequence were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 RIL for protein production. Purification of the Human ATR Variants—Soluble cell extracts of the E. coli expression strains were used for purification of both ATR variants. The growth of cells and the preparation of cell extracts was carried out as described (33Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For ammonium sulfate precipitation, cell extracts of ATR 239K (160 mg of protein) and 239M (180 mg of protein) were diluted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl. Then, ultrapure ammonium sulfate was added as a fine powder with stirring. Precipitated proteins were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × gmax using a Beckman JLA-10.500 rotor. The protein pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. ATR 239K (60 mg) and 239M (35 mg) were applied to a 60-ml ceramic hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8). The column was washed with 60 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient of 5 to 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions containing ATR of the highest purity were pooled and exchanged into 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl using a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 daltons (Viva Science, Binbrook, UK). Samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size membrane and further purified using a Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). ATR 239K (10 mg) and 239M (9 mg) were applied to the column that had been equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl. Then, the column was washed with 8 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 160-ml linear gradient from 50 to 1000 mm KCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Protein elution was monitored by following the absorbance of the column effluent at 280 nm and 8-ml fractions were collected. Purified ATR was concentrated and stored in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 130 mm KCl, and 50% glycerol at –20 °C. MSR-ATR Assay—The basis of this assay is that MSR converts cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin, which is in turn converted to AdoCbl by the ATR enzyme. The conversion of cob(I)alamin to AdoCbl proceeds with an increase in absorbance at 525 nm that allows quantitation (Δϵ = 4.8 cm–1 mm–1 525). Assays contained 200 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1.6 mm potassium Pi, 2.8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm cob(II)alamin, 0.4 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NADPH, and purified MSR and ATR as indicted in the text. The total assay volume was 2 ml and anaerobic procedures were used as described above for the ATR assay. Cob(II)alamin was prepared by exposing an anoxic solution of 1 mm AdoCbl to a 150 watt incandescent light at a distance of 15 cm for 30 min (33Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ATR 239K was purified as described above and recombinant human MSR was purified as described previously (17Olteanu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35558-35563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min prior to initiating reactions by the addition of an anoxic solution of NADPH. Measurement of Cob(I)alamin with Iodoacetate—Iodoacetate reacts rapidly and quantitatively with cob(I)alamin to form carboxymethylcobalamin (CMCbl). This reaction proceeds with an increase in absorbance at 525 nm (Δϵ525 = 5.3 cm–1 mm–1) and hence provides a facile method for quantitating cob(I)alamin (34Debussche L. Couder M. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6300-6302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anoxic stock solutions of iodoacetate (40 mm) were prepared and used the same day. The stock solution was shielded from light using aluminum foil and was added to assay mixtures just prior to the initiation of reactions. Separation and Quantification of Cobalamins by HPLC—HOCbl, AdoCbl, and CMCbl were separated and quantified by HPLC using a NovaPak C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm) equipped with a C18 Sentry guard column (Waters, Milford, MA). Samples (200 μl) were loaded onto the column and eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient from 10 to 90% methanol in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The absorbance of column effluent was monitored at 365 nm, and analytes were quantified by comparison of peak areas to a standard curve. The CMCbl standard was prepared by incubating 2 ml of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.6 mm potassium Pi, 2.8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm cob(II)alamin, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm FAD, and 0.4 mm iodoacetate at 37 °C for 1 h, which resulted in quantitative conversion of cob(II)alamin to CMCbl (data not shown). Standard curves were prepared using 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 nmol of CMCbl, AdoCbl, or HOCbl. Peak areas were integrated using Waters Breeze software. The standard curves for CMCbl, AdoCbl, and HOCbl had regression coefficients (r2) of 0.9985, 0.9993, and 0.9956, respectively. Solutions that contained CMCbl or AdoCbl were shielded from light to prevent photolysis. Effect of Ionic Strength on the MSR-ATR System—The ionic strength of MSR-ATR assays was varied by the addition of KCl. Ionic strength was calculated using the formula I = 1/2Σ (ciz)2, where I is the ionic strength, ci is the molar concentration of each type of ion, and z is the charge of each ion (35Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations: How to Solve Mathematical Problems in General Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). For lower values of ionic strength, it was necessary to reduce the Tris-HCl concentration. DNA Sequencing—DNA sequencing was carried out by University of Florida, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, DNA Sequencing Core facility, and University of Florida, Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, DNA Sequencing facility, as described previously (36Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the Human ATR Variants—The human ATR catalyzes the transfer of a 5′-deoxyadenosyl group from ATP to the central cobalt atom of cob(I)alamin to form AdoCbl (27Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9227-9234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two common polymorphic variants of the human ATR having either lysine or methionine as amino acid 239 (ATR 239M and 239K) were recently shown to be present in 54 and 46% of 72 control cell lines, respectively (26Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Kadir H. Narang M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We previously produced ATR 239K as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli (27Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9227-9234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis were used to construct E. coli expression strains that produce high levels of ATR 239K and 239M without fusion tags and lacking their predicted mitochondrial targeting sequences. Both ATR variants were produced at high levels and purified to apparent homogeneity from soluble cell extracts of recombinant E. coli. The purification consisted of three steps including ammonium sulfate precipitation, ceramic hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q chromatography (Table I). Both ATR variants precipitated between 40 and 50% ammonium sulfate saturation and eluted from the hydroxyapatite and Mono Q columns at 110–135 mm potassium Pi and 114–130 mm KCl. ATR 239K and 239M were purified 4.5- and 5.4-fold with specific activities of 220 and 190 nmol min–1 mg–1, respectively. The yields were 14 and 9%. During purification, the inclusion of KCl in chromatography and storage buffers increased enzyme stability.Table IPurification table for human ATR variants 239K and 239MPurification stepTotal proteinSpecific activityTotal activityYieldPurification239K239M239K239M239K239M239K239M239K239Mmgnmol min-1 mg-1nmol min-1%-foldCell-free extractaCell-free extracts were prepared from recombinant E. coli.16018049357840630010010011Ammonium sulfate precipitate6035110706600245084392.22Hydroxyapatite chromatography10911897118087315142.42.8MonoQ chromatography5322019011005701494.55.4a Cell-free extracts were prepared from recombinant E. coli. Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE was used to follow the purification of both ATR variants. Because purification of both enzymes proceeded similarly, only the gel used to assess the purity of ATR 239K is depicted (Fig. 2). Following the final Mono Q chromatography step, both variants appeared to be homogenous following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Linearity of the ATR Reaction—The effect of ATR concentration on activity was determined. Results showed that the rate of adenosylation was proportional to ATR concentration from 5 to 115 μg for both variants and linear regression yielded r2 values of 0.9995 and 0.9993 for ATR 239K and 239M, respectively. ATR Reaction Requirements—To determine the ATR reaction requirements, key assay components were individually omitted. For both variants, there was no detectable activity in the absence of ATR, ATP, HOCbl, or titanium(III) citrate (the reducing agent used to produce cob(I)alamin). In the complete reaction mixture, there was 215 and 194 nmol min–1 mg–1 activity for ATR 239K and 239M, respectively. In the absence of MgCl2, activity decreased by 20% for both ATR variants. There was no significant difference in activity in the absence of KCl. Alternative Nucleotide Donors—The specificity of the ATR variants for ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, ADP, and AMP was examined. ATP was found to be the best substrate giving a specific activity of 207 and 197 nmol min–1 mg–1 for ATR 239K and 239M, respectively. These values were set as 100% activity. When CTP, GTP, or UTP were tested as substrates for ATR 239K there was 9, 16, or 8% activity, respectively (Table II). Similar results were found for ATR 239M (6, 14, or 6% activity with CTP, GTP, or UTP, respectively). For both ATR variants, there was no detectable activity when AMP or ADP were substituted for ATP.Table IIUse of alternative nucleotide donors by the human ATRNucleotide donoraATP is the physiological substrate for the ATR and activity with this nucleotide was set to 100%% ActivityATR 239KATR 239MATP100100ADPNDbND, none detected.NDAMPNDNDCTP96GTP1614UTP86a ATP is the physiological substrate for the ATR and activity with this nucleotide was set to 100%b ND, none detected. Open table in a new tab Km and Vmax Values for ATR 239K and 239M—ATR 239K and 239M displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both ATP and cob(I)alamin. Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots were used to calculate Km and Vmax values (35Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations: How to Solve Mathematical Problems in General Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). For ATR 239K and 239M, the Km values for ATP were 6.3 and 6.9 μm, and the Km values for cob(I)alamin were 1.2 and 1.6 μm, respectively. The Vmax values for ATR 239K and 239M were 250 and 200 nmol min–1 mg–1, respectively. When the Km values for cob(I)alamin were determined, saturating levels of ATP (400 μm) were added to assay mixtures while varying the concentration of cob(I)alamin. Similarly, saturating levels of cob(I)alamin (50 μm) were added to assays when the Km values for ATP were determined. Each value used for kinetic calculations was the average of three measurements of the initial reaction rate. MSR Reduces Cob(II)alamin to Cob(I)alamin for AdoCbl Synthesis—The human enzyme that catalyzes the third step of cyanocobalamin assimilation, the reduction of cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin for AdoCbl synthesis by the ATR enzyme, is unknown. Recently, recombinant human MSR was shown to catalyze cob(II)alamin reduction for MS activation (17Olteanu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35558-35563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To test whether this enzyme can also reduce cob(II)alamin to cob(I) alamin for AdoCbl synthesis, an in vitro assay was used (MSRATR assay). In assays that contained standard components, cob(II)alamin, ATP, DTT, NADPH, 100 μg of purified MSR, and 10 μg of purified ATR, AdoCbl was formed at a rate of 0.96 nmol min–1. Controls showed that no measurable AdoCbl was formed in the absence of ATR, MSR, ATP, or cob(II)alamin. When NADPH was excluded from the reaction mixture, 65% of the total activity remained indicating that DTT can partially replace NADPH as the electron donor for this reaction. When DTT was omitted, 100% activity remained showing that NADPH can function efficiently as the electron donor without the need for DTT. In addition, several further tests were used to establish that AdoCbl was the product of the reaction. The UV-visible spectrum of completed reactions was characteristic of AdoCbl, and the reaction product was photolyzed by a 30-min exposure to incandescent light with the formation of cob(II) alamin (Fig. 3). Moreover, the product of the MSR-ATR reaction co-migrated with authentic AdoCbl by reverse-phase HPLC following co-injectio"

Because disruption of these vital pathways is associated with numerous pathologies, understanding GNMT control is important for evaluating methyl group regulation. Recently, gluconeogenic conditions have been shown to modulate homocysteine metabolism and treatment with glucocorticoids and/or all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced active GNMT protein, thereby leading to methyl group loss. This study was conducted to determine the effect of diabetes, alone and in combination with RA, on GNMT regulation. Diabetes and RA increased GNMT activity 87 and 148%, respectively. Moreover, the induction of GNMT activity by diabetes and RA was reflected in its abundance. Cell culture studies demonstrated that pretreatment with insulin prevented GNMT induction by both RA and dexamethasone. There was a significant decline in homocysteine concentrations in diabetic rats, owing in part to a 38% increase in the abundance of the transsulfuration enzyme cystathionine β-synthase; treatment of diabetic rats with RA prevented cystathionine β-synthase induction. A diabetic state also increased the activity of the folate-independent homocysteine remethylation enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, whereas the activity of the folate-dependent enzyme methionine synthase was diminished 52%. In contrast, RA treatment attenuated the streptozotocin-mediated increase in betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, whereas methionine synthase activity remained diminished. These results indicate that both a diabetic condition and RA treatment have marked effects on the metabolism of methyl groups and homocysteine, a finding that may have significant implications for diabetics and their potential sensitivity to retinoids.

Methyl group and folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism are interrelated pathways that provide for the subsequent transmethylation of various molecules using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; GNMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; 5-CH3-THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; MS, methionine synthase; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; DEX, dexamethasone; STZ, streptozotocin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; GNMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; 5-CH3-THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; MS, methionine synthase; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; DEX, dexamethasone; STZ, streptozotocin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.

An adequate supply of methyl groups via the diet or the folate-dependent one-carbon pool and regulation of these pathways are essential in preventing associated pathologies such as cancer, vascular disease, and neural tube defects (2Ross S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Kang S.-S. Wong P.W.K. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev.

Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) (EC 2.1.1.20) is an abundant, tissue-specific protein that plays a key role in the regulation of hepatic methyl group metabolism by the enzymatic conversion of glycine and AdoMet to S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and sarcosine (1Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar, 5Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yeo E.-J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GNMT functions to optimize the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, an indicator of transmethylation potential, because AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor of most AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (5Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cantoni G.L. Chiang P.K. Cavallini D. Gaull G.E. Zappia V. Natural Sulfur Compounds. Plenum Press, New York1980: 67-80Crossref Google Scholar). Following hydrolysis of AdoHcy, the resulting homocysteine can undergo remethylation to methionine or be irreversibly catabolized by the transsulfuration pathway. Folate-dependent remethylation occurs with the donation of a methyl group by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF) through the action of B12-dependent methionine synthase (MS) (8Shane B. Stokstad E.L.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1985; 5: 115-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In hepatic tissue, betaine derived from the oxidation of choline can also serve as a folate-independent source of methyl groups for homocysteine remethylation via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT). Transsulfuration to cysteine occurs through the activity of two vitamin B6-dependent enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and γ-cystathionase. The regulation of hepatic GNMT represents an important mechanism for controlling both the folate-dependent supply of methyl groups as well as their utilization in AdoMet-dependent transmethylation reactions. GNMT activity is regulated in response to changes in methyl group status as the result of allosteric inhibition of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase by AdoMet (9Jencks D.A. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2485-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 250: 459-477Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and inhibition of GNMT by 5-CH3-THF (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzymatic product of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. This allows methyl groups to be conserved under conditions of deficiency by decreasing GNMT activity, whereas elevations in its activity function to dispose of excess methyl groups. In addition to allosteric control, phosphorylation of GNMT represents another posttranslational mechanism to increase the activity of GNMT and regulate methyl group metabolism (12Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified both nutritional and hormonal factors that alter methyl group metabolism by targeting the key enzymes involved. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to induce hepatic GNMT activity and protein abundance, resulting in the loss of methyl groups for subsequent transmethylation reactions (13McMullen M.H. Rowling M.J. Ozias M.K. Schalinske K.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Ozias M.K. Schalinske K.L. J.

Moreover, dexamethasone (DEX) was just as effective as RA in the induction of GNMT activity in rat liver and hepatoma cells, and the co-administration of both DEX and RA induced GNMT in an additive fashion (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A diabetic state characterized by insufficient circulating concentrations of insulin and elevated levels of the counter-regulatory hormones glucagon and glucocorticoids has also been reported to alter enzymes involved in methyl group metabolism. An elevation in the activity of GNMT has been reported in alloxan-induced diabetic sheep and rats (6Yeo E.-J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Xue G.-P. Snoswell A.M. Biochem. Int. 1985; 10: 897-905PubMed Google Scholar); however, little is known about the mechanistic basis for this increase. Brosnan and co-workers have shown that under diabetic conditions, the catabolism of homocysteine was enhanced by transcriptional regulation of CBS, and these changes were prevented by treatment with insulin (19Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol.

Although we have shown that DEX can significantly alter methyl group and homocysteine metabolism (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the focus in this study was to evaluate these pathways in a diabetic rat model, alone and in combination with RA, as well as determine the effect of insulin on preventing these alterations. Chemicals—Reagents were obtained as follows: S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine, PerkinElmer Life Sciences; chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences; S-adenosyl-l-methionine and streptozotocin, Sigma; protease inhibitors and RA, Calbiochem; goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase, goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase, and rabbit anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase, Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). GNMT and CBS antibodies were kindly provided by Yi-Ming Chen, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan (22Liu H.-H. Dhen K.-H. Shin Y.-P. Lui W.-Y. Wong F.-H. Dhen Y.-M.A. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Jan Kraus, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, respectively. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Animals—All animal experiments were approved by and conducted in accordance with Iowa State University Laboratory Animal Resources Guidelines. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) (125–149 g) were housed in individual plastic cages in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water. Rats were randomly assigned to treatment groups (6 rats per group) and acclimated to the control diet (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for 5 days. Following the acclimation period, rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of either streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg body weight) in the vehicle (10 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.5) or the vehicle alone. The following day animals received a daily oral dose of RA (30 μmol/kg body weight) or vehicle (corn oil) alone. Following a 5-day treatment period with RA, rats were anesthetized and whole blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture. An aliquot of whole blood was used to assess blood glucose concentrations using a commercial kit (Sigma), whereas the remaining blood was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 6 min, and the resulting plasma fraction was stored at –20 °C for subsequent analysis of homocysteine concentrations. Liver samples were removed and homogenized in 4 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered (10 mm, pH 7.0) sucrose (0.25 m) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were stored at –70 °C with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol for subsequent enzymatic and protein abundance measurements. Total soluble protein concentrations were determined based on the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (Coomassie Plus, Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Additional liver samples were homogenized in 2 volumes of 0.4 m perchloric acid for the determination of AdoMet and AdoHcy. Cell Culture—Rat pancreatic AR42J and hepatoma H4IIE cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cells were grown in 150-cm2 flasks in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and a temperature of 37 °C until they were 70–75% confluent. H4IIE cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). AR42J cells were grown in F-12K nutrient mixture containing 20% fetal bovine serum as well as penicillin and streptomycin. Cell lines received fresh media prior to the initiation of any treatments. H4IIE and AR42J cells were treated with either a vehicle of 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, control), 10 μm RA, 0.1 μm DEX, or both RA and DEX as described previously (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A parallel group of AR42J and H4IIE cells was preincubated with 100 nm insulin for 24 h prior to the addition of RA and/or DEX. Following a 72-h incubation period, cells were detached using 0.25% trypsin/1 mm EDTA, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and lysed on ice in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm benzamidine, 100 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 250 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 24 μg/ml p-nitroguanidinobenzoate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 8 min, supernatants were stored at –70 °C for analysis of GNMT protein abundance. GNMT Activity Analysis—The enzymatic activity of GNMT was determined using the method described by Cook and Wagner (24Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, and performed in triplicate. The assay mixture (100 μl) consisted of 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 9.0), 1 mm glycine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine, and was initiated with 250 μg of protein followed by incubation at 25 °C for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid (10%) was added to terminate the reaction followed by the addition of activated charcoal and centrifugation (14,000 × g) to remove radiolabeled AdoMet. Aliquots of the supernatants were removed for liquid scintillation counting. Determination of GNMT and CBS Protein Abundance—GNMT protein abundance was determined using immunoblotting techniques as previously described (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel was used to quantify the 32-kDa monomer subunit of GNMT. Following separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:4,000 dilution of the monoclonal GNMT antibody (22Liu H.-H. Dhen K.-H. Shin Y.-P. Lui W.-Y. Wong F.-H. Dhen Y.-M.A. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. CBS protein abundance was analyzed using a similar method as described above to separate the 63-kDa CBS subunit. A 1:20,000 dilution of the polyclonal CBS antibody was used, which was followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. GNMT and CBS protein abundance were detected with chemiluminescence and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Densitometric analysis was performed using SigmaGel software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). For both GNMT and CBS, three samples from each treatment group were randomly chosen for analysis on a single immunoblot. Determination of Hepatic AdoMet and AdoHcy Concentrations—Perchloric acid homogenates were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were neutralized and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) to obtain AdoMet and AdoHcy (25Fell D. Benjamin L.E. Steele R.D. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 345: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Schalinske K.L. Steele R.D. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1695-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). AdoMet and AdoHcy were separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC and UV detection (254 nm) using a mobile phase containing 30% methanol in 5 mm octane sulfonic acid (pH 4.0) operated isocratically at 1.2 ml/min. Analysis of BHMT and MS Activity—BHMT activity was measured as described previously by Garrow (27Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The standard BHMT assay contained 5 mmdl-homocysteine, 2 mm betaine (0.1 μCi), and 40 μg of total protein. The activity of MS was determined as described previously (28Keating J.N. Weir P.G. Scott J.M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1985; 69: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The assay reaction mixture containing sodium phosphate buffer (500 mm, pH 7.5), cyanocobalamin (1.3 μm), dithiothreitol (1 m), AdoMet (10 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (82.4 mm), homocysteine (100 mm), and [methyl-14C]-THF (15 mm, 0.17 μCi/μmol) was added to liver supernatants and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Ice-cold water was added to terminate the reaction, and the assay mixture was immediately applied to a AG 1-X8 (chloride form) resin columns. Effluent fractions (3 ml of deionized water) were collected for subsequent liquid scintillation counting. For both the BHMT and MS assay, homocysteine was prepared fresh daily from a thiolactone derivative. Plasma Homocysteine Analysis—Total plasma homocysteine concentrations were determined using HPLC and fluorescence detection (29Ubbink J.B. Hayward Vermack W.J. Bissbort S. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 565: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). For derivatization, 10% tributylphosphine in dimethylformamide was added to 300 μl of plasma samples and subsequently incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm EDTA. Following centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were added to a solution containing borate buffer (0.125 m, pH 9.5), sodium hydroxide (1.55 m), and 4-fluoro-7-sulfobenzofurazan (ammonium salt, 0.1%). N-Acetylcysteine (1 mm) was added to the plasma samples prior to derivatization as an internal standard. Samples were injected onto a μBondapak C18 Radial-Pak column (Waters Associates) equilibrated in a mobile phase consisting of 4% acetonitrile in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.1). Statistical Analysis—SigmaStat software (SPSS) was used for all statistical analyses. The mean values of each treatment group were subjected to a two-way analysis of variance. When the analysis of variance was significant (p < 0.05), means were compared using Fisher's least significant difference procedure. STZ Resulted in Elevated Blood Glucose and Significantly Less Weight Gain Regardless of RA Treatment—Cumulative weight gain for diabetic rats was 23 and 36% of respective non-diabetic values, whereas RA treatment was without effect (Table I). STZ clearly induced a diabetic state in rats as blood glucose concentrations were elevated 3.7-fold compared with control values. Rats treated with RA had no significant effect on circulating levels of glucose compared with control values, and RA attenuated the hyperglycemia exhibited by diabetic rats.Table ICumulative weight gain and blood glucose concentrations in rats treated with STZ and/or RAWeight gainBlood glucosegmg/dlControl77 ± 2a147 ± 17aSTZ18 ± 3b539 ± 19bRA73 ± 1a165 ± 17aSTZ + RA26 ± 5b435 ± 51c Open table in a new tab Both Diabetes and RA Treatment Induced Active GNMT— STZ-treated rats exhibited a 1.9-fold increase in hepatic GNMT activity compared with the control values (Fig. 1A). RA increased GNMT activity 2.5-fold compared with control rats and was significantly greater than the degree of induction in STZ-treated rats. Hepatic GNMT activity was highest in the rats receiving both STZ and RA (2.6-fold), although this increase was not significantly different from RA treatment alone. The changes in GNMT activity in diabetic and RA-treated rats were also reflected in the abundance of the protein, where a 5.3- and 4.8-fold increase was observed, respectively (Fig. 1B). Moreover, co-administration of STZ and RA significantly induced GNMT protein abundance (6.8-fold) to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Thus, both RA treatment and a diabetic condition modulate the expression of active GNMT in rat liver. Induction of GNMT by RA and/or DEX was Prevented by Insulin Treatment—As reported previously (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), both RA and DEX alone or in co-administration resulted in induction of the GNMT protein in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (Fig. 2). Incubating cells with insulin for 24 h prior to treatment with RA and/or DEX prevented GNMT induction. Similarly, DEX-mediated induction of GNMT in AR42J cells was also prevented by insulin; however, RA was not an effective signal to induce GNMT in these cells. STZ Treatment Reduced Plasma Homocysteine Concentrations and Induced CBS Abundance—Plasma homocysteine concentrations were significantly reduced ∼48% in both groups of STZ-treated rats regardless of RA administration (Fig. 3). Although we have found previously that RA alone was effective at lowering circulating homocysteine levels (14Ozias M.K. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 4090-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the 26% decrease observed under these experimental conditions did not reach statistical significance. The hypohomocysteinemia exhibited by diabetic rats appears to be due, in part, to a 38% increase in the abundance of CBS, the initial enzyme in the irreversible catabolism of homocysteine (Fig. 4). However, CBS activity is regulated allosterically, and thus flux studies conducted in vivo would be required to evaluate the transsulfuration pathway. Interestingly, RA treatment of diabetic rats prevented CBS induction (Fig. 4), even though plasma homocysteine concentrations remained diminished (Fig. 3).Fig. 4The abundance of CBS was elevated in STZ-mediated diabetic rats and abrogated following treatment with RA. Hepatic tissue samples from the same rats as described for Fig. 1 were used to determine CBS abundance by Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative immunoblot is shown above the bar graph. Data are means ± S.E.

BHMT activity was significantly increased 3.3-fold in diabetic rats, whereas the activity of MS was reduced 52% (Table II). RA did not significantly alter either enzyme, although there was a trend (p = 0.061) for increased MS activity, similar to our previous observations (14Ozias M.K. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 4090-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RA was effective at reducing the activity of BHMT in diabetic rats, but did not prevent the STZ-mediated decrease in MS activity.Table IIActivity of remethylation enzymes methionine synthase MS and BHMT in the livers of rats treated with STZ and/or RABHMTMSunits/mg of proteinpmol/min·mg of proteinControl40 ± 3a86 ± 11aSTZ132 ± 11b41 ± 5bRA51 ± 4a119 ± 19aSTZ + RA100 ± 8c36 ± 6b Open table in a new tab STZ-mediated Elevations in the Hepatic Concentrations of AdoMet and AdoHcy Were Prevented by RA Treatment—A diabetic condition resulted in a significant increase in the hepatic concentrations of AdoMet (169%) and AdoHcy (90%) (Table III).

Because AdoMet and AdoHcy are allosteric regulators of a number of enzymes involved in folate, methyl group, and homocysteine metabolism, it is difficult to determine the collective metabolic effect of these changes in diabetic rats in the absence of flux measurements using isotopic tracers.Table IIIHepatic concentrations of AdoMet and AdoHcy from rats treated with STZ and/or RAAdoMetAdoHcyAdoMet/AdoHcynmol/g of liverControl42.7 ± 2.3a34.9 ± 2.1a1.24 ± 0.08aSTZ114.9 ± 22.5b66.3 ± 10.2b1.77 ± 0.34aRA38.9 ± 3.1a34.5 ± 4.1a1.20 ± 0.15aSTZ + RA43.6 ± 3.7a40.3 ± 4.3a1.14 ± 0.12a Open table in a new tab Methyl groups, homocysteine, and the folate-dependent one-carbon pool represent interrelated metabolic processes that are important in health and disease. Because GNMT is a vital regulatory protein that functions to control the supply and utilization of methyl groups, it is paramount to understand how nutritional and/or hormonal factors modulate its expression. Our earlier work demonstrated that RA and DEX were independent signals to induce active GNMT in rat liver and in cultured hepatoma cells (17Rowling M.J. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended these findings by demonstrating that a diabetic condition, mediated by treatment with STZ, also has a profound impact on the activity of hepatic GNMT. Previous rat studies using alloxan-induced diabetes reported similar increases (85%) in GNMT activity (6Yeo E.-J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas treatment with glucagon were less pronounced (23%) (20Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43740-43747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); however, the mechanistic basis for this increase in GNMT activity has not been thoroughly explored. A novel aspect of our studies demonstrates that for both diabetes and RA, the abundance of GNMT protein was markedly elevated, indicating that GNMT was regulated by transcriptional and/or translational mechanisms or possibly at the level of degradation of the protein. It is not known if regulation of GNMT expression in a diabetic state is the result of an increase in glucocorticoid levels or a lack of insulin. The cell culture studies shown here clearly demonstrate that pretreatment with insulin prevented GNMT induction by both DEX and RA. It will be important in future studies to more fully characterize this diabetic condition with alterations in methyl group metabolism. Interestingly, the responsiveness of GNMT expression to RA and DEX appears to be cell type specific. We have found in other studies that DEX was a more universal signal than RA for GNMT induction across a number of tissues and cell lines, including those that do not express detectable GNMT, such as the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. 2V. E. Knoblock, E. B. Nonnecke, M. J. Rowling, and K. L. Schalinske, unpublished data. It is not clear how RA, DEX, and/or a diabetic state alter the expression of GNMT. Previous studies on the regulation of GNMT activity have found it to be at the posttranslational level by phosphorylation and allosteric inhibition by 5-CH3-THF (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Balaghi M. Horne D.W. Wagner C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Cook R.J. Horne D.W. Wagner C. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on the known actions of glucocorticoids and RA with respect to regulation of gene expression, it is likely that the induction of GNMT is the result of increased transcription. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that pretreatment of hepatoma cells with actinomycin D prevented GNMT induction by DEX and RA, and abundance of the protein appears to reflect changes in its synthesis rate. 3M. J. Rowling, K. M. Nieman, and K. L. Schalinske, unpublished data. However, GNMT has not been reported to contain a retinoic acidnor a glucocorticoid-response element in its promoter region (32Ogawa H. Konishi K. Takata Y. Nakashima H. Fujioka M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 168: 141-151Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that additional intracellular signals are required to directly mediate regulation of GNMT expression. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that increases in phosphorylation of the protein have a role in increasing GNMT activity, particularly as glucagon and glucocorticoids can exert their action via alterations in protein kinase activity. Homocysteine concentrations reflect the collective balance between production from AdoMet-dependent transmethylation reactions, remethylation to methionine, and catabolism via the transsulfuration pathway. As has been reported (19Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43740-43747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we also found that a diabetic state was characterized by a reduction in circulating homocysteine levels. This change in homocysteine homeostasis appears to reflect an increase in the activity of BHMT and the abundance of CBS, even though the activity of MS was reduced. Similarly, previous diabetes/hyperglucagonemia studies have attributed the hypohomocysteinemia to up-regulation of CBS and γ-cystathionase, whereas the activity of hepatic BHMT and MS were not significantly altered (19Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42912-42918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of flux studies it is difficult to determine homocysteine catabolism because CBS is regulated allosterically by other factors such as AdoMet, a known allosteric stimulator of CBS activity (33Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the increase in CBS abundance that we reported, we also found that the hepatic concentration of AdoMet was elevated in agreement with previous studies using hyperglucogonemic rats (20Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43740-43747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Elevations in hepatic AdoMet levels may be the result of increased expression of methionine adenosyltransferase, as it is up-regulated by glucocorticoids (34Gil B. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An increase in hepatic AdoMet concentrations would also be expected to reduce 5-CH3-THF levels as a result of allosteric inhibition of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (9Jencks D.A. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2485-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 250: 459-477Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The lack of 5-CH3-THF acting as an inhibitory ligand for GNMT (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), like phosphorylation, may be a contributing factor for the increase in its activity in diabetic rats. An interesting aspect of our work was that the administration of RA to diabetic rats prevented CBS induction and AdoMet accumulation and partially reduced the activity of BHMT, whereas MS activity was unaffected. In contrast to diabetes, RA alone had no affect on CBS abundance or the activity of BHMT and MS, although we have found in previous studies that RA does increase MS when provided for a longer period of time (14Ozias M.K. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 4090-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the activity and abundance of GNMT remained elevated in rats treated with RA. This further illustrates the need for metabolic flux measurements under in vivo conditions to determine the outcome of these interactions. The implications of these results for humans are profound, as diabetes and its complications are a significant health problem and the use of pharmacological retinoid compounds has risen dramatically in recent years (35Wysowski D.K. Swann J. Vega A. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2002; 46: 505-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to folate, optimal metabolism of methyl groups and homocysteine is dependent on a number of B-vitamins including B12,B6, and riboflavin, as well as an adequate source of methyl groups such as methionine and choline. Moreover, it is well known that the human population has a significant prevalence of polymorphic enzymes important in methyl group, homocysteine, and folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (36Loktionov A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2003; 14: 426-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Taken together, these nutritional, genetic, and hormonal factors underscore the need for understanding the relationship between these metabolic pathways and diabetes. As most type I diabetics control their disease by the use of insulin, there are nonetheless likely many individuals who do not adequately monitor their condition. Moreover, many of the changes noted in our study were recently demonstrated in a type II diabetes (Zucker diabetic fatty rat) model, including an increase in hepatic CBS, BHMT, and AdoMet (37Hall B.N. Ratnam S. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. FASEB J. 2004; 18 (abstr.): A546Google Scholar). We thank Stacy E. Schroeder for the preliminary GNMT studies using streptozotocin- and alloxan-treated rats."
https://openalex.org/W2010313062,"Cancer progression depends on an accumulation of metastasis-supporting cell signaling molecules, which target signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, gene expression. One such molecule, osteopontin (OPN), represents a key molecular signaling event in tumor progression and metastasis. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that underlie OPN expression in the setting of breast cancer have not been well studied. In this regard, we have examined the differential transcriptional regulation of OPN in the murine mammary epithelial tumor cell lines, 4T1 and 4T07, which are sublines derived from the parental population of 410.4 cells from Balb/cfC3H mice. These lines are phenotypically heterogeneous in their metastatic behavior. 4T1 hematogenously metastasizes to the lung, liver, bone, and brain, whereas 4T07 is highly tumorigenic but fails to metastasize. The tumor growth and metastatic spread of 4T1 cells closely mimics stage IV breast cancer. We demonstrate that a Ras-independent, phosphoinositide-3 kinase-dependent, c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun results in binding of an AP-1 c-Jun homodimer to the OPN promoter in 4T1 cells. This differential up-regulation of OPN gene transcription and protein expression in 4T1 cells conveys in vitro correlates of a metastatic phenotype. These results provide new insight into the transcriptional regulation of OPN as a key mediator of metastatic behavior in malignancy."

GroEL is a large cylindrical protein complex comprising two heptameric rings of 57-kDa identical subunits, and these rings are stacked back to back (6Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C.

Current understanding of the major productive pathway of an ATP hydrolysis-coupled GroEL function starting from the substrate protein-loaded GroEL is as follows. (i) For cis-ternary complex formation, the binding of ATP to the substrate protein-loaded heptamer ring of GroEL permits the binding of GroES to this ring (cis-ring) generating an enlarged, closed central cavity (cis-cavity) in which the substrate protein is discharged (cis-ATP complex) (7Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The cis-cavity underneath GroES provides a protein chamber for folding without the risk of aggregation (e.g. Refs. 9Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R.

(ii) For trans-ring activation, ATP hydrolysis in the cis-ring leads to produce the cis-ADP complex, and the GroEL heptamer ring opposite to the cis-ring (trans-ring) becomes ready to bind ATP (12Rye H.S.

(iii) In cis-ternary complex decay, the binding (not hydrolysis) of ATP to the trans-ring, in return, induces the release of GroES and ADP from the cis-ring allowing the substrate protein, whether folded or not, to escape from the cis-cavity (12Rye H.S.

According to the above scheme, the step (ii), the trans-ring activation involves the hydrolysis of ATP in the cis-ATP complex to generate a transient intermediate cis-ADP·Pi complex, which is followed by rapid Pi release (15Ueno T.

In ADP + BeFx, a stable 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex with a substrate protein in the cis-cavity was generated and the further addition of GroES in ATP + BeFx produced the symmetric 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex.

GroES Exchange—ATP was rapidly injected (0.5 mm final concentration) into 1.3 ml of HKM buffer containing 5 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 100 nm GroEL, 50 nm GroESCy3, and 10 μm rLA in the absence or presence of BeCl2 at 25 °C. Changes in the Cy3 fluorescence (excitation at 545 nm, emission at 563 nm) were monitored continuously with a fluorometer (F-4500, Hitachi, Japan). When indicated, unlabeled GroES (1.0 μm final concentration) was injected into the mixtures. Gel Filtration—The solution containing 5 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm BeCl2, 1.4 μm GroEL, 5.6 μm GroESCy3, 10 μm rLA, and 1 mm nucleotide (ATP or ADP) in HKM buffer was incubated at 25 °C for 2 min, and applied to a gel filtration HPLC column (G3000SWXL, Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with HKM buffer containing 50 mm Na2SO4, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm BeCl2. Elution was monitored by an in-line fluorometer (excitation at 545 nm, emission at 563 nm) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The peak containing the GroEL-GroES complex was collected for the further analyses (see below). In some experiments, the peak fractions containing the GroEL-GroES complexes were concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM-100) and then applied again to a gel-filtration column under the conditions indicated. Quantitation of Bound GroES and Nucleotide—To know the amount of the bound GroES, the GroEL complexes isolated by gel-filtration HPLC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Brilliant Bluestained bands were quantitated by a public domain software package (NIH Image). The determination of bound nucleotides was as follows. The isolated GroEL complexes were treated with perchloric acid (final 1.0%), and the supernatant was neutralized with K2CO3. The supernatants were applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column (ODS-80Ts, Tosoh, Japan), which can separate ATP and ADP with monitoring by absorbance at 260 nm (26Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amount of nucleotide was calculated by the integrated peak area. Electron Microscopy—The solution containing 1 mm ATP, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm BeCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1.0 μm GroEL, 4.0 μm GroES, and 20 μm rLA in HKM buffer was subjected to ultrafiltration to remove free GroES and rLA. An aliquot of the solution was applied on an electron microscope specimen grid covered with a carbon support film. The specimen was immediately stained with 2.0% uranyl acetate and observed with an electron microscope (JEM-1230, JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Images were recorded onto electron image films at a magnification of 40,000. Rhodanese Folding Assay—To initiate folding reactions, the solution containing the GroEL saturated with rhodanese and GroES in HKM buffer was mixed with a 3-fold volume of the solution containing nucleotide (ATP or ADP), 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm BeCl2. When indicated, hexokinase was included in the ADP solutions. Final concentrations of the components in the reaction mixtures were as follows: 1 mm nucleotides, 0.5 μm GroEL saturated with rhodanese, 1.0 μm GroES, 200 mm glucose, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Na2S2O3, and when indicated, 0.04 units/μl hexokinase. For the single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiment, excess ATP was quenched by adding hexokinase (final concentration, 0.04 units/μl) to the reaction mixture at 3 s after initiation of the reaction. We confirmed that 1 mm ATP in the reaction mixture was quenched completely within the next 3 s (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To know the time course of folding of rhodanese, aliquots (5 μl) were taken out at indicated times, mixed with 750 μl of the solution containing 100 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm Na2S2O3, and 1 mm EDTA, and recovered rhodanese activities were determined according to the standard protocol (27Sorbo B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). To know the amount of GroES and the rhodanese in the folding chambers, released GroES and rhodanese were removed by the ultrafiltration at 1 h after initiation of the reaction, and subsequently proteinase K (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) was added. After a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added at final concentration 1 mm, and the components with molecular mass smaller than 100 kDa were removed by ultrafiltration. An aliquot of the resulting solution (∼20 μg) was applied to 15% SDS gel. Other aliquots of proteinase K-treated, ultrafiltered samples (∼4 μg protein) were used for the assays of the recovered activities of rhodanese. To release all of the proteins from the folding chambers, GroES was detached from GroEL by addition of equal volume of 20 mm CDTA. After a 90-min incubation at 25 °C, the activities of rhodanese were measured. Inhibition of GroEL ATPase Turnover by BeFx—The effect of BeFx on GroEL ATPase activity in the presence of GroES and rLA was examined. Upon the addition of 1 mm BeCl2 in the medium containing excess NaF, the turnover of ATP hydrolysis by GroEL was inhibited almost completely and immediately (<2 s) (Fig. 1A and inset). Because single turnover of the ATPase cycle of GroEL under these conditions takes ∼8 s, BeFx stops the action of GroEL within a single reaction cycle. AlFx was also tested but, unlike BeFx, several minutes were required to gain the maximum inhibition (data not shown). Another phosphate analogue, NaVO4, did not show an inhibitory effect on GroEL ATPase, as reported previously (18Inobe T. Kikushima K. Makio T. Arai M. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Chaudhry C. Farr G.W. Todd M.J. Rye H.S. Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4877-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused on the effect of BeFx. When BeFx concentrations in the assay mixtures were changed by varying BeCl2 concentrations in 10 mm NaF, 30 μm BeCl2 gave a 50% inhibition of ATPase, 100 μm BeCl2 90%, and 250 μm BeCl2 99%. Accordingly, we adopted 1 mm BeFx in the following experiments to ensure the maximum inhibition. Above measurements were carried out for GroEL + rLA + GroES, but ATPase activity of GroEL + rLA or GroEL alone was also severely inhibited by BeFx (Fig. 1B). An alternative ATPase assay using an inorganic phosphate determination (Malachite Green assay) also gave indistinguishable results (data not shown). Stable Binding of GroES to GroEL in BeFx—The fluorescently labeled GroESCy3 is functionally intact, and the fluorescence increases upon binding to GroEL (14Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The addition of ATP to the mixture of GroEL, GroESCy3, and rLA initiated the functional chaperonin cycle and induced the increase of the fluorescence of GroESCy3 (Fig. 2A). The dilution of GroESCy3 by the addition of a large excess of unlabeled GroES resulted in a decrease in fluorescence, indicating an exchange of GroEL-bound GroESCy3 with unlabeled free GroES. In the presence of BeFx, however, the fluorescence was not changed by the addition of unlabeled GroES (Fig. 2B). Therefore, BeFx inhibits the functional cycling of GroEL by preventing the release of GroES from GroEL. GroEL-GroES Complexes Formed in BeFx—To analyze the GroEL-GroES complex formed in BeFx, we incubated GroEL, rLA, ATP, and GroESCy3 for 2 min, added BeFx, incubated for 2 min, subjected the mixture to gel-filtration HPLC, and eluted the mixture with the BeFx-containing buffer. The GroESCy3 eluted at the position of the GroEL shown by an arrow (Fig. 3A) represents the GroEL-GroESCy3 complex. The amount of GroESCy3 in the complex was calculated to be ∼1.8 mol/mol of GroEL based on the fraction in the total eluted fluorescence. When ADP was included instead of ATP in the incubation mixture, ∼0.9 mol of GroESCy3/mol of GroEL were co-eluted with GroEL (Fig. 3A). The stability of the GroEL-GroESCy3 complex formed in ATP + BeFx was dependent on the presence of BeFx in the medium, because when the peak fraction of the GroEL-GroESCy3 complex was applied to a second gel-filtration column and eluted with the buffer that did not contain BeFx, approximately one-half of the GroESCy3 was dissociated from GroEL during elution, leaving the complex with ∼0.9 mol of GroESCy3/mol of GroEL (Fig. 3B). The released GroESCy3 was eluted as a long tailing of the major peak but not an isolated peak, indicating that dissociation occurred gradually in BeFx-free buffer. The complex made in ADP + BeFx was stable; it was not dissociated during the elution with the BeFx-free buffer (data not shown). When BeFx was absent in both the reaction mixtures and the elution buffer, ATP and ADP gave similar results; ∼0.3 mol of GroESCy3/mol of GroEL were found at the position of GroEL (Fig. 3C). Analysis of the GroEL-GroES Complexes Formed in BeFx— The peak fraction of the GroEL-GroES complex in gel-filtration HPLC was isolated and further analyzed. The densitometry of the bands of GroEL and GroES in SDS-PAGE of the complexes confirmed the GroEL:GroES molar ratios estimated from the elution profiles above described; 1:1.7 for the complex made in ATP + BeFx and 1:0.8 for the complex made in ADP + BeFx (Table I). The analysis of nucleotides extracted from the complexes indicated that ADP occupied all of the nucleotide binding sites of GroEL in the complex formed in ATP + BeFx and half of the nucleotide binding sites in the complex formed in ADP + BeFx. From these results we concluded that the complex made in ATP + BeFx was the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex in which the nucleotide binding sites of two GroEL rings were filled by ADP and that the complex made in ADP + BeFx was the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex in which the nucleotide binding sites of one GroEL ring were filled by ADP. Bound ADP in these complexes should be coordinated with BeFx, because the complexes were isolated only in the presence of BeFx. It appeared, however, that the BeFx moiety of ADP·BeFx in one of the GroEL rings of the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex was exchangeable with BeFx medium and, in the absence of BeFx medium, ADP·BeFx (and GroES) dissociated from one of GroEL rings to produce the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex (see also Fig. 6B).Table IStoichiometry of GroES, nucleotide, and rhodanese in the isolated GroEL complexesComplex was formed inGroES/GroELaObtained from the isolated GroEL-GroES complexes shown in Fig. 3, A and C.ADP/GroELaObtained from the isolated GroEL-GroES complexes shown in Fig. 3, A and C.,bATP was not detected in all of the complexes.Rhodanese/GroELcProteinase K-protected rhodanese encapsulated in the cis-cavity was quantitated by the corresponding band intensity shown in Fig. 5B.mol/molmol/molmol/molATP0.34.5NDdND, not detected.ADP0.25.0NDATP + BeFx1.717.21.9ADP + BeFx0.88.81.4a Obtained from the isolated GroEL-GroES complexes shown in Fig. 3, A and C.b ATP was not detected in all of the complexes.c Proteinase K-protected rhodanese encapsulated in the cis-cavity was quantitated by the corresponding band intensity shown in Fig. 5B.d ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Electron Micrograph of the GroEL-GroES Complexes Formed in BeFx—We observed the images of the complexes formed in ATP + BeFx under an electron micrograph. Complexes formed in ATP + BeFx showed symmetrical football-like shapes, and GroES associated to both ends of GroEL (Fig. 4). On the contrary, bullet-like shapes with GroES associated to one end of GroEL were seen for the complexes formed in ADP + BeFx (data not shown), a familiar shape for the usual GroEL-GroES complex made in the absence of BeFx.(e.g. Ref. 28Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Folding in the Presence of BeFx—All of the above experiments were carried out in the presence of substrate proteins, rLA. To know whether substrate protein(s) can fold in the 1:1 and 1:2 GroEL-GroES complexes formed in BeFx, we used rhodanese as a substrate protein. Rhodanese is a stringent substrate protein that can fold efficiently only with the aid of GroEL, GroES, and ATP (e.g. Refs. 29Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 30Brinker A. Pfeifer G. Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Cell. 2001; 107: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by mixing GroES, ATP, ± BeFx, and GroEL whose substrate protein binding sites of two rings were saturated previously with denatured rhodanese (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Without BeFx, rhodanese activity was gradually recovered until it finally reached a value corresponding to 1.8 mol of rhodanese/mol of GroEL (Fig. 5A). In this case, unfolded rhodanese was repeatedly encapsulated into (and escaped from) the cis-cavity during multiple turnovers of the chaperonin functional cycle (31Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 32Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 33Taguchi H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the presence of BeFx, 1.9 mol of rhodanese were folded. We also examined the folding of rhodanese in ADP ± BeFx. It should be noted that, even with taking special precautions to remove contaminating ATP from commercial ADP (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), no recovery of rhodanese activity was observed in ADP. However, when BeFx was present, 1.1 mol of rhodanese/mol of GroEL were folded in ADP. In these folding experiments, the final folding yields were different from each other, but the folding rates were nearly the same, reflecting the inherent folding characteristics of rhodanese. We also examined the folding of another stringent substrate protein, malate dehydrogenase (34Peralta D. Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of rhodanese, activity recovered in ADP + BeFx was 54% of that recovered in ATP + BeFx (data not shown). 4Malate dehydrogenase is a dimeric enzyme. For the dimerization, GroES was partially detached from the BeF complexes by the addition of CDTA under an on-ice condition (12Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) to xrelease the encapsulated malate dehydrogenase monomer. Therefore, an accurate mol of folded malate dehydrogenase/mol of GroEL was not obtained. The above results, together with the GroEL:GroES stoichiometry, indicated that the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex generated in ATP + BeFx contains two substrate proteins, whereas the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex generated in ADP + BeFx contains one. These substrate proteins are assumed to be encapsulated in the folding chambers underneath GroES and allowed to fold. Next, we further confirmed this assumption. Accessibility of Protease—The mixtures incubated for 60 min as in Fig. 5A were subjected to ultrafiltration to remove free GroES, treated with proteinase K, and again subjected to ultrafiltration to remove proteinase K and digestion products. The resultant solutions were used for SDS-PAGE analysis and for the rhodanese activity assay. The densitometry of the bands in Fig. 5B showed that the complexes generated in ATP + BeFx and ADP + BeFx contained 1.9 and 1.4 mol of proteinase K-resistant rhodanese/mol of GroEL, respectively (Table I). Also, the rhodanese activity roughly corresponding to the amount of rhodanese in SDS-PAGE was detected (Fig. 5C). Without BeFx, a rhodanese band in SDS-PAGE and rhodanese activity was not detected in the complexes generated in ATP or ADP. The reasons why no rhodanese was recovered in the absence of BeFx are explained as follows. With the ATP present in the absence of BeFx, the folding of rhodanese was assisted by GroEL-GroES and released to a bulk solution and thus removed in the ultrafiltration process. However with the ADP present in the absence of BeFx, rhodanese was bound to GroEL but no or little GroES bound to the rhodanese-bound GroEL ring under this condition, the non-native rhodanese was susceptible to proteolytic digestion. The 1:2 and 1:1 GroEL:GroES molar ratios for the complexes made in ATP + BeFx and ADP + BeFx, respectively, were also seen in Fig. 5B. These results showed clearly that rhodanese molecules in these complexes after the protease treatment were really accommodated in the folding chambers but not associated to the trans-ring or peripheral surface of GroEL. GroESCy3 Binding to the 1:1 GroEL-GroES Complex—The 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex formed in ADP + BeFx was isolated by gel-filtration HPLC with the buffer containing BeFx. The isolated complex contained ∼2 mol of rhodanese/mol of GroEL, one in the cis-cavity and the other at the trans-ring as shown by sensitivity to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 6A, inset). The isolated complex in the BeFx buffer was incubated with GroESCy3 + ATP, GroESCy3 + ADP, or GroESCy3 alone and applied again to the same gel-filtration column eluted with the BeFx buffer. As shown in Fig. 6A, binding of GroESCy3 to the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex in the BeFx buffer was observed only in ATP but not in ADP nor in the absence of nucleotide. SDS-PAGE analysis of the GroEL complexes confirmed that the amount of GroES (sum of GroESCy3 and unlabeled GroES) relative to GroEL increased from 1.0 to 2.3 after incubation with ATP + BeFx (data not shown). Release of GroESCy3 from the 1:2 GroEL-(ES + ESCy3) Complex—Taking advantage of the isolation of the 1:2 GroEL-(ES + ESCy3) complex, we tested whether the secondary bound GroESCy3 in the complex is equivalent to the previously bound GroES. To address the question, we applied the 1:2 GroEL-(ES + ESCy3) complex to a gel-filtration column eluted in the absence of BeFx where the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex should release one of two GroES to produce the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex (Fig. 3B). If the secondary bound GroESCy3 is preferentially released, all of the GroESCy3 should be eluted as unbound GroESCy3 leaving a non-fluorescent 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex. However, this was not the case; half of GroESCy3 remained associated with GroEL, and another half was eluted as unbound GroESCy3 (Fig. 6B, trace 2). As expected, with BeFx in the elution buffer, the original 1:2 GroEL-(ES + ESCy3) complex was recovered, and with CDTA in the elution buffer, all the GroESCy3 was released from GroEL (Fig. 6B, traces 1 and 3). These results demonstrate that the two GroES heptamers in the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex are equivalent. The results of this study are summarized in Fig. 7. In the presence of BeFx, the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex is formed in ADP. This complex is converted into the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex in the presence of BeFx when GroES and ATP are supplied. The same 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex is also formed in ATP in the presence of BeFx. The 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex is unstable in the absence of BeFx medium and is changed into the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex when exposed to the BeFx-free buffer. The 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex is stable in the BeFx-free buffer. Encapsulated substrate protein(s) in these complexes is free to fold. As described in the Introduction, the functional cycle of GroEL is comprised of three steps, 5We recently proposed a two timer mechanism of the GroEL functional cycle that is significantly different from the conventional single timer model (15Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the functional cycle expressed in the text is compatible with either of the two models. (i) cis-ternary complex formation, (ii) trans-ring activation, and (iii) cis-ternary complex decay. The experiments using BeFx as an inhibitor provide some insight into the nucleotide states of cis-ring required for the progress of these steps (Table II). It has been known that BeFx can form stable ADP·BeFx at the catalytic sites of various ATP-metabolizing enzymes by mimicking the Pi part of ADP·Pi or γ-P part of ATP (16Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent x-ray crystallography of the 1:1 GroEL-GroES formed in AlFx showed that AlF3 is coordinated to ADP at each of the catalytic sites in the cis-ring of the complex (19Chaudhry C. Farr G.W. Todd M.J. Rye H.S. Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4877-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography, as well as x-ray scattering analysis, also suggested that the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complexes formed in metal fluorides resemble the usual 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex formed in the absence of metal fluorides (18Inobe T. Kikushima K. Makio T. Arai M. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Chaudhry C. Farr G.W. Todd M.J. Rye H.S. Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4877-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We recently reported that ADP with minimum ATP contamination can mediate the binding of GroES to the substrate protein-free GroEL but not to the substrate protein-loaded GroEL (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previously reported cis-folding supported by ADP is most likely because of the trace amount of ATP contained in or generated from ADP. However, in BeFx, authentic ADP can promote GroES binding to the substrate protein-loaded GroEL to generate the cis-ternary complex in which folding can proceed efficiently (Fig. 5). It has been known that ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, is required for the step (i), cis-ternary complex formation, because a slow ATP-hydrolysis mutant GroEL (D398A) can generate a similar 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex when ATP is provided (12Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In this context, ADP·BeFx, but not ADP alone, can substitute ATP in the cis-ternary complex formation (Table II).Table IINucleotide states of cis-ringATPADPADP·BeFx(i) cis-ternary complex formationYesNoYes(ii) trans-ring activationNoYesYes(iii) cis-ternary complex decayNoYesNo Open table in a new tab If nucleotides at the cis-ring are unhydrolyzed ATP, step (ii) trans-ring activation does not occur even when ATP medium is present (12Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It occurs when the nucleotides at the cis-ring are ADP. However, the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex with ADP·BeFx in the cis-ring can undergo step (ii) when ATP is available (Fig. 6A). Thus, it appears that ATP hydrolysis of the cis-ATP complex is the prerequisite for the trans-ring activation, but Pi release from the cis-ADP·Pi complex is not. In the case when the reaction is started by ATP in the presence of BeFx, an intermediate cis-ADP·Pi complex would appear after the cis-ATP complex and BeFx rapidly replaces the Pi moiety of ADP·Pi to produce the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex, which then binds ATP at the trans-ring. These results indicate that, in the cis-ADP·Pi complex, the trans-ring is already activated and ready to bind ATP. As to the step (iii), different from the uninhibited cycle, ATP binding to the trans-ring in the presence of BeFx does not induce the release of GroES, ADP, and substrate protein from the cis-ring. Prior release of Pi from the cis-ring may be necessary for the cis-cavity opening that is induced by ATP binding to the activated trans-ring. The reactions continue in the presence of BeFx even without the decay of the cis-ternary complex and several events follow, binding of GroES to the trans-ring and hydrolysis of ATP in the trans-ring to produce ADP·Pi, which is then converted to ADP·BeFx. These events result in the production of the symmetric 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex with two folding chambers and with 14 ADP·BeFx. The contention above described is our preferred explanation, but of course, other possibilities are not excluded. For example, if the symmetric 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex would be a naturally occurring intermediate of the GroEL functional cycle as argued previously (31Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 36Azem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 37Sparrer H.

Activation of sGC results in the production of cGMP from GTP. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel protein interaction between CCT (chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide) subunit η and the α1β1 isoform of sGC. CCTη was found to interact with the β1 subunit of sGC via a yeast-two-hybrid screen. This interaction was then confirmed in vitro with a co-immunoprecipitation from mouse brain. The interaction between these two proteins was further supported by a co-localization of the proteins within rat brain. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, CCTη was found to bind to the N-terminal portion of sGC. In vitro assays with purified CCTη and Sf9 lysate expressing sGC resulted in a 30-50% inhibition of diethylamine diazeniumdiolate-NO-stimulated sGC activity. The same assays were then performed using BAY41-2272, an NO-independent allosteric sGC activator, and CCTη had no effect on this activity. Furthermore, CCTη had no effect on basal or sodium nitroprusside-stimulated αβCys-105 sGC, a constitutively active mutant that only lacks the heme group. The N-terminal 94 amino acids of CCTη seem to be critical for the mediation of this inhibition. Lastly, a 45% inhibition of sGC activity by CCTη was seen in vivo in BE2 cells stably transfected with CCTη and treated with sodium nitroprusside. These data suggest that CCTη binds to sGC and, in cooperation with some other factor, inhibits its activity by modifying the binding of NO to the heme group or the subsequent conformational changes.

The interaction between these two proteins was further supported by a co-localization of the proteins within rat brain. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, CCTη was found to bind to the N-terminal portion of sGC. In vitro assays with purified CCTη and Sf9 lysate expressing sGC resulted in a 30-50% inhibition of diethylamine diazeniumdiolate-NO-stimulated sGC activity. The same assays were then performed using BAY41-2272, an NO-independent allosteric sGC activator, and CCTη had no effect on this activity. Furthermore, CCTη had no effect on basal or sodium nitroprusside-stimulated αβCys-105 sGC, a constitutively active mutant that only lacks the heme group. The N-terminal 94 amino acids of CCTη seem to be critical for the mediation of this inhibition. Lastly, a 45% inhibition of sGC activity by CCTη was seen in vivo in BE2 cells stably transfected with CCTη and treated with sodium nitroprusside. These data suggest that CCTη binds to sGC and, in cooperation with some other factor, inhibits its activity by modifying the binding of NO to the heme group or the subsequent conformational changes.

NO is produced by the enzyme nitric-oxide synthase. The main target of NO, mediating most of its downstream effects, is a cytosolic heterodimer of α and β subunits known as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Upon NO binding, the activated sGC catalyzes the formation of cGMP from GTP (1Murad F. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Murad F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 3Murad F. Forstermann U. Nakane M. Pollock J. Tracey R. Matsumoto T. Buechler W. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP is then involved in the activation of a variety of effectors such as cyclic nucleotidegated channels, protein kinases, and phosphodiesterases (4Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar).There has been evidence suggesting that there are in vivo mechanisms other than nitric oxide that regulate sGC activity. Bellamy et al. (5Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) show that deactivation of sGC on the removal of NO occurred 25-fold faster in intact cerebellar cells than the fastest estimate for purified sGC. These data suggest that there is probably another protein or group of proteins that regulate sGC activity, because it occurs in the order of seconds.In addition to the indirect evidence of protein regulation of sGC provided by Bellamy et al. (5Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), PSD95 (post-synaptic density protein 95) (6Russwurm M. Wittau N. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44647-44652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) (7Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Ju H. Harris M.B. Snead C. Jilling T. Dimitropoulou C. Maragoudakis M.E. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H669-H678Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have both been shown to interact with isoforms of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Both PSD95 and HSP90 were shown to localize different isoforms of sGC to the membrane. Additionally, HSP90 was shown to enhance the response of sGC to NO. In both of these cases, the interaction with sGC is modulated by interaction with a nitric-oxide synthase isoform. We hypothesized that a protein existed that modified sGC activity, independent of any interaction with nitric-oxide synthase isoforms.To find this regulator of sGC activity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with the β1 subunit of sGC as bait against a human brain cDNA library. The screening revealed CCT (chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide) subunit η to be an interacting protein. Immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical studies suggest that such interaction occurs in vivo. This interaction inhibited NO-stimulated sGC activity both in vitro and in vivo, whereas basal activity or activation by allosteric regulator was not affected by CCTη. CCTη had no effect on the constitutively active αβCys-105 sGC mutant that lacks a heme group. These studies suggest that CCTη, in cooperation with some other factor, can mediate a novel type of NO-dependent inhibition of sGC.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll of the materials were supplied by Sigma unless otherwise specified.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The full-length cDNA of the β1 subunit of sGC was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the pGBKT7 vector between the EcoRI and SalI sites (pGBβ). This vector was transfected into AH109 yeast cells (Clontech). A human brain cDNA library cloned in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain of the pACT2 vector was transfected into yeast containing the pGBβ vector. The resulting transfected yeast were then plated on quadruple dropout agar (-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade) with 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. The yeast were then allowed to grow for 3 weeks at 30 °C at which time the positive clones that were greater than 2 mm in diameter were picked and grown in Leu-deficient medium overnight. The yeast were then lysed, and the pACT2 vectors containing the target proteins (pACT-prot) were amplified in TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The pACT-prot were then transfected into AH109 containing pGBβ and replated on quadruple dropout agar. B-Galactosidase filter lift assays (Clontech) were then performed on these clones to try and reduce the number of false positives. The positive clones from this screening were then transfected into AH109 and AH109 containing pGBKT7 as controls to see whether any of these positive clones could activate the reporter gene in AH109 by itself or in conjunction with the binding domain alone. This step further reduced the number of false positives.Deletions of β1 Subunit—To identify the sGC-binding region(s) at CCTη, progressive C-terminal deletions of sGC β subunit were generated. The truncated β subunits were cloned into pGBT7 vector to generate pGBβΔ366-619, pGBβΔ266-619, and pGBβΔ100-619 constructs carrying the indicated deletions.α-Galactosidase Assay—The plasmids with full-length and truncated β1 subunit (pGBβ, pGBβΔ366-619, pGBβΔ266-619, and pGBβΔ100-619) were transfected into AH109 containing pACT-CCTη and grown in selective liquid culture(-Trp/-Leu) overnight. The yeast were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and 8 μl of the conditioned growth medium were mixed with 24 μl of assay buffer (33 mmp-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactoside and 333 mm sodium acetate). This mixture was then incubated in a water bath of 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 960 μl of stop solution (100 mm sodium carbonate). The optical density of each of these samples was then measured at 410 nm, and α-galactosidase activity was estimated. One unit of α-galactosidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactoside to p-nitrophenol and d-galactose in 1 min at 30 °C in acetate buffer at pH 4.5, as described in the Clontech yeast two-hybrid protocol.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CCTη with Histidine Tag— Full-length CCTη was amplified out of brain cDNA library (Clontech) using the 5′ primer, 5′-TTAGAATTCCACATGATGCCCACACCAGTTATCCTATTGAAA-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TGGCGCCGGCGTCAGTGGGGGCGGCCACG-3′, and TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The resultant 1.5-kb PCR product contained the full-length CCTη and was cloned into a TOPO2.1 vector. The wild type CCTη gene alone codes for a protein with a molecular mass of a 45-kDa protein. The CCTη ORF was then cut with EcoRI and ligated into pET 28a in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag. This His6-tagged CCTη has a molecular mass of ∼75 kDa. The CCTη-pET 28a construct was then transformed into BL21 DE3 pLysS cells and selected on kanamycin (50 μg/ml) LB plates. A colony from the plate was picked and grown overnight in culture. 10 ml of culture was then taken and diluted to an A600 of 0.02 in 300 ml of fresh LB. After the A600 reached 0.4, 1.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. The culture was then shaken for another 9 h, after which time the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in hypotonic phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 30 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) with 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μg/ml lysozyme and left on ice for 30 min. Following sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was then passed through a 5-ml packed column of nickel-tagged agarose (Novagen). The column was then washed with 12 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) followed by 10 column volumes of 100 mm imidazole in PBS and eluted with 3 column volumes of 250 mm imidazole in PBS. This elution was then concentrated with an Amicon Ym-30 column and used for GTP conversion assays. The control β-galactosidase protein was purified in a similar manner.Western Blots—Protein samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to methanol-activated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking the membranes, the following antibodies were used for detection: rabbit polyclonal soluble guanylyl cyclase antibodies (Cayman) at a 1:5,000 dilution; clone B4 of mouse monoclonal soluble guanylyl cyclase antibodies (8Brandwein H. Lewicki J. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4241-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal His6 antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:3,000 dilution, and rabbit polyclonal CCTη antibodies (a gift from Dr. Willison at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom) characterized in detail previously (9Hynes G. Kubota H. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma) along with ECL+ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for visualization of the bands.Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Adult rats were terminally anesthetized with chloroform and perfused transcardially with 500 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by 500 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3-4 h, and immersed in 20% sucrose overnight. Serial sections of 100 μm were cut in the coronal plane using an HM505E Microm cryostat and collected in PBS. Sections were blocked and permeabilized for 1 h in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies (1:300 for B4 mouse monoclonal sGC antibodies and 1:1000 for CCTη rabbit polyclonal antibody) were diluted in the same solution and incubated with sections of rat brain overnight at 4 °C. Control sections were not incubated with any primary antibody. All of the sections were then washed three times for 10 min in PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa-568-coupled antibodies and goat anti-mouse Alexa-488-coupled antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 for 3 h at 4 °C. The sections were washed three times for 10 min in PBS and then mounted.Confocal microscopy was done on a Zeiss LSM-410. Sections through the tissue were imaged at 1 μm. Eight sections were recorded per tissue slice. Brightness and contrast of images were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems).Preparation of Lysates for Immunoprecipitation and CCTη Expression—The mouse organs used for determination of CCTη expression were homogenized in 4 ml of PBS with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, and 1 μm benzamidine. The whole cell lysate protein concentration was determined via Bradford assay. The mouse brains used for co-immunoprecipitation were prepared in the same buffer and then following homogenization, the lysate was centrifuged at 2,900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then taken and centrifuged for 45 min at 29,000 × g and 4 °C.Co-immunoprecipitation—20 μl of a 50% protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) slurry was added to control and experimental tubes. 20 μl of ascite serum with rat monoclonal CCT antibody (Stressgen) or rat preimmune serum were added to each of the two tubes and allowed to bind to the beads for 15 min at room temperature. 30 mm Phe-Arg and Phe-Leu dipeptides were added to the beads to block nonspecific binding sites and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was spun down for 5 s, and the supernatant was discarded. 940 μl of PBS was then added to each tube along with 780 μg of mouse brain lysate prepared as described above and incubated with constant mixing at 4 °C overnight. The tubes were then spun down at 10,000 × g and washed with 500 μl of PBS five times. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli buffer. 20 μl of the eluted samples and 5 μl of lysate were loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above.Human sGC Expression and Purification—Human recombinant sGC expression and lysate preparation were done using the SF9 baculovirus system previously described (10Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).GTP Conversion Assay—Purified CCTη (3.25 μg) and either sGC-expressing Sf9 lysate (5-8 μg) or αβCys-105 mutant sGC-expressing Sf9 lysate (5-8 μg) or purified sGC (1.2 μg) were incubated together in 20 μl of sample buffer (2 mg/ml albumin, 50 mm triethanolamine, and 100 μm EGTA) for 10 min at room temperature. Following the incubation, 40 μl of reaction buffer (125 mm triethanolamine, 250 μm EGTA, 2.5 mm IBMX, 2.5 mg/ml albumin, 2.5 mm cGMP, 0.125 mg/ml creatine kinase, 12.5 mm creatine phosphate, and 7.5 mm magnesium chloride) were added. To the mixture of sample buffer and incubation buffer, 40 μl of substrate buffer containing various concentrations of DEA-NO (as indicated) or 100 μm SNP or 2 μm BAY and 200 μm GTP/0.01 μCi of [α-32P]GTP were added. This mixture was then incubated in a circulating water bath at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 100 mm zinc acetate and 1 ml of 120 mm sodium carbonate. The tubes were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was loaded on to 1.5-ml aluminum columns. Synthesized cGMP was eluted with 10 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then quantified on β scintillation counter.Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—FLAG-tagged CCTη was amplified using the 5′ primer, 5′-TAAGCTAGCCACATGATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGCCCACACCAGTTATCCTATTGAAA-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TGGCGCCGGCGTCAGTGGGGGCGGCCACG-3′, and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pMGH2 (Invivogen). BE2 cells (ATCC number CRL-2268) were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2 in cell culture medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.05 mm non-essential amino acids). Four 100-mm plates of 80% confluent BE2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE-plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two were transfected with pMG-CCTη plasmid, and two were transfected with pMGH2 vector alone. To select the stable transfected clones, media with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) were added to each of the plates every 4 days for 3 weeks. Stable colonies were then picked, transferred to fresh plates, and grown to confluency with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase Reaction—RNA was isolated from confluent plates of BE2 cells stably transfected with a pMG-CCTη construct and pMGH2 vector using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers. The expression of FLAG-tagged CCTη was tested by a reverse transcriptase reaction using the following primers: 5′-CACCCACCTCAGCATCTTGGGAT-3′ (CCTη-specific) and 5′-ATGATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACG-3′ (FLAG-specific).cGMP Tritium Radioimmunoassay of Stable Clones—The BE2 stables expressing CCTη and control cells were split at 50% confluence and replaced with medium that did not contain hygromycin B. The stables were at 80-90% confluence when the assay was conducted. The medium described by the ATCC for the BE2 cells was taken off the cells and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 2 mm IBMX for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 1 mm SNP was then added to the medium, and cells were incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. This medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS with 2.5 mm IBMX. The cells were trypsinized and harvested. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 125 mm triethanolamine, 250 μm EGTA, and 2.5 mm IBMX. The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. 80 μl of supernatant, as determined by the Bradford assay, of the control and CCTη-expressing cells were used for cGMP radioimmunoassay. The cGMP tritium radioimmunoassay (Amersham-TRK500) was done according the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSYeat Two-hybrid Screening—To find the putative protein(s) that interacts with human sGC, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using human brain yeast two-hybrid cDNA library (Clontech). Twelve million cDNAs were screened against full-length human β1 protein, and 334 of these clones grew on selective medium. 12 of these clones were positive for the X-galactosidase filter lift assay. Sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames of 1315 bases and 1350 bases in length, both of which were CCTη. The specificity of the interaction was then confirmed by transfecting the activation domain plasmid containing the CCTη gene into yeast with a plasmid encoding just the Gal4 binding domain without bait and also into yeast with no plasmid. Both of these transfections did not grow on selective media, indicating that the interaction is specific in yeast (data not shown).Because CCTη is a novel interacting partner of α1β1 sGC identified via a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we next wanted to determine the expression pattern of CCTη versus the ubiquitously expressed α1β1 sGC. We found that CCTη was abundant in many tissues. CCTη was not expressed at all in the small intestine, but it was expressed in the testis, heart, brain, kidneys, and lungs (Fig. 1).sGC Co-immunoprecipitates with CCTη—After the expression pattern of CCTη was determined, we tested the interaction between sGC and CCTη by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of CCTη protein from the C57BL6 mouse brain revealed the co-precipitation of sGC. On the contrary, when immunoprecipitation was performed with the preimmune serum, neither CCTη nor sGC was precipitated, confirming the specificity of sGC/CCTη precipitation (Fig. 2). Based on the standard curves obtained from the Western blotting of purified CCTη and sGC, we calculated that ∼6% of the total CCTη was precipitated together with ∼2% of the β subunit of sGC (data not shown).Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation of sGC with CCTη. CCTη was immunoprecipitated from mouse brain (load lane, lane 1) using rat preimmune serum (lane 2), or rat monoclonal CCT antibodies (lane 3). Western blotting (WB) with rabbit polyclonal anti-CCTη antibodies (A) or rabbit polyclonal anti-sGC antibodies (B) was used to detect the co-precipitation of CCTη and sGC. 5 μl of load and 20 μl of immunoprecipitated (IP) elution were loaded in each case. C, specificity of anti-sGC antibodies was confirmed by the blocking of sGC signal with an excess of antigenic peptide (lanes 1 and 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Co-localization of sGC and CCTη—After confirming the in vivo interaction between sGC and CCTη by immunoprecipitation, we next decided to visualize the co-localization of CCTη and sGC in rat brain by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). As seen in the image from all of the magnifications (Fig. 3, C, F, and I) CCTη and sGC proteins do co-localize in the rat hippocampus along the dentate gyrus. From the highest magnification, it appears that sGC has cytosolic and perinuclear localization, whereas CCTη localizes mainly in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 3H). Such subcellular localization suggests that only the cytosolic fraction of sGC enzyme could efficiently interact with CCTη protein.Fig. 3Co-localization and confocal microscopy of sGC and CCTη in rat hippocampus. Sections of rat hippocampus were stained with anti-CCTη (A, D, and G) or anti-sGC (B, E, and H) antibodies and viewed at several increasing magnifications. First row, viewed at ×10 magnification; second row, viewed at ×120 magnification, third row, viewed at ×300 magnification. Co-localization of sGC and CCTη is presented in panels C, F, and I. Control staining without primary antibodies for CCTη and sGC are shown at lowest magnification in panels J and K, respectively. A quantitative representation of the amount of co-localization between the two proteins is shown in L with the units of both axes pixel-numbered. The bar beneath the graph indicates the color scheme for an increasing number of co-localized pixels with red being the highest. The white bar in A, B, and C is 270 μm, the bar in D, E, and F is 20 μm, and the bar in G, H, and I is 8 μm in scale. The scale bar of controls (J and K) is 270 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Region of β1 Interacting with CCTη—We next determined the region of the β1 subunit of sGC that interacts with CCTη. As seen in Fig. 4, the first 100 amino acids of β1 subunit are not sufficient to interact with CCTη protein. However, the truncated β1 subunit carrying 266 residues interacts with CCTη with the same efficiency as the truncated β1 subunit with 366 residues. The highest strength of interaction was observed when full-length β1 subunit was tested. Thus, these data indicate that there are at least two regions in the β1 subunit, one between the residues 101 and 266 and another between residues 367 and 619, that are interacting with CCTη protein.Fig. 4Defining the region of interaction between the β1 subunit of sGC and CCTη. Progressive C-terminal deletions of the sGC β1 subunit were cloned in-frame to the GAL4 binding domain of the bait vector pGBKT7 of the yeast two-hybrid system. The full-length CCTη was cloned in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain of the target pACT vector of the yeast two-hybrid system. Both bait and target vectors were transfected into the AH109 strain of yeast, and the strength of the interaction was measured in vivo by the α-galactosidase assay. Interaction of p53 and the small T-antigen was used as positive control for in vivo interaction, whereas interaction of sGC β1 subunit and actin was used as negative control. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of two independent experiments performed in tetraplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CCTη Inhibits NO-stimulated sGC Activity—To determine whether or not CCTη has an effect on sGC activity, we expressed a full-length CCTη tagged with hexahistidine at the N terminus in BL21 bacterial strain. Hexahistidine-tagged β-galactosidase was also expressed in the same strain and used as negative control. The results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that β-galactosidase and buffer have a similar effect on DEA-NO-stimulated cGMP formation activity of sGC, whereas CCTη inhibits this cGMP formation by 30-50% in the 10-100 μm range of DEA-NO (Fig. 5). Furthermore, CCTη seems to inhibit sGC-expressing Sf9 lysate by decreasing the Vmax of NO stimulated-sGC and not by affecting the EC50 of sGC for NO. Note that there is no difference in cGMP formation activities among buffer, β-galactosidase, and CCTη under basal conditions. When BAY41-2272 was used to stimulate the sGC-expressing Sf9 lysate, no difference in cGMP formation was seen between controls and CCTη (data not shown). The fact that CCTη inhibited NO-stimulated sGC, a heme-dependent agonist, but did not inhibit BAY-stimulated sGC, an NO-independent allosteric activator, or any of the basal activities of sGC implies that the mechanism of CCTη inhibition may work through a modification of the NO-stimulated heme group or the consequent conformational changes that occur after NO binds to the heme group.Fig. 5CCTη inhibits sGC Vmax but does not affect the affinity to NO. Inset, purity of CCTη preparation was tested by Coomassie Blue staining (lane 2), and the identity of the purified protein was confirmed by Western blotting (lane 1) using anti-CCTη antibodies. Protein molecular size markers are shown in lane 3. Sf9 lysate-expressing sGC enzyme was treated with increasing concentration of NO-donor DEA-NO in the presence of equal amounts of purified CCTη (triangles), β-galactosidase (squares), or control buffer (diamonds). sGC activity was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This mechanism of CCTη inhibition of NO-stimulated sGC was further supported by the effect seen on αβCys-105 sGC. This mutant lacks the heme moiety because of the substitution of His-105 residue coordinating heme iron and is insensitive to NO stimulation (11Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it was shown that αβCys-105 sGC has a constitutively increased activity, even in the absence of any stimulators, suggesting that the mutant sGC is already in an activated conformation (11Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These properties of the mutant enzyme are also summarized in the Fig. 6A. Preincubation of the mutant enzyme with CCTη has no effect on cGMP-forming activity of basal or NO-treated αβCys-105 sGC similar to the control buffer or β-galactosidase protein (Fig. 6B). However, preincubation of wild type enzyme with CCTη inhibit the SNP-stimulated activity versus buffer and β-galactosidase controls. This lends further evidence to the hypothesis that CCTη inhibits sGC activity through modification of an NO-activated heme group or a modification of the conformational changes induced by nitrosyl heme.Fig. 6CCTη inhi"
https://openalex.org/W2114807370,"Recently, the PAT family of proton-dependent amino acid transporters has been identified as a novel class of mammalian amino acid symporters. PAT1 and PAT2 members mediate electrogenic uptake of small, neutral amino acids and derivatives by cotransport of protons. Analysis of the structural requirements for substrate recognition by PAT1 identified that a free amino group in a substrate is not essential for recognition. We therefore hypothesized that PAT1 and its ortholog PAT2 may also be able to recognize and transport the homologous short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. We examined in Xenopus laevis oocytes whether the SCFAs interact with the transporter by employing flux studies, electrophysiology and intracellular pH recordings. SCFAs did not induce positive inward currents but inhibited glycine-induced transport currents. PAT-mediated uptake of radiolabeled proline was also dose-dependently reduced by SCFA and could be described by first order competition kinetics with apparent Ki-values for butyrate of 6.0 +/- 0.7 and 7.6 +/- 1.3 mM for PAT1 and PAT2, respectively. Acetate as well as propionate uptake was significantly enhanced in oocytes expressing PAT1 or PAT2. An electroneutral H+/SCFA symport mode was demonstrated by recording intracellular pH changes under voltage clamp conditions with rate constants for the initial intracellular acidification in the presence of SCFAs significantly increased in PAT-expressing oocytes. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the PAT1 and PAT2 proteins are capable to transport selected SCFAs in an electroneutral and the homologous amino acids in an electrogenic mode and are therefore a paradigm for bifunctional solute carriers."

Whereas the DsbA-DsbB system utilizes the oxidizing power of ubiquinone (UQ) under aerobic conditions, menaquinone (MK) is believed to function as an immediate electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. Here, we characterized MK reactivities with DsbB. In the absence of UQ, DsbB was complexed with MK8 in the cell. In vitro studies showed that, by binding to DsbB in a manner competitive with UQ, MK specifically oxidized Cys41 and Cys44 of DsbB and activated its catalytic function to oxidize reduced DsbA. In contrast, menadione used in earlier studies proved to be a more nonspecific oxidant of DsbB. During catalysis, MK8 underwent a spectroscopic transition to develop a visible violet color (λmax = 550 nm), which required a reduced state of Cys44 as shown previously for UQ color development (λmax = 500 nm) on DsbB. In an in vitro reaction system of MK8-dependent oxidation of DsbA at 30 °C, two reaction components were observed, one completing within minutes and the other taking >1 h. Both of these reaction modes were accompanied by the transition state of MK, for which the slower reaction proceeded through the disulfide-linked DsbA-DsbB(MK) intermediate. The MK-dependent pathway provides opportunities to further dissect the quinone-dependent DsbA-DsbB redox reactions.

Disulfide bond formation, an important maturation process for envelope and secreted proteins, depends on dedicated cellular factors (Dsb proteins) (1Collet J.-F. Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 179: 2465-2471Google Scholar, 2Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 72: 111-135Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). DsbA, a periplasmic enzyme of Escherichia coli, introduces disulfide bonds into newly exported proteins using its Cys30–Cys33 active-site disulfide bond. DsbB, a plasma membrane protein, re-oxidizes the DsbA cysteines to enable catalytic functioning of DsbA (3Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As a more thorough introduction and discussion of the modes of DsbB function in the oxidation of DsbA, including the current controversies, has been presented in our previous study (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we recapitulate some salient features of UQ-DsbB interaction here. Ubiquinone interacts with DsbB with a Km of ∼2.0 μm and activates its DsbA-oxidizing activity in vitro (10Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Of the two pairs of essential cysteines in the periplasmic domains of DsbB (Cys41/Cys44 in the N-terminal loop and Cys104/Cys130 in the C-terminal loop) (12Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the Cys41/Cys44 pair is strongly oxidized by the respiratory components in vivo (8Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, UQ1 or decylubiquinone oxidizes this pair (but not the other pair) of cysteines in vitro (13Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the UQ-binding site on DsbB has not been directly determined (15Xie T. Yu L. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1649-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the functional importance of the region around Cys44 in this interaction has been suggested. Mutations of residues 42 and 43 affect the redox potential and reactivity of DsbB, and those of the short segment between Cys44 and the second transmembrane region impair UQ8-dependent DsbB oxidation in vivo (13Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, the importance of the length of this segment (17Kobayashi T. Takahashi Y. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as well as of Arg48 (16Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10884-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for the quinone-DsbB interaction has been proposed. The peculiar states of DsbB-bound UQ have been described recently. Bardwell and co-workers (18Regeimbal J. Gleiter S. Trumpower B.L. Yu C.-A. Diwaker M. Ballou D.P. Bardwell J.C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13779-13784Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggested that UQ on DsbB constitutively forms a quinhydrone-type charge transfer complex consisting of a hydroquinone and a benzoquinone moiety and having a strong absorption at 505–510 nm. In contrast, we have shown that UQ undergoes a spectroscopic transition to exhibit an absorption peak at ∼500 nm only when it is on DsbB in certain forms (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of these forms is the DsbA-DsbB complex, in which DsbA and DsbB are held together by an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys30 of DsbA and Cys104 of DsbB. Mutational analyses indicated that generation of reduced Cys44 in DsbB is primarily responsible for the color development and that the important sequence/structural features around this residue (as discussed above) are also required for the UQ “red shift.” Although DsbA itself is not directly required for the UQ anomaly, a disulfide rearrangement in the DsbA-DsbB complex, as demonstrated by Kadokura and Beckwith (19Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), will generate reduced Cys44 and hence the spectroscopic transition of UQ. More specifically, engagement of Cys104 in the mixed disulfide formation with Cys30 of DsbA renders reduced Cys130, which in turn attacks the Cys41–Cys44 disulfide to form a Cys41–Cys130 disulfide and to reduce Cys44. On the basis of these observations and considerations, we proposed that the spectroscopic transition of UQ represents its activated state that drives electron transfer and resolution of the DsbA-DsbB complex in a manner overcoming the reversed redox potential difference (Refs. 13Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 14Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol.

Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DsbA-dependent disulfide bond formation is not impaired in anaerobically growing E. coli cells (7Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 10Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 10884-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in which menaquinone (MK) is the prevailing quinone species (21Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). MK is indeed believed to play an electron-accepting role like UQ in the DsbA-DsbB system (7Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 16Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10884-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, MK reactivity with DsbB has not been studied systematically. The first indication for the in vivo importance of MK was provided by our observation that mutational impairment of both the UQ and MK biosynthetic pathways results in dysfunction of the DsbA-DsbB system (9Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Kadokura et al. (16Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10884-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that some Arg48 substitutions in DsbB result in a low activity enzyme that can no longer utilize the MK analog menadione as an in vitro electron-accepting substrate. The aim of this study was to characterize the MK-dependent pathway of oxidative protein folding. Here, we identified the MK molecular species (MK8) that associates with DsbB in the absence of UQ and showed that its interaction with DsbB is similar to that of UQ, including a striking spectroscopic transition elicited by the special states of DsbB. The in vitro reaction of DsbA oxidation with MK8 proved slower than the UQ-dependent reaction, and we characterized this reaction in some detail to gain further insights into the molecular pathways of quinone-coupled and DsbB-dependent oxidation of DsbA.

Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with the same medium without UQ1, and then re-inoculated into the UQ1-free medium. After overnight shaking, cells were diluted into the same medium for an additional 3 h of growth at 37 °C. Cultures were directly treated with trichloroacetic acid (5%) to “freeze” the redox states of the proteins, which were dissolved in SDS solution containing AMS and subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-DsbA immunoblotting (9Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this assay, reduced DsbA is mobility-shifted due to the AMS modification. Preparation of Various Forms of DsbB and DsbA—All of the DsbB-derived proteins used in this work contained a His6 tag attached to the C terminus, and their nonessential cysteine residues (Cys8 and Cys49) were mutated to Ala and Val, respectively (7Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The DsbB variant is referred to simply as DsbB in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with appropriate sets of primers. DsbB and its mutant forms were overexpressed and purified as described by Inaba et al. (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DsbA was overexpressed and purified as described by Inaba and Ito (13Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding DsbA(C33S) was described previously (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To prepare DsbB without endogenously bound quinones, it was overproduced in the ubiA menA double mutant strain AN384 (21Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as described by Inaba et al. (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This quinone-free DsbB protein is referred to as DsbB(ΔQ) and contained <0.05 molar eq of quinones as determined by UV spectrum measurements before and after reduction with NaBH4 (10Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, DsbB prepared from wild-type cells contains endogenous UQ8 and is referred to as DsbB(UQ). To prepare DsbB with endogenously bound MK, it was overproduced in the ubiA- mutant strain TA36. Plasmid-bearing cells were grown first in the presence of UQ1 and then in its absence as described above, except that the final cell growth was started at a turbidity of 60 with a Klett colorimeter (filter no. 54) in the presence of 10 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and continued for 4 h. This DsbB protein was then purified by standard procedures (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is referred to as DsbB(MK). Purified DsbA was reduced by incubation with 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min, followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove DTT. DsbB was similarly reduced with DTT, but more care was required with the gel filtration steps because DsbB is prone to rapid air oxidation in the absence of DTT. Thus, we equilibrated Bio-Spin resin with degassed buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM)) containing 20 mm DTT for 30 min, followed by a thorough wash with degassed DTT-free buffer before loading the DTT-reduced DsbB preparation. Identification of DsbB-bound Menaquinone—MK species were extracted from the DsbB(MK) preparation (see above) essentially as described by Bader et al. (10Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Four milliliters of a DsbB(MK) solution (6 mg/ml) was mixed with 6 ml of methanol (-20 °C) and then extracted four times with 10 ml of hexane. The combined hexane phases were evaporated to dryness under vacuum, and residual materials were dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol. A Shimadzu LCMS-2010A instrument was used to separate a 5-μl portion on a Shim-pack VP-ODS reverse-phase chromatography column by elution with methanol/isopropyl alcohol (3:1) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Peak fractions were then subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with scanning from m/z 900 to 100 for 1 s. The absorption spectra of the MK species extracted from DsbB(MK) were recorded at wavelengths of 200–400 nm using a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer (1-cm light path). To quantify MK8, the extracted MK sample was dissolved in ethanol containing 0.01 volume of 1 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and a portion was treated with a few pieces of solid NaBH4, which should have reduced any quinone molecules within 2 min at room temperature (24Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient difference between oxidized and reduced forms of MK was assumed to be Δϵ245 = 25.84 mm-1 cm-1 (24Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to quantify MK8. In Vitro Assays for DsbB-catalyzed DsbA Oxidation—DsbB activities were followed by several different methods. For kinetic studies, oxidation of DsbA was determined by the decrease in DsbA fluorescence (25Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) essentially as described by Bader et al. (26Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The initial velocity of the reaction was determined from the initial slope of the fluorescence change at 330 nm using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% DDM, 20 μm reduced DsbA, 5 nm DsbB, and the indicated concentrations of quinones when necessary. Assays were carried out at 30 °C by manual addition of DsbB. Reactions between DsbB and reduced DsbA in the presence of a quinone species were also determined by gel electrophoresis as described by Inaba et al. (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, reactions were terminated by mixing with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid for subsequent AMS modification and SDS-PAGE of the proteins involved. Protein species were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Band intensities for reduced DsbA, oxidized DsbA, partially reduced DsbB, oxidized DsbB, and the DsbA-DsbB disulfide complex were quantified using a Fuji LAS-1000 CCD image analyzer. Finally, the DsbB reactions were followed by spectroscopic changes of a quinone species. To follow absorption changes at 550 nm during the reaction between reduced DsbA and DsbB(MK), absorption spectra from 400 to 700 nm were scanned at various time points after a 1:1 mixing of DsbB(MK) (80 μm) and reduced DsbA (80 μm). The buffer solution was 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.02% DDM. MK-dependent in Vivo Oxidation of DsbA—MK is considered to be a major anaerobic quinone species (21Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is also believed to function as an immediate electron acceptor of the DsbA-DsbB redox system under anaerobic conditions (7Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 10Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To mimic the anaerobic cellular quinone composition, we used an E. coli mutant defective in UQ biosynthesis. Whereas the ubiA menA double mutant defective in both the UQ and MK biosynthetic enzymes accumulated reduced DsbA (Fig. 1, lanes 4), the ubiA single mutant contained normally oxidized DsbA (lanes 3) even when cells were deprived of UQ1. The DsbA redox states did not differ significantly between aerobically (Fig. 1A) and semi-anaerobically (Fig. 1B) grown cells. Thus, irrespective of oxygen availability, MK can support the DsbA oxidation function of DsbB in vivo. DsbB Interacts with MK8 (but Not with Demethylmenaquinone-8 (DMK8)) in the Absence of UQ—E. coli contains three major quinone compounds, UQ8, MK8, and DMK8 (24Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DsbB is purified from aerobically grown E. coli cells as a complex with UQ8 (10Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To examine whether DsbB is still complexed with a quinone species in the absence of UQ, we expressed it in cells of the ubiA mutant that had been deprived of UQ1. DsbB was purified, and the preparation was subjected to extraction with organic solvents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Upon reverse-phase column chromatography, the extracted materials gave two peaks (minor (peak I) and major (peak II)) in addition to some materials with early retention times (Fig. 2A). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the peak I and II compounds had molecular masses of 725.45 and 739.50 Da, respectively, which coincided with those of a single Na+ adduct of DMK8 and of MK8 (Fig. 2B). The DsbB preparation contained only a trace of peak I material, suggesting that DsbB in the UQ-deprived cells was associated with MK8. This notion was supported further by measurement of the NMR spectrum of the DsbB extract, which proved to be almost identical to that of a commercially available MK analog, MK4 (data not shown). The fact that DsbB was purified as a complex with MK8 (but not with DMK8 of ∼3-fold greater cellular abundance (21Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)) from UQ-depleted E. coli cells indicates that DsbB specifically recognizes MK8. MK8 in ethanol shows several broad absorption peaks at 230–280 nm, the intensity and sharpness of which increase upon reduction (24Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the UV-visible spectra of the DsbB extract before and after reduction with NaBH4. The spectroscopic patterns observed were indeed characteristic of the oxidized and reduced forms of MK. Assuming that the extinction coefficient difference between the oxidized and reduced MK forms at 245 nm is 25.84 mm-1 cm-1 (24Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we calculated that our DsbB preparation from the UQ-free cells contained equimolar amounts of the DsbB polypeptide and MK8. In conclusion, DsbB specifically interacts with MK8 to form a 1:1 complex. Specific Oxidation of the Cys41/Cys44 Pair in DsbB by MK—To characterize the reactivity between MK and DsbB, we first reduced DsbB(ΔQ), which had been purified as a quinone-free form from the ubiA menA double mutant cells (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.-H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and incubated it with MK4 (a commercial product). In addition to wild-type DsbB (DsbB(CCCC)), we used its derivatives lacking the C-terminal (DsbB(CCSS)) or N-terminal (DsbB(SSCC)) pair of essential cysteines. The redox states of DsbB were determined by the modifiability with AMS, which alkylates a thiol and thereby causes mobility retardation upon SDS-PAGE. Reduced DsbB(CCCC) was converted to the fully oxidized form when it was incubated with MK4 at 30 °C for 60 min or longer (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–5). DsbB(CCSS), retaining the Cys41/Cys44 pair, was MK4-dependent and completely oxidized within 120 min (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–10), but DsbB(SSCC), retaining the Cys104/Cys130 pair, was only insignificantly oxidized (lanes 12–15). These results indicate that, like UQ (8Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), MK4 selectively oxidizes the Cys41/Cys44 pair of essential cysteine residues in DsbB. It was noted that MK-dependent DsbB oxidation was slower than the UQ-dependent reaction. Also, wild-type DsbB was more rapidly oxidized than DsbB(CCSS). When reduced DsbA was included in the above reactions, it was oxidized only by the wild-type DsbB protein in an MK4-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). In the experimental settings used, oxidation of DsbB appeared to precede the oxidation of DsbA, indicating that DsbB must first be oxidized by MK4 to initiate DsbA oxidation. Neither DsbB(CCSS) nor DsbB(SSCC) was active in DsbA oxidation in the presence of MK4, consistent with the essentiality of all of the cysteine residues at positions 41, 44, 104, and 130 in DsbB (12Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, like UQ, MK4 activates the DsbA oxidation pathway(s), in which all of these DsbB cysteines play crucial roles. In previous studies, Bader et al. (7Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and Kadokura et al. (16Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl.

We found, however, that the menadione reactivity was nonspecific in that it oxidized not only the Cys41/Cys44 pair, but also the Cys104/Cys130 pair in DsbB (Fig. 3C). Similar reactivity was also noted for UQ0, a UQ analog without a hydrophobic side chain. 2Y.-h. Takahashi, unpublished data. These results suggest that a hydrophobic isoprenyl chain of quinone molecules is important for their specific interaction with DsbB to create the correct intramolecular disulfide bond. MK Acts as a Competitive Inhibitor in the UQ-dependent DsbA Oxidation Reaction Mediated by DsbB—The DsbB-mediated DsbA oxidation reaction in vitro is a few orders of magnitude slower in the presence of MK4 than UQ. 3Y.-h. Takahashi and K. Inaba, unpublished data. If MK4 and UQ share a specific binding site on DsbB, MK4 may interfere with the UQ-dependent rapid DsbA oxidation reaction. Indeed, we observed such inhibit"

The physiological function of this APP domain has not yet being established; nevertheless several studies support the notion that the CuBD of APP is involved in Cu homeostasis. We used APP synthetic peptides to evaluate their protective properties against Cu2+ neurotoxicity in a bilateral intra-hippocampal injection model. We found that human APP135-156 protects against Cu2+-induced neurotoxic effects, such as, impairment of spatial memory, neuronal cell loss, and astrogliosis. APP135-156 lacking two histidine residues showed protection against Cu2+; however, APP135-156 mutated in cysteine 144, a key residue in the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu1+, did not protect against Cu2+ neurotoxicity. In accordance with recent reports, the CuBD of the Caenorhabditis elegans, APL-1, protected against Cu2+ neurotoxicity in vivo. We also found that Cu2+ neurotoxicity is associated with an increase in nitrotyrosine immunofluorescence as well as with a decrease in Cu2+ uptake. The CuBD of APP therefore may play a role in the detoxification of brain Cu."
https://openalex.org/W2122999078,"INGAP peptide comprises the core active sequence of Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein (INGAP), a pancreatic cytokine that can induce new islet formation and restore euglycemia in diabetic rodents. The ability of INGAP peptide in vitro to enhance nerve growth from sensory ganglia suggests its potential utility in peripheral nerve disorders. In this study, INGAP peptide was administered alone or in combination with insulin to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice exhibiting signs of peripheral neuropathy. Following a 2-wk treatment period, thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic mice was significantly improved in groups that received INGAP peptide, without development of hyperalgesia. Explanted dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from these groups showed enhanced nerve outgrowth and evidence of increased mitochondrial activity. Western blotting experiments revealed attenuation of neurofilament hyperphosphorylation, up-regulation of beta-tubulin and actin, and increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 in DRG. These findings suggest that INGAP peptide can activate some of the signaling pathways implicated in nerve regeneration in sensory ganglia, thereby providing a means of improvement of nociceptive dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2153434031,"Mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1) cause the blinding disease Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). The similarity of AIPL1 to AIP has led to suggestions that AIPL1 could function in a similar manner to AIP in facilitating protein translocation and as a component of chaperone complexes. AIPL1 interacts with the cell cycle regulator NEDD8 ultimate buster protein 1 (NUB1). As AIPL1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and NUB1 is predominantly nuclear, we tested the hypothesis that AIPL1 could modulate the nuclear translocation of NUB1. Co-transfection of AIPL1 with GFP-NUB1 resulted in a shift of GFP-NUB1 subcellular distribution toward the cytoplasm. Interestingly, AIPL1 was able to act in a chaperone-like fashion to efficiently suppress inclusion formation by NUB1 fragments. Co-transfection of AIPL1 with GFP-NUB1-N and GFP-NUB1-C resulted in an AIPL1-dependent suppression of GFP-NUB1-N perinuclear inclusions and GFP-NUB1-C intranuclear inclusions leading to the redistribution of these fragments in the cytoplasm. This chaperone-like function of AIPL1 was specific for NUB1, since AIPL1 was unable to suppress the inclusion formation by unrelated aggregation-prone proteins and AIP had no effect on NUB1 localization or inclusion formation. We examined the effect of a range of pathogenic and engineered mutations on the ability of AIPL1 to modulate NUB1 localization or inclusion formation. With the exception of W278X, which formed non-functional SDS-insoluble inclusions, all of the pathogenic mutations studied were soluble and could modulate NUB1 with varying efficiency compared with the wild-type protein. The effect of AIPL1 on NUB1 required the C-terminal region of AIPL1, as engineered C-terminal truncation mutations had no effect on NUB1. These data show that AIPL1 can modulate protein translocation and act in a chaperone-like manner and suggest that AIPL1 is an important modulator of NUB1 cellular function."

Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that the predominant form of PP2A in cells is a heterotrimer consisting of three subunits. Two of them, the 36-kDa catalytic C subunit and the 63-kDa scaffolding A subunit (PR65), form the core enzyme, and the regulatory B subunit binds the core enzyme to form the holoenzyme. The A and C subunits both exist as two isoforms (α and β), which are closely related, whereas the B subunit is variable, and its multiple isoforms belong to at least three unrelated gene families, B/B55/PR55 (α-δ isoforms), B′/B56/PR61 (α-ϵ isoforms), and B″/PR72/PR130/PR59/PR48 (3Sontag E. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The core PP2A enzyme has also been shown to bind other cellular proteins, including striatin and SG2NA (4Moreno C.S. Park S.

Viral proteins, such as the SV40 small t antigen and the polyomavirus small and middle T antigens, can replace the cellular B subunits (5Mumby M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two closely related genes, PPH21 and PPH22, redundantly encode the major PP2A catalytic subunit (6Sneddon A.A. Cohen P.T. Stark M.J.

Mutations of CDC55 are viable, but yield defects in cytokinesis and in the spindle checkpoint and result in abnormal cell morphology.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and thus E4orf4 may have a therapeutic potential for cancer. We have previously shown that E4orf4 interacts with the PP2A holoenzyme through a direct association with the Bα/B55 subunit (17Kleinberger T. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7556-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can also bind PP2A complexes containing B′/B56 (23Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We, and others, have recently shown that the interaction with PP2A complexes that include the Bα/B55, but not the B′/B56 subunit, is required for induction of apoptosis by E4orf4 (22Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T.

Virol. 2000; 74: 7869-7877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding the B subunit alone is not sufficient for induction of apoptosis, because an E4orf4 mutant, A3 (S95P), could bind the B subunit, whereas the A and C subunits were excluded from the complex, causing A3 to act as a dominant negative mutant (23Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of an active PP2A also contributes to other functions performed by the E4orf4 protein, including down-regulation of transcription (17Kleinberger T. Shenk T. J.

Marcellus R.C. Whalen A. Ahn N.G. Ricciardi R.P. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and alternative splicing (18Kanopka A. Muhlemann O. Petersen-Mahrt S. Estmer C. Ohrmalm C. Akusjarvi G. Nature. 1998; 393: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that E4orf4 induces PP2A-dependent growth arrest in S. cerevisiae, by targeting PP2A to the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/cyclosome) and inhibiting the activity of the APC/C in mitosis (27Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our results, together with previously reported work, further suggested that E4orf4 could be enhancing a physiological interaction of PP2A with the APC/C. Thus, the work in yeast indicated that E4orf4 can be used as a tool to further characterize PP2A function and regulation. We have also shown that the yeast system can be utilized to select for non-apoptotic mutants of E4orf4, which do not bind PP2A (28Afifi R. Sharf R. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4444-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a biological selection assay based on E4orf4 toxicity in yeast can identify mutations in the E4orf4-PP2A complex, which affect interactions within the complex. In this work we designed a protocol to select for Cdc55 mutants that lost the ability to transduce the E4orf4 toxic signal. These mutants define residues in Cdc55 required for the interaction with the core enzyme and with E4orf4. Functional characterization of the mutants and the WT protein revealed that a low level of binding of the regulatory B/Cdc55 subunit to the catalytic C subunit is retained in the absence of the scaffolding A/Tpd3 subunit. The minimal PP2A activity associated with this complex is sufficient for maintaining a partially active spindle checkpoint and an apparently normal cytokinesis. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast cells were grown either in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 0.015% l-tryptophan, 2% glucose) or in synthetic (SD) medium (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Rapamycin was added to solid medium to a final concentration of 100 nm from a stock of 1 mm in 100% ethanol. Benomyl was added to solid medium to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml from a stock of 3 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Nocodazole was added to liquid medium to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml from a stock of 2 mg/ml in Me2SO. α-Factor was added to liquid medium to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml from a stock of 2 mg/ml. For induction with galactose, cells were grown in synthetic medium with 2% raffinose overnight. They were then diluted to A600 0.3 and allowed to grow another 2 h before addition of galactose to 2%. Alternatively, cells were grown in 2% glucose to mid-log phase, washed once, and resuspended in 2% galactose. The yeast strains used in this study are isogenic with strain W303, and include KY520 (cdc55Δ) (27Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J.

Marker swap plasmid ura3::ADE2 was used to introduce an ADE2 instead of a URA3 marker in pRS426 and pRS426-PPM1, as described by Voth et al. (31Voth W.P. Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, a TRP1 marker was introduced into pRS416 and pRS416-(HA)3PPH22 instead of the URA3 marker, using the ura3::TRP1 marker swap plasmid. Mutagenesis—The Cdc55 open reading frame has been mutagenized at random by PCR amplification of CDC55 in the presence of 0.03 mm MnCl2, as previously described (22Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The forward primer was CTCCAAGCTTCTGTCTACC, and the reverse primer was ACATTATTCTGGAATCC. Plasmid YCp50-CDC55 has been digested with SacI and MluI. The fragment containing the vector and sequences lying 916 bp upstream of the CDC55 coding frame and 330 bp downstream of it (defined as the linear vector) was gel-purified, as were the PCR products. The PCR products share homologous sequences with the vector, which include 120 bp upstream of the CDC55 open reading frame (positions –1036- –916 relative to the first ATG) and 334 bp downstream of it (1910–2244). The linear vector and PCR products were transformed into KY520 yeast cells containing p414GALL-E4orf4, where they underwent homologous recombination to produce a circular plasmid, as previously described (32Evans D.R.H. Myles T.M. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24038-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Selection for E4orf4-resistant clones was performed on galactose plates. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of Plasmid DNA from Yeast—The yeast cells containing p414GALL-E4orf4 and mutant YCp50-CDC55 were grown 1 day on medium containing tryptophan but lacking uracil, and then plated on plates lacking uracil and containing 2-amino-5-fluorobenzoic acid to select for clones that lack the plasmid encoding the TRP marker (33Toyn J.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. White W.H. Thompson L.A. Hollis G.F. Yeast. 2000; 16: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were extracted from the clones obtained on 2-amino-5-fluorobenzoic acid as previously described (34Aronheim A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Phosphatase Assays—For co-immunoprecipitations, yeast extracts were prepared by bead beating cells for 4 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were spun to separate beads and debris from the clear lysate. The beads were washed twice more in the lysis buffer and immunoprecipitations were carried out in the same lysis buffer. Lysates and antibodies were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and rotated for an additional hour. The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation phosphatase assays have been previously described (22Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, immune complexes were prepared as described above and were washed twice more in PP2A buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The immune complexes were incubated with 50 nmol of peptide substrate RRA(pT)VA (35Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in PP2A buffer for 60 min at 30 °C. The amount of free phosphate released was measured by a color reaction generated in the presence of molybdate and malachite green. Antibodies used in this work were: anti-E4orf4 (19Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2975-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Tpd3 (from J. R. Broach), anti-Cdc55 antibodies, raised against a glutathione S-transferase-Cdc55 fusion protein, and anti-HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Selection for Cdc55 Mutants That Cannot Mediate E4orf4 Toxicity in Yeast—The protocol used to select for CDC55 mutants that have lost the ability to transduce the E4orf4 toxic effect was based on the findings that E4orf4 inhibits growth of WT yeast but not of cdc55Δ cells, and that ectopic expression of a WT CDC55 gene in the cdc55Δ background restores E4orf4 toxicity (27Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36Roopchand D.E. Lee J.M. Shahinian S. Paquette D. Bussey H. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5279-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It also relies on the finding that E4orf4-induced cell death requires an interaction between E4orf4 and an active PP2A, containing both catalytic and regulatory subunits (22Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mutants selected by this protocol may be deficient in their ability to bind either E4orf4 or the PP2A-AC heterodimer. To obtain cdc55 mutants, the CDC55 gene was mutated by a low-fidelity PCR-based protocol, as described previously (22Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mutated PCR products and the linear vector, described under “Experimental Procedures,” were transformed into cdc55Δ yeast cells containing p414GALL-E4orf4. Homologous recombination in the transformed yeast cells produced circular plasmids containing the mutated PCR products (32Evans D.R.H. Myles T.M. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24038-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Transformants that grew on galactose (i.e. resistant to E4orf4) presumably contained a mutated Cdc55 protein that could not transduce the E4orf4 signal. Growth of the transformants on galactose was compared with that of cdc55Δ cells containing an empty vector or the vector expressing WT Cdc55. Only clones that grew as well as the vector-containing yeast were further analyzed. In the next stage, clones that became resistant to E4orf4 toxicity because of decreased E4orf4 expression levels or lack of expression of Cdc55 were identified by immunoprecipitations and Western blots, and discarded. Plasmid DNAs were extracted from the remaining yeast clones, and used in a second cycle of transformation and plating on galactose, in the presence of E4orf4, to confirm that they conferred resistance to the viral protein. In the initial screen, 71 E4orf4-resistant colonies were obtained from 2,306 transformed yeast cells. 40 colonies of the 71 expressed high levels of E4orf4, as detected by Western blots. Of these colonies, only 12 expressed Cdc55 at more than 50% WT levels (clones 15, 19, 28, 29, 37, 68, 1, 66, 73, 81, 110, and 126) and three more expressed lower levels of Cdc55 (38, 41, and 87). Plasmid DNAs were extracted from the 15 resistant colonies expressing E4orf4 and Cdc55, and were tested for their ability to confer resistance to E4orf4 in a second cycle of transformation. All of them were indeed unable to mediate E4orf4 toxicity. Analysis of the Ability of Mutant Cdc55 Proteins to Bind E4orf4 and the PP2A Tpd3 Subunit—Yeast clones containing the plasmids encoding E4orf4 and Cdc55 were induced on galactose and Cdc55 was immunoprecipitated from the yeast extracts. The presence of Cdc55, Tpd3, and E4orf4 in the immune complexes was detected using Western blots. In some experiments E4orf4 was immunoprecipitated and the presence of E4orf4 and Cdc55 in the immune complexes was investigated. As seen in Fig. 2 and Table I, the mutant Cdc55 proteins appeared to fall into four categories: (a) Cdc55 mutants that bind Tpd3, but not E4orf4 (clones 1, 28, 68, and 81); (b) Cdc55 mutants that bind E4orf4, but not Tpd3 (clone 126); (c) Cdc55 mutants that bind neither Tpd3 nor E4orf4 (clones 15, 19, 29, 37, 66, 73, and 110 (S309P)); and (d) Cdc55 mutants that are expressed at low levels, but bind Tpd3 at relatively high levels (clones 38, 41, and 87). The binding experiments were repeated three times, and binding and expression levels were quantified by densitometry. The average binding levels obtained in these experiments are presented in Table I.Table ISummary of Cdc55 mutationsClone numberMutationCdc55 expressionTpd3 bindingE4orf4 bindingType 1 clones: interact with Tpd3 at 50% or more of WT levels but bind E4orf4 with low efficiency1Q125R, I171F, I307S, K316R+/-+/--/+68R206K, E290G, S309P, N372D+/-+/--28E85G, S180G, I307T, Y344C++-201D262N+/-+/--/+207Y344A+/-+/--81Y344C+/-+-107V514D+/-+/--Type 2 clones: interact with E4orf4 but not with Tpd3126H100L, K118E+-+K118EK118E+-+Type 3 clones: do not interact with Tpd3 or E4orf415T184I, M229T, R264G+/---73L102P, H333R, A471V+/---66Q125L, R508STOP+--37F33S, V514D+--19D262G+/---L102PL102P+/---/+110S309P+/---29S368P+/---Type 4 clones: enhanced Tpd3 binding38Q125R, L480Q-/++/--/+41T105A, S418G, M460I, N461D-/++/--87S440G-/++/--Type 5 clones: no effect on binding102T184A, I307A+++F33SF33S+++/-Q125LQ125L+++/-44E290A+/-++/- Open table in a new tab Sequence Analysis of the Mutants—The Cdc55 mutants were subjected to sequencing, and the results are shown in Table I. Because several of the mutants contained more than one mutation, a few substitutions were introduced as single mutations into the Cdc55 protein by site-directed mutagenesis. The additional mutants obtained by this procedure were tested for their ability to bind E4orf4 and Tpd3, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2C and Table I. Binding of the Mutants to an Active PP2A—To determine whether the mutant Cdc55 proteins associated with an active PP2A-AC heterodimer, phosphatase assays were carried out, using the Cdc55 immune complexes and a phosphorylated PP2A peptide substrate, as previously described (22Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Afifi R. Sharf R. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4444-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that most Cdc55 mutants that bound intermediate to high levels of Tpd3 (greater than 33% of WT levels), bound intermediate to WT levels of PP2A activity (more than 30% of WT levels). One clone associated consistently with 2-fold higher phosphatase activity compared with the WT Cdc55 protein (E290A). Clones that were severely deficient in Tpd3 binding (bound less than 15% WT levels) were also associated with dramatically reduced levels of PP2A activity (less than 20% of WT levels, clones 73, 66, 15, 37, 126, D262G, S368P, K118E, L102P, and S309P). However, two clones that bound Tpd3 well (clones 41 and 68 bound Tpd3 at more than 50% WT levels), appeared to bind low levels of an active PP2A core enzyme (around 15% WT levels). Functional Analysis of Single Substitution Mutants—To test whether the various mutations affected Cdc55 functions, we examined their influence on two of the known phenotypes associated with CDC55. cdc55Δ mutants demonstrate defective spindle checkpoint activity (37Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Wang Y. Burke D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which could result from a diminished ability to promote dephosphorylation of Cdc28 (37Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and from enhanced derepression of the APC/C activity in the mutant cells, leading to a less effective inactivation of the APC/C by the spindle checkpoint pathway (27Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc55 antagonizes the Tor signaling pathway, and cdc55Δ mutants exhibit rapamycin resistance as well as an enhanced association between the Tap42 and the C subunit of PP2A (39Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To test whether the various mutants were associated with a checkpoint defect caused by loss of CDC55, we examined their sensitivity to benomyl. Strains defective in the spindle checkpoint pathway are more sensitive to low levels of benomyl, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, probably because of an increased proportion of cells that go through mitosis in the absence of an intact spindle (40Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 41Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). To simplify analysis, each class of cdc55 mutations to be examined was represented only by mutants with single amino acid substitutions. We expected that mutants, which were dramatically reduced in their ability to bind an active PP2A, would lose their resistance to sublethal concentrations of benomyl, whereas mutants associating with WT PP2A levels would retain benomyl resistance. Surprisingly, three mutants that associated with 15% or less of WT PP2A activity, L102P, K118E, and to a lesser extent S309P, were almost as resistant to benomyl as WT Cdc55. One mutant, D262N, which was associated with WT levels of PP2A activity was not as resistant to benomyl as the WT yeast (Fig. 4). The macrolide drug rapamycin inhibits yeast growth by inhibiting essential activities of Tor kinase that are mediated at least partially through Tap42. cdc55Δ strains are resistant to rapamycin, because Cdc55 is required to reverse Tor-mediated phosphorylation of Tap42, and in its absence even low levels of Tor kinase activity are sufficient for cell growth (39Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The various single substitution mutants were grown in the presence of 100 nm rapamycin, a concentration to which the WT strain is sensitive, but on which the cdc55Δ strain can grow. As shown in Fig. 4 mutants Y344A and Y344C that bind WT levels of phosphatase activity are as sensitive to rapamycin as the WT strain. Mutant D262N is rapamycin-resistant despite its ability to associate with WT levels of PP2A activity. Mutants that were associated with low levels of PP2A activity were more resistant to rapamycin than WT yeast. However, K118E was less resistant than other mutants retaining low level association with the active phosphatase, such as L102P and S309P. The finding that mutant D262N, which binds WT PP2A activity levels, behaves like a cdc55Δ mutant may be explained"
https://openalex.org/W2102870423,"Vertebrate rhodopsin promoters exhibit striking sequence identities proximal to the initiation site, suggesting that conserved transcription factors regulate rhodopsin expression in these animals. We identify and characterize two transcriptional activators of the Xenopus rhodopsin gene: homologs of the mammalian Crx and Nrl transcription factors, XOtx5 and XL-Nrl (originally named XL-maf), respectively. XOtx5 stimulated transcription ∼10-fold in human 293 cells co-transfected with a plasmid containing the rhodopsin promoter (–508 to +41) upstream of luciferase, similar to the ∼6-fold stimulation with human Crx. XL-Nrl stimulated transcription ∼27-fold in mammalian 293 cells co-transfected with the rhodopsin luciferase reporter, slightly more than the ∼17-fold stimulation with Nrl. Together, the Xenopus transcription factors synergistically activated the rhodopsin promoter (∼140-fold), as well as in combination with mammalian homologs. Deletion of the Nrl-response element, TGCTGA, eliminated the synergistic activation by both mammalian and Xenopus transcription factors. Deletion of the conserved ATTA sequences (Ret-1 or BAT-1), binding sites for Crx, did not significantly decrease activation by Crx/XOtx5. However, there was increased activation by Nrl/XL-Nrl and an increased synergy when the Ret-1 site was disrupted. These results illustrate conservation of mechanisms of retinal gene expression among vertebrates. In transgenic tadpoles, XOtx5 and XL-Nrl directed premature and ectopic expression from the Xenopus rhodopsin promoter-GFP transgene. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous rhodopsin gene was also observed in some animals, showing that XOtx5 and XL-Nrl can activate the promoter in native chromatin environment.

Photoreceptors are highly specialized cells with complex structures that permit efficient light absorption, high signal transduction amplification, rapid kinetics, and adaptation over a range of light intensities (1Dowling J.E. The Retina: An Approachable Part of the Brain. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar). Phototransduction requires the coordinated expression of many genes, including the visual pigments that absorb light, enzymes involved in the cGMP cascade, ion channels plus multiple regulatory and structural proteins. It has been estimated using serial analysis of gene expression that ∼4% of the genes expressed in the retina encode phototransduction proteins (2Sharon D. Blackshaw S. Cepko C.L. Dryja T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Many of these genes are quite conserved in vertebrates. Moreover, programs of eye development share many conserved features in the animal kingdom (3Oliver G. Gruss P. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Pichaud F. Desplan C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Even in such distantly related species as Drosophila and humans, similar transcription factors are involved in development and expression of retina-specific genes (5Kumar J.P. Moses K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Tahayato A. Sonneville R. Pichaud F. Wernet M.F. Papatsenko D. Beaufils P. Cook T. Desplan C. Dev.

Often, proteins involved in growth and differentiation of the eye from one species can substitute for homologs in distantly related species (4Pichaud F. Desplan C. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This conservation also extends to the cis-acting elements in proximal promoters of retinal genes. Promoters have exhibited at least partial functionality between mammals and lower vertebrates. For example, the human β-PDE and IRBP proximal promoters were found to drive rod or photoreceptor-specific expression, respectively, in Xenopus (9Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E. Ji M. Knox B.E.

Current attention is focused upon identifying the specific sequences that are important for cell-specific expression and the transcription factors that regulate gene expression. Rhodopsin is found exclusively in rods in high abundance and its expression level is controlled primarily at the level of transcription initiation (11Treisman J.E. Morabito M.A. Barnstable C.J. Mol.

Given the functional and sequence similarities in rhodopsin promoters, it appears likely that homologous transcription factors would mediate transcriptional activation in vertebrates. Two important activators of the mammalian rhodopsin promoter are Crx and Nrl. Crx is a divergent member of the Otx5 subclass, related to the Drosophila otd (orthodenticle) protein (27Gamse J.T.

The Xenopus tropicalis L-maf was obtained from the X. tropicalis genome sequence (scaffold_1738, version 1.0 (37Institute Joint Genome Xenopus Tropicalis Database. 2004. DOE Joint Genome Institute, 2004Google Scholar)). The sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX (version 1.81) (38Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining (39Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood algorithms using ProtDist and Neighbor as implemented in the PHYLIP package (40Felsenstein J.

Evol. 1980; 16: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23653) Google Scholar). The maximum parsimony tree was obtained by 10 random addition heuristic search replicates and the tree bisection-reconnection branch-swapping option. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed by the quick-add OTUs search with the JTT-f model of amino acid substitution, retaining the 2,000 top ranking trees. Bootstrap proportions were calculated by analysis of 2,000 replicates for neighbor-joining and 1000 for maximum parsimony, and 2,000 puzzles for maximum likelihood. Expression Constructs—Full-length expression constructs for pcDNA-Crx (human) and pMT3-Nrl (human) were obtained from S. Chen and A. Swaroop, respectively, and have been described previously (24Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J.

A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The pCS2-XOtx5b full-length expression construct was obtained from A. Viczian and has been described previously (34Vignali R. Colombetti S. Lupo G. Zhang W. Stachel S. Harland R.M. Barsacchi G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 96: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The XL-maf coding region was produced by RT-PCR (see below) and the resulting PCR product was cloned into pBluescript using the engineered BamHI and EcoRI sites. This construct was then digested with SpeI and EcoRI and the XL-maf coding region was moved into the pMT3 vector that had been modified with adapters (5′-AATTAACTAGTCTGGAATTCAT-3′ top and 5′-TCGAATGAATTCCAGACTAGTT-3′ bottom). XMafB was amplified from cDNA prepared from stage 38 Xenopus embryo heads (see below) and cloned into the modified pMT vector. Promoter Constructs—The XOP-GFP reporter construct contains the Xenopus rhodopsin promoter –508/+41 (XOP), driving expression of GFP. The luciferase reporter construct, XOP-GL2, contains XOP (–503/+41) driving expression of luciferase. The XOP deletion constructs contained the full-length XOP promoter with targeted disruption of specific elements (ΔRet1, Δ–136 to –122; ΔBAT, Δ–107 to –91; ΔNRE, Δ–84 to –58), driving expression of luciferase. All reporter constructs were described previously (23Mani S.S. Batni S. Whitaker L. Chen S. Engbretson G. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36557-36565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 293 Transfections—293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were co-transfected in 24-well plates with a total of 0.7 μg of DNA and LipofectAMINE PLUS transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 0.2 μg of XOP-GL2 was transfected in each well, along with various combinations of mammalian and Xenopus expression constructs. Each transfection also contained 0.1 μg of a Renilla luciferase reporter under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK, Invitrogen). Empty pMT3 vector was included in transfections when necessary to bring total DNA to 0.7 μg. Cells were transfected for 3 h in the absence of serum, and harvested 42 h post-transfection. Cell lysates were analyzed using luciferase assay reagent (Invitrogen) to assay luciferase expression. Expression levels were determined relative to each construct alone. RT-PCR for XL-maf and XMafB—RNAs from adult Xenopus retina and stage 38 Xenopus heads were reverse transcribed with gene-specific primers to produce cDNA (SuperscriptII RT polymerase, Invitrogen). XL-maf was amplified using primers as previously described (36Ishibashi S. Yasuda K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar): forward, 5′-CCCGGATCCATGGCACTCGATGATCTACCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGGGAATTCTCACAGAAAGAGCTCAGCTCC-3′, with the addition of BamHI and EcoRI sites, respectively, to facilitate cloning. XOtx2 primers were used as a positive control (forward, 5′-AGGGAAAGGACCACTTTCAC and reverse, 5′-CCAGATGGACACAGGGGCTG). 1/10 of the RT reaction was amplified with Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) using the following PCR parameters: 1 min at 94 °C to denature, then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension of 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript and 14 clones were sequenced (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). Sequence comparisons were performed on the deduced polypeptide sequences using the Lasergene package (DNAStar, Madison, WI), after correcting sequences for nucleotide substitutions that occurred in only one clone (arising during PCR amplification). XMafB was amplified from cDNA prepared from stage 38 Xenopus embryo heads using the primers: forward, 5′-GGACTAGTCATGCGTGGAGAGTTGC and reverse, 5′-GAGAATTCCTCACATGAAGAACTCTGG. SpeI and EcoRI sites were added for cloning the insert into the modified pMT vector. PCR parameters were 1 min at 94 °C to denature, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, and a final extension of 3 min at 72 °C. Clones were confirmed by sequencing (Davis Sequencing). In Situ Hybridizations—The XL-maf/pBluescriptII clone was digested with either EcoRI or SpeI and the linearized DNA was used to produce sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled probes (Roche Diagnostics) using T3 and T7 polymerases, respectively. In situ hybridization was performed on sections of stage 48 Xenopus tadpoles and adult Xenopus eyes as described (44Shimamura K. Hirano S. McMahon A.P. Takeichi M. Development. 1994; 120: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the digoxigenin-labeled probe was hybridized for 2 days at 65 °C. Embryo Transfections—Embryo transfections were performed as described previously (23Mani S.S. Batni S. Whitaker L. Chen S. Engbretson G. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36557-36565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) except that N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammonium methylsulfate was used for all transfections (Roche). 2.5 μg of XOP-GL was used per transfection and 2.5 μg of each transcription factor plasmid was used as well, with empty pMT plasmid included when necessary to bring total DNA up to 7.5 μg. The DNA to lipid ratio was 1:3. Transgenic Xenopus—Transgenic animals were produced using standard restriction enzyme-mediated integration (45Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: pCS2+-Otx5b was linearized with SalI, XL-maf-PMT and empty pMT3 were linearized with AvrII, and XOP-GFP was linearized with XhoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The restriction enzyme-mediated integration reaction for each combination included 0.15 units of each restriction enzyme, 400 ng of XOP-GFP reporter, 100 ng of pCS2-XOtx5b or XL-maf-PMT, and when necessary, empty pMT3 vector to bring total DNA up to 600 ng/∼104 sperm nuclei. Restriction enzyme-mediated integration reactions contained 5 μl of egg extract and frozen rather than fresh sperm were used (47Sparrow D.B. Latinkic B. Mohun T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GFP expression was followed for 5 days of development by using fluorescence microscopy of live animals. Images were produced using a SPOT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., McHenry, IL) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). RT-PCR for GFP and Endogenous Rhodopsin—RNA was isolated from the tails of 2-day-old tadpoles positive for GFP expression for the treatments: XOP + XL-maf, XOP + XOtx5, and XOP + XL-maf + XOtx5. Five GFP positive animals from each treatment were analyzed. Three animals from the group injected with XOP + empty pMT vector were also analyzed. RNA was also prepared from one 6-day-old XOP positive tadpole (entire embryo, including the eye) as a positive control for both GFP and rhodopsin. RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers and SuperScriptII RT polymerase (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase (Promega) following the manufacturers' protocols. The resulting cDNA was amplified in a standard PCR with primers for GFP (forward, 5′-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG; reverse, 5′-CCTTGAAGAAGATGGTGCGCTC) and Xenopus rhodopsin (forward, 5′-ATGAACGGAACAGAAGGTCCA; reverse, 5′-CCAGTGACCAGAGGGCC). The rhodopsin primers were designed to amplify across the first intron of the rhodopsin gene to produce a 376-bp band from cDNA. PCR parameters were as follows: GFP, 1 min at 94 °C to denature, then 36 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 45 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension of 3 min at 72 °C; XOP, 1 min at 94 °C to denature, then 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, and a final extension of 3 min at 72 °C.

To determine whether XOtx5 functions similarly to mammalian Crx, we tested the ability of XOtx5 to activate Xenopus rhodopsin. In 293 cells, the XOP-GL2 directed very weak expression of a luciferase reporter (∼3-fold over a promoter-less control, data not shown), as expected from the in vivo cell specificity. When an XOtx5 expression construct was included in the transfection, significant stimulation (∼10-fold over XOP-GL2 alone) of transcriptional activity was observed (Fig. 1, A and C). In transfections in which the XOP-GL2 reporter was increased, an even greater increase in transcriptional activity was observed (Fig. 1B). This magnitude of activation is similar to that seen in transfections with a mammalian promoter and Crx (24Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A key feature of the Crx transcription factor is the synergistic activation of a mammalian rhodopsin promoter in the presence of Nrl. Co-transfections of 293 cells with plasmids harboring XOtx5 and human Nrl resulted in an activation of over 100-fold (Fig. 1C) (note: Nrl alone only activates the Xenopus promoter ∼17-fold, see Fig. 5A). This synergistic activation with XOtx5, although slightly lower in combination with human Nrl, is comparable with the activation of the mammalian promoter (24Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and Xenopus rhodopsin promoter (Fig. 1C) with Crx. These results confirm the earlier phylogenetic results and indicate that XOtx5 has the same function as mammalian Crx in transcription assays.Fig. 5Comparison of transcriptional activities with rhodopsin-targeted disruption constructs. A, the luciferase activity from 293 cells transfected with various targeted disruption constructs, human Crx, and/or human Nrl are shown relative to the activity observed by transfection of each promoter construct alone (n = 2–6). 200 ng of each construct were used, and empty pMT was included when necessary to make the total transfected DNA equ"

The human I-1 gene has been spliced to generate two alternative mRNAs, termed I-1α and I-1β, encoding polypeptides that differ from I-1 in their C-terminal sequences. Reverse transcription-PCR established that I-1α and I-1β mRNAs are expressed in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. Functional analysis of I-1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain dependent on human I-1 for viability established that a novel domain encompassing amino acids 77–110 is necessary for PP1 inhibition in yeast. Expression of human I-1 in S. cerevisiae with a partial loss-of-function eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) kinase (Gcn2p) mutation permitted growth during amino acid starvation, consistent with the inhibition of Glc7p/PP1, the yeast eIF2α phosphatase. In contrast, human I-1α, which lacks amino acids 83–134, and I-1 with C-terminal deletions were significantly less effective in promoting yeast growth under starvation conditions. These data suggest that C-terminal sequences of I-1 enhance regulation of the eukaryotic eIF2α phosphatase. In vitro studies established that C-terminal sequences, deleted in both I-1α and I-1β, enhance PP1 binding and inhibition. Expression of full-length and C-terminally truncated I-1 in HEK293T cells established the importance of the I-1 C terminus in transducing cAMP signals that promote eIF2α phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that multiple domains in I-1 target cellular PP1 complexes and establishes I-1 as a cellular regulator of eIF2α phosphorylation.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Regulation of these diverse PP1 functions in mammalian tissues is mediated by the interaction of the PP1 catalytic subunit with a number of targeting subunits and endogenous protein inhibitors (2Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prototypic mammalian PP1 regulator, Inhibitor-1 (I-1), requires phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) to inhibit PP1. I-1 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and is a critical regulator of PP1 function in many cAMP-regulated physiological processes, including cardiac contractility (3Carr A.N. Schmidt A.G.

Girault J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Such studies also highlighted a conserved tetrapeptide sequence (KIQF) that is critical for PP1 inhibition by I-1 and DARPP-32. Subsequent studies that noted the presence of homologous sequences in several PP1 regulators as well as co-crystallization of the PP1 catalytic subunit with a peptide containing an (R/K)(I/V)XF sequence established that this domain represents a conserved PP1-binding motif found in many PP1 regulators (7Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar).Although the N-terminal PP1 inhibitory domains of DARPP-32 and I-1 are nearly identical, the C-terminal sequences are highly divergent, and the precise role of these sequences is largely unknown. Both I-1 and DARPP-32 are phosphorylated at serine residues in their C-terminal domains, and studies of DARPP-32 have provided the clearest insights into the function of these covalent modifications. Serine phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinases I and II modulates the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34 and thereby regulates DARPP-32 function as a PP1 inhibitor (8Girault J.A.

Girault J.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, our studies of I-1 showed that the C terminus plays an important role in binding other cellular proteins, specifically GADD34, a scaffolding protein that also binds PP1; this generates a heterotrimeric complex with eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) phosphatase activity (10Connor J.H. Weiser D.C. Li S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We speculated that the C terminus targets I-1 to specific cellular PP1 complexes, such as GADD34·PP1, and that, following PKA phosphorylation, I-1 inhibits eIF2α phosphatase activity. In this manner, the GADD34·PP1·I-1 complex represents a mechanism by which cAMP could regulate mammalian protein synthesis.The human I-1 gene is alternatively spliced to generate two additional mRNAs, termed I-1α and I-1β (11Liu H.T. Lin T.H. Kuo H.C. Chen Y.C. Tsay H.J. Jeng H.H. Tsai P.C. Shie F.K. Chen J.H. Huang H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1293-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Full-length I-1 differs from the I-1α and I-1β polypeptides in their C-terminal sequences. I-1α contains a deletion of amino acids 83–134, whereas I-1β results from a frameshift at amino acid 61 and possesses a unique C terminus. Until this work, the functions of these novel I-1 isoforms as PP1 inhibitors, specifically the holoenzymes found in eukaryotic cells, have not been analyzed.Biochemical studies show that human I-1 inhibits the yeast PP1 catalytic subunit, Glc7p, in an indistinguishable manner from human PP1 (12Connor J.H. Quan H.N. Ramaswamy N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Lee E.Y. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that expression of I-1 impacts only select PP1-dependent signaling pathways (13Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JC1007-97, expression of active human I-1 is essential for growth and viability (13Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This provides a novel cell-based assay for examining the structure-function of I-1 as a regulator of PP1 holoenzymes. Our work validates the use of yeast as a model eukaryotic system for analyzing the function of human I-1 and shows, for the first time, that selected C-terminal residues in human I-1 are required for effective PP1 inhibition in yeast. Analysis of tissues from wild-type (WT) I-1 and I-1-null mice established that three distinct mRNAs are transcribed from a single mouse I-1 gene and confirmed that alternative splicing yields the two additional transcripts, I-1α and I-1β, in many mouse tissues. Utilizing S. cerevisiae strain Y27, in which Glc7p was previously shown to dephosphorylate eIF2α to allow the recovery of yeast from amino acid starvation (14Wek R.C. Cannon J.F. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5700-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we established that human I-1α, which lacks C-terminal residues present in full-length I-1, is a less effective inhibitor of phosphatase activity. In vitro biochemical experiments demonstrated that the C-terminal region of I-1 enhances binding to the PP1 catalytic subunit and inhibition of phosphatase activity. Expression of I-1 in HEK293T cells demonstrated that the I-1 C terminus facilitated cAMP signals that inhibit protein translation in mammalian cells and suggested distinct roles for the newly defined isoforms, I-1α and I-1β, in regulating cellular PP1 activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—Anti-PP1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Anti-I-1 (1:1000) and anti-I-1(T35-P) (1: 2000) polyclonal antibodies were generated in this laboratory and used as described previously (10Connor J.H. Weiser D.C. Li S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Anti-eIF2α polyclonal antibody (1:500) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-phospho-Ser51 eIF2α antibody (1:1000) was from BIOSOURCE. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1: 1000) was obtained from Sigma.Yeast Strains—The following yeast strains were used in this work: Y27, MATα gcn2-507 ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 ino1 HIS4-lacZ; H1402, MATα ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 ino1 HIS4-lacZ; H1149, MATα gcn2::LEU2 ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 ino1 HIS4-lacZ; and JC1007-97, MATα gfa1-97 ade2 ade3 leu2 ura3 lys2 can1.Human I-1 Expression Plasmids—All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Deletions of human I-1 were generated using JZ205 as template. With the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), stop codons were added at amino acids 142, 123, 97, 77, and 54 of human I-1 (hI-1). The region encoding C-terminal amino acids 81–171 was excised from pGEM3ZF/I-1 using SacI and HindIII and ligated into pGEX-4T using EcoRI and XhoI. The N-terminal region of I-1 cDNA (encoding amino acids 1–80) was excised from pGEM3ZF/I-1 using NcoI and SacI and ligated into pRSET-B, which was then digested with BglII and SalI, and the resulting cDNA was inserted into pGEX-4T using BamHI and SalI. Expression constructs for I-1α were generated from the hI-1 cDNA by introducing NheI sites at codons 83 and 134. Following digestion with NheI, the cDNA was religated to produce a cDNA encoding hI-1α with one exception, with an alanine substitution at residue 84. Mammalian expression plasmids were generated using PCR primers that added BglII and SalI restriction sites to the hI-1 cDNA. The PCR product was digested with BglII and SalI and ligated into pCMV-FLAG-2 (Sigma) digested with BamHI and SalI. All cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing at the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility.Table IPlasmids used in this workNameDescriptionSource/Ref.p21682μ URA3 GLC7-(1-207)13Zheng J.

Briefly, strains Y27, H1402, and H1149 were transformed with plasmids expressing hI-1 or dominant-negative GLC7. Cultures were grown at 30 °C on synthetic medium lacking uracil and histidine and containing 40 mm leucine and 30 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) or on control medium lacking uracil. Growth was monitored as formation of yeast colonies.Sectoring Assay in S. cerevisiae gfa1-97—Yeast sectoring assays were performed as described (13Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast strain JC1007-97 containing JZ203 was transformed with competing hI-1-expressing plasmids, and yeast cells were grown on synthetic medium lacking uracil and reduced adenine (6 μg/ml). The red-and-white sectoring colonies were counted after 4 days of growth at 30 °C. Deletions of hI-1 were generated using gap repair. PCR primers were designed that included the GDP promoter and various 5′-regions of hI-1 cDNA from JZ205. The PCR-amplified cDNAs in the linearized plasmids YEp195 (2μ URA3) and YCp33 (CEN URA3) were transformed into JC1007-97, and yeast cells were grown as described (13Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting of Yeast Lysates—Yeast cells were grown on nonselective medium at 30 °C to A600 = 0.6. The cells were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), mixed with an equal volume of glass beads, and vortexed at full speed for five bursts of 20 s. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting.Expression of Recombinant hI-1—The pGEX-4T constructs encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to I-1-(1–171), I-1-(1–80), and I-1-(81–171) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL cells, and bacteria were grown overnight in 50 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (33 μg/ml) at 30 °C. Cultures were grown at 30 °C to A600 = 0.5, cooled to 18 °C, and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h. Bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The resuspended cultures were lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 10 min.Bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were rinsed three times with 50 ml each of lysis buffer, followed by 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm glutathione. Eluted proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% (w/v) Brij 35. GST-I-1α and GST-I-1-(Δ77–110) were expressed as described above, with the exception that protein induction was carried out for 3 h at 37 °C.PP1 Sedimentation—Glutathione-Sepharose beads (25-μl bed volume) were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl). GST fusion proteins were incubated with washed beads in Tris-buffered saline (total volume of 300 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein-bound beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 500 × g and rinsed twice with Tris-buffered saline. HEK293T cell lysate (300 μg of total protein) in Tris-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 was incubated with the GST fusion protein-bound beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml each of the same buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PP1 was detected by Western immunoblotting with anti-PP1 antibody. All PP1 sedimentation assays were performed three times with two independent preparations of recombinant I-1 protein.Phosphorylase Phosphatase Assay—Phosphorylase phosphatase assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol with PP1 catalytic subunit (0.02 units) purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and hI-1 proteins. I-1 was phosphorylated using purified bovine cardiac PKA catalytic subunit (16Connor J.H. Quan H. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 41-58PubMed Google Scholar). Two independent preparations of each I-1 fusion peptide were phosphorylated. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was established by “back-phosphorylation” of all phosphorylated I-1 polypeptides using fresh PKA and [32P]ATP and analysis of 32P incorporation to ensure 1 mol/mol phosphorylation of all GST-I-1 proteins.The assays were initiated by [32P]phosphorylase (final concentration of 2 mg/ml), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by addition of 200 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. [32P]Phosphate release was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. All assays were performed at least three times in triplicate.Expression of I-1 in Cultured Mammalian Cells—HEK293T cells (grown to near confluency in 6-well plates) were transfected with 2.0 μg of FLAG-hI-1 DNA, 2.0 μg of FLAG-hI-1(T35A) DNA, 2.0 μg of FLAG-hI-1-(1–77) DNA, or 2.0 μg of vector control (pCMV-FLAG-2) and 4 μlof LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then treated with 0.1% Me2SO or 5 μm forskolin. After 6 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) for 15 min on ice. Cells were scraped, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 3 min. The cleared lysates were then run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots were quantified using Scion Image Beta 4.0.2. I-1 phosphorylation was normalized to total I-1 and then reported as -fold increase relative to control Me2SO-treated cells (n = 4). Phosphorylation of eIF2α was normalized to total eIF2α and reported as -fold change relative to cells expressing the vector control (n = 4).Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR for I-1 mRNAs—Total cellular RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen). mRNA was isolated from 50 μg of total RNA using Oligotex mRNA purification resin (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and resuspended in a final volume of 40 μl. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) consisting of mRNA (10 μl), dNTPs (250 μm), oligo(dT) primers (5 pmol), dithiothreitol (8.75 mm), and RNasin (20 units; Promega) were preincubated at 75 °C for 5 min to denature RNA and cooled rapidly to 42 °C. Reverse transcription was initiated by immediate addition of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (100 units; Promega). Reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 60 min and then heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. The resulting cDNAs (3 μl) were amplified with oligonucleotide primers (1 pmol) specific for I-1 (5′-ATG GAG CCC CGA CAA CAG CCC ACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATC CCC GGA TAC CAA CTT CTG-3′ (antisense)) or β-actin transcripts (5′-G TGG GCC GCC CTA GGC ACC AG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTC TTT GAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC-3′ (antisense)). The I-1α and I-1β splice variants were selectively amplified using sense primers that spanned the alternative splice junctions (where the underlined nucleotides represent the exon 6 splice acceptor site): I-1α, 5′-GAC CAC ACC CAC CAT GAA AGA G-3′ and the I-1 antisense primer; and I-1β, 5′-TCC CCA ACT CAC TTC TCA AGA G-3′ and the I-1 antisense primer. All amplifications were conducted in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and Taq polymerase (1 unit). Reactions to amplify I-1 and β-actin cDNAs were carried out for 24 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Annealing temperatures for I-1α and I-1β were 58 °C for 35 cycles and 63 °C for 40 cycles, respectively. The cDNAs were separated by electrophoresis on 2% (w/v) agarose gels, transferred to ZetaProbe membrane, and hybridized to radiolabeled oligonucleotides specific for exon 4 (5′-CGG AAG AAG ATG ACA AGG ACC-3′), exon 5 (5′-GAG CCA CTG AGA GCA CAG GG-3′), exon 6 (5′-GCA GAA TCC AAC CCC AAG AC-3′), and β-actin (5′-CAG GCA TTG TGA TGG ACT C-3′).RESULTSNumerous PP1 complexes have been identified in eukaryotic cells and are composed of PP1 catalytic subunits associated with regulatory subunits (17Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunits target PP1 to subcellular organelles and/or direct the dephosphorylation of selected phosphoproteins. The PP1 catalytic subunit is also inhibited by several PP1-selective inhibitor proteins, such as I-1 (18Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D961-D972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies show that nanomolar concentrations of PKA-phosphorylated I-1 inhibit the PP1 catalytic subunit isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle, but are less effective in inhibiting the glycogen-bound complex composed of PP1 bound to GM (19Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Analysis of I-1-null mice suggests that I-1 preferentially regulates a subset of PP1 complexes that control vascular and cardiac muscle contractility (3Carr A.N. Schmidt A.G. Suzuki Y. del Monte F. Sato Y. Lanner C. Breeden K. Jing S.L. Allen P.B. Greengard P. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Grupp I.L. Hajjar R.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell.

Morris R.G. Andersen P. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3537-3543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other PP1 functions, such as glycogen metabolism (21Scrimgeour A.G. Allen P.B. Fienberg A.A. Greengard P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20949-20952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), are essentially unaffected in the mutant mouse. The molecular basis for I-1 selectivity for specific PP1 complexes remains unknown in part because of the lack of suitable cellular assays to investigate the structure-function of I-1 as an inhibitor of PP1 function in eukaryotic cells.Structure-Function of I-1 in Yeast—Our previous studies showed that hI-1 potently inhibits Glc7p, the budding yeast PP1 catalytic subunit, in vitro (12Connor J.H. Quan H.N. Ramaswamy N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Lee E.Y. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of hI-1 in yeast showed that some Glc7p-regulated pathways, such as mitosis and gene transcription, are inhibited, whereas others, such as glycogen metabolism and meiosis, are essentially unaffected (13Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that I-1 expression in yeast could be used to define the molecular basis by which I-1 targets cellular PP1 complexes. I-1 dependence in yeast was also used in a genetic screen to identify novel Glc7p (PP1)-regulated pathways and yielded strain JC1007-97, in which the presence of active hI-1 is required for transcription of the GFA1 (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase-1) gene and yeast growth (13Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This provided a novel assay for evaluating the mechanism of action of I-1 as a regulator of eukaryotic PP1 complexes since only an expression vector carrying a hI-1 construct with full PP1 inhibitory activity could complement the loss of existing WT hI-1. To analyze the structure-function of I-1, yeast containing JZ203 (ADE3 hI-1) was transformed with various I-1 constructs (pDW series). The loss of the plasmid-borne ADE3 marker, which maintains the gfa1-97 yeast as red colonies, occurs only when pDW plasmids express functional PP1 inhibitors, and this results in the conversion of red-to-white colonies (Fig. 1). Counting the white and/or red-and-white sectoring colonies provided a measure of relative PP1 inhibitory activity of the replacement I-1 polypeptide. In this regard, the plasmid expressing hI-1-(1–171) (JZ205) resulted in significant red-to-white conversion, with >70% white colonies. I-1(T35A), expressing full-length hI-1 lacking Thr35, who"

Redox cofactors are embedded in proteins, and this matrix strongly influences their redox potential. Several cofactors are usually found in these complexes, and they are structurally organized in a chain with distances between the electron donor and acceptor short enough to allow rapid electron tunneling. Among the different interactions that contribute to the determination of the redox potential of these cofactors, electrostatic interactions are important but restive to direct experimental characterization. The influence of interaction between cofactors is evidenced here experimentally by means of redox titrations and time-resolved spectroscopy in a chimeric bacterial reaction center (Maki, H., Matsuura, K., Shimada, K., and Nagashima, K.

The absorption spectra and orientations of the various cofactors of this chimeric reaction center are similar to those found in their respective native protein, indicating that their local environment is conserved. However, the redox potentials of both the primary electron donor and its closest heme are changed. The redox potential of the primary electron donor is downshifted in the chimeric reaction center when compared with the wild type, whereas, conversely, that of its closet heme is upshifted. We propose a model in which these reciprocal shifts in the midpoint potentials of two electron transfer partners are explained by an electrostatic interaction between them.

Proteins exert a fine electrochemical tuning of the redox potential of the cofactors they bind in order to perform the various electron transfer reactions that are involved in biological processes. As a famous example, the redox potentials (Em) 1The abbreviations used are: Em, midpoint redox potential; Eh, ambient redox potential; P, primary electron donor; RC, reaction center; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; g2, 2 tensor component.1The abbreviations used are: Em, midpoint redox potential; Eh, ambient redox potential; P, primary electron donor; RC, reaction center; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; g2, 2 tensor component. of c-type cytochromes are tuned by more than 500 mV (see Ref. 1Gunner M.R. Alexov E. Torres E. Lipovaca S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 126-134Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar and references therein). The physicochemical basis of a such wide range of modulations has been rationalized by various authors who all agree that the protein medium has the unique property of providing a dielectric environment in which the redox cofactors are embedded with an intricate charge or dipole distribution (1Gunner M.R. Alexov E. Torres E. Lipovaca S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 126-134Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Parson W.W. Chu Z.-T. Warshel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 3Warshel A. Aqvist J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). From a general standpoint, the free energy difference between the oxidized and reduced forms of any redox cofactor in a protein is the sum of several terms. Among these are ΔGconf and ΔGel. ΔGconf accounts for any conformational change that the change in the redox state of the cofactor may induce (including proton or ion binding or release). ΔGel results from the electrostatic potential at the cofactors resulting from the individual charged groups and the permanent dipoles within the protein. Estimating the respective values of these different terms is a difficult task, yet their sum is readily accessible experimentally because it can be obtained by comparing the absolute values of the Em in solution and in the protein. The latter may be obtained by two different methods. The most commonly used one is equilibrium redox titration. The other relies on the determination, by a functional analysis, of the free energy change associated with an electron transfer reaction between two cofactors. Such a change in free energy is generally considered as equal to the difference in Ems between the electron donor and acceptor. Thus, provided that one of these two redox potentials is known, the other one is readily inferred. However, these two methods sometimes yield different results and this has led to the distinction between “equilibrium redox potential” and “operating redox potential.” These differences arise because the two methods do not probe the same state of the redox cofactors. Two types of phenomena may account for these differences. One comes from the distinct time domain involved in equilibrium redox titration and functional analysis. Whereas redox titrations require thermodynamic equilibrium between the sample and the solution poised at a given potential, the functional analysis allows one to probe transient states whose free energy may differ significantly from that of the equilibrated states. Indeed, in response to the change in the redox state of a given cofactor, the protein environment may undergo energetic relaxation (such as proton transfer, conformational changes), which may be slower than the lifetime of the transient oxidized (or reduced) cofactor. Armstrong et al. (4Armstrong F.A. Camba R. Heering H.A. Hirst J. Jeuken L.J. Jones A.K. Leger C. McEvoy J.P. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 2000; 116: 191-203Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have nicely illustrated this point with the “fast-scan electrovoltammetric” technique. Other examples are found in photosynthetic reaction centers (RC) (for example, see Refs. 5Woodbury N.W. Parson W.W. Gunner M.R. Prince R.C. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 6-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar and 6Sebban P. Wraight C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 54-65Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An alternative but non-exclusive explanation of the different Ems yielded by redox titration and functional analysis relies on the fact that most of the membrane proteins involved in electron transfer reactions bind several cofactors, which are usually located at less than 15 Å, one from the other. Such short distances may result in significant electrostatic interactions among the different cofactors. Thus, for a given cofactor, ΔGel includes the electrostatic contributions of the nearby electron carriers. Such a contribution has been nicely illustrated in the case of the tetraheme cytochrome of Blastochloris (formerly Rhodopseudomonas) viridis (7Gunner M.R. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Nitschke W. Rutherford A.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, it is noteworthy that throughout a redox titration, all of the cofactors undergo an identical charge change in terms of sign (i.e. all are either reduced or oxidized), whereas in an electron transfer chain, two nearby cofactors involved in an electron transfer reaction will undergo charge changes of opposite sign (one will be oxidized at the expense of the other). Consequently, if the electrostatic interaction between the two is significant, the difference between their equilibrium Ems will be greater than the free energy change associated with the electron transfer between them. In this paper, we illustrated the importance of such electrostatic interactions in electron transfer chains. Although electron transfer chains embedded in a single protein are found in many biological pathways, the photosynthetic chains are ideally suited for such studies. Indeed, not only do they allow redox titration of the various redox cofactors, but also the kinetics of electron transfer reaction may be characterized with an unequalled time resolution. In particular, the bacterial photosynthetic RC of B. viridis and its associated tetraheme cytochrome have been intensively studied. Its three-dimensional structure has been solved (9Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar), and the spectroscopic or redox properties of the various cofactors are known (see Ref. 10Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 775-805Google Scholar for a review). Further, the different electron transfer steps have been characterized (11Ortega J.M. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In membrane fragments as well as purified RC of B. viridis, the reduction of the oxidized primary electron donor P+ by the closest heme, c559, is multiphasic (12Ortega J.M. Mathis P. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 34: 127Google Scholar). Interestingly, this feature has been interpreted along the lines of either of the two phenomena that has just been described, a conformational heterogeneity yielding a distribution of substates (11Ortega J.M. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or a low equilibrium constant of this electron transfer reaction (13Baymann F. Rappaport F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15320-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To reconcile this latter hypothesis with the equilibrium constant of ∼100 expected from the difference in midpoint potentials of the P+/P and c559+/c559, Baymann and Rappaport (13Baymann F. Rappaport F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15320-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) proposed that an electrostatic interaction between P and its closest heme raises the redox potential of the P+/P couple. As discussed below, the present results support this hypothesis. From an experimental standpoint, B. viridis has the drawback of being unable to grow heterotrophically, making the mutagenesis approach uncertain despite a few successful attempts. Recently, Maki et al. (14Maki H. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Nagashima K.V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3921-3928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) succeeded in transferring the membrane bound cytochrome of B. viridis to another bacterium, Rubrivivax gelatinosus, in which mutagenesis strategy may be planned (15Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Verméglio A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14028-14032Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this paper, we further investigated this chimeric RC (hereafter named VC-F) and show that most of the various cofactors at the donor side of this RC show absorption spectra and relative orientations similar to those found in the respective native RCs, indicating that the backbone structure of the protein as well as the interactions between the hemes and the side chains are conserved (Fig. 1). These findings make the chimeric RC suited for the direct characterization of electrostatic interactions between cofactors by the mean of equilibrium redox titration. Indeed, in this RC, two cofactors (the primary electron donor (P) and the closest heme c559) are expected to have redox potentials differing by less than 50 mV (see Fig. 1). Such a case allows the direct observation of a putative electrostatic interaction, because it should manifest itself by a deviation to a one-electron Nernst curve. This contrasts with the case where the two interacting redox centers have strongly different midpoint potentials (as in the B. viridis case, for example) for they are then expected to titrate in well separated redox potential ranges and thus yield titration curves that follow the classical Nernst equation. Accordingly, we found that the redox titration of the primary donor (P/P+) of the chimeric RC displayed a deviation to a one-electron Nernst curve. The redox potential of the primary donor was downshifted by 50 mV in the chimera with respect to the WT R. gelatinosus strain. Interestingly, the redox potential of the closest heme (the c559 heme) underwent a converse upshift of similar amplitude. These data prove that electrostatic interactions between cofactors in proteins modulate their redox potentials. Interspecific replacement of the gene coding for the RC-bound cytochrome subunit in R. gelatinosus used to produce VC-F mutant is described by Maki et al. (14Maki H. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Nagashima K.V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3921-3928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The site-directed substitution by a two-step PCR method of Arg-204 for a Leu in the cytochrome subunit of the VC-F strain is described by Nagashima et al. (17Nagashima K.V.P. Alric J. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Verméglio A. Bruce D. van der Est A. 13th International Congress on Photosynthesis. Allen Press, Montréal2004Google Scholar). Cells of the VC-F mutant of R. gelatinosus were grown for 24 h in the light and in anaerobic conditions in Hutner medium with 50 μg·ml–1 kanamycin and 20 μg·ml–1 ampicillin. For membrane preparations, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), and disrupted by a French press at 50 megapascals. The remaining intact cells were separated from the membrane supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane fragments then were collected after centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 90 min and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7), for equilibrium redox titrations. EPR Spectroscopy—Membrane fragments were resuspended in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7) and oxidized by the addition of 2 mm potassium ferricyanide. The membranes were then washed free from ferricyanide by renewed pelleting and resuspension in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7). Electron paramagnetic response spectra were taken at 15 K using a Bruker ER 300 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments helium cryostat and temperature-control system. The instrument settings were as follows: microwave power, 6.7 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.43 GHz; and modulation amplitude, 2.5 millitesla. Angular dependence of EPR signals was investigated on oriented membrane multilayer obtained by drying the membrane fragments onto Mylar sheets (18Rutherford A.W. Sétif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 128-132Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Redox titrations were performed as described previously (13Baymann F. Rappaport F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15320-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Baymann F. Moss D.A. Mantele W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in an electrochemical cell (100-μm optical path length) with three electrodes: a platinum electrode; a gold grid (InterNet Inc.) modified by PATS (2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, Sigma) to avoid irreversible adsorption of the proteins onto the gold grid; and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 3 m KCl. The redox mediators were used at 20 μm each: 1,4-benzoquinone (Em = +280 mV); 1,1-dimethyl ferrocene (Em = +340 mV); ferrocene (Em = +420 mV); and monocarboxylic acid ferrocene (Em = +530 mV). The optical spectroscopic measurements were performed on two different laboratory-built absorption spectrophotometers: a Xenon flashlamp microsecond time resolution one (20Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar) used for the titration of the cytochromes in the α-band and a Nd:YAG-pulsed laser nanosecond time resolution one (21Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1999; 70: 202-207Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) used for the kinetic experiments and the flash-induced titration of the primary electron donor. Redox Characteristics of the P+/P Couple in the WT and Chimeric RCs—The primary electron donor P was titrated in membrane fragments purified from R. gelatinosus and B. viridis WT strains and the chimeric VC-F strain (Fig. 2, left panel) by measuring the flash-induced absorption changes at 605 nm, 50 ns after the actinic flash. Both the oxidative or reducing waves yielded similar results, indicating that thermodynamic equilibrium was reached during the titration (data not shown). The titration curve in B. viridis could be satisfyingly fitted with a Nernst curve with Em = +500 mV. The P+/P couple in R. gelatinosus titrates with an Em of ∼+400 mV, consistent with previous findings (22Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), but, interestingly, the titration curve showed a slight deviation to a one-electron Nernst equation (dotted line). In the VC-F-chimeric RC, the results were significantly different from that in R. gelatinosus WT. (i) The deviation to the one-electron Nernst equation (dotted line) was more pronounced. (ii) The overall midpoint potential was lower by ∼50 mV. Several non-exclusive hypotheses may account for such a difference. The first one relies on a strong heterogeneity among the RCs. As a possible reason for such heterogeneity, one may consider that the tetraheme subunit is lost in a fraction of RCs during the preparation of the membrane fragments. To test this hypothesis, we measured (Fig. 3) the amount of long-lived P+ under conditions where only the c556 and c559 hemes were reduced in the dark (Fig. 3, squares) and under conditions where the high and low potential hemes were reduced in the dark (Fig. 3, triangles). Whereas in the former case ∼50% P+ was still present 200 μs after the flash, this fraction of long-lived P+ was only 3% when the low potential hemes were reduced. Under these latter conditions, the free energy change associated with P+ reduction is expected to be large because of the low midpoint potentials of the electron donor (see Fig. 1). Thus, after this equilibrium is reached (i.e. in the hundreds of a microsecond time range, see Fig. 1), the amount of P+ remaining should be too low to be detectable. Conversely, in the eventual RCs devoid of the tetraheme subunit, P+ is expected to decay via charge recombination, i.e. in the tens of a millisecond time range (23Agalidis I. Sebban P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of P+ still detectable at 200 μs after the actinic flash can be taken as an indication of the amount of RCs with no tetraheme subunit. Moreover, the absorption changes measured 200 μs after the flash were indicative of the flash-induced oxidation of a low potential heme (data not shown). We take these results as evidence that most of the RCs (97%) have a bound and functional cytochrome subunit. Another possible explanation of the different titration curves in the VC-F and WT RCs is a structural modification of the protein matrix around the bacteriochlorophyll dimer resulting from the chimeric association with the B. viridis cytochrome subunit. We consider this hypothesis as unlikely as well, because the absorption changes associated with the formation of the P+ state in the VC-F mutant were similar to those observed with the WT R. gelatinosus RC (Fig. 4A). Further, EPR measurements performed on VC-F-oriented membrane multilayer dried on Mylar sheets showed an angle dependence of the gz signal of the hemes identical to that obtained for B. viridis. Nitschke and Rutherford (24Nitschke W. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3161-3168Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) assigned the EPR gz signals of each of the four hemes in the B. viridis cytochrome on the basis of their respective Em. They ascribed the g-value of 3.09 to the highest potential c559 heme and g-values comprised between 3.29 and 3.32 to the other hemes. The global binding of the B. viridis cytochrome onto the RC of R. gelatinosus was investigated in the same way. Oriented multilayers of VC-F membrane fragments exhibited peaks at g-values of 3.1 and 3.3 with orientation-dependent intensities (Fig. 4B). Polar plots of EPR signal amplitudes allowed one to orient the gz of 3.1 along the 0° axis, whereas the maximum of the gz = 3.3 line was found at 45° (Fig. 4C). Since the gz vector of a heme is perpendicular to the porphyrin ring, we concluded that the highest potential heme c559 was almost perpendicular (90°) to the membrane plane, similar to B. viridis (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. 7 in Ref. 24Nitschke W. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3161-3168Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absorption spectra of the four hemes bound to the tetraheme subunit are conserved in the chimeric RC with respect to the WT B. viridis RC (see Fig. 5A for a comparison of absorption changes associated with the oxidation of the c556 and c559 hemes in both strains). Furthermore, the Ems of the three lower potential hemes embedded in the cytochrome subunit are remarkably conserved when compared with those found in B. viridis (14Maki H. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Nagashima K.V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3921-3928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Based on the sensitivity of both the spectroscopic and redox properties of a redox cofactor to any significant alteration of its protein environment, we take these results as a strong indication in favor of a conserved structure.Fig. 5Dark equilibrium redox titration of the high potential hemes of VC-F and B. viridis RC.

Such an interaction between two close redox cofactors implies that the Em of either one of the two cofactors depends on the redox state of its neighbor. In the present framework, one should thus consider the following schemes as shown in Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2The reduced and oxidized states of the cytochrome are noted as c and c+, respectively, for the sake of clarity. It does not mean that the absolute charge of the reduced cytochrome is null or that it is equal to one for the oxidized state. Yet, the change in charge resulting from the oxidation is equal to one electron.Pc↔EP(c)P+c+e−(Eq. 1) Pc+↔EP(c+)P+c++e−(Eq. 2) Pc+↔EP(c+)P+c++e−(Eq. 3) P+c↔Ec(P+)P+c++e−(Eq. 4) with{EP(c+)=EP(c)+ΔψEc(P+)=Ec(P)+Δψ(Eq. 5) where EP(c+) and EP(c) are the Em values of the P+/P couple in the presence of the oxidized and reduced cytochromes, respectively, Δψ is the electrostatic interaction between both cofactors, and Ec(P+) and Ec(P) are the Em values of the cytochrome in presence of P+ and P, respectively. The equation used to fit the titration curve is then derived from both following points. 1) The total amount of oxidized P+ or of reduced P can be written as shown in Equations 6 and 7.[P+]=[P+c+]+[P+c](Eq. 6) [P]=[Pc+]+[Pc](Eq. 7) 2) Applying the Nernst equation at a given ambient potential (Eh) to the four electron transfer reactions just described yields Equations 8, 9, 10, 11.[P+c][Pc]=10Eh−EP(c)60(Eq. 8) [P+c+][Pc+]=10Eh−EP(c+)60=10Eh−EP(c)−Δψ60(Eq. 9) [Pc+][Pc]=10Eh−Ec(P)60(Eq. 10) [P+c+][P+c]=10Eh−Ec(P+)60=10Eh−Ec(P)−Δψ60(Eq. 11) Incorporating Equations 8, 9, 10, 11 into Equations 6 and 7 at a given Eh, the fraction of P in the oxidized state, irrespective of the redox state of the cytochrome is shown in Equation 12.[P+][P+]+[P]=10Eh−EP(c)60+102Eh−Ec(P)−EP(c)−Δψ601+10Eh−EP(c)60+10Eh−Ec(P)60+102Eh−Ec(P)−EP(c)−Δψ60(Eq. 12) This equation allows one to distinguish several cases, each of the two extreme ones where EP(c) « Ec(P) or Ec(P) « EP(c+) yields a redox titration, which follows a one-electron Nernst curve (with Em = EP(c) and Em = EP(c) +Δψ, respectively). This reflects the fact that the redox changes of each cofactor occur in well separated redox potential ranges; thus, they do not interfere. A third and experimentally more interesting case arises when EP(c) ≈ Ec(P) or Ec(P) ≈ EP(c+), because according to the above equation, the titration curve should be markedly different from a classical Nernst curve. This latter case applies to the VC-F strain. The data presented in Fig. 2 could be satisfyingly fitted to Equation 12 (Fig. 2, solid lines) with Ec(P), EP(c), and Δψ as varying parameters. In the VC-F strain, the best-fit parameters were: Ec(P) = +380 mV; EP(c) = +350 mV; and Δψ = +50 mV. In the R. gelatinosus RC, the fit to Equation 12 yielded Ec(P) =+300 mV, EP(c) =+350 mV, and Δψ=+50 mV. In B. viridis, because the Ems of the two interacting cofactors belong to more distinct redox potential regions, the deviation to a one-electron Nernst curve was, as expected, less pronounced. The data could be satisfyingly fitted either with a one-electron Nernst curve with EP =+500 mV or, according to Equation 12, with Ec(P) =+380 mV, EP(c) =+450 mV, and Δψ=+50 mV. It is noteworthy that the values found for the Em of the P+/P couple as well as for Δψ were similar in the chimeric and “parent” RC from R. gelatinosus. Yet, one could argue that the value found here for the Em of the P+/P couple in R. gelatinosus WT is 50 mV smaller than the previously reported one of 400 mV. This was not unexpected, because in the WT, the Em of the closest heme to P is significantly lower than that of the P+/P couple so that the respective oxidation (or reduction) of the two cofactors occurs in distinct redox potential domains. Consequently, the most significant fraction of P should be oxidized in the presence of the oxidized cytochrome and the titration curve should yield, as a first approximation, a Em of EP(c) + Δψ = 350 + 50 =+400 mV, in good agreement with previous reports (22Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To further test this interpretation, we have measured the equilibrium redox titration of the P+/P couple in a site-directed mutant of the VC-F strain in which the Em of the c559 heme is expected to be decreased, thereby increasing the gap between the Ems of P and its closest heme. According to the calculation of Gunner and Honig (7Gunner M.R. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the presence of a positively charged arginine residue (Arg-264) in the vicinity of the c559 heme of the B. viridis cytochrome subunit contributes to raise the midpoint potential of this redox center. This finding was confirmed by Chen et al. (26Chen I.P. Mathis P. Koepke J. Michel H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3592-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) who substituted, by site-directed mutagenesis, this residue for a lysine and found a downshifted Em for the c559 by ∼110 mV. We have also targeted this Arg and substituted it for a Leu in the gene coding for the tetraheme subunit in the VC-F strain (17Nagashima K.V.P. Alric J. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Verméglio A. Bruce D. van der Est A. 13th International Congress on Photosynthesis. Allen Press, Montréal2004Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous findings from Chen et al. (26Chen I.P. Mathis P. Koepke J. Michel H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3592-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the Em of the c559 heme in this mutant (R264L) was decreased to 130 mV (17Nagashima K.V.P. Alric J. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Verméglio A. Bruce D. van der Est A. 13th Internation"
https://openalex.org/W2046199699,"Human cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) has a dual function in cross-regulation of cell cycle and differentiation, whereas menage a trois 1 (MAT1) assembles CAK and determines CAK's substrate specificity. Although the dynamic state of MAT1 protein levels is found to modulate CAK activity, how intracellular regulation of MAT1 controls CAK activity is unknown. Recent studies demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA)-induced human HL60 cell proliferation/differentiation (P/D) transition is accompanied by MAT1 degradation and decreased CAK phosphorylation of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa). Thus, we investigated the biochemical pathway of MAT1 degradation and its relationship with CAK phosphorylation of RARa. We find that RA induces ubiquitination-proteolysis of MAT1 and that ubiquitin-proteasome targets CAK-free MAT1 only. RA-induced MAT1 ubiquitination reduces CAK abundance and decreases CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha, whereas inhibition of MAT1 ubiquitination resists this RA-effect. These findings reveal that RA induces MAT1 ubiquitination to decrease CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha, suggesting a novel mechanism of RA-mediated P/D transition in which MAT1 ubiquitination may act as an integral part of RA-effect to decrease CAK activity in the switch from proliferation to differentiation."
