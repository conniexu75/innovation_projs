https://openalex.org/W2283143515,"Background Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder involving marked immunological changes. IL-17-targeting biologics have been successful in reducing the disease burden of psoriasis patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Unfortunately, the stratum corneum prevents penetration of large molecule weight proteins, including monoclonal antibodies. Thus, for the majority of psoriasis patients ineligible for systemic treatments, a small molecule targeting RORγt, the master regulator of IL-17 family cytokines, may represent an alternative topical medicine with biologic-like efficacy. Methods and Findings The preclinical studies described in this manuscript bridge the gap from bench to bedside to provide the scientific foundation for a compound entering clinical trials for patients with mild to moderate psoriasis. In addition to several ex vivo reporter assays, primary T cell cultures, and the imiquimod mouse model, we demonstrate efficacy in a newly developed human ex vivo skin assay, where Th17-skewed cytokine expression is induced from skin-resident immune cells. Importantly, the skin barrier remains intact allowing for the demonstration of topical drug delivery. With the development of this novel assay, we demonstrate potent compound activity in the target tissue: human skin. Finally, target engagement by this small molecule was confirmed in ex vivo lesional psoriatic skin. Conclusions Our work describes a progressive series of assays to demonstrate the potential clinical value of a novel RORγ inverse agonist small molecule with high potency and selectivity, which will enter clinical trials in late 2015 for psoriasis patients."

However,in vivoαIIbβ3 activation and fibrinogen conversion to fibrin occur simultaneously, although the relative contributions of fibrinogenversusfibrin to αIIbβ3-mediated platelet functions are unknown. Here, we compared the interaction of αIIbβ3 with fibrin and fibrinogen to explore their differential effects. A microscopic bead coated with fibrinogen or monomeric fibrin produced by treating the immobilized fibrinogen with thrombin was captured by a laser beam and repeatedly brought into contact with surface-attached purified αIIbβ3. When αIIbβ3-ligand complexes were detected, the rupture forces were measured and displayed as force histograms. Monomeric fibrin displayed a higher probability of interacting with αIIbβ3 and a greater binding strength. αIIbβ3-fibrin interactions were also less sensitive to inhibition by abciximab and eptifibatide. Both fibrinogen- and fibrin-αIIbβ3 interactions were partially inhibited by RGD peptides, suggesting the existence of common RGD-containing binding motifs. This assumption was supported using the fibrin variants αD97E or αD574E with mutated RGD motifs. Fibrin made from a fibrinogen γ'/γ' variant lacking the γC αIIbβ3-binding motif was more reactive with αIIbβ3 than the parent fibrinogen. These results demonstrate that fibrin is more reactive with αIIbβ3 than fibrinogen. Fibrin is also less sensitive to αIIbβ3 inhibitors, suggesting that fibrin and fibrinogen have distinct binding requirements. In particular, the maintenance of αIIbβ3 binding activity in the absence of the γC-dodecapeptide and the α-chain RGD sequences suggests that the αIIbβ3-binding sites in fibrin are not confined to its known γ-chain and RGD motifs."

Methods Pregnant women were consecutively recruited in their first trimester. Habitual snoring was screened by using a questionnaire in the 1st and 3rd trimester, respectively. According to the time of snoring, participants were divided into pregnancy onset snorers, chronic snorers and non-snorers. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between snoring and pregnancy outcomes. Results Of 3 079 pregnant women, 16.6% were habitual snorers, with 11.7% were pregnancy onset snorers and 4.9% were chronic snorers. After adjusting for potential confounders, chronic snorers were independently associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (RR 1.66, 95%CI 1.09–2.53). Both pregnancy onset and chronic snorers were independently associated with placental adhesion (RR 1.96, 95%CI 1.17–3.27, and RR 2.33, 95%CI 1.22–4.46, respectively). Pregnancy onset snorers were at higher risk of caesarean delivery (RR 1.37, 95%CI 1.09–1.73) and having macrosomia (RR 1.54, 95%CI 1.05–2.27) and large for gestational age (LGA) (RR 1.71, 95%CI 1.31–2.24) infants. In addition, being overweight or obese before pregnancy plays an important role in mediating snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Maternal snoring may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and being overweight or obese before pregnancy with snoring is remarkable for researchers. Further studies are still needed to confirm our results."
https://openalex.org/W2260607294,"There is limited information about age-specific structural and functional properties of human heart valves, while this information is key to the development and evaluation of living valve replacements for pediatric and adolescent patients. Here, we present an extended data set of structure-function properties of cryopreserved human pulmonary and aortic heart valves, providing age-specific information for living valve replacements. Tissue composition, morphology, mechanical properties, and maturation of leaflets from 16 pairs of structurally unaffected aortic and pulmonary valves of human donors (fetal-53 years) were analyzed. Interestingly, no major differences were observed between the aortic and pulmonary valves. Valve annulus and leaflet dimensions increase throughout life. The typical three-layered leaflet structure is present before birth, but becomes more distinct with age. After birth, cell numbers decrease rapidly, while remaining cells obtain a quiescent phenotype and reside in the ventricularis and spongiosa. With age and maturation–but more pronounced in aortic valves–the matrix shows an increasing amount of collagen and collagen cross-links and a reduction in glycosaminoglycans. These matrix changes correlate with increasing leaflet stiffness with age. Our data provide a new and comprehensive overview of the changes of structure-function properties of fetal to adult human semilunar heart valves that can be used to evaluate and optimize future therapies, such as tissue engineering of heart valves. Changing hemodynamic conditions with age can explain initial changes in matrix composition and consequent mechanical properties, but cannot explain the ongoing changes in valve dimensions and matrix composition at older age."
https://openalex.org/W2269639862,"The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive vector species. It is a proven vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses, with the potential to host a further 24 arboviruses. It has recently expanded its geographical range, threatening many countries in the Middle East, Mediterranean, Europe and North America. Here, we investigate the theoretical limitations of its range expansion by developing an environmentally-driven mathematical model of its population dynamics. We focus on the temperate strain of Ae. albopictus and compile a comprehensive literature-based database of physiological parameters. As a novel approach, we link its population dynamics to globally-available environmental datasets by performing inference on all parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach using experimental data as prior knowledge and the surveillance dataset of Emilia-Romagna, Italy, as evidence. The model accounts for temperature, precipitation, human population density and photoperiod as the main environmental drivers, and, in addition, incorporates the mechanism of diapause and a simple breeding site model. The model demonstrates high predictive skill over the reference region and beyond, confirming most of the current reports of vector presence in Europe. One of the main hypotheses derived from the model is the survival of Ae. albopictus populations through harsh winter conditions. The model, constrained by the environmental datasets, requires that either diapausing eggs or adult vectors have increased cold resistance. The model also suggests that temperature and photoperiod control diapause initiation and termination differentially. We demonstrate that it is possible to account for unobserved properties and constraints, such as differences between laboratory and field conditions, to derive reliable inferences on the environmental dependence of Ae. albopictus populations."
https://openalex.org/W2267952953,"Accumulating evidence suggests that iron-associated proteins contribute to tumor initiation and development. Ferritin light chain (FTL), a key protein in iron metabolism, is associated with the survival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association remain largely unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of FTL in the pathogenesis of GBM. By using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we found that expression of FTL was higher in patients with GBM than in those with low-grade glioma. Immunofluorescence showed that FTL was mainly localized in the nucleus of GBM cells and was closely associated with mitotic spindles. Knockdown of FTL resulted in inhibition of cell growth and activation of the GADD45A/JNK pathway in GBM cells. Immunoblotting revealed that levels of GADD45A protein decreased in GBM cells when FTL expression increased. Furthermore, transfection of GADD45A in GBM cells significantly decreased cell viability, and this effect was impeded by co-transfection of FTL. Moreover, FTL was found to localize with GADD45A in GBM cells, and a coimmunoprecipitation experiment showed that the two proteins physically interacted. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which FTL regulates the growth of GBM cells via the GADD45/JNK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2275021215,"The obligate intracellular developmental cycle of Chlamydia trachomatis presents significant challenges in defining its proteome. In this study we have applied quantitative proteomics to both the intracellular reticulate body (RB) and the extracellular elementary body (EB) from C. trachomatis. We used C. trachomatis L2 as a model chlamydial isolate for our study since it has a high infectivity:particle ratio and there is an excellent quality genome sequence. EBs and RBs (>99% pure) were quantified by chromosomal and plasmid copy number using PCR, from which the concentrations of chlamydial proteins per bacterial cell/genome were determined. RBs harvested at 15h post infection (PI) were purified by three successive rounds of gradient centrifugation. This is the earliest possible time to obtain purified RBs, free from host cell components in quantity, within the constraints of the technology. EBs were purified at 48h PI. We then used two-dimensional reverse phase UPLC to fractionate RB or EB peptides before mass spectroscopic analysis, providing absolute amount estimates of chlamydial proteins. The ability to express the data as molecules per cell gave ranking in both abundance and energy requirements for synthesis, allowing meaningful identification of rate-limiting components. The study assigned 562 proteins with high confidence and provided absolute estimates of protein concentration for 489 proteins. Interestingly, the data showed an increase in TTS capacity at 15h PI. Most of the enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis were detected along with high levels of muramidase (in EBs) suggesting breakdown of peptidoglycan occurs in the non-dividing form of the microorganism. All the genome-encoded enzymes for glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle were identified and quantified; these data supported the observation that the EB is metabolically active. The availability of detailed, accurate quantitative proteomic data will be invaluable for investigations into gene regulation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2280313619,"The structures of the lipooligosaccharides from Brucella melitensis mutants affected in the WbkD and ManBcore proteins have been fully characterized using NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed that disruption of wbkD gives rise to a rough lipopolysaccharide (R-LPS) with a complete core structure (β-d-Glcp-(1→4)-α-Kdop-(2→4)[β-d-GlcpN-(1→6)-β-d-GlcpN-(1→4)[β-d-GlcpN-(1→6)]-β-d-GlcpN-(1→3)-α-d-Manp-(1→5)]-α-Kdop-(2→6)-β-d-GlcpN3N4P-(1→6)-α-d-GlcpN3N1P), in addition to components lacking one of the terminal β-d-GlcpN and/or the β-d-Glcp residues (48 and 17%, respectively). These structures were identical to those of the R-LPS from B. melitensis EP, a strain simultaneously expressing both smooth and R-LPS, also studied herein. In contrast, disruption of manBcore gives rise to a deep-rough pentasaccharide core (β-d-Glcp-(1→4)-α-Kdop-(2→4)-α-Kdop-(2→6)-β-d-GlcpN3N4P-(1→6)-α-d-GlcpN3N1P) as the major component (63%), as well as a minor tetrasaccharide component lacking the terminal β-d-Glcp residue (37%). These results are in agreement with the predicted functions of the WbkD (glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen) and ManBcore proteins (phosphomannomutase involved in the biosynthesis of a mannosyl precursor needed for the biosynthesis of the core and O-antigen). We also report that deletion of B. melitensis wadC removes the core oligosaccharide branch not linked to the O-antigen causing an increase in overall negative charge of the remaining LPS inner section. This is in agreement with the mannosyltransferase role predicted for WadC and the lack of GlcpN residues in the defective core oligosaccharide. Despite carrying the O-antigen essential in B. melitensis virulence, the core deficiency in the wadC mutant structure resulted in a more efficient detection by innate immunity and attenuation, proving the role of the β-d-GlcpN-(1→6)-β-d-GlcpN-(1→4)[β-d-GlcpN-(1→6)]-β-d-GlcpN-(1→3)-α-d-Manp-(1→5) structure in virulence.

https://openalex.org/W2258066101,"Luteoloside is a member of the flavonoids family that exhibits several bioactivities including anti-microbial and anti-cancer activities. However, the antiviral activity of luteoloside against enterovirus 71 (EV71) and the potential mechanism(s) responsible for this effect remain unknown. In this study, the antiviral potency of luteoloside against EV71 and its inhibitory effects on 3C protease activity were evaluated. First, we investigated the cytotoxicity of luteoloside against rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, which was the cell line selected for an in vitro infection model. In a subsequent antiviral assay, the cytopathic effect of EV71 was significantly and dose-dependently relieved by the administration of luteoloside (EC50 = 0.43 mM, selection index = 5.3). Using a plaque reduction assay, we administered luteoloside at various time points and found that the compound reduced EV71 viability in RD cells rather than increasing defensive mobilization or viral absorption. Moreover, biochemical studies focused on VP1 (a key structural protein of EV71) mRNA transcript and protein levels also revealed the inhibitory effects of luteoloside on the EV71 viral yield. Finally, we performed inhibition assays using luteoloside to evaluate its effect on recombinant 3C protease activity. Our results demonstrated that luteoloside blocked 3C protease enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.36 mM) that was similar to the effect of rutin, which is a well-known C3 protease inhibitor. Collectively, the results from this study indicate that luteoloside can block 3C protease activity and subsequently inhibit EV71 production in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2258442318,"Selective pressures imposed by pathogenic microorganisms to embryos have selected in hosts for a battery of antimicrobial lines of defenses that includes physical and chemical barriers. Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2260432300,"Background Persistent inflammation and immune activation has been hypothesized to contribute to increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with chronic HIV infection. In this study, we examined the correlation of peripheral monocyte subsets and soluble biomarkers of inflammation to coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression, as measured by cardiac computed tomography scan. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis utilizing baseline data of 78 participants with HIV infection on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Hawaii Aging with HIV-Cardiovascular study who had available baseline monocyte subset analysis as well as CAC measurement at baseline and at 2-year follow up. Monocyte phenotypes were assessed from cryopreserved blood by flow cytometry and plasma was assayed for soluble biomarkers using antibody-coated beads in a high sensitivity Milliplex Luminex platform. Change in CAC over 2 years was analyzed as the primary outcome variable. Results Of all monocyte subsets and biomarkers tested, higher non-classical monocyte percentage (ρ = 0.259, p = 0.022), interleukin (IL)-6 (ρ = 0.311, p = 0.012), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (ρ = 0.524, p = <0.001) were significantly correlated to higher 2-year CAC progression in unadjusted Spearman’s correlation. Non-classical monocyte percentage (ρ = 0.247, p = 0.039), and MCP-1 (ρ = 0.487, p = <0.001), remained significantly correlated to 2-year CAC progression, while IL-6 was not (ρ = 0.209, p = 0.120) after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, smoking history, and BMI. Conclusion The percentage of non-classical monocytes and plasma MCP-1 levels were independently associated with CAC progression and may be related to the progression of atherosclerosis and increased CVD risk associated with chronic HIV infection on stable ART."
https://openalex.org/W2287284028,"Understanding gas migration pathways is critical to unraveling structure-function relationships in enzymes that process gaseous substrates such as O2, H2, and N2 This work investigates the role of a defined pathway for O2 in regulating the peroxidation of linoleic acid by soybean lipoxygenase 1. Computational and mutagenesis studies provide strong support for a dominant delivery channel that shuttles molecular oxygen to a specific region of the active site, thereby ensuring the regio- and stereospecificity of product. Analysis of reaction kinetics and product distribution in channel mutants also reveals a plasticity to the gas migration pathway. The findings show that a single site mutation (I553W) limits oxygen accessibility to the active site, greatly increasing the fraction of substrate that reacts with oxygen free in solution. They also show how a neighboring site mutation (L496W) can result in a redirection of oxygen toward an alternate position of the substrate, changing the regio- and stereospecificity of peroxidation. The present data indicate that modest changes in a protein scaffold may modulate the access of small gaseous molecules to enzyme-bound substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2264709294,"Improvement of neuronal recovery in the ischemic penumbra around a brain infarct has a large potential to advance clinical recovery of patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, pathophysiological mechanisms leading to either recovery or secondary damage in the penumbra are not completely understood. We studied neuronal dynamics in a model system of the penumbra consisting of networks of cultured cortical neurons exposed to controlled levels and durations of hypoxia. Short periods of hypoxia (pO2≈20mmHg) reduced spontaneous activity, due to impeded synaptic function. After ≈6 hours, activity and connectivity partially recovered, even during continuing hypoxia. If the oxygen supply was restored within 12 hours, changes in network connectivity were completely reversible. For longer periods of hypoxia (12–30 h), activity levels initially increased, but eventually decreased and connectivity changes became partially irreversible. After ≈30 hours, all functional connections disappeared and no activity remained. Since this complete silence seemed unrelated to hypoxic depths, but always followed an extended period of low activity, we speculate that irreversible damage (at least partly) results from insufficient neuronal activation. This opens avenues for therapies to improve recovery by neuronal activation."
https://openalex.org/W2266626643,"Through 17 years and from a sample of 7,790 faecal pellets and 26,346 prey items, we studied the diet of the Balearic lizard Podarcis lilfordi in Aire Island (Menorca, Balearic Islands, Spain). We analysed the diet in terms of prey frequencies, as well as by their volume and biomass contributions. The diet of the Balearic lizard was extremely variable through the years, months and areas under study. The dominance of small clumped prey, particularly ants, was confirmed. However, the main contribution by volume corresponded to beetles, with a relevant role for Diplopoda and terrestrial Isopoda during some months and at particular areas of the island. Several prey items were probably captured at the base of shrubs, under stones or inside rock crevices. Therefore, our estimations of electivity would only be reliable for epigeal and flying prey. The capacity of the Balearic lizard to include marine subsidies in its diet, such as coastal crustaceans, is noteworthy. Also, its consumption of carrion from carcasses of gulls and rabbits and leftovers from human visitors is remarkable. Juvenile conspecifics can also be a sporadic food resource, especially during the second half of summer, whereas the consumption of vegetal matter is constant for each whole year. The shifts of vegetal exploitation among areas of the island and months take place according to availability of different plant species at each area or during a given period. Thus, lizards are able to conduct a thorough monitoring of plant phenology, exploiting a large variety of plant species. Omnivory does not imply the indiscriminate inclusion of any edible food in its diet. Rather, the inclusion of several food items means the adoption of a wide range of foraging behaviours adapted to the exploitation of each food resource."
https://openalex.org/W2273587189,"Current methods of administering busulfan to remove the endogenous germ cells cause hematopoietic toxicity, require special instruments and a narrow transplantation time. We use a direct testicular injection of busulfan method for preparing recipients for SSC transplantation. Male ICR mice (recipients) were divided into four groups, and two experimental groups were treated with a bilateral testicular injection of 4 or 6 mg/kg/side busulfan (n = 60 per concentration group). Mice received an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 40 mg/kg busulfan (n = 60, positive control) and bilateral testicular injections of 50% DMSO (n = 60, negative control). Donor SSCs from RFP-transgenic C57BL/6J mice were introduced into the seminiferous tubules of each recipient testis via efferent duct injection on day 16-17 after busulfan treatment. Recipient mice mated with mature female ICR mice and the number of progeny was recorded. The index detected at day 14, 21, 28, 35 and 70 after busulfan treatment. Blood analysis shows that the toxicity of busulfan treated groups was much lower than i.p. injection groups. Fertility was restored in mice treated with busulfan and donor-derived offspring were obtained after SSC transplantation. Our study indicated that intratesticular injection busulfan for the preparation of recipients in mice is safe and feasible."

Antiplatelet non-responsiveness is related to recurrent ischemic events, but the culprit genetic variants responsible for the non-responsiveness have not been well studied. We aimed to identify the genetic variants associated with poor clinical outcomes.Patients with symptomatic extracranial or intracranial stenosis scheduled for stenting and receiving dual antiplatelets (clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 100 mg daily) for at least 5 days before intervention were enrolled. Ischemic events including recurrent transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular-related mortality within 12 months follow-up were recorded. We examined the influence of genetic polymorphisms on treatment outcome in our patients.A total of 268 patients were enrolled into our study and ischemic events were observed in 39 patients. For rs662 of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), allele C was associated with an increased risk of ischemic events (OR = 1.64, 95%CI = 1.03-2.62, P = 0.029). The A-allele carriers of rs2046934 of P2Y12 had a significant association with adverse events (OR = 2.01, 95%CI = 1.10-3.67, P = 0.041). The variant T-allele of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) rs1330344 significantly increased the risk of recurrent clinical events (OR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.12-3.03, P = 0.017). The other single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) had no association with ischemic events.PON1, P2Y12 and COX1 polymorphisms were associated with poorer vascular outcomes. Testing for these polymorphisms may be valuable in the identification of patients at risk for recurrent ischemic events."
https://openalex.org/W2255150230,"Context Severe bacterial infections are not considered as a leading cause of death in young children in sub-Saharan Africa. The worldwide emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) could change the paradigm, especially in neonates who are at high risk of developing healthcare-associated infections. Objective To evaluate the epidemiology and the burden of ESBL-E bloodstream infections (BSI). Methods A case-case-control study was conducted in patients admitted in a pediatric hospital during two consecutive years. Cases were patients with Enterobacteriaceae BSI and included ESBL-positive (cases 1) and ESBL-negative BSI (cases 2). Controls were patients with no BSI. Multivariate analysis using a stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for ESBL acquisition and for fatal outcomes. A multistate model was used to estimate the excess length of hospital stay (LOS) attributable to ESBL production while accounting for time of infection. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess the independent effect of ESBL-positive and negative BSI on LOS. Results The incidence rate of ESBL-E BSI was of 1.52 cases/1000 patient-days (95% CI: 1.2–5.6 cases per 1000 patient-days). Multivariate analysis showed that independent risk factors for ESBL-BSI acquisition were related to underlying comorbidities (sickle cell disease OR = 3.1 (95%CI: 2.3–4.9), malnutrition OR = 2.0 (95%CI: 1.7–2.6)) and invasive procedures (mechanical ventilation OR = 3.5 (95%CI: 2.7–5.3)). Neonates were also identified to be at risk for ESBL-E BSI. Inadequate initial antibiotic therapy was more frequent in ESBL-positive BSI than ESBL-negative BSI (94.2% versus 5.7%, p<0.0001). ESBL-positive BSI was associated with higher case-fatality rate than ESBL-negative BSI (54.8% versus 15.4%, p<0.001). Multistate modelling indicated an excess LOS attributable to ESBL production of 4.3 days. The adjusted end-of-LOS hazard ratio for ESBL-positive BSI was 0.07 (95%CI, 0.04–0.12). Conclusion Control of ESBL-E spread is an emergency in pediatric populations and could be achieved with simple cost-effective measures such as hand hygiene, proper management of excreta and better stewardship of antibiotic use, especially for empirical therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2253653597,"The glucocorticoid stress response, regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, enables individuals to cope with stressors through transcriptional effects in cells expressing the appropriate receptors. The two receptors that bind glucocorticoids-the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-are present in a variety of vertebrate tissues, but their expression in the brain is especially important. Neural receptor patterns have the potential to integrate multiple behavioral and physiological traits simultaneously, including self-regulation of glucocorticoid secretion through negative feedback processes. In the present work, we quantified the expression of GR and MR mRNA throughout the brain of a female great tit (Parus major), creating a distribution map encompassing 48 regions. This map, the first of its kind for P. major, demonstrated a widespread but not ubiquitous distribution of both receptor types. In the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the hippocampus (HP)-the two brain regions that we sampled from a total of 25 birds, we found high GR mRNA expression in the former and, unexpectedly, low MR mRNA in the latter. We examined the covariation of MR and GR levels in these two regions and found a strong, positive relationship between MR in the PVN and MR in the HP and a similar trend for GR across these two regions. This correlation supports the idea that hormone pleiotropy may constrain an individual's behavioral and physiological phenotype. In the female song system, we found moderate GR in hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudalis (HVC), and moderate MR in robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Understanding intra- and interspecific patterns of glucocorticoid receptor expression can inform us about the behavioral processes (e.g. song learning) that may be sensitive to stress and stimulate future hypotheses concerning the relationships between receptor expression, circulating hormone concentrations and performance traits under selection, including behavior."

In this study, we describe the kinetics of nitrite (NO2−) reduction by Fe(II)-CBS to form Fe(II)NO•-CBS. The second order rate constant for the reaction of Fe(II)-CBS with nitrite was obtained at low dithionite concentrations. Reoxidation of Fe(II)NO•-CBS by O2 showed complex kinetic behavior and led to peroxynitrite (ONOO−) formation, which was detected using the fluorescent probe, coumarin boronic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2277438596,"We have studied the influence of protein crowders, either combined or individually, on the GTP-induced FtsZ cooperative assembly, crucial for the formation of the dynamic septal ring and, hence, for bacterial division. It was earlier demonstrated that high concentrations of inert polymers like Ficoll 70, used to mimic the crowded cellular interior, favor the assembly of FtsZ into bundles with slow depolymerization. We have found, by fluorescence anisotropy together with light scattering measurements, that the presence of protein crowders increases the tendency of FtsZ to polymerize at micromolar magnesium concentration, being the effect larger with ovomucoid, a negatively charged protein. Neutral polymers and a positively charged protein also diminished the critical concentration of assembly, the extent of the effect being compatible with that expected according to pure volume exclusion models. FtsZ polymerization was also observed to be strongly promoted by a negatively charged polymer, DNA, and by some unrelated polymers like PEGs at concentrations below the crowding regime. The influence of mixed crowders mimicking the heterogeneity of the intracellular environment on the tendency of FtsZ to assemble was also studied and nonadditive effects were found to prevail. Far from exactly reproducing the bacterial cytoplasm environment, this approach serves as a simplified model illustrating how its intrinsically crowded and heterogeneous nature may modulate FtsZ assembly into a functional Z-ring."
https://openalex.org/W2285097639,"Recent evidence indicated that interspecific hybridization was the major mode of evolution in Pyrus. The genetic relationships and origins of the Asian pear are still unclear because of frequent hybrid events, fast radial evolution, and lack of informative data. Here, we developed fluorescent sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) markers with lots of informative sites and high polymorphism to analyze the population structure among 93 pear accessions, including nearly all species native to Asia. Results of a population structure analysis indicated that nearly all Asian pear species experienced hybridization, and originated from five primitive genepools. Four genepools corresponded to four primary Asian species: P. betulaefolia, P. pashia, P. pyrifolia, and P. ussuriensis. However, cultivars of P. ussuriensis were not monophyletic and introgression occurred from P. pyrifolia. The specific genepool detected in putative hybrids between occidental and oriental pears might be from occidental pears. The remaining species, including P. calleryana, P. xerophila, P. sinkiangensis, P. phaeocarpa, P. hondoensis, and P. hopeiensis in Asia, were inferred to be of hybrid origins and their possible genepools were identified. This study will be of great help for understanding the origin and evolution of Asian pears."
https://openalex.org/W2297875876,"Cardiac hypertrophy is a key pathological process of many cardiac diseases. However, early detection of cardiac hypertrophy is difficult by the currently used non-invasive method and new approaches are in urgent need for efficient diagnosis of cardiac malfunction. Here we report that speckle tracking-based strain analysis is more sensitive than conventional echocardiography for early detection of pathological cardiac hypertrophy in the isoproterenol (ISO) mouse model. Pathological hypertrophy was induced by a single subcutaneous injection of ISO. Physiological cardiac hypertrophy was established by daily treadmill exercise for six weeks. Strain analysis, including radial strain (RS), radial strain rate (RSR) and longitudinal strain (LS), showed marked decrease as early as 3 days after ISO injection. Moreover, unlike the regional changes in cardiac infarction, strain analysis revealed global cardiac dysfunction that affects the entire heart in ISO-induced hypertrophy. In contrast, conventional echocardiography, only detected altered E/E’, an index reflecting cardiac diastolic function, at 7 days after ISO injection. No change was detected on fractional shortening (FS), E/A and E’/A’ at 3 days or 7 days after ISO injection. Interestingly, strain analysis revealed cardiac dysfunction only in ISO-induced pathological hypertrophy but not the physiological hypertrophy induced by exercise. Taken together, our study indicates that strain analysis offers a more sensitive approach for early detection of cardiac dysfunction than conventional echocardiography. Moreover, multiple strain readouts distinguish pathological cardiac hypertrophy from physiological hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2255936019,"To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and maternal satisfaction of a newly established integrative postpartum community-based clinic providing comprehensive support for mothers during the first month after discharge from the hospital. Our primary interests were breastfeeding rates, readmission and patient satisfaction.A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Ottawa, Canada, where 472 mothers were randomized via a 1:2 ratio to either receive standard of care (n = 157) or to attend the postpartum breastfeeding clinic (n = 315). Outcome data were captured through questionnaires completed by the participants at 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks postpartum. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were conducted to determine the effect of the intervention on exclusive breastfeeding at 12 weeks (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included breastfeeding rate at 2, 4 and 24 weeks, breastfeeding self-efficacy scale, readmission rate, and satisfaction score.More mothers in the intervention group (n = 195, 66.1%) were exclusively breastfeeding at 12 weeks compared to mothers in the control group (n = 81, 60.5%), however no statistically significant difference was observed (OR = 1.28; 95% CI:0.84-1.95)). The rate of emergency room visits at 2 weeks for the intervention group was 11.4% compared to the standard of care group (15.2%) (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.39-1.23). The intervention group was significantly more satisfied with the overall care they received for breastfeeding compared to the control group (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 3.50-6.88)).This new model of care did not significantly increase exclusive breastfeeding at 12 weeks. However, there were clinically meaningful improvements in the rate of postnatal problems and satisfaction that support this new service delivery model for postpartum care. A community-based multidisciplinary postpartum clinic is feasible to implement and can provide appropriate and highly satisfactory care to mother-baby dyads. This model of care may be more beneficial in a population that is not already predisposed to breastfeed.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02043119."
https://openalex.org/W2266200420,"Background Vibrio harveyi GH20 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (VhGlcNAcase) is a chitinolytic enzyme responsible for the successive degradation of chitin fragments to GlcNAc monomers, activating the onset of the chitin catabolic cascade in marine Vibrios. Methods Two invariant acidic pairs (Asp303-Asp304 and Asp437-Glu438) of VhGlcNAcase were mutated using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy. The effects of these mutations were examined and the catalytic roles of these active-site residues were elucidated using a chemical rescue approach. Enhancement of the enzymic activity of the VhGlcNAcase mutants was evaluated by a colorimetric assay using pNP-GlcNAc as substrate. Results Substitution of Asp303, Asp304, Asp437 or Glu438 with Ala/Asn/Gln produced a dramatic loss of the GlcNAcase activity. However, the activity of the inactive D437A mutant was recovered in the presence of sodium formate. Our kinetic data suggest that formate ion plays a nucleophilic role by mimicking the β-COO-side chain of Asp437, thereby stabilizing the reaction intermediate during both the glycosylation and the deglycosylation steps. Conclusions Chemical rescue of the inactive D437A mutant of VhGlcNAcase by an added nucleophile helped to identify Asp437 as the catalytic nucleophile/base, and hence its acidic partner Glu438 as the catalytic proton donor/acceptor. General Significance Identification of the catalytic nucleophile of VhGlcNAcases supports the proposal of a substrate-assisted mechanism of GH20 GlcNAcases, requiring the catalytic pair Asp437-Glu438 for catalysis. The results suggest the mechanistic basis of the participation of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase in the chitin catabolic pathway of marine Vibrios."

These filaments undergo significant structural rearrangements during the cell cycle. We aimed at identifying key components that are involved in or regulate the transitions of the septins. By combining cell synchronization and quantitative affinity-purification mass-spectrometry, we performed a screen for specific interaction partners of the septins at three distinct stages of the cell cycle. A total of 83 interaction partners of the septins were assigned. Surprisingly, we detected DNA-interacting/nuclear proteins and proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis predominantly present in alpha-factor arrested that do not display an assembled septin structure. Furthermore, two distinct sets of regulatory proteins that are specific for cells at S-phase with a stable septin collar or at mitosis with split septin rings were identified. Complementary methods like SPLIFF and immunoprecipitation allowed us to more exactly define the spatial and temporal characteristics of selected hits of the AP-MS screen."

Consistently, people doing a task together build internal representations not only of their actions and goals, but also of the other people performing the task. However, little is known about which are the behavioral mechanisms and the psychological factors affecting the subjective sensation of synchrony, or ""connecting"" with someone else. In this work, we sought to find which factors induce the subjective sensation of synchrony, combining motion capture data and psychological measures. Our results show that the subjective sensation of synchrony is affected by performance quality together with task category, and time. Psychological factors such as empathy and negative subjective affects also correlate with the subjective sensation of synchrony. However, when people estimate synchrony as seen from a third person perspective, their psychological factors do not affect the accuracy of the estimation. We suggest that to feel this sensation it is necessary to, first, have a good joint performance and, second, to assume the existence of an attention monitoring mechanism that reports that the attention of both participants (self and other) is focused on the task."

We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the role of these mechanisms in the recent expansion of the invasive Ipomoea cairica from non-saline to salt-stressed coastal habitats. A comparison of the plant's photosynthetic traits and construction costs across habitats was conducted through a field survey. Meanwhile, a full factorial greenhouse experiment was conducted with two ecotypes (non-saline and coastal) of I. cairica and two salinity gradients (water and 4 g L-1 NaCl solution) to evaluate the roles of the two strategies by comparing their main traits. The results revealed that the construction cost and Amax of I. cairica did not change with the habitat type. The ecotype and saline treatments, however, significantly influenced the plant growth. The non-saline ecotype (NE) generally showed higher or equal plasticity of biomass-allocation and functional traits compared to the coastal ecotype (CE). However, the fitness and biomass of the NE significantly decreased with salinity, whereas those aspects of the CE did not change. Our results indicate that the recent expansion of I. cairica into coastal areas may be accelerated by the local adaptation of the CE to salt stress. Additionally, in South China, the CE will most likely evolve adaptations to both saline and non-saline environments, which will further broaden the invasion range of I. cairica in the future."

Finally, we determined spermine (SPM) sensitivity of these uncharacterized SNPs and found that Q212R-containing channels displayed reduced block by 1 μm SPM. At 100 μm SPM, the block was equal to or greater than WT, suggesting that the greater driving force of SPM allowed achievement of steady state.

https://openalex.org/W2267794112,"A prevailing neuroinflammation hypothesis is that increased production of proinflammatory cytokines contributes to progressive neuropathology, secondary to the primary damage caused by a traumatic brain injury (TBI). In support of the hypothesis, post-injury interventions that inhibit the proinflammatory cytokine surge can attenuate the progressive pathology. However, other post-injury neuroinflammatory responses are key to endogenous recovery responses. Therefore, it is critical that pharmacological attenuation of detrimental or dysregulated neuroinflammatory processes avoid pan-suppression of inflammation. MW151 is a CNS-penetrant, small molecule experimental therapeutic that restores injury- or disease-induced overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines towards homeostasis without immunosuppression. Post-injury administration of MW151 in a closed head injury model of mild TBI suppressed acute cytokine up-regulation and downstream cognitive impairment. Here, we report results from a diffuse brain injury model in mice using midline fluid percussion. Low dose (0.5–5.0 mg/kg) administration of MW151 suppresses interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels in the cortex while sparing reactive microglia and astrocyte responses. To probe molecular mechanisms, we used live cell imaging of the BV-2 microglia cell line to demonstrate that MW151 does not affect proliferation, migration, or phagocytosis of the cells. Our results provide insight into the roles of glial responses to brain injury and indicate the feasibility of using appropriate dosing for selective therapeutic modulation of injurious IL-1β increases while sparing other glial responses to injury."

A phosphoinositide 3-kinase/phospholipase Cγ1 pathway regulates fibroblast growth factor-induced capillary tube formation.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PLCγ activity is also required for the activation of cytokine-mediated Erk signaling (5.Amin A.R. Ichigotani Y. Oo M.L. Biswas M.H. Yuan H. Huang P. Mon N.N. Hamaguchi M. The PLC-PKC cascade is required for IL-1β-dependent Erk and Akt activation: their role in proliferation.Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1727-1731PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to Rac, PLCγ is also essential in NK anti-tumor cytotoxicity (7.Caraux A. Kim N. Bell S.E. Zompi S. Ranson T. Lesjean-Pottier S. Garcia-Ojeda M.E. Turner M. Colucci F. Phospholipase C-γ2 is essential for NK cell cytotoxicity and innate immunity to malignant and virally infected cells.Blood. 2006; 107: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Rac and PLCγ participate in NK cell microbial killing and where they are positioned in the signaling cascade. The microbial target, Cryptococcus neoformans is a globally endemic fungal pathogen that affects HIV-infected patients, causing ∼1 million meningitis cases annually; 600,000 of these cases result in death within 3 months of presentation to the health care system (18.Park B.J. Wannemuehler K.A. Marston B.J. Govender N. Pappas P.G. Chiller T.M. Estimation of the current global burden of cryptococcal meningitis among persons living with HIV/AIDS.AIDS. 2009; 23: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Protection against cryptococcal infection is provided by a combination of leukocytes, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T and B cells, granulocytes, and NK cells (reviewed in Ref. 19.Gibson J.F. Johnston S.A. Immunity to Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii during cryptococcosis.Fungal. Genet. Biol. 2015; 78: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The importance of NK cell activity against Cryptococcus was highlighted in murine studies, where mice with defective or depleted NK cells were susceptible to cryptococcal infection (20.Hidore M.R.

It is known that human or mouse NK cells or human NK cell lines killed Cryptococcus (1.Ma L.L. Wang C.L. Neely G.G. Epelman S. Krensky A.M. Mody C.H.

Inhibition of cytotoxic effector molecules, such as perforin, in NK cells led to a reduction in anti-cryptococcal activity (1.Ma L.L. Wang C.L. Neely G.G. Epelman S. Krensky A.M. Mody C.H. NK cells use perforin rather than granulysin for anticryptococcal activity.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3357-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These studies outline the important role of NK cells in protecting against cryptococcal infection and highlight the need to study NK cell anti-cryptococcal signaling to lay the groundwork for therapies to restore defective NK function in HIV patients (24.Li S.S.

Tumor and viral ligands activated NK cell signaling pathways with multiple points of convergence and divergence (25.Bryceson Y.T. Ljunggren H.G. Long E.O. Minimal requirement for induction of natural cytotoxicity and intersection of activation signals by inhibitory receptors.Blood. 2009; 114: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26.Kwon H.J. Kim H.S. Signaling for synergistic activation of natural killer cells.Immune. Netw. 2012; 12: 240-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, NKG2D (natural killer group 2 member D) and 2B4 are two NK cell receptors that initiated different signaling pathways: YINM or immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif signaling, respectively (25.Bryceson Y.T. Ljunggren H.G. Long E.O. Minimal requirement for induction of natural cytotoxicity and intersection of activation signals by inhibitory receptors.Blood. 2009; 114: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although two different pathways were initiated, both pathways converged into a Vav1 → PLCγ pathway that led to degranulation (25.Bryceson Y.T. Ljunggren H.G. Long E.O. Minimal requirement for induction of natural cytotoxicity and intersection of activation signals by inhibitory receptors.Blood. 2009; 114: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In cryptococcal killing, the SFK → PI3K → Erk cytotoxicity pathway has been identified (4.Wiseman J.C. Ma L.L. Marr K.J. Jones G.J. Mody C.H. Perforin-dependent cryptococcal microbicidal activity in NK cells requires PI3K-dependent ERK1/2 signaling.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27.Oykhman P.

Immun. 2013; 81: 3912-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that multiple anti-cryptococcal signaling pathways converge on to this central pathway. Because Rac and PLCγ are activated by PI3K and led to Erk signaling, convergence of Rac and PLCγ could be required for NK cryptococcal killing (5.Amin A.R. Ichigotani Y. Oo M.L. Biswas M.H. Yuan H. Huang P. Mon N.N. Hamaguchi M. The PLC-PKC cascade is required for IL-1β-dependent Erk and Akt activation: their role in proliferation.Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1727-1731PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Djeu J.Y. Jiang K. Wei S. A view to a kill: signals triggering cytotoxicity.Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 636-640PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Putney J.W. PLC-γ: an old player has a new role.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E280-E281Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rac activated PI3K in epithelial cells (28.Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Cdc42 and Rac1 induce integrin-mediated cell motility and invasiveness through PI(3)K.Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that Rac and SFK signaling converge to activate PI3K. By studying Rac and PLCγ, this study aims to elucidate the interconnections between the pathways that are activated by Cryptococcus. To examine signaling in NK cell-mediated cryptococcal killing, we used the human NK cell line, YT (29.Shirakawa F. Tanaka Y. Eto S. Suzuki H. Yodoi J. Yamashita U. Effect of interleukin 1 on the expression of interleukin 2 receptor (Tac antigen) on human natural killer cells and natural killer-like cell line (YT cells).J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 551-556PubMed Google Scholar), and primary blood-derived NK cells isolated from healthy adults. Rac activation was assessed by precipitation with the p21 binding domain (PBD) of PAK. The requirement for Rac in the anticryptococcal activity of NK cells was assessed using two independent pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA knockdown and examining cryptococcal cfu. A flow cytometric assay was used to assess conjugate formation between NK cells and Cryptococcus. To determine the proximal and distal signaling elements, the interplay between Rac, SFK, PI3K, and Erk1/2 was assessed using loss of function approaches and performing immunoblots for activation of each element. We found that NK cell mediated anti-cryptococcal cytotoxicity required both Rac- and SFK-mediated activation of PI3K → Erk signaling. Our results suggest a novel role for Rac as an upstream regulator of PI3K activity in NK cells.

Cells for flow cytometry were labeled with specific antibody for mouse anti-CD11a PE-Cy5 (BD Biosciences; catalog no. 551131). The human NK-like leukemia cell line YT (gift from C. Clayberger, Emeritus Faculty, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) was used to model human NK cells. YT cells were validated by its expression of NKp30 and NKp44 and lack of CD3. YT cells were maintained in complete medium containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen; catalog no. 11140), 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen; catalog no. 11360), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. Primary NK cells were isolated from healthy donors using a NK isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA; catalog no. 130–092-657) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated cells were routinely >92% CD56+, <0.5% CD3+. C. neoformans strain B3501 (ATCC, Manassas, VA; catalog no. 34873) and strain 145 (ATCC; catalog no. 62070) were grown to log phase in Sabouraud dextrose broth (Becton Dickinson; catalog no. 238230) on a 32 °C shaker overnight. YT cells (3 × 105 to 3 × 106) were preincubated with varying inhibitors for 1 h in 37 °C CO2 incubator. YT cells were then co-incubated with C. neoformans strain B3501 at and an effector to target (E:T) ratio of 100:1 for varying time points in a 37 °C water bath. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% NaN3. Lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase (Roche) and protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen; catalog no. NP0335BOX). After separation, the samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and revealed with indicated antibodies. Bands were recorded using ODYSSEY infrared imaging system (Licor). Densitometry was calculated by measuring the area under the intensity plot, using ImageJ (National Institute of Health; version 1.48). Fold increase in signaling compared with unstimulated was calculated as (intensity of stimulated condition normalized to loading control)/(intensity of unstimulated condition normalized to loading control) − 1. C. neoformans strain B3501 and strain 145 were grown to log phase overnight in Sabouraud dextrose broth on an orbital shaker at 32 °C. YT cells were co-cultured with the indicated strain of C. neoformans at an E:T ratio of 150:1 in round bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific; catalog no. 163320). cfu were determined at 24 and 48 h postinoculation. The anti-cryptococcal activity of primary NK cells were determined by co-culture with C. neoformans at an E:T ratio of 1000:1 in round bottom 96-well plates. cfu were determined 24 h postinoculation. In experiments where EHT 1864, Rac inhibitor II, or MBCD were used, the inhibitors were added to the YT or primary NK cells at the same time that Cryptococcus was added. In addition, an equivalent volume of sterile H2O was added to control wells to control for the highest levels of EHT1864 used, an equivalent concentration of DMSO was added to control for the highest levels of Rac inhibitor II used, and PBS was added to control for MBCD. YT cells were preincubated with varying concentrations of U73122 for 1 h, which has been shown to block lytic granule convergence in a similar NK cell line (YTS) (30.James A.M. Hsu H.T. Dongre P. Uzel G. Mace E.M. Banerjee P.P. Orange J.S. Rapid activation receptor- or IL-2-induced lytic granule convergence in human natural killer cells requires Src, but not downstream signaling.Blood. 2013; 121: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). YT cells were then washed with complete medium and incubated with Cryptococcus as described above. Primary NK cell and YT cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. The percentage of viability was calculated as (number of trypan blue positive cells)/(total number of cells) × 100%. The concentrations of inhibitors used did not affect viability of YT and primary NK cells. C. neoformans strain B3501 was labeled following the procedure for Cryptococcus gattii as described (31.Huston S.M. Li S.S. Stack D. Timm-McCann M. Jones G.J. Islam A. Berenger B.M. Xiang R.F. Colarusso P. Mody C.H. Cryptococcus gattii is killed by dendritic cells, but evades adaptive immunity by failing to induce dendritic cell maturation.J. Immunol. 2013; 191: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, C. neoformans was cultured overnight to the exponential phase of proliferation and labeled with 2.5 μg/ml of FITC per 108 cells at 22 °C for 10 min. C. neoformans was then washed three times with PBS. YT cells or primary NK cells were co-incubated with 5 μl of anti-CD11a PE-Cy5 antibody and 100 μm EHT1864 or vehicle control for 30 min in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. YT cells or primary NK cells and different amounts of Cryptococcus were incubated together for 10 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of complete medium. YT cells or primary NK cells were then agitated by pipetting. Conjugates were detected by Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer (Cytosoft version 5.3, Guava Technologies, Millipore, Danvers, MA), and the data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The percentage of NK cells in conjugates with C. neoformans were determined as follows: (number of green and red event)/(total number of red events) × 100%. For conjugate assays testing SFK, YT cells were preincubated with dasatinib for 60 min or PP2 or PP3, which served as the control for PP2 for 120 min in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. Other steps were performed the same as below. PBMC were isolated from healthy donors by Ficol-Paque gradient (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; catalog no. 17-1440-02). PBMC (2 × 106/ml) was labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester as per the manufacturer's instructions and stimulated with 5 μg/ml of phytohemeagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 1 μm, 2.5 μm U73122, or DMSO control equivalent to the highest amount of U73122 used. PBMC were allowed to proliferate for 5 days in 24-well plates in 37 °C CO2 incubator. The levels of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labeling were determined by Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer. YT cells were precultured with 10 μm EHT 1864 or 100 μm Rac inhibitor II or 50 μm Ly294002 or DMSO vehicle control for 1 h at 37 °C. YT cells were unstimulated or stimulated with C. neoformans for 4 min in a 37 °C water bath. YT cells centrifuged at 6000 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant was decanted. YT cells were then lysed and Cryptococcus was added to the unstimulated conditions to control for the additional volume of Cryptococcus in the stimulated conditions. Rac-GTP was then extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions with two modifications (Millipore; catalog no. 17-10394). Protease inhibitor (Roche) was substituted for leupeptin, and 5 μl of the PBD-conjugated magnetic beads of PAK was used. Aliquots of whole cell lysate were saved before the addition of PBD-coated beads, so that the total levels of Rac1 could be determined. Two different sequences of siRNA specific against Rac1 (UAAGGAGAUUGGUGCUGUA and AUGAAAGUGUCACGGGUAA), one of which bears no resemblance to Rac2, and one nontargeting control sequence were purchased from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of each of the siRNA sequences was performed by resuspending 3 million YT cells in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution (kit V; Amaxa, Walkersville, MD) and adding 2 μg of the corresponding siRNA. The solution was then transferred to cuvettes, and nucleofection was performed using the O-017 program. A total of 500 μl of prewarmed complete medium was added, and the cells were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 10 min. The cells were then transferred to a 6-well plate containing 5 ml of prewarmed complete medium. GraphPad Prism was used to evaluate statistics. Error bars represent the S.E. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. p < 0.05 is considered to be a statistically significant different between conditions. The percentage of reduction in conjugates compared with H2O or DMSO was analyzed by the column statistics program in GraphPad Prism. Experimental protocols were approved and performed following the guidelines from the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Calgary (protocol number REB15-0600). NK cell tumor and cryptococcal killing both depend on a PI3K → Erk signaling pathway (4.Wiseman J.C. Ma L.L. Marr K.J. Jones G.J. Mody C.H.

Jiang K. Wei S. A view to a kill: signals triggering cytotoxicity.Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 636-640PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the cytotoxicity pathway may be similar between tumor and cryptococcal killing. During tumor killing, PI3K was found to activate Rac, which then triggers Erk activity (9.Djeu J.Y. Jiang K. Wei S. A view to a kill: signals triggering cytotoxicity.Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 636-640PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, PI3K has also been shown to activate PLCγ leading to Erk signaling (32.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

To determine whether cryptococcal killing depends on Rac or PLCγ, we first investigated Rac activation in YT cells.

https://openalex.org/W2265839167,"FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2)-activated sodium channel (FaNaC) is an amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activated by endogenous tetrapeptide in invertebrates, and belongs to the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily. The ENaC/DEG superfamily differs markedly in its means of activation, such as spontaneously opening or gating by mechanical stimuli or tissue acidosis. Recently, it has been observed that a number of ENaC/DEG channels can be activated by small molecules or peptides, indicating that the ligand-gating may be an important feature of this superfamily. The peptide ligand control of the channel gating might be an ancient ligand-gating feature in this superfamily. Therefore, studying the peptide recognition of FaNaC channels would advance our understanding of the ligand-gating properties of this superfamily of ion channels. Here we demonstrate that Tyr-131, Asn-134, Asp-154, and Ile-160, located in the putative upper finger domain of Helix aspersa FaNaC (HaFaNaC) channels, are key residues for peptide recognition of this ion channel. Two HaFaNaC specific-insertion motifs among the ENaC/DEG superfamily, residing at the putative α4-α5 linker of the upper thumb domain and the α6-α7 linker of the upper knuckle domain, are also essential for the peptide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. Chemical modifications and double mutant cycle analysis further indicated that those two specific inserts and key residues in the upper finger domain together participate in peptide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. This ligand recognition site is distinct from that of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) by a longer distance between the recognition site and the channel gate, carrying useful information about the ligand gating and the evolution of the trimeric ENaC/DEG superfamily of ion channels.

For example, it is now known that ENaC, ASIC3, BASIC, and ASIC1a channels can be activated by the small molecules S3969 (5.Lu M. Echeverri F. Kalabat D. Laita B. Dahan D.S. Smith R.D. Xu H.

These new findings suggest an important small molecule or peptide ligand-gating property of this superfamily of ion channels, in addition to the subtype-specific gating mechanisms such as spontaneously opening or gating by mechanical stimuli and tissue acidosis, can play an important role in ENaC/DEG channel activation. However, the structural components underlying the ligand gating of ENaC/DEG remain largely unclear except for ASIC channels, mainly due to the high resolution structure of chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) that was determined recently. However, extensively studying gating properties of ASIC channels remains difficult because of multiple proton-binding sites located in different domains of ASIC channels (10.Jasti J. Furukawa H.

Candidate amino acids involved in H+ gating of acid-sensing ion channel 1a.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 572-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The binding sites and the number of bound-protons vary during the allosteric process (10.Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Structure of acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 Å resolution and low pH.Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Additionally, ASIC channels are polymodel receptors responding to various stimuli including acidosis, small molecules, deprivation of extracellular calcium, peptide toxin, and mechano-stimuli, making them more challenging in thoroughly understanding the channel gating of those ion channels. Belonging to the DEG/ENaC superfamily, the FaNaC channel is an FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2)-gated ion channel that was discovered in invertebrates and is activated only by peptides rather than acidosis (14.Perry S.J. Straub V.A. Schofield M.G. Burke J.F. Benjamin P.R. Neuronal expression of an FMRFamide-gated Na+ channel and its modulation by acid pH.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5559-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the deprivation of extracellular calcium (15.Green K.A. Cottrell G.A. Activity modes and modulation of the peptide-gated Na+ channel of Helix neurones.Pflugers Archiv. 2002; 443: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, the RFamide peptide ligand control of channel gating may represent an ancient ligand-gating feature in the ENaC/DEG superfamily (16.Gründer S. Assmann M. Peptide-gated ion channels and the simple nervous system of Hydra.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the FaNaC channel may be a nice simplified model for studying the ligand-gating mechanism of the ENaC/DEG superfamily, which will advance our understanding of the ligand-gating properties of this superfamily of ion channels. So far, four FaNaC genes have been identified, namely, HaFaNaC from the Helix aspersa (17.Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Cloning of the amiloride-sensitive FMRFamide peptide-gated sodium channel.Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), HtFaNaC from Helisoma trivolvis (18.Jeziorski M.C. Green K.A. Sommerville J. Cottrell G.A. Cloning and expression of a FMRFamide-gated Na+ channel from Helisoma trivolvis and comparison with the native neuronal channel.J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), LsFaNaC from Lymnaea stagnalis (14.Perry S.J. Straub V.A. Schofield M.G. Burke J.F. Benjamin P.R. Neuronal expression of an FMRFamide-gated Na+ channel and its modulation by acid pH.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5559-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and AkFaNaC from Aplysia kurodai (19.Ruben P. Johnson J.W. Thompson S. Analysis of FMRF-amide effects on Aplysia bursting neurons.J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 252-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Belkin K.J. Abrams T.W.

Molecular cloning and functional characterization of the Aplysia FMRFamide-gated Na+ channel.Pflugers Archiv. 2006; 451: 646-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). FaNaC is the first discovered peptide-gated ion channel identified in the ENaC/DEG superfamily. Cloned from the freshwater Polyp Hydra, HyNaC is another ancient peptide-gated ion channel, activated by Hydra-RFamides (22.Golubovic A. Kuhn A. Williamson M. Kalbacher H. Holstein T.W. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Gründer S. A peptide-gated ion channel from the freshwater polyp Hydra.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35098-35103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The existence of the peptide-gated channels in both mollusks and coelenterates suggests that an RFamide-gated channel already exists in a common ancestor of mollusks and coelenterates (16.Gründer S. Assmann M. Peptide-gated ion channels and the simple nervous system of Hydra.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Appearing later than FaNaC and HyNaC in evolution, ASICs are proton-gated acid-sensing ion channels found in chordata. Although ASICs cannot be directly activated by RFamide peptides, they can be regulated by them, including FMRFamide (23.Askwith C.C. Cheng C. Ikuma M. Benson C. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Neuropeptide FF and FMRFamide potentiate acid-evoked currents from sensory neurons and proton-gated DEG/ENaC channels.Neuron. 2000; 26: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of peptide-binding pockets in ASICs, by which FMRFamide interacts with and regulates proton activated currents. The close relationship among ASICs, HyNaCs, and FaNaCs suggests that ASICs may have evolved from an RFamide-gated channel (14.Perry S.J. Straub V.A. Schofield M.G. Burke J.F. Benjamin P.R. Neuronal expression of an FMRFamide-gated Na+ channel and its modulation by acid pH.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5559-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Gründer S. Assmann M. Peptide-gated ion channels and the simple nervous system of Hydra.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also been speculated that the entire superfamily of DEG/ENaC has evolved from RFamide gated ion channels (16.Gründer S. Assmann M. Peptide-gated ion channels and the simple nervous system of Hydra.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, studying the FaNaC channels may also provide insights into better understanding of the channel evolution of the ENaC/DEG superfamily. The sequence homology among ENaC/DEG subfamilies is not high, but around 15–20% (1.Kellenberger S. Schild L. Epithelial sodium channel/degenerin family of ion channels: a variety of functions for a shared structure.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar); However, the sequence identity within a subfamily is much higher, with ∼30% for both ENaC subunits and degenerins, ∼45–60% for ASICs, and ∼65% for the four FaNaC orthologues (1.Kellenberger S. Schild L. Epithelial sodium channel/degenerin family of ion channels: a variety of functions for a shared structure.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Despite the high sequence homology among the four FaNaC orthologues, they exhibit different affinities to FMRFamide. For HaFaNaC, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of FMRFamide is 2–10 μm (17.Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Cloning of the amiloride-sensitive FMRFamide peptide-gated sodium channel.Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 24.Cottrell G.A. Jeziorski M.C. Green K.A. Location of a ligand recognition site of FMRFamide-gated Na+ channels.FEBS Letters. 2001; 489: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), while for HtFaNaC the value is 70 μm (18.Jeziorski M.C. Green K.A. Sommerville J. Cottrell G.A. Cloning and expression of a FMRFamide-gated Na+ channel from Helisoma trivolvis and comparison with the native neuronal channel.J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence between residues 89 and 211, located within the extracellular domains of HaFaNaC or HtFaNaC, may be responsible for the different affinities to FMRFamide (24.Cottrell G.A. Jeziorski M.C. Green K.A. Location of a ligand recognition site of FMRFamide-gated Na+ channels.FEBS Letters. 2001; 489: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25.Cottrell G.A. Domain near TM1 influences agonist and antagonist responses of peptide-gated Na+ channels.Pflugers Archiv. 2005; 450: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although detailed structural components remain unknown. In addition, alignment of members in the superfamily revealed two specific inserts identified in FaNaC channels (Fig. 1A). Analyzing the structure of cASIC1 (Fig. 1B) suggests that insertion I is a ∼20 amino acid sequence between α4 and α5 in the thumb domain (Fig. 1, A and C, green) while insertion II is ∼50 amino acid long sequence bending over α6 and α7 in the knuckle domain (Fig. 1, A and C, orange). However, whether or not those two specific inserts are involved in the recognition of FMRFamide by HaFaNaC remains unclear. Here, in a combination of sequence alignment, mutagenesis, electrophysiological recording, Western blot, chemical modification, and double-mutant cycle analysis, we explore the peptide/ligand recognition of FaNaC channels. By comparing ligand recognition and activation mechanisms with other members of the ENaC/DEG superfamily, we aim to provide insights into small peptide-induced channel activation or small molecule-induced channel activation of some members of this superfamily, and thus aim to gain some information about the channel evolution of this superfamily. FMRFamide was synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. DTNB and DTT were purchased from Sigma; Hilymax transfection reagents were purchased from DOJINDO Laboratories; sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, NeutrAvidin agarose resin and ECL solution were all purchased from Pierce, Antibody of EE-tag was purchased from Abcam; antibody of GAPDH and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sungene. The HaFaNaC pRc/CMV was kindly gifted by Drs. Lingueglia, E. and Lazdunski, M. All the constructs had the Glu-Glu (EE) tag (GAATACATGCCAATGGAA) fused at C-terminal of the channel. Mutations were made using the QuikChange® Mutagenesis Kit following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced (by GENEWIZ, Inc.) for verification. CHO cells were cultured in F12 Nutrient Mixture (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% Glutamax (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (HyClone). Transient transfection was carried out using the Hilymax transfection reagents (DOJINDO Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each 35-mm dish, CHO cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid and 5 μl of transfection reagents. Green fluorescent protein was co-transfected in the cell as a marker with a ratio of 1:6 (GFP:FaNaC) to identify cells expressing HaFaNaC for electrophysiology experiments. All electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature 24–48 h after cells transfection as we previously described (6.Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H.

Commun. 2014; 5: 4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HaFaNaC currents were recorded with the whole cell patch-clamp method using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and DIGIDATA 1440A with Clampex 10.2 software. Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 3–5 MΩ. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 120 KCl, 30 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 EGTA, pH 7.4. The bath solution contained the following (in mm): 150 NaCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 5 KCl, and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.4. After establishment of the whole-cell configuration, currents were measured at a holding potential of −60 mV. Surface biotinylation and Western blots were performed on cultured HEK293 cells according to our previous protocols (26.Zhao W.S. Wang J. Ma X.J. Yang Y. Liu Y. Huang L.D. Fan Y.Z. Cheng X.Y.

The HEK 293 cells were transfected with 8 μg plasmids of HaFaNaC or its mutants (in pRc-CMV vector), 1.2 μg plasmid of green fluorescent protein (as a transfection marker), and 15 μl transfection reagent Hylimax. After transfected for 24–48 h, the cells were washed with chilled PBS and incubated in 2 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C in the same buffer for biotinylation of proteins on cell surface. After 30 min, 20 mm glycine was added to stop the reaction. Excessive reagents were then washed out with chilled PBS; and the cells were lysed by 200 μl RIPA buffer (containing protease inhibitors Mixture from Sigma) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. A small portion of the supernatant (28 μl added with 7 μl of 5×SDS sample buffer) was used as total protein fraction. The remaining lysate was incubated with NeutrAvidin agarose resin (Pierce) overnight in 4 °C. The resin beads were later centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and rinsed with PBS for 5 times to remove the unbound proteins. The resin-bound proteins were subsequently eluted with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer and used as the membrane fraction. The samples (boiled at 98 °C for 5 min, 15 μl per lane) and protein marker (10–170 kDa, purchased from Thermo Scientific Pierce) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (60V for 30 min and then 100 V for 90 min). The proteins were later transferred to a PVDF membrane by using Trans-Blot S.D. Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (20V for 65 min). After incubation with EE-tag antibody (1:1000; Abcam®) overnight at 4 °C and followed HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, the membrane was visualized with ECL solution (Pierce), and the signals were recorded by using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare) instrument. A homology model of HaFaNaC was created based on the cASIC1 structure (Protein Data Bank entry 2QTS, 1.9 Å) using Modeler 9.9 as previously described (26.Zhao W.S. Wang J. Ma X.J. Yang Y. Liu Y.

The sequences of HaFaNaC and cASIC1 were retrieved from the GenBankTM (GenBank ID: cASIC1, 63054900, HaFaNaC, 1149511). The alignments of the target sequences were made by Modeler 9.9 and manually adjusted to match published alignments (10.Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Structure of acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 Å resolution and low pH.Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The constructed model was checked and validated by ProCheck (29.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Data are represented as means ± S.E. Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed on at least four different cells. Statistical significance between different groups was determined using the Student's t test, where p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**) was considered significant. The data were fit to the Hill equation I/Imax = 1/[1+(EC50/[FMRFamide])nH], where I is the normalized current at a given concentration of FMRFamide, Imax is the maximum normalized current, nH is the Hill coefficient. Quantitative analyses of the Western blot results were performed by using Quantity One-4.6.2. Previous studies suggested that residues located near the first transmembrane domain (TM) and the extracellular domain, numbered 89–211, are responsible for different EC50 values of FMRFamide between HaFaNaC and HtFaNaC, although the detailed sites remain unclear (24.Cottrell G.A. Jeziorski M.C. Green K.A. Location of a ligand recognition site of FMRFamide-gated Na+ channels.FEBS Letters. 2001; 489: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25.Cottrell G.A. Domain near TM1 influences agonist and antagonist responses of peptide-gated Na+ channels.Pflugers Archiv. 2005; 450: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments and homology models of protein structures suggest that the regions exhibiting high variation in amino acid sequences participate in the formation of the finger domain (Figs. 1C and 2A, unconserved residues are highlighted in blue). Assuming that residues 89–211 contribute to the different FMRFamide affinity between HaFaNaC and HtFaNaC (24.Cottrell G.A. Jeziorski M.C. Green K.A. Location of a ligand recognition site of FMRFamide-gated Na+ channels.FEBS Letters. 2001; 489: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25.Cottrell G.A. Domain near TM1 influences agonist and antagonist responses of peptide-gated Na+ channels.Pflugers Archiv. 2005; 450: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we constructed a series of chimeras by substitution of the sequences of HaFaNaC with corresponding sequences on the HtFaNaC, resulting in 13 chimeras, namely chimera 1 (Ch1, Gln-110–Ile-116, HaFaNaC numbering, similarly hereinafter), chimera 2 (Ch2, Leu-124–Thr-126), chimera 3 (Ch3, Arg-128–Tyr-131), chimera 4 (Ch4, Phe-132–Asn-134), chimera 5 (Ch5, Ser-136–Asn-138), chimera 6 (Ch6, Leu-139–Thr141), chimera 7 (Ch7, Arg-144–Arg-150), chimera 8 (Ch8, D154QK), chimera 9 (Ch9, Asn-158–Ile-160), chimera 10 (Ch10, Gln-169–Leu-174), chimera 11 (Ch11, Asn-177–Met-183), chimera 12 (Ch12, Leu-191–Val-194) and chimera 13 (Ch13, Ser-198–Phe-200) (Fig. 2A). The wild-type (WT) HaFaNaC channel had a saturated concentration and half maximum effective concentration (EC50) for FMRFamide of ∼100 μm and ∼7 μm (EC50 = 6.46 ± 1.05 μm, n = 8, nH = 1.04 ± 0.25, Fig. 2, B and C), respectively. Accordingly, we calculated the ratio of currents (I7 μm/I100 μm) induced by 7 μm and 100 μm, to initially simplify the screening of the influence of various mutants or chimeras on the FMRFamide-apparent affinity. We then selected mutants with ratio values significantly lower than 0.5 (Fig. 2D), which reflected a significantly decreased affinity rendered by chimera mutants, for the following dose-dependent curve measurements. The chimera mutants Ch3, Ch4, Ch8, and Ch9 decreased the I7 μm/I100 μm ratio of currents (Fig. 2D), suggesting that these mutations interrupt FMRFamide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. Whereas the I7 μm/I100 μm ratios of chimera mutants Ch1, Ch2, Ch5, Ch7, Ch10, Ch11, Ch12, and Ch13 were comparable with or higher than those of the WT HaFaNaC channels. As revealed by the dose-response curves of the WT HaFaNaC channel (EC50 = 6.46 ± 1.05 μm, n = 8, nH = 1.04 ± 0.25) and those of the chimera mutants with altered I7 μm/I100 μm values, residues in Ch3 (Arg-128–Tyr-131, EC50 = 207 ± 40 μm, n = 5, nH = 1.18 ± 0.06), Ch4 (Phe-132–Asn-134, EC50 = 27.3 ± 1.7 μm, n = 4, nH = 1.15 ± 0.07), Ch8 (D154QK, EC50 = 91.7 ± 10.6 μm, n = 4, nH = 1.31 ± 0.26), and Ch9 (Asn-158–Ile-160, EC50 = 147 ± 19 μm, n = 10, nH = 1.28 ± 0.09) are essential for the peptide recognition of the HaFaNaC channel. Further studies on single amino acid substitution of Ch3, Ch4, and Ch9 revealed that the mutations Y131Q (in Ch3), N134T (in Ch4), and I160F (in Ch9) significantly decreased the FMRFamide apparent affinity, where the EC50 values of the mutants were 53.2 ± 13.9 μm (n = 6, nH = 1.39 ± 0.10), 18.5 ± 3.27 μm (n = 5, nH = 1.22 ± 0.21), and 61.8 ± 10.6 μm (n = 4, nH = 1.29 ± 0.17), respectively (Fig. 2C), suggesting the roles of those amino acids in FMRFamide recognition. Because Ch8 (D154QK) could also decrease the apparent affinity of FMRFamide by 13-fold, we examined the affinity of the single-residue mutants D154Q (23.3 ± 1.17 μm, n = 4, nH = 1.40 ± 0.10) and D154K (84.7 ± 5.4 μm, n = 4, nH = 0.92 ± 0.15). Both significantly reducing the channel apparent affinity to peptides, suggesting that Asp-154 also participates in the recognition of FMRFamide.

https://openalex.org/W2282134994,"The association between clinically diagnosed periodontitis, a common chronic oral infection, and metabolic syndrome has been previously reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of plasma IgG levels against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia, C-reactive protein, and periodontal status with metabolic syndrome. Plasma IgG levels and C-reactive protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and salivary levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among 127 individuals aged 35–76 years, 57 participants had metabolic syndrome and severe periodontitis, 25 had metabolic syndrome and an absence of severe periodontitis, 17 healthy individuals had severe periodontitis, and 28 healthy individuals were without severe periodontitis. Patients with metabolic syndrome had reduced humoral immune response to A. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.008), regardless of their salivary levels or periodontitis status compared with healthy participants. The IgG antibody response to P. gingivalis, regardless of their salivary levels or participants’ health condition, was significantly higher in severe periodontitis patients (p<0.001). Plasma IgG titers for P. intermedia were inconsistent among metabolic syndrome or periodontal participants. Our results indicate that the presence of lower levels of IgG antibodies to A. actinomycetemcomitans (OR = 0.1; 95%CI 0.0–0.7), but not P. gingivalis, a severe periodontitis status (OR = 7.8; 95%CI 1.1–57.0), high C-reactive protein levels (OR = 9.4; 95%CI 1.0–88.2) and body mass index (OR = 3.0; 95%CI 1.7–5.2), are associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. The role of the decreased IgG antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans, increased C-reactive protein levels on the association between periodontal disease and metabolic syndrome in a group of Thai patients is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2258021750,"Small-molecule thiols, such as cysteine (CYS) and glutathione (GSH), are essential for maintaining the cellular redox environment and play important roles in regulating various cellular physiological functions. A fluorescence probe (compound 1-Cu2+) for thiols based on coumarin carbohydrazide dinuclear copper complex was developed. Compound 1 was synthesized from the reaction of 7-(diethylamino)-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carbohydrazide with 4-tert-butyl-2,6- diformylphenol. Accordingly, the copper complex (compound 1-Cu2+) was prepared by mixing compound 1 with 2 equivalents copper ions. Compound 1 had strong fluorescence while compound 1-Cu2+ hardly possessed fluorescence owing to the quenching nature of paramagnetism Cu2+ to the fluorescence molecule excited state. However, the fluorescence intensity of compound 1-Cu2+ was increased dramatically after the addition of thiol-containing amino acids, but not the other non-sulfhydryl amino acids. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra indicated that compound 1-Cu2+ had good selectivity and sensitivity for thiols such as glutathione in CH3CN:H2O (3:2, v/v) PBS solution. The fluorescence imaging experiments implied that compound 1-Cu2+ has potential application in thiol-containing amino acids detection in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2262052538,"Enhancement or inhibition of cytokine signaling and corresponding immune cells responses are critical factors in various disease treatments. Cytokine signaling may be inhibited by cytokine-neutralizing antibodies (CNAs), which prevents further activation of cytokine receptors. However, CNAs may result in enhanced—instead of inhibitory—cytokine signaling (an “agonistic effect”) in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. This may lead to lack of efficacy or adverse events for cytokine-inhibiting based medicines. Alternatively, cytokine-antibody complexes may produce stronger signaling vs. cytokine alone, thereby increasing the efficacy of stimulating cytokine-based drugs, at equal or lower cytokine doses. In this paper, the effect of cytokine signaling enhancement by a CNA was studied in a generic mathematical model of interleukin-4 (IL-4) driven T-cell proliferation. The occurrence of the agonistic effect depends upon the antibody-to-cytokine binding affinity and initial concentrations of antibody and cytokine. Model predictions were in agreement with experimental studies. When the cytokine receptor consists of multiple subunits with substantially differing affinities (e.g., IL-4 case), the choice of the receptor chain to be blocked by the antibody is critical, for the agonistic effect to appear. We propose a generic mechanism for the effect: initially, binding of the CNA to the cytokine reduces free cytokine concentration; yet, cytokine molecules bound within the cytokine-CNA complex—and released later and over time—are “rescued” from earlier clearance via cellular internalization. Hence, although free cytokine-dependent signalling may be less potent initially, it will also be more sustained over time; and given non-linear dynamics, it will lead ultimately to larger cellular effector responses, vs. the same amount of free cytokine in the absence of CNA. We suggest that the proposed mechanism is a generic property of {cytokine, CNA, receptor} triads, both in vitro and in vivo, and can occur in a predictable fashion for a variety of cytokines of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2270033198,"To identify unique characteristics of recent versus established HIV infections and describe sexual transmission networks, we characterized circulating HIV-1 strains from two randomly selected populations of ART-naïve participants in rural western Kenya.Recent HIV infections were identified by the HIV-1 subtype B, E and D, immunoglobulin G capture immunoassay (IgG BED-CEIA) and BioRad avidity assays. Genotypic and phylogenetic analyses were performed on the pol gene to identify transmitted drug resistance (TDR) mutations, characterize HIV subtypes and potential transmission clusters. Factors associated with recent infection and clustering were assessed by logistic regression.Of the 320 specimens, 40 (12.5%) were concordantly identified by the two assays as recent infections. Factors independently associated with being recently infected were age ≤19 years (P = 0.001) and history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past six months (P = 0.004). HIV subtype distribution differed in recently versus chronically infected participants, with subtype A observed among 53% recent vs. 68% chronic infections (p = 0.04) and subtype D among 26% recent vs. 12% chronic infections (p = 0.012). Overall, the prevalence of primary drug resistance was 1.16%. Of the 258 sequences, 11.2% were in monophyletic clusters of between 2-4 individuals. In multivariate analysis factors associated with clustering included having recent HIV infection P = 0.043 and being from Gem region P = 0.002.Recent HIV-1 infection was more frequent among 13-19 year olds compared with older age groups, underscoring the ongoing risk and susceptibility of younger persons for acquiring HIV infection. Our findings also provide evidence of sexual networks. The association of recent infections with clustering suggests that early infections may be contributing significant proportions of onward transmission highlighting the need for early diagnosis and treatment as prevention for ongoing prevention. Larger studies are needed to better understand the structure of these networks and subsequently implement and evaluate targeted interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2253361516,"Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs), including natural lectins, are more and more considered as broad-spectrum antivirals. These molecules are able to directly inhibit many viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue Virus, Ebola Virus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus through binding to envelope protein N-glycans. In the case of HIV, it has been shown that CBAs select for mutant viruses with N-glycosylation site deletions which are more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. In this study we aimed at evaluating the HCV resistance to CBAs in vitro. HCV was cultivated in the presence of increasing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cyanovirin-N, Concanavalin-A or Griffithsin concentrations, during more than eight weeks. At the end of lectin exposure, the genome of the isolated strains was sequenced and several potential resistance mutations in the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins were identified. The effect of these mutations on viral fitness as well as on sensitivity to inhibition by lectins, soluble CD81 or the 3/11 neutralizing antibody was assessed. Surprisingly, none of these mutations, alone or in combination, conferred resistance to CBAs. In contrast, we observed that some mutants were more sensitive to 3/11 or CD81-LEL inhibition. Additionally, several mutations were identified in the Core and the non-structural proteins. Thus, our results suggest that in contrast to HIV, HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins. Further investigations are needed to completely elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2256639224,"Background The physiological demands of pregnancy on the maternal cardiovascular system can catapult women into a metabolic syndrome that predisposes to atherosclerosis in later life. We sought to identify the nature of the epigenomic changes associated with the increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in adult women following pre-eclampsia. Findings We assessed the genome wide epigenetic profile by methyl-C sequencing of monozygotic parous twin sister pairs discordant for a severe variant of pre-eclampsia. In the adult twin sisters at risk for CVD as a consequence of a complicated pregnancy, a set of 12 differentially methylated regions with at least 50% difference in methylation percentage and the same directional change was found to be shared between the affected twin sisters and significantly different compared to their unaffected monozygous sisters. Conclusion The current epigenetic marker set will permit targeted analysis of differentially methylated regions potentially related to CVD risk in large cohorts of adult women following complicated pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2269462423,"Dietary calcium (Ca) concentrations might affect regulatory pathways within the Ca and vitamin D metabolism and consequently excretory mechanisms. Considering large variations in Ca concentrations of feline diets, the physiological impact on Ca homeostasis has not been evaluated to date. In the present study, diets with increasing concentrations of dicalcium phosphate were offered to ten healthy adult cats (Ca/phosphorus (P): 6.23/6.02, 7.77/7.56, 15.0/12.7, 19.0/17.3, 22.2/19.9, 24.3/21.6 g/kg dry matter). Each feeding period was divided into a 10-day adaptation and an 8-day sampling period in order to collect urine and faeces. On the last day of each feeding period, blood samples were taken.Urinary Ca concentrations remained unaffected, but faecal Ca concentrations increased (P < 0.001) with increasing dietary Ca levels. No effect on whole and intact parathyroid hormone levels, fibroblast growth factor 23 and calcitriol concentrations in the blood of the cats were observed. However, the calcitriol precursors 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3, which are considered the most useful indicators for the vitamin D status, decreased with higher dietary Ca levels (P = 0.013 and P = 0.033). Increasing dietary levels of dicalcium phosphate revealed an acidifying effect on urinary fasting pH (6.02) and postprandial pH (6.01) (P < 0.001), possibly mediated by an increase of urinary phosphorus (P) concentrations (P < 0.001).In conclusion, calcitriol precursors were linearly affected by increasing dietary Ca concentrations. The increase in faecal Ca excretion indicates that Ca homeostasis of cats is mainly regulated in the intestine and not by the kidneys. Long-term studies should investigate the physiological relevance of the acidifying effect observed when feeding diets high in Ca and P."
https://openalex.org/W2284198291,"Multiple relationships between ubiquitin-proteasome mediated protein turnover and transcriptional activation have been well documented, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. One way to induce degradation is via ubiquitination of the N-terminal α-amino group of proteins. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator CIITA is the master regulator of MHC class II gene expression and we found earlier that CIITA is a short-lived protein. Using stable and transient transfections of different CIITA constructs into HEK-293 and HeLa cell lines, we show here that the extreme N-terminal end of CIITA isoform III induces both rapid degradation and transactivation. It is essential that this sequence resides at the N-terminal end of the protein since blocking of the N-terminal end with an epitope-tag stabilizes the protein and reduces transactivation potential. The first ten amino acids of CIITA isoform III act as a portable degron and transactivation sequence when transferred as N-terminal extension to truncated CIITA constructs and are also able to destabilize a heterologous protein. The same is observed with the N-terminal ends of several known N-terminal ubiquitination substrates, such as Id2, Cdt1 and MyoD. Arginine and proline residues within the N-terminal ends contribute to rapid turnover. The N-terminal end of CIITA isoform III is responsible for efficient in vivo recruitment to the HLA-DRA promoter and increased interaction with components of the transcription machinery, such as TBP, p300, p400/Domino, the 19S ATPase S8, and the MHC-II promoter binding complex RFX. These experiments reveal a novel function of free N-terminal ends of proteins in degradation-dependent transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2256713214,"The exon-exon junction complex (EJC) is a conserved eukaryotic multiprotein complex that examines the quality of and determines the availability of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) posttranscriptionally. Four proteins, MAGO, Y14, eIF4AIII and BTZ, function as core components of the EJC. The mechanisms of their interactions and the biological indications of these interactions are still poorly understood in plants. A new mutation, hap1-2. leads to premature pollen death and a reduced seed production in Arabidopsis. This mutation introduces a viable truncated transcript AtMagoΔC. This truncation abolishes the interaction between AtMago and AtY14 in vitro, but not the interaction between AtMago and AteIF4AIII. In addition to a strong nuclear presence of AtMago, both AtMago and AtMagoΔC exhibit processing-body (P-body) localization. This indicates that AtMagoΔC may replace AtMago in the EJC when aberrant transcripts are to be degraded. When introducing an NMD mutation, upf3-1, into the existing HAP1/hap1-2 mutant, plants showed a severely reduced fertility. However, the change of splicing pattern of a subset of SR protein transcripts is mostly correlated with the sr45-1 and upf3-1 mutations, not the hap1-2 mutation. These results imply that the C terminal domain (CTD) of AtMago is required for the AtMago-AtY14 heterodimerization during EJC assembly, UPF3-mediated NMD pathway and the AtMago-AtY14 heterodimerization work synergistically to regulate male gametophyte development in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2254303253,"Can ideology, as a widespread “expectation creator,” impact economic decisions? In two studies we investigated the influence of the Benevolent Sexism (BS) ideology (which dictates that men should provide for passive and nurtured women) on women’s economic decision-making. In Study 1, using a Dictator Game in which women decided how to share amounts of money with men, results of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model analysis show that higher endorsement of BS and contextual expectations of benevolence were associated with more very unequal offers. Similarly, in an Ultimatum Game in which women received monetary offers from men, Study 2’s Generalized Linear Mixed Model’s results revealed that BS led women to reject more very unequal offers. If women’s endorsement of BS ideology and expectations of benevolence prove contrary to reality, they may strike back at men. These findings show that BS ideology creates expectations that shape male-female relationships in a way that could be prejudicial to men."
https://openalex.org/W2336190182,"The goal of this research was to establish a new and innovative framework for cost-effectiveness modeling of HIV-1 treatment, simultaneously considering both clinical and epidemiological outcomes. EPICE-HIV is a multi-paradigm model based on a within-host micro-simulation model for the disease progression of HIV-1 infected individuals and an agent-based sexual contact network (SCN) model for the transmission of HIV-1 infection. It includes HIV-1 viral dynamics, CD4+ T cell infection rates, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics modeling. Disease progression of HIV-1 infected individuals is driven by the interdependent changes in CD4+ T cell count, changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA, accumulation of resistance mutations and adherence to treatment. The two parts of the model are joined through a per-sexual-act and viral load dependent probability of disease transmission in HIV-discordant couples. Internal validity of the disease progression part of the model is assessed and external validity is demonstrated in comparison to the outcomes observed in the STaR randomized controlled clinical trial. We found that overall adherence to treatment and the resulting pattern of treatment interruptions are key drivers of HIV-1 treatment outcomes. Our model, though largely independent of efficacy data from RCT, was accurate in producing 96-week outcomes, qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to the ones observed in the STaR trial. We demonstrate that multi-paradigm micro-simulation modeling is a promising tool to generate evidence about optimal policy strategies in HIV-1 treatment, including treatment efficacy, HIV-1 transmission, and cost-effectiveness analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2271385139,"Background In recent years large bibliographic databases have made much of the published literature of biology available for searches. However, the capabilities of the search engines integrated into these databases for text-based bibliographic searches are limited. To enable searches that deliver the results expected by comparative anatomists, an underlying logical structure known as an ontology is required. Development and Testing of the Ontology Here we present the Mammalian Feeding Muscle Ontology (MFMO), a multi-species ontology focused on anatomical structures that participate in feeding and other oral/pharyngeal behaviors. A unique feature of the MFMO is that a simple, computable, definition of each muscle, which includes its attachments and innervation, is true across mammals. This construction mirrors the logical foundation of comparative anatomy and permits searches using language familiar to biologists. Further, it provides a template for muscles that will be useful in extending any anatomy ontology. The MFMO is developed to support the Feeding Experiments End-User Database Project (FEED, https://feedexp.org/), a publicly-available, online repository for physiological data collected from in vivo studies of feeding (e.g., mastication, biting, swallowing) in mammals. Currently the MFMO is integrated into FEED and also into two literature-specific implementations of Textpresso, a text-mining system that facilitates powerful searches of a corpus of scientific publications. We evaluate the MFMO by asking questions that test the ability of the ontology to return appropriate answers (competency questions). We compare the results of queries of the MFMO to results from similar searches in PubMed and Google Scholar. Results and Significance Our tests demonstrate that the MFMO is competent to answer queries formed in the common language of comparative anatomy, but PubMed and Google Scholar are not. Overall, our results show that by incorporating anatomical ontologies into searches, an expanded and anatomically comprehensive set of results can be obtained. The broader scientific and publishing communities should consider taking up the challenge of semantically enabled search capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2276786042,"Aim For patients receiving endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), there is urgent need pertaining to the prevention of postoperative bleeding. We conducted a retrospective propensity score-matched study that evaluated whether pre-ESD gastric lavage prevents postoperative bleeding after ESD for gastric neoplasms. Methods From September 2002 to October 2015, the 760 consecutive patients receiving ESD for gastric neoplasm were enrolled and data regarding them were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional preventive treatment against delayed bleeding after ESD, including the administration of proton pump inhibitor and preventive coagulation of visible vessels, at the end of the ESD procedure. Results Pre-ESD risk factors for postoperative bleeding included tumor size and no gastric lavage. Using multivariate analysis tumor size >2.0 cm (HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.65–5.10, p = 0.0002) and no gastric lavage (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.13–9.11, p = 0.029) were found to be independent risk factors. Next, we evaluated the effect of gastric lavage on the prevention of post-ESD bleeding using a propensity score-matching method. A total of 284 subjects (142 per group) were selected. Adjusted odds ratio of gastric lavage for post-ESD bleeding was 0.25 (95% CI 0.071–0.886, p = 0.032). Conclusion Pretreatment gastric lavage reduced postoperative bleeding in patients receiving ESD for gastric neoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2295018557,"Human blood basophils have recently gained interest in addition to their function as allergic effector cells. Previous work suggests the involvement of innate immune mechanisms in the development and exacerbation of allergic responses, which might be mediated by basophils. We assayed the expression levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1, 2, 4 and 6 on purified basophils from birch pollen-, house dust mite-, and non-allergic individuals. Additionally, we compared cytokine and chemokine secretion upon TLR stimulation in these basophil donor groups. Expression of TLR4 on the basophils of the allergic donor groups was decreased and CXCL8 secretion was elevated upon stimulation of TLR1/2 and TLR2/6 compared to the non-allergic donors. Decreased TLR expression and elevated CXCL8 secretion may represent possible mechanisms for aggravation of allergic symptoms in case of parasitic infection."
https://openalex.org/W2258371767,"Web-reinforced composite sandwich panels exhibit good mechanical properties in one-way bending, but few studies have investigated their flexural behavior and deformation calculation methods under conditions of four simply supported edges. This paper studies the bending performance of and deformation calculation methods for two-way web-reinforced composite sandwich panels with different web spacing and heights. Polyurethane foam, two-way orthogonal glass-fiber woven cloth and unsaturated resin were used as raw materials in this study. Vacuum infusion molding was used to prepare an ordinary composite sandwich panel and 5 web-reinforced composite sandwich panels with different spacing and web heights. The panels were subjected to two-way panel bending tests with simple support for all four edges. The mechanical properties of these sandwich panels during the elastic stage were determined by applying uniformly distributed loads. The non-linear mechanical characteristics and failure modes were obtained under centrally concentrated loading. Finally, simulations of the sandwich panels, which used the mechanical model established herein, were used to deduce the formulae for the deflection deformation for this type of sandwich panel. The experimental results show that webs can significantly improve the limit bearing capacity and flexural rigidity of sandwich panels, with smaller web spacing producing a stronger effect. When the web spacing is 75 mm, the limit bearing capacity is 4.63 times that of an ordinary sandwich panel. The deduced deflection calculation formulae provide values that agree well with the measurements (maximum error <15%). The results that are obtained herein can provide a foundation for the structural design of this type of panel."
https://openalex.org/W2258402297,"This paper proposes SAR imaging algorithm with largest coherence based on the existing SAR imaging algorithm. The basic idea of SAR imaging algorithm in imaging processing is that output signal can have maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using the optimal imaging parameters. Traditional imaging algorithm can acquire the best focusing effect, but would bring the decoherence phenomenon in subsequent interference process. Algorithm proposed in this paper is that SAR echo adopts consistent imaging parameters in focusing processing. Although the SNR of the output signal is reduced slightly, their coherence is ensured greatly, and finally the interferogram with high quality is obtained. In this paper, two scenes of Envisat ASAR data in Zhangbei are employed to conduct experiment for this algorithm. Compared with the interferogram from the traditional algorithm, the results show that this algorithm is more suitable for SAR interferometry (InSAR) research and application."
https://openalex.org/W2256221962,"Rhinoviruses (RV) are increasingly being reported to cause mild to severe infections of respiratory tract in humans. RV are antigenically the most diverse species of the genus Enterovirus and family Picornaviridae. There are three species of RV (RV-A, -B and -C), with 80, 32 and 55 serotypes/types, respectively. Antigenic variation is the main limiting factor for development of a cross-protective vaccine against RV.Serotyping of Rhinoviruses is carried out using cross-neutralization assays in cell culture. However, these assays become laborious and time-consuming for the large number of strains. Alternatively, serotyping of RV is carried out by alignment-based phylogeny of both protein and nucleotide sequences of VP1. However, serotyping of RV based on alignment-based phylogeny is a multi-step process, which needs to be repeated every time a new isolate is sequenced. In view of the growing need for serotyping of RV, an alignment-free method based on ""return time distribution"" (RTD) of amino acid residues in VP1 protein has been developed and implemented in the form of a web server titled RV-Typer. RV-Typer accepts nucleotide or protein sequences as an input and computes return times of di-peptides (k = 2) to assign serotypes. The RV-Typer performs with 100% sensitivity and specificity. It is significantly faster than alignment-based methods. The web server is available at http://bioinfo.net.in/RV-Typer/home.html."
