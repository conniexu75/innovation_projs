https://openalex.org/W2095340306,"It has been demonstrated that dengue virus can be propagated by intracerebral inoculation in mice. Although initial adaptation to the mouse is a tedious and difficult process, 16 consecutive passages have been achieved already in one series and further passages are in progress. The virus propagated in mice produced dengue in human volunteers, but was not pathogenic for cotton rats, hamsters, guinea pigs or rabbits. Although it was evident that even after 2 serial passages in mice the virus produced a modified type of disease in human beings, tests with the 7th, 9th and 10th passage material indicated that the modification had become so marked that it could be used as a vaccine for the production of immunity against dengue."

The isolate of Beggiatoa from Bernard clay, when reinoculated into soil treatments from pure culture, significantly reduced hydrogen sulfide levels in soils and increased oxygen release from rice plants. Rice plants significantly increased Beggiatoa survival in flooded soils. Some hydrogen sulfide was necessary for survival of the Bernard clay isolate; high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide killed the Bernard clay isolate but were tolerated by a Crowley silt loam isolate from Eagle Lake, Texas. The results suggest that Beggiatoa may be an element of wetlands plant ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2017306913,"Anders and coworkers (Science, v. 190, p. 1251, 1262 (1975)) have suggested decay in situ of a volatile superheavy element 115 (or 114, 113) to explain the enrichment of heavy Xe isotopes in mineral fractions of the Allende meteorite. Manuel and Sabu attempt to show that the scenario described by Anders et al. cannot account for their experimental results, that these new data provide additional evidence in support of their own earlier suggestion that the isotopically anomalous Xe in the Allende and other carbonaceous chondrites was produced prior to incorporation into meteorite minerals, that the elemental and isotopic ratios of noble gases in these meteorite minerals contain an important record of the nuclear processes that produced the chemical elements, and that this record of element synthesis offers a possible explanation for the solar neutrino puzzle. Anders et al. respond that Manuel and Sabu have misunderstood the data (of Anders et al.). The samples were mixtures of two distinct phases, each with its own characteristic noble gas component. The correlations stressed by Manuel and Sabu would then be a trivial consequence of the fact that all the samples are mixtures of the two phases. 1 table. (RWR)"

https://openalex.org/W1971973788,A microbiological and fluorometric test for the determination of minute amounts of alloxan has been described. The test involves the conversion of the alloxan to riboflavin which is measured by microbiological or fluorometric techniques.
https://openalex.org/W2047468337,"When illuminated pea tendrils from light-grown plants are rubbed on their abaxial side, they rapidly coil in a spiral fashion. If similar tendrils are held in the dark for 3 days and then rubbed, however, they will not coil until they are subsequently illuminated. They can remain uncoiled in the dark for as long as 2 hours after stimulation, and will still coil immediately when they are illuminated. Tendrils that are rubbed and held at 25 degrees C will coil, but those treated at 5 degrees or 10 degrees C will not. However, tendrils rubbed at 25 degrees C and kept from coiling for an hour at 5 degrees C, will immediately coil when restored to the higher temperature. These observations are interpreted to imply separation of sensory and motor functions."
