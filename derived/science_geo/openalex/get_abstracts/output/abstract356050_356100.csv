https://openalex.org/W2126814743,"Background In gonochoristic vertebrates, sex determination mechanisms can be classified as genotypic (GSD) or temperature-dependent (TSD). Some cases of TSD in fish have been questioned, but the prevalent view is that TSD is very common in this group of animals, with three different response patterns to temperature. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed field and laboratory data for the 59 fish species where TSD has been explicitly or implicitly claimed so far. For each species, we compiled data on the presence or absence of sex chromosomes and determined if the sex ratio response was obtained within temperatures that the species experiences in the wild. If so, we studied whether this response was statistically significant. We found evidence that many cases of observed sex ratio shifts in response to temperature reveal thermal alterations of an otherwise predominately GSD mechanism rather than the presence of TSD. We also show that in those fish species that actually have TSD, sex ratio response to increasing temperatures invariably results in highly male-biased sex ratios, and that even small changes of just 1–2°C can significantly alter the sex ratio from 1∶1 (males∶females) up to 3∶1 in both freshwater and marine species. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that TSD in fish is far less widespread than currently believed, suggesting that TSD is clearly the exception in fish sex determination. Further, species with TSD exhibit only one general sex ratio response pattern to temperature. However, the viability of some fish populations with TSD can be compromised through alterations in their sex ratios as a response to temperature fluctuations of the magnitude predicted by climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1995649556,"In general, the definite determination of bacterial species is a tedious process and requires extensive manual labour. Novel technologies for bacterial detection and analysis can therefore help microbiologists in minimising their efforts in developing a number of microbiological applications.We present a robust, standardized procedure for automated bacterial analysis that is based on the detection of patterns of protein masses by MALDI mass spectrometry. We particularly applied the approach for classifying and identifying strains in species of the genus Erwinia. Many species of this genus are associated with disastrous plant diseases such as fire blight. Using our experimental procedure, we created a general bacterial mass spectra database that currently contains 2800 entries of bacteria of different genera. This database will be steadily expanded. To support users with a feasible analytical method, we developed and tested comprehensive software tools that are demonstrated herein. Furthermore, to gain additional analytical accuracy and reliability in the analysis we used genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms by mass spectrometry to unambiguously determine closely related strains that are difficult to distinguish by only relying on protein mass pattern detection.With the method for bacterial analysis, we could identify fire blight pathogens from a variety of biological sources. The method can be used for a number of additional bacterial genera. Moreover, the mass spectrometry approach presented allows the integration of data from different biological levels such as the genome and the proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2012470011,"PlcR is a Bacillus cereus transcriptional regulator, which activates gene expression by binding to a nucleotidic sequence called the 'PlcR box'. To build a list of all genes included in the PlcR regulon, a consensus sequence was identified by directed mutagenesis. The reference strain ATCC14579 sequenced genome was searched for occurrences of this consensus sequence to produce a virtual regulon. PlcR control of these genes was confirmed by comparing gene expression in the reference strain and its isogenic Delta-plcR strain using DNA microarrays, lacZ fusions and proteomics methods. The resulting list included 45 genes controlled by 28 PlcR boxes. Forty of the PlcR controlled proteins were exported, of which 22 were secreted in the extracellular medium and 18 were bound or attached to cell wall structures (membrane or peptidoglycan layer). The functions of these proteins were related to food supply (phospholipases, proteases, toxins), cell protection (bacteriocins, toxins, transporters, cell wall biogenesis) and environment-sensing (two-component sensors, chemotaxis proteins, GGDEF family regulators). Four genes coded for cytoplasmic regulators. The PlcR regulon appears to integrate a large range of environmental signals, including food deprivation and self cell-density, and regulate the transcription of genes designed to overcome obstacles that hinder B. cereus growth within the host: food supply, host barriers, host immune defenses, and competition with other bacterial species. PlcR appears to be a key component in the efficient adaptation of B. cereus to its host environment."
https://openalex.org/W2155942896,"Background While the relationship between average adherence to HIV potent antiretroviral therapy is well defined, the relationship between patterns of adherence within adherence strata has not been investigated. We examined medication event monitoring system (MEMS) defined adherence patterns and their relation to subsequent virologic rebound. Methods and Results We selected subjects with at least 3-months of previous virologic suppression on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen from two prospective cohorts in France and North America. We assessed the risk of virologic rebound, defined as HIV RNA of >400 copies/mL according to several MEMS adherence measurements. Seventy two subjects were studied, five of them experienced virologic rebound. Subjects with and without virologic rebound had similar baseline characteristics including treatment durations, regimen (efavirenz vs nevirapine), and dosing schedule. Each 10% increase in average adherence decreased the risk of virologic rebound (OR = 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.37, 0.81], P<0.002). Each additional consecutive day off therapy for the longest treatment interruption (OR = 1.34; 95%CI [1.15, 1.68], P<0.0001) and each additional treatment interruption for more than 2 days (OR = 1.38; 95%CI [1.13, 1.77], P<0.002) increased the risk of virologic rebound. In those with low-to-moderate adherence (i.e. <80%), treatment interruption duration (16.2 days versus 6.1 days in the control group, P<0.02), but not average adherence (53.1% vs 55.9%, respectively, P = 0.65) was significantly associated with virologic rebound. Conclusions Sustained treatment interruption may pose a greater risk of virologic rebound on NNRTI therapy than the same number of interspersed missed doses at low-to-moderate adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1967408983,"microRNAs act in a prevalent and conserved post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism that impacts development, homeostasis and disease, yet biological functions for the vast majority of miRNAs remain unknown. Given the power of invertebrate genetics to promote rapid evaluation of miRNA function, recently expanded miRNA identifications (miRBase 10.1), and the importance of assessing potential functional redundancies within and between species, we evaluated miRNA sequence relationships by 5′ end match and overall homology criteria to compile a snapshot overview of miRNA families within the C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes that includes their identified human counterparts. This compilation expands literature documentation of both the number of families and the number of family members, within and between nematode and fly models, and highlights sequences conserved between species pairs or among nematodes, flies and humans. Themes that emerge include the substantial potential for functional redundancy of miRNA sequences within species (84/139 C. elegans miRNAs and 70/152 D. melanogaster miRNAs share significant homology with other miRNAs encoded by their respective genomes), and the striking extent to which miRNAs are conserved across species—over half (73/139) C. elegans miRNAs share sequence homology with miRNAs encoded also in both fly and human genomes. This summary analysis of mature miRNA sequence relationships provides a quickly accessible resource that should facilitate functional and evolutionary analyses of miRNAs and miRNA families."
https://openalex.org/W2012633474,"Before the formation of the Central American Isthmus, there was a Central American Peninsula. Here we show that southern Central America existed as a peninsula as early as 19 Ma, based on new lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic and strontium chemostratigraphic analyses of the formations exposed along the Gaillard Cut of the Panama Canal. Land mammals found in the Miocene Cucaracha Formation have similar body sizes to conspecific taxa in North America, indicating that there existed a terrestrial connection with North America that allowed gene flow between populations during this time. How long did this peninsula last? The answer hinges on the outcome of a stratigraphic dispute: To wit, is the terrestrial Cucaracha Formation older or younger than the marine La Boca Formation? Previous stratigraphic studies of the Panama Canal Basin have suggested that the Cucaracha Formation lies stratigraphically between the shallow-marine Culebra Formation and the shallow-to-upper-bathyal La Boca Formation, the latter containing the Emperador Limestone. If the La Boca Formation is younger than the Cucaracha Formation, as many think, then the peninsula was short-lived (1–2 m.y.), having been submerged in part by the transgression represented by the overlying La Boca Formation. On the other hand, our data support the view that the La Boca Formation is older than the Cucaracha Formation. Strontium dating shows that the La Boca Formation is older (23.07 to 20.62 Ma) than both the Culebra (19.83–19.12 Ma) and Cucaracha (Hemingfordian to Barstovian North American Land Mammal Ages; 19–14 Ma) formations. The Emperador Limestone is also older (21.24–20.99 Ma) than the Culebra and Cucaracha formations. What has been called the “La Boca Formation” (with the Emperador Limestone), is re-interpreted here as being the lower part of the Culebra Formation. Our new data sets demonstrate that the main axis of the volcanic arc in southern Central America more than likely existed as a peninsula connected to northern Central America and North America for much of the Miocene, which has profound implications for our understanding of the tectonic, climatic, oceanographic and biogeographic history related to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama."
https://openalex.org/W2041244672,"Background Articular cartilage is a highly functional tissue which covers the ends of long bones and serves to ensure proper joint movement. A tissue engineering approach that recapitulates the developmental characteristics of articular cartilage can be used to examine the maturation and degeneration of cartilage and produce fully functional neotissue replacements for diseased tissue. Methodology/Principal Findings This study examined the development of articular cartilage neotissue within a self-assembling process in two phases. In the first phase, articular cartilage constructs were examined at 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days immunohistochemically, histologically, and through biochemical analysis for total collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content. Based on statistical changes in GAG and collagen levels, four time points from the first phase (7, 14, 28, and 56 days) were chosen to carry into the second phase, where the constructs were studied in terms of their mechanical characteristics, relative amounts of collagen types II and VI, and specific GAG types (chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronan). Collagen type VI was present in initial abundance and then localized to a pericellular distribution at 4 wks. N-cadherin activity also spiked at early stages of neotissue development, suggesting that self-assembly is mediated through a minimization of free energy. The percentage of collagen type II to total collagen significantly increased over time, while the proportion of collagen type VI to total collagen decreased between 1 and 2 wks. The chondroitin 6- to 4- sulfate ratio decreased steadily during construct maturation. In addition, the compressive properties reached a plateau and tensile characteristics peaked at 4 wks. Conclusions/Significance The indices of cartilage formation examined in this study suggest that tissue maturation in self-assembled articular cartilage mirrors known developmental processes for native tissue. In terms of tissue engineering, it is suggested that exogenous stimulation may be necessary after 4 wks to further augment the functionality of developing constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2003930585,"Inversion recombination elements present unique opportunities for computing and information encoding in biological systems. They provide distinct binary states that are encoded into the DNA sequence itself, allowing us to overcome limitations posed by other biological memory or logic gate systems. Further, it is in theory possible to create complex sequential logics by careful positioning of recombinase recognition sites in the sequence.In this work, we describe the design and synthesis of an inversion switch using the fim and hin inversion recombination systems to create a heritable sequential memory switch. We have integrated the two inversion systems in an overlapping manner, creating a switch that can have multiple states. The switch is capable of transitioning from state to state in a manner analogous to a finite state machine, while encoding the state information into DNA. This switch does not require protein expression to maintain its state, and ""remembers"" its state even upon cell death. We were able to demonstrate transition into three out of the five possible states showing the feasibility of such a switch.We demonstrate that a heritable memory system that encodes its state into DNA is possible, and that inversion recombination system could be a starting point for more complex memory circuits. Although the circuit did not fully behave as expected, we showed that a multi-state, temporal memory is achievable."
https://openalex.org/W1999508425,"We present a computational model for target discrimination based on intracellular recordings from neurons in the fly visual system. Determining how insects detect and track small moving features, often against cluttered moving backgrounds, is an intriguing challenge, both from a physiological and a computational perspective. Previous research has characterized higher-order neurons within the fly brain, known as ‘small target motion detectors’ (STMD), that respond robustly to moving features, even when the velocity of the target is matched to the background (i.e. with no relative motion cues). We recorded from intermediate-order neurons in the fly visual system that are well suited as a component along the target detection pathway. This full-wave rectifying, transient cell (RTC) reveals independent adaptation to luminance changes of opposite signs (suggesting separate ON and OFF channels) and fast adaptive temporal mechanisms, similar to other cell types previously described. From this physiological data we have created a numerical model for target discrimination. This model includes nonlinear filtering based on the fly optics, the photoreceptors, the 1st order interneurons (Large Monopolar Cells), and the newly derived parameters for the RTC. We show that our RTC-based target detection model is well matched to properties described for the STMDs, such as contrast sensitivity, height tuning and velocity tuning. The model output shows that the spatiotemporal profile of small targets is sufficiently rare within natural scene imagery to allow our highly nonlinear ‘matched filter’ to successfully detect most targets from the background. Importantly, this model can explain this type of feature discrimination without the need for relative motion cues."
https://openalex.org/W2069772134,"The wobble uridine in yeast cytosolic tRNALys2UUU and tRNAGlu3UUC undergoes a thio-modification at the second position (s2 modification) and a methoxycarbonylmethyl modification at the fifth position (mcm5 modification). We previously demonstrated that the cytosolic and mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly machineries termed CIA and ISC, including a cysteine desulfurase called Nfs1, were essential for the s2 modification. However, the cytosolic component that directly participates in this process remains unclear. We found that ubiquitin-like protein Urm1 and ubiquitin-activating enzyme-like protein Uba4, as well as Tuc1 and Tuc2, were strictly required for the s2 modification. The carboxyl-terminal glycine residue of Urm1 was critical for the s2 modification, indicating direct involvement of the unique ubiquitin-related system in this process. We also demonstrated that the s2 and mcm5 modifications in cytosolic tRNAs influence each other's efficiency. Taken together, our data indicate that the s2 modification of cytosolic tRNAs is a more complex process that requires additional unidentified components.

Taken together, our data indicate that the s2 modification of cytosolic tRNAs is a more complex process that requires additional unidentified components. Many modified nucleotides are found in tRNAs of various organisms, and the post-translational modification of tRNA molecules is thought to be necessary to maintain their structure and thereby to exert their proper function in translation (1Agris P.F. Vendeix F.A. Graham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In yeast, uridine of the first position of anticodon, in cytosolic tRNA (cy-tRNA), 2The abbreviations used are: cy-tRNA, cytosolic tRNA; cy-tRNALys2UUU, cytosolic tRNA for lysine; cy-tRNAGlu3UUC, cytosolic tRNA for glutamate; s2 modification, thio-modification at the second position; s2U, 2-thiouridine; mcm5 modification, 5-methoxylcarbonylmethyl modification at the fifth position; mcm5U, 5-methoxycarbonyl methyluridine; cm5U, 5-carboxymethyl uridine; Fe/S, iron-sulfur; ISC machinery, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis machinery; CIA machinery, cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery; TAP, tandem affinity purification tag; APM, [(N-acryloylamino)phenyl] mercuric chloride; U34, uridine at the first anticodon sequence in tRNA; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: cy-tRNA, cytosolic tRNA; cy-tRNALys2UUU, cytosolic tRNA for lysine; cy-tRNAGlu3UUC, cytosolic tRNA for glutamate; s2 modification, thio-modification at the second position; s2U, 2-thiouridine; mcm5 modification, 5-methoxylcarbonylmethyl modification at the fifth position; mcm5U, 5-methoxycarbonyl methyluridine; cm5U, 5-carboxymethyl uridine; Fe/S, iron-sulfur; ISC machinery, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis machinery; CIA machinery, cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery; TAP, tandem affinity purification tag; APM, [(N-acryloylamino)phenyl] mercuric chloride; U34, uridine at the first anticodon sequence in tRNA; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. for lysine (cy-tRNALys2UUU) and glutamate (cy-tRNAGlu3UUC) contains sulfur instead of oxygen at the second position (the s2 modification) and 5-methoxylcarbonylmethyl at the fifth position (the mcm5 modification). These cy-tRNAs read split codon boxes; they decode the general NAA-type codon and can wobble into the NAG codon (2Björk G.R. Huang B. Persson O.P. Byström A.S. RNA (N. Y.). 2007; 13: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the s2 and mcm5 modifications in U34 are thought to be important in maintaining stable codon-anticodon pairing during decoding of these cy-tRNAs on the ribosome.For the s2 modification of cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC, the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 located in the mitochondria was essential, indicating that a sulfur atom used for the s2 modification should originate from the cysteine sulfur atom located inside the mitochondria (3Nakai Y. Umeda N. Suzuki T. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Watanabe K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12363-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nfs1 is also known to provide sulfur for the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster biosynthesis, which involves the mitochondrial ISC and cytosolic CIA machineries (4Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs was dependent not only on Nfs1 but also on other ISC and CIA proteins such as Cfd1 (7Nakai Y. Nakai M. Lill R. Suzuki T. Hayashi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2841-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the cytosolic Fe/S cluster assembly mediated by CIA must precede Fe/S cluster biosynthesis in the mitochondria, which is mediated by ISC (8Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), our previous observation suggests that at least one cytosolic Fe/S cluster-containing protein plays an indispensable role in the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs (7Nakai Y. Nakai M. Lill R. Suzuki T. Hayashi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2841-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It may also be possible that the sulfur atom forming an Fe/S cluster may itself be directly used for the s2 modification. Besides the mitochondrial Nfs1 and Fe/S cluster assembly machineries, ISC and CIA, other cytosolic components directly involved in the s2 modification remain to be elucidated. However, for the mcm5 modification of U34 in cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC, several cytosolic proteins, including the Elongator proteins (Elp1–6) and Kti11–13 proteins, have been shown to be involved (9Huang B. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Among them, Elp3 is an Fe/S cluster-containing protein (10Paraskevopoulou C. Fairhurst S.A. Lowe D.J. Brick P. Onesti S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but its knock-out mutant was reported to retain the s2-modified uridine derivatives in their nucleoside pool (9Huang B. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).Here we identify Tuc1 (previously named Ncs6) as an indispensable factor for the s2 modification. In addition, we found that Tuc2 (previously named Ncs2), Urm1, and Uba4 were also strictly required for the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs. All of these factors are somehow genetically linked to Cla4, whose depletion causes a synthetic lethality with the tuc1 null mutation (11Goehring A.S. Mitchell D.A. Tong A.H. Keniry M.E. Boone C. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1501-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although Urm1 and Uba4 were initially identified as a ubiquitination-like protein modifier system (12Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the exact function of this system remains unclear. We propose here that a cytosolic sulfur transfer system mediated by Urm1 and Uba4 plays a key role in the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—BY4742 (MATα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0) and all gene knock-out strains were purchased from OpenBiosystems (Huntsville, AL). Cells were grown with YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or with synthetic complete media containing glucose but lacking leucine (SD-Leu) or histidine (SD-His) for plasmid maintenance. Synthetic medium supplemented with 2% galactose and 3% glycerol (SGGly-Leu or SGGly-His) was used for GAL1/10 promoter-dependent production of plasmid-borne proteins.The TUC1 gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the plasmid pESC-LEU (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), generating the plasmid pESC-Tuc1-myc, which expressed Tuc1 followed by a c-Myc epitope under the GAL1 promoter. The plasmid was introduced into Δtuc1 cells to generate the recombinant strain Δtuc1/Tuc1-myc. Cells grown on SD-Leu plates were cultivated with SGGly-Leu medium to express the recombinant protein, and recovery of the s2 modification was confirmed with the APM-Northern analysis. The TUC2 gene was also amplified by PCR and subcloned into the plasmid pESC-HIS to generate pESC-Tuc2-FLAG, generating Tuc2 followed by a FLAG epitope sequence under the GAL10 promoter. The plasmid was introduced into Δtuc2 cells to generate Δtuc2/Tuc2-FLAG cells. Cells grown on SD-His plates were cultivated with SGGly-His to express the recombinant protein, and recovery of the s2 modification was confirmed. The Tuc2-TAP strain was also purchased (Open Biosystems, the yeast TAP strains).The URM1 gene was amplified with the same 5′-primer (5′-AAGGATCCGATGGTAAACGTGAAAGTGGA-3′) and the 3′-primer designed to contain the stop codon (5′-CCGTCGACTTAACCACCATGTAATGTTGAA-3′) or the primer to construct the in-frame fusion of Urm1-myc (5′-CCGTCGACACCACCATGTAATGTTGAA-3′). Amplified fragments were subcloned into pESC-LEU to construct the pESC-Urm1 or pESC-Urm1-myc, respectively. These plasmids were then introduced into Δurm1 cells.To examine temperature-sensitive and/or caffeine-sensitive growth, each strain grown to the mid-log phase in appropriate liquid media was harvested and transferred to SD medium. After a 4-h incubation at 30 °C, each cell suspension that measured an A600 = 0.1 unit was serially diluted, spotted onto agar plates, and incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C.Gel Retardation Analysis Using APM Coupling with Northern Hybridization (APM-Northern Analysis)—The presence of thiouridine in the prepared tRNA can be verified by the retardation of electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels containing [(N-acryloylamino)phenyl] mercuric chloride (APM). Equal amounts (2 μg) of total tRNA were separated with a denaturing gel containing 7 m urea and 24 μm of APM and analyzed with a specific DNA probe against cy-tRNALys2UUU, cy-tRNAGlu3UUC, and cy-tRNAArgUCU, as shown previously (3Nakai Y. Umeda N. Suzuki T. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Watanabe K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12363-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The relative proportion of the s2 modification in each tRNA was determined with three independent experiments as described previously (7Nakai Y. Nakai M. Lill R. Suzuki T. Hayashi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2841-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Detection of the Adenylated Intermediate of Tuc1—The TUC1 gene was inserted into pET28a (Novagen) and used to express a His6-Tuc1 protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)Star (Invitrogen). E. coli soluble cell extracts containing His6-Tuc1 were incubated with a mixture of 4 μg of tRNA prepared from Δtuc1 cells at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl reaction mixture with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm KCl, 12 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm of [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (∼300 Ci/mmol, BD Biosciences). After quenching the reaction by adding 90 μl of 5% formic acid, tRNA was extracted and precipitated and then subjected to PAGE under denaturing conditions. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and also exposed on an imaging plate to visualize the radioactivity using the BAS2500 system (FujiFilm).Sulfur Incorporation into the Recombinant Uba4 Protein in Vitro—URM1 and UBA4 genes were cloned into pACYC-Duet1 (Novagen) to express Urm1 and Uba4 with a carboxyl-terminal S-tag (Uba4-S-tag either separately or simultaneously). Expression of the recombinant proteins in BL21(DE3)Star (Stratagene) cells was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. When grown to A600 = 0.5, E. coli cells were collected and resuspended in Luria Bertani medium containing half-concentration of salts, followed by further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml blasticidin-S HCl (Invitrogen). The cells were then collected and suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 0.1% Triton X-100. After disruption by freeze-thawing, cells were incubated with l-[35S]cysteine (1075 Ci/mmol, Tokyo Medical CRO, Japan) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were spun down, and then the supernatants were subjected to acrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. 35S-Labeled protein bands were detected by contacting the gel to the imaging plate and analyzed with BAS2500 (FujiFilm).HPLC Analysis of the Total tRNA Nucleoside—Total tRNAs prepared were digested with 4 units of ribonuclease P1 (Yuasa Shou Co., Ltd.) in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) for 1 h. After addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 100 mm, the resulting nucleosides were then precipitated with 2-propanol. The total nucleosides suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl were loaded onto a chromatography column (COS-MOSIL 5C18 column, 4.5 mm × 25 cm, Nakalai Tesque, Japan) and developed with a gradient of 25 mm sodium acetate and 50% acetonitrile as described previously (1Agris P.F. Vendeix F.A. Graham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The eluted nucleosides were monitored at 256 nm.Gel Filtration Chromatography with Yeast Cytosol Coupling Immunological Detection of Proteins—Cytosolic fractions were prepared from TAP-Tuc1 and TAP-Tuc2 cells that expressed Tuc1 and Tuc2 proteins with TAP tags at their carboxyl termini, as described previously. They were fractionated using Superdex-200 gel filtration column chromatography using SMART System (GE Healthcare) with a running buffer of 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5). Aliquots of each fraction were separated using electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting with an anti-TAP antibody (Open Biosystems) and an anti-Urm1 antibody (Invitrogen).RESULTSTuc1 and Tuc2 as Well as Urm1 and Uba4 Are Strictly Required for the s2 Modification of cy-tRNAs—During a search for possible cytosolic proteins that are directly involved in the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs, we noticed that Ncs6 (YGL211W gene product, now termed Tuc1), which is likely to be a cytosolic protein, contained a PP-loop-type ATPase domain as well as some conserved cysteine residue-containing domains. Because proteins containing this domain arrangement have been shown to be involved in some kinds of tRNA modifications (13Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and because Cfd1 and Nbp35, which participate in both the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs and the cytosolic Fe/S cluster assembly, also possess the P-loop motif and can transfer certain sulfur-containing compounds, we regarded Tuc1 (Ncs6) as a likely candidate that could be directly involved in the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs. The s2 modification of total tRNAs prepared from Δtuc1 cells was examined to observe the retardation of tRNA during migration in the APM-containing gel (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We analyzed three cytosolic tRNAs as follows: cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC undergo s2 modification in addition to mcm5 modification, whereas cy-tRNAArgUCU undergoes only mcm5 modification. As shown in Fig. 1, the migration of cy-tRNAArgUCU was not altered in either wild-type BY4742 or Δtuc1 cells. In contrast, the migration of cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC prepared from wild-type cells was significantly retarded as compared with those prepared from Δtuc1 cells, the latter of which corresponded well to the migration of cy-tRNAArgUCU. These data indicate that the s2 modification of both cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC was severely impaired in Δtuc1 cells.Tuc1 was originally designated Ncs6 (need Cla4 to survive 6) because depletion of Tuc1 causes a synthetic lethality in a Δcla4 strain (11Goehring A.S. Mitchell D.A. Tong A.H. Keniry M.E. Boone C. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1501-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cla4 is known as a Ste20-like protein kinase involved in signal transduction and whose deletion exhibits multiple defects (14Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). NCS2 (now termed TUC2), URM1, and UBA4 genes were also demonstrated to be essential in a Δcla4 strain, but their exact functions still remain unclear (15Goehring A.S. Rivers D.M. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4329-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether deletion of TUC2, URM1, or UBA4 causes any defect in the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs. As shown in Fig. 1, we observed that the s2 modification of both cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC was almost completely impaired in Δtuc2, Δurm1, or Δuba4 cells. However, in contrast to these stains, Δcla4 did not exhibit any such defects in the s2 modification of both cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC, indicating that Tuc2, Urm1, and Uba4, but not Cla4, are necessary for the s2 modification of cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC. To know whether these novel factors involved in the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs form a complex in the cytosol, we performed gel filtration chromatography of cytosolic fractions prepared from yeast cells expressing Tuc1-TAP and Tuc2-TAP proteins followed by Western analysis using an anti-TAP tag and anti-Urm1 antibodies (Fig. 2A). Note that expression of these tagged proteins in the respective deletion strains was able to restore the cytosolic s2 modification (data not shown), indicating that they are functional. Although the calculated molecular mass of Tuc1-TAP protein is 60,523 Da, the protein was eluted as a large molecular weight complex (>250 kDa) (fraction 4 in Fig. 2A). However, Tuc2-TAP, whose calculated molecular mass is 77,008 Da, eluted at ∼140 kDa, which most likely corresponds to a homodimer (fraction 6 in Fig. 2A). Urm1 protein was eluted at ∼24 kDa, which was also most likely a homodimer. Taken together, Urm1, Tuc1, and Tuc2 exist as distinct entities in the yeast cytosol.FIGURE 2Characterization of Tuc1, Tuc2, and Urm1 proteins. A, size-exclusion chromatography of the yeast cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic fraction of cells expressing either Tuc1-TAP or Tuc2-TAP protein was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography using Superdex-200. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to the immunological detection with anti-TAP (for Tuc1-TAP and Tuc2-TAP proteins) and anti-Urm1 antibodies. B, formation of adenylated tRNA in the presence of recombinant Tuc1. Each sample contains 4 μg of total tRNA prepared from Δtuc1 yeast cells and extracts (1 mg of protein) of E. coli cells with (+) or without (–) expressed His6-Tuc1 protein. They were incubated with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP (top panels), and labeled tRNAs were separated by electrophoresis with 7 m urea-containing acrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. The tRNA samples loaded onto the gel were also blotted onto a nylon membrane and visualized by UV illumination (bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tuc1 Belongs to the Family of PP-loop Type ATPases and Can Catalyze Adenylation of tRNAs—MnmA, a PP-loop ATPase required for the s2 modification of U34 in E. coli tRNAs, exhibits pyrophosphatase activity in vitro, and it can activate U34 by adenylation just prior to sulfur incorporation (16Numata T. Ikeuchi Y. Fukai S. Suzuki T. Nureki O. Nature. 2006; 442: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Tuc1 is also characterized as a PP-loop ATPase, whereas the unique cysteine motif that is lacking in MnmA protein exists at the amino-terminal region of Tuc1 (2Björk G.R. Huang B. Persson O.P. Byström A.S. RNA (N. Y.). 2007; 13: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Tuc1 possesses similar adenylation activity. When the non-s2 modified tRNAs prepared from Δtuc1 cells were incubated with E. coli extracts containing His6-Tuc1 protein in the presence of [α-32P]ATP, radiolabeled tRNAs were seen. However, when [γ-32P]ATP was used, no such radiolabeled species were detected (Fig. 2B). Therefore, like MnmA in E. coli, yeast Tuc1 can form an adenylated tRNA intermediate that is likely required for the s2 modification of yeast cy-tRNAs.Carboxyl-terminal Glycine of Urm1 Is Important for the s2 Modification of cy-tRNAs—Urm1 and Uba4 were initially identified as a novel protein conjugation system, where Urm1 acts as a ubiquitin-related modifier, and Uba4 functions as a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)-like protein (12Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Later it was proposed that this protein conjugation system be termed urmylation, although the target proteins that undergo urmylation remain unclear (15Goehring A.S. Rivers D.M. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4329-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In parallel with the ubiquitin system, Urm1 forms a thioester with Uba4 between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Urm1 and the active cysteine of Uba4 (12Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To examine whether the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Urm1 is also required for the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs, a mutant form of Urm1 whose carboxyl-terminal glycine was masked by the Myc tag (Urm1-myc) of 14 amino acids was expressed in Δurm1 cells under the control of the GAL10 promoter. Although s2 modification of cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC in Δurm1 cells was fully recovered by expressing the wild-type Urm1, no such recovery was observed when Urm1-myc was expressed (Fig. 3A). Western analysis confirmed that expression levels of Urm1 and Urm1-myc in Δurm1 cells were not different from each other (Fig. 3B). From these data, we concluded that the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Urm1 is essential for the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs and that this unique ubiquitin-related system involving Urm1 and Uba4 plays a critical role in the s2 modification.FIGURE 3Complementation analysis of the s2 modification in Δurm1 cells by expressing Urm1 with or without carboxyl-terminal Myc tag. A, total tRNA prepared either from the Δurm1/Urm1 or Δurm1/Urm1-myc cells grown under the GAL1/10 promoter-induced (+) or -repressed (–) conditions were examined for the s2 modification of cy-tRNALys2UUU (cy-K) and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC (cy-E). Parenthesis and an arrowhead indicate corresponding tRNAs with and without s2 modification. Proportions of the s2-modified tRNAs are shown as bar graphs presenting the average values obtained from three independent experiments, with error bars indicating the ranges of the values (lower panel). B, expression of Urm1 and Urm1-myc in Δurm1 cells used in A was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-Urm1 and anti-Myc antibodies. Whole cell extracts were prepared from transformed yeast cells grown under the GAL1/10 promoter-induced (+) or -repressed (–) conditions. Note that the URM1 and URM1-MYC genes were placed under the GAL1/10 promoter and transformed into in Δurm1 cells so that no band was detected with either antibody in the extracts prepared from cells grown under the GAL1/10 promoter-repressed conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Uba4 Can Bind the Cysteine-derived Sulfur with the Aid of Urm1—In bacteria, sulfur that is incorporated into thiamine is derived from l-cysteine, and this sulfur incorporation reaction is known to be catalyzed, at least in part, by ThiS and ThiF, both of which were demonstrated to bind cysteine-derived sulfur (17Lehmann C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Urm1 and Uba4 show significant sequence similarities to ThiS and ThiF, respectively. We therefore asked if Urm1 and/or Uba4 can bind cysteine-derived sulfur. To achieve this, Urm1 and Uba4 (with S-tag) proteins were expressed in E. coli cells either separately or simultaneously (Fig. 4A). After de novo protein synthesis was blocked by blasticidin-S, cell extracts were incubated with [35S]cysteine. As shown in Fig. 4B, the 57-kDa Uba4-S-tag protein was found to bind the cysteine-derived 35S label only in the presence of co-expressed Urm1. These data suggest that Uba4 might function as a sulfur carrier protein required for the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs. Although Furukawa et al. (12Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) previously identified a significant amount of Urm1-Uba4 conjugate when tagged versions of both proteins were overexpressed in yeast cells, no such Urm1-Uba4 conjugate was detected in E. coli cell extracts when both proteins were expressed at high levels (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Sulfur incorporation into recombinant Uba4 in the presence of Urm1. A, expression of Urm1 and Uba4-Stag in E. coli cells was confirmed by Western analysis using an anti-Urm1 antibody and S-protein-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, respectively. Whole cell extracts were prepared from E. coli cells that expressed (+) or did not express (–) Urm1 and/or Uba4-Stag protein(s). B, whole cell extracts prepared as described in A were incubated with l-[35S]cysteine and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. After electrophoresis, 35S-labeled protein bands were detected by autoradiography. An arrowhead indicates the position of 35S-labeled Uba4-Stag.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)mcm5 Modification of U34 Influences the Efficiency of s2 Modification of cy-tRNAs—As described above, U34 of cy-tRNALys2UUU and cy-tRNAGlu3UUC undergoes both mcm5 and s2 modifications. Trm9 is a methyltransferase for the mcm5 modification (18Kalhor H.R. Clarke S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9283-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and both Kti11 and Elp3 are involved in the early steps of this modification (9Huang B. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19Esberg A. Huang B. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In Δkti11, Δelp3, and Δtrm9 cells, the mcm5 modification of cy-tRNA was almost completely inhibited (9Huang B. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19Esberg A. Huang B. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In those mutants, although the s2 modification of cy-tRNAs was reported to occur, the impact on the efficiency of s2 modification was not investigated. As shown in Fig. 1, the s2 modification was significantly, but not totally, inhibited in Δkti11, Δelp3, and Δtrm9 mutants, suggesting that impairment of mcm5 modification has some inhibitory effects on the s2 modification in cy-tRNAs. In contrast, to examine the impact on efficiency of mcm5 modification by eliminating the s2 modification in cy-tRNAs, we compared HPLC elution profiles of nucleosides of bulk tRNA prepared from the wild-type, Δelp3, Δtuc1, and Δtuc2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, we observed a common major nucleoside peak in Δelp3, Δtuc1, and Δtuc2 samples but not with the wild-type sample. The nucleoside was purified, and its molecular mass was determined to be 302.03, which shows good agreement with that of 5-carboxymethyluridine (cm5U) (302.24), a premature form of mcm5U (Fig. 5B). This may indicate that impairment of s2 modification also affects the efficiency of methylation of cm5U34.FIGURE 5Elution profiles of total tRNA nucleosides separated by HPLC and mass determination of cm5U.

https://openalex.org/W2042010436,"HIV prevalence is rising, especially among high risk females in Tijuana, Baja California, a Mexico-US border city situated on major migration and drug trafficking routes. We compared factors associated with HIV infection among male and female injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana in an effort to inform HIV prevention and treatment programs. IDUs aged > or = 18 years were recruited using respondent-driven sampling and underwent testing for HIV, syphilis and structured interviews. Logistic regression identified correlates of HIV infection, stratified by gender. Among 1056 IDUs, most were Mexican-born but 67% were born outside Tijuana. Reasons for moving to Tijuana included deportation from the US (56% for males, 29% for females), and looking for work/better life (34% for females, 15% for males). HIV prevalence was higher in females versus males (10.2% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.001). Among females (N = 158), factors independently associated with higher HIV prevalence included younger age, lifetime syphilis infection and living in Tijuana for longer durations. Among males (N = 898), factors independently associated with higher HIV prevalence were syphilis titers consistent with active infection, being arrested for having 'track-marks', having larger numbers of recent injection partners and living in Tijuana for shorter durations. An interaction between gender and number of years lived in Tijuana regressed on HIV infection was significant (p = 0.03). Upon further analysis, deportation from the U.S. explained the association between shorter duration lived in Tijuana and HIV infection among males; odds of HIV infection were four-fold higher among male injectors deported from the US, compared to other males, adjusting for all other significant correlates (p = 0.002). Geographic mobility has a profound influence on Tijuana's evolving HIV epidemic, and its impact is significantly modified by gender. Future studies are needed to elucidate the context of mobility and HIV acquisition in this region, and whether US immigration policies adversely affect HIV risk."

Yet, the majority of genetically modified (GM) lines are maintained on this genetic background.Reported here is the development of an easily implemented method that consistently yields fertilization rates of 70+/-5% with this strain. This six-fold increase is achieved by collecting sperm from the vas deferens and epididymis into a cryoprotective medium of 18% raffinose (w/v), 3% skim milk (w/v) and 477 microM monothioglycerol. The sperm suspension is loaded into 0.25 mL French straws and cooled at 37+/-1 degrees C/min before being plunged and then stored in LN(2). Subsequent to storage, the sperm are warmed at 2,232+/-162 degrees C/min and incubated in in vitro fertilization media for an hour prior to the addition of oocyte cumulus masses from superovulated females. Sperm from 735 GM mouse lines on 12 common genetic backgrounds including C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, 129S1/SvImJ, FVB/NJ and NOD/ShiLtJ were cryopreserved and recovered. C57BL/6J and BALB/cByJ fertilization rates, using frozen sperm, were slightly reduced compared to rates involving fresh sperm; fertilization rates using fresh or frozen sperm were equivalent in all other lines. Developmental capacity of embryos produced using cryopreserved sperm was equivalent, or superior to, cryopreserved IVF-derived embryos.Combined, these results demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach as an economical and efficient option for archiving and distributing mice."
https://openalex.org/W2000003193,"The development of personalized medicine is a primary objective of the medical community and increasingly also of funding and registration agencies. Modeling is generally perceived as a key enabling tool to target this goal. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) have previously been used to simulate inflammation at various scales up to the whole-organism level. We extended this approach to the case of a novel, patient-specific ABM that we generated for vocal fold inflammation, with the ultimate goal of identifying individually optimized treatments. ABM simulations reproduced trajectories of inflammatory mediators in laryngeal secretions of individuals subjected to experimental phonotrauma up to 4 hrs post-injury, and predicted the levels of inflammatory mediators 24 hrs post-injury. Subject-specific simulations also predicted different outcomes from behavioral treatment regimens to which subjects had not been exposed. We propose that this translational application of computational modeling could be used to design patient-specific therapies for the larynx, and will serve as a paradigm for future extension to other clinical domains."
https://openalex.org/W2041916713,"A scanning electron microscope survey was initiated to determine if the previously reported findings of ""dinosaurian soft tissues"" could be identified in situ within the bones. The results obtained allowed a reinterpretation of the formation and preservation of several types of these ""tissues"" and their content. Mineralized and non-mineralized coatings were found extensively in the porous trabecular bone of a variety of dinosaur and mammal species across time. They represent bacterial biofilms common throughout nature. Biofilms form endocasts and once dissolved out of the bone, mimic real blood vessels and osteocytes. Bridged trails observed in biofilms indicate that a previously viscous film was populated with swimming bacteria. Carbon dating of the film points to its relatively modern origin. A comparison of infrared spectra of modern biofilms with modern collagen and fossil bone coatings suggests that modern biofilms share a closer molecular make-up than modern collagen to the coatings from fossil bones. Blood cell size iron-oxygen spheres found in the vessels were identified as an oxidized form of formerly pyritic framboids. Our observations appeal to a more conservative explanation for the structures found preserved in fossil bone."
https://openalex.org/W2052727753,"Moderate heat stress (40 degrees C for 30 min) on spinach thylakoid membranes induced cleavage of the reaction center-binding D1 protein of photosystem II, aggregation of the D1 protein with the neighboring polypeptides D2 and CP43, and release of three extrinsic proteins, PsbO, -P, and -Q. These heat-induced events were suppressed under anaerobic conditions or by the addition of sodium ascorbate, a general scavenger of reactive oxygen species. In accordance with this, singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals were detected in spinach photosystem II membranes incubated at 40 degrees C for 30 min with electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping spectroscopy. The moderate heat stress also induced significant lipid peroxidation under aerobic conditions. We suggest that the reactive oxygen species are generated by heat-induced inactivation of a water-oxidizing manganese complex and through lipid peroxidation. Although occurring in the dark, the damages caused by the moderate heat stress to photosystem II are quite similar to those induced by excessive illumination where reactive oxygen species are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2129446814,"The felid family consists of two major subgroups, the sabretoothed and the feline cats, to which all extant species belong, and are the most anatomically derived of all carnivores for predation on large prey with a precision killing bite. There has been much controversy and uncertainty about why the skulls and mandibles of sabretoothed and feline cats evolved to become so anatomically divergent, but previous models have focused on single characters and no unifying hypothesis of evolutionary shape changes has been formulated. Here I show that the shape of the skull and mandible in derived sabrecats occupy entirely different positions within overall morphospace from feline cats, and that the evolution of skull and mandible shape has followed very different paths in the two subgroups. When normalised for body-size differences, evolution of bite forces differ markedly in the two groups, and are much lower in derived sabrecats, and they show a significant relationship with size and cranial shape, whereas no such relationship is present in feline cats. Evolution of skull and mandible shape in modern cats has been governed by the need for uniform powerful biting irrespective of body size, whereas in sabrecats, shape evolution was governed by selective pressures for efficient predation with hypertrophied upper canines at high gape angles, and bite forces were secondary and became progressively weaker during sabrecat evolution. The current study emphasises combinations of new techniques for morphological shape analysis and biomechanical studies to formulate evolutionary hypotheses for difficult groups."
https://openalex.org/W1995655096,"Background Streptococcus iniae is a significant pathogen in finfish aquaculture, though knowledge of virulence determinants is lacking. Through pyrosequencing of the S. iniae genome we have identified two gene homologues to classical surface-anchored streptococcal virulence factors: M-like protein (simA) and C5a peptidase (scpI). Methodology/Principal Findings S. iniae possesses a Mga-like locus containing simA and a divergently transcribed putative mga-like regulatory gene, mgx. In contrast to the Mga locus of group A Streptococcus (GAS, S. pyogenes), scpI is located distally in the chromosome. Comparative sequence analysis of the Mgx locus revealed only one significant variant, a strain with an insertion frameshift mutation in simA and a deletion mutation in a region downstream of mgx, generating an ORF which may encode a second putative mga-like gene, mgx2. Allelic exchange mutagenesis of simA and scpI was employed to investigate the potential role of these genes in S. iniae virulence. Our hybrid striped bass (HSB) and zebrafish models of infection revealed that M-like protein contributes significantly to S. iniae pathogenesis whereas C5a peptidase-like protein does not. Further, in vitro cell-based analyses indicate that SiMA, like other M family proteins, contributes to cellular adherence and invasion and provides resistance to phagocytic killing. Attenuation in our virulence models was also observed in the S. iniae isolate possessing a natural simA mutation. Vaccination of HSB with the ΔsimA mutant provided 100% protection against subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of wild-type (WT) S. iniae after 1,400 degree days, and shows promise as a target for live attenuated vaccine development. Conclusions/Significance Analysis of M-like protein and C5a peptidase through allelic replacement revealed that M-like protein plays a significant role in S. iniae virulence, and the Mga-like locus, which may regulate expression of this gene, has an unusual arrangement. The M-like protein mutant created in this research holds promise as live-attenuated vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2035095433,"Transcripts expressed in eukaryotes are classified as poly A+ transcripts or poly A- transcripts based on the presence or absence of the 3' poly A tail. Most transcripts identified so far are poly A+ transcripts, whereas the poly A- transcripts remain largely unknown.We developed the TRD (Total RNA Detection) system for transcript identification. The system detects the transcripts through the following steps: 1) depleting the abundant ribosomal and small-size transcripts; 2) synthesizing cDNA without regard to the status of the 3' poly A tail; 3) applying the 454 sequencing technology for massive 3' EST collection from the cDNA; and 4) determining the genome origins of the detected transcripts by mapping the sequences to the human genome reference sequences. Using this system, we characterized the cytoplasmic transcripts from HeLa cells. Of the 13,467 distinct 3' ESTs analyzed, 24% are poly A-, 36% are poly A+, and 40% are bimorphic with poly A+ features but without the 3' poly A tail. Most of the poly A- 3' ESTs do not match known transcript sequences; they have a similar distribution pattern in the genome as the poly A+ and bimorphic 3' ESTs, and their mapped intergenic regions are evolutionarily conserved. Experiments confirmed the authenticity of the detected poly A- transcripts.Our study provides the first large-scale sequence evidence for the presence of poly A- transcripts in eukaryotes. The abundance of the poly A- transcripts highlights the need for comprehensive identification of these transcripts for decoding the transcriptome, annotating the genome and studying biological relevance of the poly A- transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W2170064171,"Progesterone plays a role in breast cancer development and progression but the effects on breast cancer cell movement or invasion have not been fully explored. In this study, we investigate the actions of natural progesterone and of the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on actin cytoskeleton remodeling and on breast cancer cell movement and invasion. In particular, we characterize the nongenomic signaling cascades implicated in these actions. T47-D breast cancer cells display enhanced horizontal migration and invasion of three-dimensional matrices in the presence of both progestins. Exposure to the hormones triggers a rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of membrane ruffles required for cell movement, which are dependent on the rapid phosphorylation of the actin-regulatory protein moesin. The extra-cellular small GTPase RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK-2) cascade plays central role in progesterone- and MPA-induced moesin activation, cell migration and invasion. In the presence of progesterone, progesterone receptor A (PRA) interacts with the G protein G alpha(13), while MPA drives PR to interact with tyrosine kinase c-Src and to activate phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, leading to the activation of RhoA/ROCK-2. In conclusion, our findings manifest that progesterone and MPA promote breast cancer cell movement via rapid actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which are mediated by moesin activation. These events are triggered by RhoA/ROCK-2 cascade through partially differing pathways by the two compounds. These results provide original mechanistic explanations for the effects of progestins on breast cancer progression and highlight potential targets to treat endocrine-sensitive breast cancers."

In Treg-attenuated, BCG-immunized mice, which were then infected with M. tuberculosis, the lung mycobacterial load was significantly, albeit moderately, reduced compared to the control mice.Our results provide the first demonstration that attenuation of Treg subset concomitant to BCG vaccination has a positive, yet limited, impact on the protective capacity of this vaccine against infection with M. tuberculosis. Thus, for rational design of improved BCG, it should be considered that, although the action of Treg does not represent the major cause of the limited efficiency of BCG, the impact of this cell population on the subsequent control of M. tuberculosis growth is significant and measurable."
https://openalex.org/W1974943937,"Albumin, an abundant plasma protein with multifunctional properties, is mainly synthesized in the liver. Albumin has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) since it can bind to and transport amyloid beta (Aβ), the causative agent of AD; albumin is also a potent inhibitor of Aβ polymerization. Despite evidence of non-hepatic transcription of albumin in many tissues including kidney and pancreas, non-hepatic synthesis of albumin at the protein level has been rarely confirmed. In a pilot phase study of Human Brain Proteome Project, we found evidence that microglial cells in brain may synthesize albumin. Here we report, for the first time, the de novo synthesis of albumin in human microglial cells in brain. Furtherore, we demonstrate that the synthesis and secretion of albumin from microglial cells is enhanced upon microgial activation by Aβ1–42- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treatment. These data indicate that microglial cells may play a beneficial role in AD by secreting albumin that not only inhibits Aβ polymerization but also increases its clearance."

In an earlier study, we found that serotonin (5-HT), acting through the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, promotes axonal transport of mitochondria in cultured hippocampal neurons by increasing Akt activity, and consequently decreasing glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) activity. This finding suggests a critical role for neuromodulators in the regulation of mitochondrial trafficking in neurons. In the present study, we investigate the effects of a second important neuromodulator, dopamine, on mitochondrial transport in hippocampal neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that dopamine, like 5-HT, regulates mitochondrial motility in cultured hippocampal neurons through the Akt-GSK3β signaling cascade. But, in contrast to the stimulatory effect of 5-HT, administration of exogenous dopamine or bromocriptine, a dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) agonist, caused an inhibition of mitochondrial movement. Moreover, pretreatment with bromocriptine blocked the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on mitochondrial movement. Conversely, in cells pretreated with 5-HT, no further increases in movement were observed after administration of haloperidol, a D2R antagonist. In contrast to the effect of the D2R agonist, addition of SKF38393, a dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) agonist, promoted mitochondrial transport, indicating that the inhibitory effect of dopamine was actually the net summation of opposing influences of the two receptor subtypes. The most pronounced effect of dopamine signals was on mitochondria that were already moving directionally. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with either a D2R agonist or a D1R antagonist decreased Akt activity, and conversely, treatment with either a D2R antagonist or a D1R agonist increased Akt activity. Conclusions/Significance Our observations strongly suggest a role for both dopamine and 5-HT in regulating mitochondrial movement, and indicate that the integrated effects of these two neuromodulators may be important in determining the distribution of energy sources in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2054858709,"The rat is a reference animal model for physiological studies and for the analysis of multigenic human diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, neurological disorders, and cancer. The rats have long been used in extensive chemical carcinogenesis studies. Thus, the rat embryonic stem (rES) cell is an important resource for the study of disease models. Attempts to derive ES cells from various mammals, including the rat, have not succeeded. Here we have established two independent rES cells from Wister rat blastocysts that have undifferentiated characters such as Nanog and Oct3/4 genes expression and they have stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA) -1, -3, -4, and TRA-1-81 expression. The cells were successfully cultured in an undifferentiated state and can be possible over 18 passages with maintaining more than 40% of normal karyotype. Their pluripotent potential was confirmed by the differentiation into derivatives of the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Most importantly, the rES cells are capable of producing chimera rats. Therefore, we established pluripotent rES cell lines that are widely used to produce genetically modified experimental rats for study of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2159645918,"One of the most common questions addressed by ecologists over the past decade has been--how does species richness impact the production of community biomass? Recent summaries of experiments have shown that species richness tends to enhance the production of biomass across a wide range of trophic groups and ecosystems; however, the biomass of diverse polycultures only rarely exceeds that of the single most productive species in a community (a phenomenon called 'transgressive overyielding'). Some have hypothesized that the lack of transgressive overyielding is because experiments have generally been performed in overly-simplified, homogeneous environments where species have little opportunity to express the niche differences that lead to 'complementary' use of resources that can enhance biomass production. We tested this hypothesis in a laboratory experiment where we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in homogeneous and heterogeneous nutrient environments.Experimental units were comprised of patches containing either homogeneous nutrient ratios (16:1 nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) in all patches) or heterogeneous nutrient ratios (ranging from 4:1 to 64:1 N:P across patches). After allowing 6-10 generations of algal growth, we found that algal species richness had similar impacts on biomass production in both homo- and heterogeneous environments. Although four of the five algal species showed a strong response to nutrient heterogeneity, a single species dominated algal communities in both types of environments. As a result, a 'selection effect'--where diversity maximizes the chance that a competitively superior species will be included in, and dominate the biomass of a community--was the primary mechanism by which richness influenced biomass in both homo- and heterogeneous environments.Our study suggests that spatial heterogeneity, by itself, is not sufficient to generate strong effects of biodiversity on productivity. Rather, heterogeneity must be coupled with variation in the relative fitness of species across patches in order for spatial niche differentiation to generate complementary resource use."
https://openalex.org/W2152261559,"Background Adenosine Deaminase Activity (ADA) is a commonly used marker for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion. There has been concern about its usefulness in immunocompromised patients, especially HIV positive patients with very low CD4 counts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of ADA in pleural fluid in patients with low CD4 counts. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective case control study. Medical files of patients with tuberculous pleuritis and non-tuberculous pleuritis were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, CD4 cell counts in blood and biochemical markers in pleural fluid, including ADA were recorded. Results One ninety seven tuberculous pleuritis and 40 non- tuberculous pleuritis patients were evaluated. Using the cut-off value of 30 U/L, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of ADA was 94%, 95%, 19, and 0.06 respectively. The mean CD4 cell counts among TB pleuritis patients was 29 and 153 cells/microL in patients with CD4 <50 cells/microL and >50 cells/microL, (p<0.05) respectively. The corresponding mean ADA values for these patients were 76 U/L and 72 U/L respectively (p>0.5). There was no correlation between ADA values and CD4 cell counts (r = −0.120, p = 0.369). Conclusion ADA analysis is a sensitive marker of tuberculous pleuritis even in HIV patients with very low CD4 counts in a high TB endemic region. The ADA assay is inexpensive, rapid, and simple to perform and is of great value for the immediate diagnosis of tuberculous pleuritis while waiting for culture result and this has a positive impact on patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2006889109,"Circadian clocks are internal molecular time-keeping mechanisms that provide living organisms with the ability to adjust their growth and physiology and to anticipate diurnal environmental changes. Circadian clocks, without exception, respond to light and, in plants, light is the most potent and best characterized entraining stimulus. The capacity of plants to respond to light is achieved through a number of photo-perceptive proteins including cryptochromes and phytochromes. There is considerable experimental evidence demonstrating the roles of photoreceptors in providing light input to the clock.In order to identify genes regulated by diurnal and circadian rhythms, and to establish possible functional relations between photoreceptors and the circadian clock in tomato, we monitored the temporal transcription pattern in plants entrained to long-day conditions, either by large scale comparative profiling, or using a focused approach over a number of photosensory and clock-related genes by QRT-PCR. In parallel, focused transcription analyses were performed in cry1a- and in CRY2-OX tomato genotypes.We report a large series of transcript oscillations that shed light on the complex network of interactions among tomato photoreceptors and clock-related genes. Alteration of cryptochrome gene expression induced major changes in the rhythmic oscillations of several other gene transcripts. In particular, over-expression of CRY2 had an impact not only on day/night fluctuations but also on rhythmicity under constant light conditions. Evidence was found for widespread diurnal oscillations of transcripts encoding specific enzyme classes (e.g. carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes) as well as for post-transcriptional diurnal and circadian regulation of the CRY2 transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2093659636,"The unique phenotype of renal medullary cells allows them to survive and functionally adapt to changes of interstitial osmolality/tonicity. We investigated the effects of acute hypertonic challenge on AQP2 (aquaporin-2) water channel trafficking. In the absence of vasopressin, hypertonicity alone induced rapid (<10 min) plasma membrane accumulation of AQP2 in rat kidney collecting duct principal cells in situ, and in several kidney epithelial lines. Confocal microscopy revealed that AQP2 also accumulated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) following hypertonic challenge. AQP2 mutants that mimic the Ser256-phosphorylated and -nonphosphorylated state accumulated at the cell surface and TGN, respectively. Hypertonicity did not induce a change in cytosolic cAMP concentration, but inhibition of either calmodulin or cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity blunted the hypertonicity-induced increase of AQP2 cell surface expression. Hypertonicity increased p38, ERK1/2, and JNK MAPK activity. Inhibiting MAPK activity abolished hypertonicity-induced accumulation of AQP2 at the cell surface but did not affect either vasopressin-dependent AQP2 trafficking or hypertonicity-induced AQP2 accumulation in the TGN. Finally, increased AQP2 cell surface expression induced by hypertonicity largely resulted from a reduction in endocytosis but not from an increase in exocytosis. These data indicate that acute hypertonicity profoundly alters AQP2 trafficking and that hypertonicity-induced AQP2 accumulation at the cell surface depends on MAP kinase activity. This may have important implications on adaptational processes governing transcellular water flux and/or cell survival under extreme conditions of hypertonicity.

This may have important implications on adaptational processes governing transcellular water flux and/or cell survival under extreme conditions of hypertonicity. Most mammalian cells are exposed to an extracellular environment that remains isotonic under normal physiological conditions, largely as a result of renal regulatory mechanisms that maintain water and electrolyte body fluid composition within a very narrow range. This process relies on the counter-current concentration mechanism that occurs along the loop of Henle and which, in turn, depends on the generation of a NaCl and urea concentration gradient along the cortico-papillary axis. As a consequence, renal medullary cells are physiologically exposed to changing conditions of variable interstitial osmolality/tonicity that can reach up to 1200 mosmol/kg in human inner medulla and up to 4500 mosmol/kg in some remarkable rodent species that are adapted to life in arid desert conditions (1Van Hoek A. Huang Y. Fang P. Protein Adaptations and Signal Transduction. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam2001: 73-85Google Scholar). The unique phenotype of these cells allows them to survive and function under these “hostile” conditions and to rapidly adapt to recurrent variations in their environmental tonicity that follow physiological and behavioral changes. In addition to the promotion of intracellular events that ensure cell survival, hypertonicity also promotes events that mediate changes in cell function in various physiological settings. Both rapid and slow responses mediate cell adaptation to increased extracellular tonicity. Rapid responses include actin and microtubule remodeling, changes in phosphoinositide metabolism, and activation of a large network of intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPK 5The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseCDcollecting ductVPvasopressinV2Rvasopressin receptor type 2PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase AERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseYFPyellow fluorescent proteinssYFPsoluble secreted yellow fluorescent proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyPBSphosphate-buffered salineBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateIODintegrated optical densityTGNtrans-Golgi networkMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinasemβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinSNAPsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteinSNARESNAP receptorPKIPKA inhibitorMDCmonodansylcadaverine. 5The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseCDcollecting ductVPvasopressinV2Rvasopressin receptor type 2PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase AERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseYFPyellow fluorescent proteinssYFPsoluble secreted yellow fluorescent proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyPBSphosphate-buffered salineBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateIODintegrated optical densityTGNtrans-Golgi networkMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinasemβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinSNAPsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteinSNARESNAP receptorPKIPKA inhibitorMDCmonodansylcadaverine. and tyrosine kinase pathways (2Di Ciano-Oliveira C.

The final adjustment of the water reabsorption process occurs at the level of the collecting duct (CD) and is largely under the control of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP). An acute increase of plasma VP concentration leads to an accumulation of the AQP2 (aquaporin-2) water channel at the apical surface of CD principal cells, providing a means by which luminal water can enter the cell (8Brown D. Nielsen S. Brenner B.M. Brenner & Rector's The Kidney. 7th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia2004: 573-597Google Scholar). Driven by the osmotic gradient, water exits the cell via AQP3 and AQP4 expressed in the basolateral membrane. The effect of VP on AQP2 trafficking is mediated by vasopressin receptor type 2 (V2R) mainly located in the basolateral membrane of CD principal cells. V2R activation by VP leads to activation of the Gsα/adenylyl cyclase system, increased cAMP concentration, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation (9Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F3-F12PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser256 is essential for AQP2 accumulation at the cell surface (10Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F817-F822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to VP, other factors modulate AQP2 expression at the cell surface. These include dopamine, prostaglandin E2, and agents that increase cGMP concentration (11Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F893-F901Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Nejsum L.N.

Osmotic challenge to cells in the kidney is greatest in the inner medulla and gradually decreases through the outer medulla and toward the cortex. Several pieces of experimental evidence have shown that, together with VP, hypertonicity plays a major role in enhancing AQP2 gene transcriptional activity (14Ecelbarger C.A. Nielsen S. Olson B.R.

Chronic hypertonicity was additionally shown to facilitate VP-induced AQP2 insertion into the basolateral membrane of CD principal cells (20van Balkom B.W.M. van Raak M. Breton S. Pastor-Soler N. Bouley R. van der Sluijs P. Brown D. Deen P.M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1101-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Renal medullary cells are routinely exposed to abrupt variations of extracellular tonicity that challenge cell volume homeostasis. Induction of AQP2 internalization from the surface of renal CD8 cells was recently shown to occur immediately following hypotonic challenge (21Tamma G. Procino G. Strafino A. Bononi E. Meyer G. Paulmichl M. Formoso V. Svelto M. Valenti G. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting a role that AQP2 may play in regulatory volume decrease mechanisms. In light of the key role that AQP2 plays in mediating luminal water entry into CD principal cells, we investigated whether altered AQP2 trafficking and plasma membrane expression occur as a rapid response to hypertonic challenge. To this end, we analyzed AQP2 expression following acute hypertonic challenge in kidney tissue slices and in both mCCDcl1 cells, a recently established and spontaneously transformed mouse cell line derived from cortical collecting duct primary cultures (22Gaeggeler H.P.

We show that, remarkably, acute (≤30 min) hypertonic challenge increases AQP2 expression at the plasma membrane in all three models to levels comparable with that achieved by VP alone. This occurs independently of a rise in cAMP content, depends on Ser256 phosphorylation, and is at least partly mediated by p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. AQP2 Constructs and Cell Culture—LLC-PK1 cells expressing wild-type AQP2 were named LLC-AQP2 (24Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The production of stably transfected LLC-PK1 cells expressing an AQP2 S256A mutant that mimics nonphosphorylated AQP2 (LLC-AQP2 (S256A)) was previously described (10Katsura T. Gustafson C.E.

Following the same procedure, LLC-PK1 cells were stably transfected with c-myc-tagged AQP2 inserted in the pcDNA1/Neo vector in which Ser256 was replaced with aspartate (LLC-AQP2 (S256D)) in order to mimic phosphorylated AQP2.

All other cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Confluent cells were grown in serum- and hormone-free medium for 1 h (for LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells) or 24 h (for mCCDcl1 cells) before performing experiments. Isoosmotic (300 mosmol/kg) medium was made hypertonic by replacing a fraction of the medium with NaCl-enriched medium (1100 mosmol/kg) to obtain 350–600 mosmol/kg medium. For control cells, the same fraction of medium was replaced by isotonic medium. Medium osmolality was checked using an osmometer. For VP stimulation, 10 nm [Lys8] vasopressin was used for LLC-AQP2 cells and 10 nm [Arg8] vasopressin was used for mCCDcl1 cells. Preparation of Rat Kidney Slices—Adult vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were thirsted for 12 h, as previously described (28Lencer W.I. Brown D. Ausiello D. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C920-C932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg). Both kidneys were removed, cut into 2–3-mm-thick slices using a razor blade, and quickly placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm Na3 citrate, 6 mm d-glucose, 6 mm l-alanine, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 3 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) at 37 °C equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Slices 0.5 mm in thickness were then cut with a Stadie-Riggs microtome (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) as previously described (29Breton S. Brown D. J. Am. Soc.

The slices were first incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in equilibrated Hanks' balanced solution to establish base-line resting conditions and then stimulated for various periods of time with 100 nm [Arg8]vasopressin or with NaCl-enriched hypertonic medium. The slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 10 mm sodium periodate and 75 mm lysine, as previously described (29Breton S. Brown D. J. Am. Soc.

For double staining experiments, Glut1, clathrin, and golgin-97 staining was performed prior to AQP2 staining. Specimens were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined using a Nikon Eclipse 80i epifluorescence microscope coupled to a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera or using a Zeiss Radiance 2000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were taken with a Plan Apo ×40/1.0 numerical aperture Nikon objective (for epifluorescent microscopy) or a Plan Apo ×63/1.4 numerical aperture Zeiss objective (for confocal microscopy) and acquired using IPLab software (BD Biosciences Bioimaging, Rockville, MD). For x-z scan analysis of AQP2 expression at the cell surface, confluent LLC-AQP2 cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) for 5 min prior to cell fixation and AQP2 staining. x-z planes of confocal microscope images taken at 0.15-μm intervals were reconstructed by Volocity software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Biotinylation—Expression levels of AQP2 at the apical surface of LLC-AQP2 cells were semiquantified by growing cells to confluence on permeable 12-mm diameter filters (Costar) and treating cells or not (control) with either VP (10 nm) or hypertonic medium (500 mosmol/kg) for 30 min. Cells were then placed on ice, and the basal medium was immediately replaced with ice-cold PBS while the apical medium was replaced with PBS or 5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS-CM (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2). Free biotin was then quenched with a 10-min incubation of 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS-CM at 4 °C cells, scraped off of filters (3 filters/condition), and spun down. Cells were then resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin), sonicated four times for 20 s each, incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and spun at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was then incubated 24 h at 4 °C with streptavidin-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) that were preincubated overnight at 4 °C with lysis buffer and added to the supernatant at a 1:5 ratio. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and then twice with lysis buffer without bovine serum albumin prior to the addition of loading buffer. Samples were then heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a monoclonal mouse antibody against c-myc (30Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of total cell lysate was performed as previously described (15Hasler U. Vinciguerra M. Vandewalle A. Martin P.-Y. Feraille E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (5 μg) were separated by NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) using an iBlot Gel Transfer apparatus (Invitrogen) set at 20 V for 7 min. Phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and phospho-p38 MAPK as well as their nonphosphorylated forms were detected by Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) diluted 1:2000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000) was used as a secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). For detection of AQP2, a 1:6 dilution of monoclonal mouse antibody against c-myc (30Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) or a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antibody against a stretch of amino acids corresponding to Glu250-Gln263 of the AQP2 C-terminus (for LLC-AQP2 and mCCDcl1 cell lysates, respectively) was used. Actin was detected using a monoclonal mouse antibody against actin (1:15,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used against mouse antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Pierce), and band intensity was quantified using IPLab software. cAMP Analysis—LLC-AQP2 or mCCDcl1 cells were grown to confluence and then incubated in serum- and hormone-free medium as described above prior to 30 min of preincubation in the absence or presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Cells were then stimulated with various concentrations of VP or with NaCl-enriched hypertonic medium for an additional 15 min. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and lysed, and cAMP content was measured using the cAMP Biotrack Enzymeimmunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions, as previously described (31Bouley R. Pastor-Soler N. Cohen O. McLaughlin M. Breton S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F1103-F1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). FITC-Dextran Endocytosis—LLC-AQP2 or mCCDcl1 cells were grown to confluence and then incubated in serum- and hormone-free medium as described above. Cells were then continuously stimulated with isotonic (300 mosmol/kg) medium or were subjected to hypertonic (500 mosmol/kg) medium for various periods of time in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml FITC-dextran (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were then rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4, fixed in PBS containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 5% (w/v) sucrose for 20 min, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and examined using a Nikon Eclipse 80i epifluorescence microscope. The pixel intensity of four representative images, taken with a Plan Apo ×40/1.0 numerical aperture Nikon objective, of each experimental condition was determined using IPLab software. ssYFP Exocytosis—LLC-AQP2 cells were stably transfected with YFP cDNA 5′-flanked by a signal peptide sequence that allows its translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. The use of ssYFP as a relevant marker of vesicle exocytosis in LLC-PK1 cells has recently been established (32Nunes, P., and Brown, D. (2007) in The 5th International Conference of Aquaporin, Nara, JapanGoogle Scholar). Cells were grown in 24-well plates to 90% confluence and then incubated for 1 h in Hanks' buffer supplemented with 20 mm HEPES. The buffer was changed once more (250-μl total volume/well) prior to stimulation or not (control) for various periods of time. 150 μl of cell medium containing secreted YFP from each condition was then collected, and fluorescence was measured using a Beckman Coulter DTX 880 microplate reader (485-nm excitation filter and 535-nm emission filter) and Multimode Detection software (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). [3H]VP Binding Assay—[3H]VP binding was performed as previously described (33Bouley R. Sun T.X. Chenard M. McLaughlin M. McKee M. Lin H.Y. Brown D. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C750-C762Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) on nonstimulated LLC-AQP2 and mCCDcl1 cells grown to confluence on Transwell® filters (106 LLC-AQP2 cells/filter and 3.2 × 106 mCCDcl1 cells/filter). The culture medium was replaced by ice-cold PBS, and 16 nm [3H-8-arginine]vasopressin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the upper or lower chamber to determine either apical (upper chamber) or basolateral (lower chamber) [3H]VP binding. Incubation was carried out for 3 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled VP (1 μm). Cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, after which the filters were excised and solubilized in scintillation vials containing 500 μl of NaOH (0.1 n). After 12 h, 5 ml of Optic-Fluor scintillation fluid (Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands) was added, and bound radioactivity was determined using a Tricarb 2200 CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). Data from three experiments were analyzed. Image Semiquantification—AQP2 expression at the proximity of the plasma membrane was semiquantified as previously described (20van Balkom B.W.M. van Raak M.

Briefly, the number of pixels contained in an outline enclosing the plasma membrane or the cell cytoplasm was quantified as integrated optical density (IOD) values. The plasma membrane/cell cytoplasm sorting index is defined as the IOD of the plasma membrane divided by the cytoplasmic IOD. At least 45 cells from at least three independent experiments were analyzed for each experimental condition, and the mean plasma membrane/cell cytoplasm sorting index ± S.E. was determined. We compared the number of pixels contained in a same intrac"

Munc119/RG4 is related to the prenyl-binding protein PrBP/δ and expressed at high levels in photoreceptor ribbon synapses. Synaptic ribbons are presynaptic specializations in the active zone of these tonically active synapses and contain RIBEYE as a unique and major component. In the present study, we identified Munc119 as a RIBEYE-interacting protein at photoreceptor ribbon synapses using five independent approaches. The PrBP/δ homology domain of Munc119 is essential for the interaction with the NADH binding region of RIBEYE(B) domain. But RIBEYE-Munc119 interaction does not depend on NADH binding. A RIBEYE point mutant (RE(B)E844Q) that no longer interacted with Munc119 still bound NADH, arguing that binding of Munc119 and NADH to RIBEYE are independent from each other. Our data indicate that Munc119 is a synaptic ribbon-associated component. We show that Munc119 can be recruited to synaptic ribbons via its interaction with RIBEYE.

The mechanism of how Munc119 works in photoreceptor synapses is not clear.Photoreceptor synapses are mainly ribbon-type synapses (for review, see Refs. 9Sterling P. Matthews G.

Ribbon synapses are specialized, tonically active chemical synapses. To maintain tonic exocytosis, ribbon synapses are equipped with specialized presynaptic structures, the synaptic ribbons (for review, see Refs. 9Sterling P. Matthews G.

RIBEYE consists of a unique A-domain and a B-domain, which is largely identical to CtBP2 (12Schmitz F. Königstorfer A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2000; 28: 857-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).

The RIBEYE-specific substrate that binds to the SBD is not yet known as well as the precise physiological function of RIBEYE in the synapse.To better understand the physiological role and molecular composition of synaptic ribbons, we performed a YTH screen using the RIBEYE (B) domain as a bait. In this screen, we identified Munc119 as a potential RIBEYE-interacting protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Details on all plasmids are deposited as supplemental materials.Yeast Two-hybrid Methods—For YTH analyses, the Gal4-based Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the YTH screening, we used a bovine retinal YTH cDNA library from the retina (18Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the respective bait proteins were cloned in-frame with the Gal4-DNA binding domain of pGBKT7. The cDNA of the indicated prey proteins were cloned in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain of pACT2 or pGADT7. The bait and prey plasmids confer tryptophan and leucine prototrophy to the respective auxotrophic yeast strains. Yeast strains Y187 and AH109 were used that contain distinct auxotrophic marker genes: AH109 [MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, Gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ] (19James P.

Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). Bait plasmids were electroporated into AH109 yeast, prey plasmids into Y187 yeast. Preparation of electrocompetent yeasts and electroporation of yeasts were done as described (21Helmuth M. Altrock W. Böckers T.M. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For identifying transformants, yeasts were plated on the respective selective plates to identify the resulting convertants to the respective prototrophy (drop out media Clontech/QBiogene). For interaction analyses, AH109 yeasts containing the respective bait plasmid were mated with Y187 yeasts containing the respective prey plasmid. Mating was performed for 5 h at 30 °C in 1 ml of YPD medium with heavy vortexing. For assessing mating efficiency, half of the mated sample was streaked on –LW plates, the other half was plated on –ALWH selective plate with 10 mm aminotriazole (3-amino 1,2,4-triazole, ATZ) added. For the matings, pSE1111 and pSE1112 that encode irrelevant proteins (22Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the empty bait and prey vectors were used as negative controls. Expression of β-galactosidase (β-gal) marker gene activity was qualitatively analyzed by filter assays and quantitatively with liquid assays as described (23Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K.

For the experimental assays, Munc119(1–240)-GSTpEBG was co-transfected with RE(B)-EGFP. Empty GSTpEBG co-transfected with RE(B)-EGFP served as control assays. 48 h after transfection, the cells were collected from the plates and pelleted at 6,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C if not denoted otherwise. The cell pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA containing 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The lysate from experiment and control assay were incubated overnight with 10 μl of washed glutathione-Sepharose beads each (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatants removed. The pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times. The final pellets were boiled in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses with the indicated antibodies.Immunoprecipitation from R28 Retinal Progenitor Cells—All steps were performed at 4 °C if not denoted otherwise. Washed R28 cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) for 45 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 13,000 rpm (15 min, Eppendorf centrifuge (Biofuge Fresco, rotor 3329), and supernatants were subsequently precleared by the addition of 20 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and 10 μl of RIBEYE preimmune serum for 1 h. Following centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 1 min), the precleared lysate was divided into two equal aliquots and incubated either with 10 μl of control IgG (U2656 preimmune serum) or with 10 μl of anti-RIBEYE (U2656 immune serum) for overnight at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, 20 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the samples, and incubation was continued for another 1 h. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged and washed five times with incubation buffer. The washed protein A-Sepharose pellets were boiled in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot analyses as described below.Immunoprecipitation from the Bovine Retina—All steps were performed at 4 °C if not denoted otherwise. For each immunoprecipitation, a freshly isolated bovine retina was incubated with 2 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Samples were transferred to 2-ml syringes and forcefully ejected through 23-gauge needles to mechanically disrupt the retinal tissue. Mechanical crushing through 23-gauge needles was repeated 40–50 times. The mechanical disruption is essential to fractionate synaptic ribbons and to make them accessible for immunoprecipitation. Without mechanical treatment, no RIBEYE was observed in the respective tissue lysate. After mechanical disruption, lysis was allowed to proceed for further 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged twice at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of Munc119 preimmune serum and 20 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterward, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the precleared lysate was divided into two aliquots and incubated either with 10 μl of Munc119 immune serum (Munc119 V2T2.120) or with Munc119 preimmune serum (control IgG) together with 20 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads (overnight). After overnight incubation, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (2 min) to pellet the protein A-Sepharose beads. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The final pellet was boiled with SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in the present study: mouse monoclonal anti-GST (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-MBP (New England Biolabs), anti-RIBEYE(B) domain (U2656, 12), mouse monoclonal anti-CtBP2 (BD Biosciences), and polyclonal anti-EGFP (T3743; gift of Dr. Thomas C. Südhof, Dallas, TX). Full-length bovine Munc119-GST was used as an antigen to generate the immune serum Munc119 V2T2. For the experiments, immune serum at the 120th day after immunization was used. The antibody specifically detects Munc119 (supplemental Fig. S6). In extracts of R28 cells and bovine retina the Munc119 immune serum V2T2.120 specifically detected Munc119 at the expected running position at 35 kDa (Figs. 4 and 5 and supplemental Fig. S6).FIGURE 5Co-immunoprecipitation of RIBEYE and Munc119 from the bovine retina. Co-immunoprecipitation of RIBEYE and Munc119 from bovine retina. In A, RIBEYE immune serum and RIBEYE preimmune serum were tested for their capability to co-immunoprecipitate Munc119. Munc119 is co-immunoprecipitated by RIBEYE immune serum (lane 2, Aa) but not by RIBEYE preimmune serum (lane 3, A). Ab, shows the same blot as in Aa but reprobed with anti-RIBEYE antibodies. This blot shows the presence of RIBEYE precipitated by the immune serum (lane 2) but not by the preimmune serum (lane 3). Asterisks indicate the immunoglobulin heavy chains. Lane 1 shows the input fraction (2% of total input). The loaded 2% input fraction corresponds roughly to 200 μg of total proteins (in a volume of ≈20 μl). Considerably more input fraction could not be loaded on the gel for volume reasons and also not to overload the gel. Furthermore, synaptic ribbons are mechanically stable, Triton X-100-insoluble structures, which can only be extracted to a certain extent from the bovine retina by the combination of mechanical and chemical lysis. Therefore, the RIBEYE immunosignal is weak in the input fractions. RIBEYE is highly enriched in the experimental immunoprecipitates (lane 2) but absent in the control immunoprecipitates (lane 3). Asterisks indicate the immunoglobulin heavy chains. 100% of the protein A-beads containing the immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded on the gel for experimental and control immunoprecipitations (lanes 2 and 3). In B, Munc119 immune serum and Munc119 preimmune serum were tested for their capability to co-immunoprecipitate RIBEYE. RIBEYE is co-immunoprecipitated by Munc119 immune serum (lane 2, Ba) but not by Munc119 preimmune serum (lane 3, Ba). Bb shows the same blot as in Ba but reprobed with anti-Munc119. This blot shows the presence of Munc119 immunoprecipitated by the immune serum but not by the preimmune serume. Asterisks indicate the immunoglobulin heavy chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Miscellaneous Methods—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed as previously described (12Schmitz F.

One clone encoded full-length Munc119, the two other clones encoded truncated Munc119 proteins that started at lysine 92 (Lys-92) and isoleucine 93 (Ile-93), shortly after the beginning of the PrBP/δ-homology domain of Munc119 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the PrBP/δ domain of Munc119 is probably responsible for the interaction. Using bait constructs that encoded for the PRD-(aa1–77)- or PrBP/δ-(aa78–240) domain of Munc119 we verified that the PrBP/δ-homology domain of Munc119 is indeed responsible for the interaction with RIBEYE (Fig. 1C). The PRD of Munc119 did not interact with RIBEYE in the YTH system. In the case of RIBEYE, the NADH binding subdomain of RIBEYE(B) domain (NBD) is mediating the interaction with Munc119. Munc119 also interacted with full-length RIBEYE indicating that the A-domain of RIBEYE is not inhibiting the interaction of the RIBEYE(B) domain with Munc119 (Fig. 1D). The interactions in the YTH were assayed by the growth of the respective mated yeast on –ALWH selective plates, indicating protein-protein interaction, as well as by qualitative and quantitative assessment of the β-galactosidase marker gene expression (Fig. 1, C and D and supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 1Interaction of RIBEYE(B) and RIBEYE(AB) with Munc119 in the YTH system. A, amino acid sequence of bovine Munc119. The proline-rich domain (PRD, aa1–77) is colored in blue, the PrBP/δ-homology domain of Munc119 (aa78–240) colored in green. The boxed lysine indicates the site of a premature stop mutation that causes cone rod dystrophy in a human patient (5Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D. Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T.

The amino acids methionine 1 (M1), lysine 92 (K92), and isoleucine 93 (I93), which are underlined in yellow indicate the beginning of the reading frames of three independently obtained Munc119 YTH prey clones. The amino acid sequence of Munc119 obtained in our YTH screen is identical to the Munc119 sequence deposited at GenBank™ (accession BC103449.1). B, schematic domain structures of RIBEYE and Munc119. RIBEYE contains of a large N-terminal A-domain and a C-terminal B-domain. The B-domain of RIBEYE contains the NAD(H) binding subdomain (NBD, depicted in yellow) and the substrate binding subdomain (SBD, depicted in red).

D, RIBEYE(B) and also full-length RIBEYE (RIBEYE(AB) interact with Munc119. The interaction is mediated via the NBD of RIBEYE and the PrBP/δ homology domain of Munc119, Munc119(78–240) (C; matings 6, 12–13). Mating 22 in C and mating 6 in D denote an unrelated positive control mating (CtIP). pSE1111 is an irrelevant prey vector, and pSE1112 an irrelevant bait vector (22Bai C. Elledge S.J.

First, we performed pull-down experiments using bacterially expressed and purified fusion protein (Fig. 2). We used GST-tagged proteins (Munc119-GST and GST) as immobilized bait proteins and MBP-tagged proteins (RIBEYE(B)-MBP and MBP) as soluble prey proteins. Munc119-GST (but not GST alone) interacted with RIBEYE(B)-MBP (but not MBP alone) as judged by protein pull-down analyses (Fig. 2). Specificity of interaction in these fusion protein pull-downs was consistently shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses (Fig. 2, A and B). Next, we analyzed whether RIBEYE(B) interacts with Munc119 in transfected COS cells. For this purpose, COS cells were co-transfected with eukaryotic expression plasmids that encoded for RIBEYE(B)-EGFP and GST-tagged Munc119 or GST alone (as control protein). Munc119-GST (but not GST alone) pulled-down RIBEYE(B)-EGFP from a crude cell extract of transfected COS cells (Fig. 3), further demonstrating a specific interaction between the RIBEYE(B) domain and Munc119.FIGURE 2RIBEYE(B) specifically interacts with Munc119 in fusion protein pull-down assays. Pull-down analyses of RIBEYE(B)/Munc119 complexes using bacterially expressed fusion proteins. In A, pull-down experiments were analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel after SDS-PAGE. In B, by Western blot analyses with the indicated antibodies. A and B, lanes 1–4 show the indicated purified fusion proteins (input fractions). All input lanes, except for lane 4, represent 50% of the input fraction. Lane 4 represents 25% of the input fraction. In lanes 5–8, 100% was loaded. GST-tagged fusion proteins were used as immobilized bait proteins and MBP-tagged proteins as soluble prey proteins. Only Munc119-GST pulled-down RE(B)-MBP (lane 8) but not GST alone (lane 6). Neither GST alone nor Munc119-GST pulled-down MBP alone (lanes 5 and 7). The asterisks in lanes 3, 7, and 8 of A label a break-down product of Munc119-GST. SDS-PAGE clearly demonstrated that Munc119-GST does not pull-down MBP alone (A). To further exclude that any MBP is nonspecifically pulled-down by Munc119-GST, we also analyzed the results of the pull-down assays by Western blotting with anti-MBP antibodies. B, Western blot analyses with anti-MBP antibodies (B) clearly show that only RE(B)-MBP (lane 8) but not MBP alone (lane 7) is pulled-down by Munc119-GST. GST alone does not pull-down RE(B)-MBP as well as MBP alone as shown by Western blotting with antibodies against MBP (Ba) demonstrating the specificity of the interaction and completely confirming the results in A. In Bb, the same blot as analyzed in Ba was reprobed (after stripping) with antibodies against GST to show equal loading of the bait proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2009346965,"That metastatic tumor cells grow in selective non-native environments suggests an ability to differentially respond to local microenvironments. BRMS1, like other metastasis suppressors, halts ectopic growth (metastasis) without blocking orthotopic tumor formation. BRMS1-expressing tumor cells reach secondary sites but do not colonize distant tissues, compelling the hypothesis that BRMS1 selectively restricts the ability of tumor cells to respond to exogenous regulators in different tissues. Here we report that BRMS1 expression in metastatic human breast cancer cells leads to a selective reduction in epidermal growth factor receptor expression and downstream (AKT) signaling. Signaling through another receptor tyrosine kinase, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), remains unaltered despite reduced levels of the signaling intermediate phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. Interestingly, reduced downstream calcium signaling is observed following treatment with platelet-derived growth factor, consistent with decreased phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. However, platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression is unaltered. Thus, BRMS1 differentially attenuates cellular responses to mitogenic signals, not only dependent upon the specific signal received, but at varying steps within the same signaling cascade. Specific modulation of signaling responses received from the microenvironment may ultimately dictate which environments are permissive/restrictive for tumor cell growth and provide insights into the biology underlying metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2011140136,"Pleistocene glacial cycles play a major role in diversification and speciation, although the relative importance of isolation and expansion in driving diversification remains debated. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 15 great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) populations distributed over the vast Eurasian breeding range of the species, and revealed unexpected postglacial expansion patterns from two glacial refugia. There were 58 different haplotypes forming two major clades, A and B. Clade A dominated in Western Europe with declining frequencies towards Eastern Europe and the Middle East, but showed a surprising increase in frequency in Western and Central Asia. Clade B dominated in the Middle East, with declining frequencies towards north in Central and Eastern Europe and was absent from Western Europe and Central Asia. A parsimonious explanation for these patterns is independent postglacial expansions from two isolated refugia, and mismatch distribution analyses confirmed this suggestion. Gene flow analyses showed that clade A colonised both Europe and Asia from a refugium in Europe, and that clade B expanded much later and colonised parts of Europe from a refugium in the Middle East. Great reed warblers in the eastern parts of the range have slightly paler plumage than western birds (sometimes treated as separate subspecies; A. a. zarudnyi and A. a. arundinaceus, respectively) and our results suggest that the plumage diversification took place during the easterly expansion of clade A. This supports the postglacial expansion hypothesis proposing that postglacial expansions drive diversification in comparatively short time periods. However, there is no indication of any (strong) reproductive isolation between clades and our data show that the refugia populations became separated during the last glaciation. This is in line with the Pleistocene speciation hypothesis invoking that much longer periods of time in isolation are needed for speciation to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2152206685,"Aging is associated with functional and structural declines in many body systems, even in the absence of underlying disease. In particular, skeletal muscles experience severe declines during aging, a phenomenon termed sarcopenia. Despite the high incidence and severity of sarcopenia, little is known about contributing factors and development. Many studies focus on functional aspects of aging-related tissue decline, while structural details remain understudied. Traditional approaches for quantifying structural changes have assessed individual markers at discrete intervals. Such approaches are inadequate for the complex changes associated with aging. An alternative is to consider changes in overall morphology rather than in specific markers. We have used this approach to quantitatively track tissue architecture during adulthood and aging in the C. elegans pharynx, the neuromuscular feeding organ. Using pattern recognition to analyze aged-grouped pharynx images, we identified discrete step-wise transitions between distinct morphologies. The morphology state transitions were maintained in mutants with pharynx neurotransmission defects, although the pace of the transitions was altered. Longitudinal measurements of pharynx function identified a predictive relationship between mid-life pharynx morphology and function at later ages. These studies demonstrate for the first time that adult tissues undergo distinct structural transitions reflecting postdevelopmental events. The processes that underlie these architectural changes may contribute to increased disease risk during aging, and may be targets for factors that alter the aging rate. This work further demonstrates that pattern analysis of an image series offers a novel and generally accessible approach for quantifying morphological changes and identifying structural biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2087244269,"Background Obtaining chloroplast genome sequences is important to increase the knowledge about the fundamental biology of plastids, to understand evolutionary and ecological processes in the evolution of plants, to develop biotechnological applications (e.g. plastid engineering) and to improve the efficiency of breeding schemes. Extraction of pure chloroplast DNA is required for efficient sequencing of chloroplast genomes. Unfortunately, most protocols for extracting chloroplast DNA were developed for eudicots and do not produce sufficiently pure yields for a shotgun sequencing approach of whole plastid genomes from the monocot grasses. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a simple and inexpensive method to obtain chloroplast DNA from grass species by modifying and extending protocols optimized for the use in eudicots. Many protocols for extracting chloroplast DNA require an ultracentrifugation step to efficiently separate chloroplast DNA from nuclear DNA. The developed method uses two more centrifugation steps than previously reported protocols and does not require an ultracentrifuge. Conclusions/Significance The described method delivered chloroplast DNA of very high quality from two grass species belonging to highly different taxonomic subfamilies within the grass family (Lolium perenne, Pooideae; Miscanthus×giganteus, Panicoideae). The DNA from Lolium perenne was used for whole chloroplast genome sequencing and detection of SNPs. The sequence is publicly available on EMBL/GenBank."
https://openalex.org/W1995424133,"Background To act as a commensal bacterium and a pathogen in humans and animals, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS) must be able to monitor and adapt to different environmental conditions. Temperature variation is a one of the most commonly encountered variables. Methodology/Principal Findings To understand the extent to which GBS modify gene expression in response to temperatures encountered in the various hosts, we conducted a whole genome transcriptome analysis of organisms grown at 30°C and 40°C. We identified extensive transcriptome remodeling at various stages of growth, especially in the stationary phase (significant transcript changes occurred for 25% of the genes). A large proportion of genes involved in metabolism was up-regulated at 30°C in stationary phase. Conversely, genes up-regulated at 40°C relative to 30°C include those encoding virulence factors such as hemolysins and extracellular secreted proteins with LPXTG motifs. Over-expression of hemolysins was linked to larger zones of hemolysis and enhanced hemolytic activity at 40°C. A key theme identified by our study was that genes involved in purine metabolism and iron acquisition were significantly up-regulated at 40°C. Conclusion/Significance Growth of GBS in vitro at different temperatures resulted in extensive remodeling of the transcriptome, including genes encoding proven and putative virulence genes. The data provide extensive new leads for molecular pathogenesis research."
https://openalex.org/W2060584507,"The human colorectal epithelium is maintained by multipotent stem cells that give rise to absorptive, mucous, and endocrine lineages. Recent evidence suggests that human colorectal cancers are likewise maintained by a minority population of so-called cancer stem cells. We have previously established a human colorectal cancer cell line with multipotent characteristics (HRA-19) and developed a serum-free medium that induces endocrine, mucous and absorptive lineage commitment by HRA-19 cells in vitro. In this study, we investigate the role of the β1 integrin family of cell surface extracellular matrix receptors in multilineage differentiation by these multipotent human colorectal cancer cells. We show that endocrine and mucous lineage commitment is blocked in the presence of function-blocking antibodies to β1 integrin. Function-blocking antibodies to α2 integrin also blocked both HRA-19 endocrine lineage commitment and enterocytic differentiation by Caco-2 human colon cancer cells; both effects being abrogated by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, suggesting a role for ERK signaling in α2-mediated regulation of colorectal cancer cell differentiation. To further explore the role of α2 integrin in multilineage differentiation, we established multipotent cells expressing high levels of wild-type α2 integrin or a non-signaling chimeric α2 integrin. Overexpression of wild-type α2 integrin in HRA-19 cells significantly enhanced endocrine and mucous lineage commitment, while cells expressing the non-signaling chimeric α2 integrin had negligible ability for either endocrine or mucous lineage commitment.

A small population of multipotent epithelial stem cells maintains the integrity and function of the adult intestinal epithelium (1Brittan M. Wright N.A. Gut. 2004; 53: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) Colorectal epithelial stem cells proliferate slowly giving rise to daughter cells that undergo a phase of rapid proliferation and then differentiate into absorptive, mucous, and endocrine cells. Homeostasis requires a precise balance between stem cell renewal and generation of lineage-committed cells; processes regulated by the Wnt, TGF-β, Hedgehog, and Notch pathways (2Sancho E. Batlle E. Clevers H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 695-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of normal stem cell renewal, is commonly present in colorectal cancer as the result of well described mutations in Wnt signaling components(3Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). This suggests that signaling cascades that promote normal colorectal epithelial stem cell renewal persist in colorectal cancer cells. Indeed there is growing support for the idea that human cancers, including colorectal cancer, are diseases of stem cells (4Dalerba P. Cho R.W. Clarke M.F. Annu. Rev.

This will require a greater understanding of the mechanisms that balance self-renewal and differentiation in colorectal epithelial stem cells and colorectal cancer cells.Maintenance of stem cells is thought to require a specialized tissue microenvironment known as a stem cell niche. The intestinal stem cell niche, like the intestinal stem cell, remains poorly defined, but it seems probable that intestinal stem cell behavior will be specified by the integration of signaling pathways triggered by soluble factors and stem cell adhesion to other cell types or extracellular matrix proteins (9Ohlstein B.

Integrins are heterodimers (one α and one β subunit (14Hynes R.

What is not clear is whether stem cell regulation is mediated entirely by the β1 integrin chain or in the context of a particular αβ heterodimer.We previously established a multipotent human colorectal cancer cell line, HRA-19 (24Kirkland S. Cancer. 1988; 61: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) Clones of this cell line execute a multilineage differentiation program forming absorptive, mucous, and endocrine cells in xenografts (24Kirkland S.

Cancer. 1988; 61: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Multiplex PCR analysis performed at the ECACC (Porton Down) confirmed that cells do have a unique profile. Lineage commitment experiments were performed as previously described (25Kirkland S.C. Henderson K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded into 8-chamber plastic slides (Nunc) at a dilution equivalent to a 1:5 split ratio (∼1.2 × 104cells/0.5 ml/chamber) (cells are transferred as a mixture of cell clumps and single cells; single cell suspension is not possible without major cell damage) in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. On Day 3, cells were transferred to serum-free medium (ITA): DMEM with 2 mm glutamine, ascorbic acid (10 μg/ml), insulin/transferrin/selenium (ITS-X: Invitrogen), and incubated at 37 °C. Monolayers were stained for endocrine cells (chromogranin) on Day 5 and mucous cells (PR4D4) on Day 6 (33Henderson K. Kirkland S.C. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 259-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by immunocytochemistry. G418 was omitted during the lineage commitment assay as it inhibited differentiation. 3S. C. Kirkland, unpublished observations. Values were normalized for cell number using the WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described by the supplier.Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence used ethanol-fixed cells with Abs to chromogranin (LK2H10: Chemicon) or α2 integrin (BD Transduction) followed by Alexa488-Rb anti-Ms immunoglobulins (Invitrogen).Cell Adhesion Assay—Multiwell plates (Nunc Maxisorp) were coated with collagen I or IV (6 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in DPBS. 105 cells per well were incubated for 2 h at 37 °Cto allow attachment. The adherent cell number was measured using crystal violet staining, where the absorbance was read at 595 nm. Blank values from bovine serum albumin-coated wells (typically less than 5% of maximal adhesion) were subtracted from test values. Antibodies were incubated with cells for 15 min at 37 °C before adding to the matrix-coated wells.Plasmid Constructs and Transfection—Integrin constructs in the pAWneo2 expression vector were a kind gift from Dr. J. Ivaska. Constructs were checked by sequencing and transfected into cells in 10-cm dishes using 10 μg of DNA and 37.5 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) prepared in Optimem medium (Invitrogen) and overnight incubation at 37 °C. Cells were transferred to DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h, then G418 200 μg/ml (Invitrogen) was added. G418-resistant colonies were selected with cloning cylinders. Cells grew very slowly in G418, and selection took many months. Transfected cells were maintained in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 200 μg/ml G418.Immunoblotting—Lysates were prepared with non-reducing SDS lysis buffer (Cell Signaling). Equal amounts of protein (RC-DC assay, Bio-Rad) were separated on 3–8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 5% milk solution, rinsed in wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated overnight with antibodies (β1 integrin; mAb 1965(Chemicon) or α2 integrin (611016)) in the blot wash. Blots were washed and incubated in HRPrabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) in blot wash for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and developed using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences).Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were surface-biotinylated in 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (freshly prepared) (Pierce) in DPBS for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cells were washed and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared with protein-G-agarose (Roche Applied Science), then incubated with antibodies to β1 (1965), α2 (PIE6), or α2β1 (1998) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected onto protein-G-agarose. Following electrophoresis and blotting, biotinylated proteins were detected with streptavidinHRP (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation of α2α1 integrin was performed with AB1934 to the cytoplasmic domain of α1 integrin and detected on blots with α2 integrin antibody.Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Caco-2 Cells—Subconfluent cells were transferred to serum-free medium (TSG) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, transferrin (5 μg/ml), sodium selenite (5 ng/ml), and 1 mm glutamine for 24 h, then harvested with 0.0125% trypsin/versene and added to an equal volume of soy bean trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml). Cells were plated at 0.6 × 104 cells/well in TSG medium into 96-well plates either untreated or coated with 10 μg/ml α2 integrin antibody (AK7) or MsIgG (Biolegend). After 72 h, the cell number was estimated with WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Chemicon); the reaction product p-nitrophenol was measured at 405 nm. Absorbance was normalized using the WST-1 values.RESULTSEndocrine Lineage Commitment Is Regulated by α2β1 Integrin—To determine whether β1 integrins were involved in lineage commitment, HRA-19 cells were transferred to serum-free medium to induce endocrine lineage commitment in the presence of a β1 antibody (JB1A), which blocks cell adhesion (26Ni H. Wilkins J. Cell Adh. Commun. 1998; 5: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and signaling (34Radel C. Rizzo V. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 288: H936-H945Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). JB1A reduced endocrine lineage commitment to 2% of control values (Fig. 1A). Furthermore LM534, another β1 antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of β1 integrin, also reduced endocrine lineage commitment significantly (Fig. 1A). Function-blocking β1 integrin antibody, JB1A, also blocked mucous lineage commitment in HRA-19 cells (Fig. 1B) while addition of equivalent amounts of isotype control antibody did not affect mucous cell numbers. In addition, total cell number was unaffected by treatment with JB1A or isotype control, indicating that the antibodies had not affected attachment, proliferation, or survival (Fig. 1C). These results indicate a role for the β1 integrins in regulating endocrine and mucous lineage commitment in HRA-19 cells. However, integrins are heterodimers and modulation of β1 chain function could potentially be affecting all members of the β1 integrin family. Therefore, we sought to identify which β1 integrin heterodimer(s) was involved in blocking endocrine/mucous lineage commitment.HRA-19 endocrine lineage commitment was induced in the presence of function-blocking antibodies to a range of α integrin chains known to form heterodimers with β1 integrin. Only antibodies to α2 integrin were shown to markedly reduce the ability of HRA-19 cells to generate endocrine cells while other α chain antibodies had no effect (Fig. 2A). The α2 chain antibody gave a dose-responsive inhibition of endocrine lineage commitment while an antibody recognizing the α1 chain of another collagen receptor, α1β1 integrin, had no effect at the same doses (Fig. 2B). Previous work has shown that α2 integrin only partners β1 integrin to form the α2β1 heterodimer (35Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6765) Google Scholar); therefore these experiments suggest that α2β1 integrin regulates cell fate.FIGURE 2α2 integrin regulates endocrine lineage commitment in HRA-19 cells. A, HRA-19 cells were seeded into 8-chamber slides in serum-free medium with and without antibodies to α2 (P1E6), α4 (P1H4), α5 (P1D6), and αv (P3G8) integrin, all at 500 ng/ml. Experiments were also attempted with α6 antibody (NKI-GoH3), but cell attachment was severely affected, and therefore data could not be collected. Data shown are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) **, p < 0.0001. Results are representative of a series of experiments performed with control and antibody-treated cells: α2 mAb P1E6 (five independent experiments), α4 mAb P1H4 (three independent experiments), α5 mAb P1D6 (two independent experiments), αv mAb P3G8 (three independent experiments). B, cells were seeded into 8-chamber slides in the presence of differing doses of antibodies to α1 integrin (FB12) or α2 integrin (PIE6). Data are the mean ± S.D. (n = 4) **, p < 0.0001.

Only the fully glycosylated β1 integrin band is seen at the cell surface along with a β1 integrin-associated protein which co-migrates with α2 integrin (Fig. 3C). Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to α2 integrin and α2β1 integrin complex also revealed two biotinylated protein bands corresponding in molecular weight to the α2 and β1 integrin (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Integrin expression in HRA-19, human colorectal cancer cells.

Attachment to collagen I and IV was blocked by antibodies to β1 and α2 integrin (Fig. 4), indicating that α2β1 integrin is a receptor for both collagen I and IV in HRA-19 cells. Antibodies recognizing other α chains did not significantly reduce cell binding to either collagen I or collagen IV (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4α2β1 integrin is a collagen receptor in HRA-19, human colorectal cancer cells.

Cell colonies were analyzed for their expression of α2 integrin (Fig. 5B) and α2α1 integrin (Fig. 5C). Two colonies, α2B and α2F, were chosen for further study as they showed markedly higher α2 integrin expression than the parent cell line (Fig. 5B). The chimeric protein was immunoprecipitated using an antibody to the cytoplasmic tail of α1 integrin and then detected on Western blots using an Ab to the extracellular region of the α2 chain (Fig. 5C). The α2 band was not observed in α1 immunoprecipitates of parent cells or α2 transfectants (α2B or α2F) but was present in chimeric transfectants α2α1B and α2α1E cells (Fig. 5C), which were selected for use in subsequent experiments. In the parent HRA-19 cells, α2 integrin is primarily localized at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 5D), as shown previously in the intestine (38Lussier C. Basora N. Bouatrouss Y. Beaulieu J. Microsc. Res.

Endocrine cell numbers were much higher in the wild-type α2 transfectants, α2B and α2F, than in the chimeric transfectants α2α1B and α2α1E, which showed little endocrine lineage commitment (Fig. 6, A and B). α2F and α2α1E cells had the highest expression of α2 and α2α1 proteins, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C) and these colonies showed the most extreme phenotypes with α2F cells showing 10.5-fold higher endocrine lineage commitment than the parent cells while α2α1E cells show only 2% of parent endocrine cell lineage commitment. Immunofluorescence staining of HRA-19 monolayers for chromogranin shows differential endocrine lineage commitment (Fig. 6B) between parent cells and transfectants. Phase contrast images are included to show that cells are present in the α2α1E monolayers, but endocrine lineage commitment is negligible. α2F cells contain many typical chromogranin-positive endocrine cells with long processes (Fig. 6B, white arrow).FIGURE 6α2 integrin regulates colorectal epithelial stem cell fate.

https://openalex.org/W2101473213,"Effective cryopreservation of oocytes is critically needed in many areas of human reproductive medicine and basic science, such as stem cell research. Currently, oocyte cryopreservation has a low success rate. The goal of this study was to understand the mechanisms associated with oocyte cryopreservation through biophysical means using a mouse model. Specifically, we experimentally investigated the biomechanical properties of the ooplasm prior and after cryopreservation as well as the consequences of reversible dismantling of the F-actin network in mouse oocytes prior to freezing. The study was complemented with the evaluation of post-thaw developmental competence of oocytes after in vitro fertilization. Our results show that the freezing-thawing process markedly alters the physiological viscoelastic properties of the actin cytoskeleton. The reversible depolymerization of the F-actin network prior to freezing preserves normal ooplasm viscoelastic properties, results in high post-thaw survival and significantly improves developmental competence. These findings provide new information on the biophysical characteristics of mammalian oocytes, identify a pathophysiological mechanism underlying cryodamage and suggest a novel cryopreservation method."
https://openalex.org/W2077183888,"Objective The glycoprofile of pathological prion protein (PrPres) is widely used as a diagnosis marker in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and is thought to vary in a strain-specific manner. However, that the same glycoprofile of PrPres always accumulates in the whole brain of one individual has been questioned. We aimed to determine whether and how PrPres glycosylation is regulated in the brain of patients with sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Methods PrPres glycoprofiles in four brain regions from 134 patients with sporadic or variant CJD were analyzed as a function of the genotype at codon 129 of PRNP and the Western blot type of PrPres. Results The regional distribution of PrPres glycoforms within one individual was heterogeneous in sporadic but not in variant CJD. PrPres glycoforms ratio significantly correlated with the genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene and the Western blot type of PrPres in a region-specific manner. In some cases of sCJD, the glycoprofile of thalamic PrPres was undistinguishable from that observed in variant CJD. Interpretation Regulations leading to variations of PrPres pattern between brain regions in sCJD patients, involving host genotype and Western blot type of PrPres may contribute to the specific brain targeting of prion strains and have direct implications for the diagnosis of the different forms of CJD."
https://openalex.org/W1987143841,"The evolution of eukaryotes is accompanied by the increased complexity of alternative splicing which greatly expands genome information. One of the greatest challenges in the post-genome era is a complete revelation of human transcriptome with consideration of alternative splicing. Here, we introduce a comparative genomics approach to systemically identify alternative splicing events based on the differential evolutionary conservation between exons and introns and the high-quality annotation of the ENCODE regions. Specifically, we focus on exons that are included in some transcripts but are completely spliced out for others and we call them conditional exons. First, we characterize distinguishing features among conditional exons, constitutive exons and introns. One of the most important features is the position-specific conservation score. There are dramatic differences in conservation scores between conditional exons and constitutive exons. More importantly, the differences are position-specific. For flanking intronic regions, the differences between conditional exons and constitutive exons are also position-specific. Using the Random Forests algorithm, we can classify conditional exons with high specificities (97% for the identification of conditional exons from intron regions and 95% for the classification of known exons) and fair sensitivities (64% and 32% respectively). We applied the method to the human genome and identified 39,640 introns that actually contain conditional exons and classified 8,813 conditional exons from the current RefSeq exon list. Among those, 31,673 introns containing conditional exons and 5,294 conditional exons classified from known exons cannot be inferred from RefSeq, UCSC or Ensembl annotations. Some of these de novo predictions were experimentally verified."
https://openalex.org/W2049058098,"Background The BH3-only protein Bid is an important component of death receptor-mediated caspase activation. Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 or -10 into t-Bid, which translocates to mitochondria and triggers the release of caspase-activating factors. Bid has also been reported to be cleaved by other proteases. Methodology/Principal Findings To test the hypothesis that Bid is a central mediator of stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated the effects of a small molecule Bid inhibitor on stress-induced apoptosis, and generated HeLa cells deficient for Bid. Stable knockdown of bid lead to a pronounced resistance to Fas/CD95- and TRAIL-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, and significantly increased clonogenic survival. While Bid-deficient cells were equally sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis, they showed moderate, but significantly reduced levels of apoptosis, as well as increased clonogenic survival in response to the genotoxic drugs Etoposide, Oxaliplatin, and Doxorubicin. Similar effects were observed using the Bid inhibitor BI6C9. Interestingly, Bid-deficient cells were dramatically protected from apoptosis when subtoxic concentrations of ER stressors, Etoposide or Oxaliplatin were combined with subtoxic TRAIL concentrations. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate that Bid is central for death receptor-induced cell death and participates in anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. They also show that the synergistic effects of TRAIL in combination with either ER stressors or genotoxic anti-cancer drugs are nearly exclusively mediated via an increased activation of Bid-induced apoptosis signalling."

The role of DREAM in Ca2+ homeostasis was thus explored in SH-SY5Y cells stably or transiently overexpressing DREAM or a Ca2+-insensitive mutant of it. The overexpression of DREAM had transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects. Endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ and capacitative Ca2+ influx were reduced in stably expressing cells. The previously shown down-regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 expression was confirmed; it could cause a local increase of subplasma membrane Ca2+ and thus inhibit capacitative Ca2+ influx. DREAM up-regulated the expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and could thus increase the unstimulated release of Ca2+ through it. The transient coexpression of DREAM and presenilin potentiated the decrease of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ observed in presenilin-overexpressing cells. This could be due to a direct effect of DREAM on presenilin as the two proteins interacted in a Ca2+-independent fashion.

The targets of the protein in the cytoplasm have been claimed to be the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PS, presenilin; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; AEQ, aequorin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; erAEQ, endoplasmic reticulum-targeted AEQ; pmAEQ, plasma membrane-targeted AEQ; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; tBuBHQ, 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone; cytAEQ, cytosolic AEQ; BK, bradykinin; CE, 5-(and 6-)carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; InsP3R, InsP3 receptor; CTF, C-terminal fragment; [Ca2+]er, endoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+]; [Ca2+]c, cytosolic [Ca2+]; WT, wild type. proteins presenilins (PSs) (1Buxbaum J.D.

EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Since the three names above have been used to refer to the same protein, hereafter we will only use DREAM. Only few reports have explored the possible roles of DREAM in the regulation of neuronal Ca2+ signals. In the cytoplasm, DREAM has been claimed to counteract the potentially pathogenic effects of mutated PSs (6Leissring M.A. Yamasaki T.R. Wasco W. Buxbaum J.D. Parker I. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8590-8593Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which has been proposed to be due to the potentiation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER (7Leissring M.A. Parker I. LaFerla F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32535-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). DREAM was also claimed to increase the ER Ca2+ content in neuroglioma cells (9Lilliehook C. Chan S. Choi E.K. Zaidi N.F. Wasco W. Mattson M.P. Buxbaum J.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, the increase had only been inferred from the larger amount of Ca2+ that appeared in the cytoplasm by exposing DREAM-expressing cells to thapsigargin. The effect of DREAM on neuronal Ca2+ could have important implications, given the recent findings of increased DREAM expression in brain samples of Alzheimer disease patients and in neuronal cultures exposed to the amyloid β peptide Aβ42 (10Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Hong Y.M. Song S. Mook-Jung I. Koh J.Y. Jung Y.K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It could be related to previous findings showing that the protein contributed to the production of the Aβ42 peptide and increased neuronal susceptibility to Ca2+-dependent apoptosis (11Jo D.G. Kim M.J. Choi Y.H. Kim I.K. Song Y.H. Woo H.N. Chung C.W. Jung Y.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, DREAM has also been associated with the antiapoptotic function of interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cells (12Sanz C. Mellstrom B. Link W.A. Naranjo J.R. Fernandez-Luna J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2286-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of DREAM on Ca2+ signaling has been investigated in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) stably or transiently expressing wild type (WT) DREAM or a Ca2+-insensitive mutated version of it (EFmDREAM), which silences DREAM-sensitive genes permanently. DREAM has been coexpressed together with PSs, and Ca2+ signaling has been compared with that in cells only overexpressing DREAM. Ca2+ was monitored in the cytosolic compartment (13Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), in the lumen of the ER (14Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and in the space beneath the plasma membrane (15Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The results have revealed a pleiotropic role of DREAM on the homeostasis of Ca2+. As previously found (16Gomez-Villafuertes R. Torres B. Barrio J. Savignac M. Gabellini N. Rizzato F. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adan A. Mellstrom B. Carafoli E. Naranjo J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10822-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), DREAM reduced the expression of one of the major neuronal plasma membrane Ca2+ extrusion systems, NCX3 (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3), thus elevating Ca2+ in the sub-plasma membrane space and inhibiting capacitative Ca2+ influx. As a consequence, the refilling of the ER stores with Ca2+ was also inhibited. In addition, DREAM up-regulated the InsP3R transcript levels, possibly increasing the Ca2+ leak through the receptor. These effects were transcriptional. However, DREAM also had post-transcriptional effects. It interacted directly with PS and potentiated the PS-promoted efflux of Ca2+ from the ER in transient coexpression experiments. The PS/DREAM interaction was Ca2+-independent. Cell Cultures and Transfection—SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, in 75-cm2 flasks; before transfection, they were seeded onto 13-mm glass coverslips and allowed to grow to 80% confluence. Transfection with 0.7 μg of plasmid DNA (or 0.5 μg of each plasmid in cotransfections) was carried out using TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aequorin (AEQ) measurements were performed 36 h later. Cells plated for Western blotting were collected 24–36 h after transfection. Stable WT DREAM and EFmDREAM clones were generated by transfecting the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the WT or EFmDREAM cDNA and were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mm G418. The same plasmids were used for transient expressions. PS1/pEF6/V5-His-TOPO and PS2/pcDNA3 plasmids were used for PSs transient expression. Immunocytochemistry—For immunofluorescence, SH-SY5Y cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 50 mm NH4Cl. Membranes were permeabilized with a 5-min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by a 1-h wash with 1% gelatin (type IV, from calf skin) in PBS. The coverslip was processed for the DREAM staining with specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-9142; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS. Staining was carried out with AlexaFluor589 secondary antibody (1:100 dilution in PBS; Invitrogen). Fluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a 12-bit digital cooled camera (Micromax-1300Y; Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ). Images were acquired using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Aequorin Measurements—ER Ca2+ content had to be drastically reduced before the reconstitution of functional low affinity recombinant targeted aequorin (erAEQ). To this end, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4°C in Krebs Ringer modified buffer (KRB; 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 37 °C), supplemented with 5 μm coelenterazine n (Invitrogen), the SERCA pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (tBuBHQ; 10 μm), and 600 μm EGTA. After this incubation, the cells were washed extensively with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EGTA and transferred to the chamber of a purpose-built luminometer. Transfected cytosolic AEQ (cytAEQ) was reconstituted by incubating the cells for 3 h with 5 μm coelenterazine WT (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Low affinity plasma membrane-targeted AEQ (pmAEQ) was reconstituted by incubating the cells for 1–2 h with coelenterazine WT in KRB supplemented with 100 μm EGTA. The procedure was necessary to increase the efficiency of reconstitution of pmAEQ. The additions to the KRB (1 mm CaCl2, 100 nm bradykinin (BK), 100 μm KB-R7943, 20 μm tBuBHQ, and 20 μm 5-(and 6-)carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester (CE)) were made as specified in the figure legends. The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O) to discharge the remaining AEQ pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated off-line into Ca2+ concentration values, using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of WT and mutant AEQs as previously described (13Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 17Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In brief, a 13-mm round coverslip with the transfected cells was placed in a perfused, thermostated chamber placed in close proximity to a low noise photomultiplier, with a built-in amplifier discriminator. The output of the discriminator was captured by a Thorn-EMI photon counting board and stored for further analyses. Fura-2 Measurements—Fura-2 loading was performed as previously described (18Malgaroli A. Milani D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar); the coverslip was placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100TV) connected to a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Micromax 1300Y; Princeton Instruments, Inc.). The sample was illuminated alternately at 340/380 nm, and the emitted light (filtered with an interference filter centered at 510 nm) was collected by the camera. Images were acquired using Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The ratio values (1 ratio image/s) were calculated off-line after background subtraction from each single image. DNA Constructs—The plasmids coding for the glutathione S-transferase (GST)/DREAM fusion proteins were constructed including the cDNA of WT DREAM or EFmDREAM in the pGEX4T1 vector (GE Healthcare). The coding regions were amplified by PCR using appropriate pairs of forward 5′-CGG AAT TCC GGC TTG CTC TAG ACA CCA TGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCC TCG AGC TAG ATG ACA TTC TCA AAC-3′ primers and subsequently cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI restriction site of pGEX4T1. All constructs were completely sequenced. GST Pull-down Assay—GST-WT DREAM and GST-EFmDREAM fusion proteins and GST alone were produced in Escherichia coli (BL21). Protein expression was induced by adding 0.8 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the growing culture (A600 = 0.6), and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells were centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 15 min, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted using a sonicator. Cells were then incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,700 × g for 30 min. The GST, GST-WT DREAM, and GST-EFmDREAM recombinant proteins were purified by incubating with glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatant was removed, and the glutathione-Sepharose 4B pellet was washed three times with ice-cold PBS. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with PS2/pcDNA3 plasmid. 24–36 h after transfection, a cell extract was prepared by lysing cells in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysis was performed by three cycles of freeze and thaw (–70 °C/37 °C), and lysates were cleared by collecting the supernatants after spinning. Loading of the samples was normalized for the total content of cellular proteins determined by the Bradford assay (Sigma). Different amounts of cell lysate (0.8–2 mg) were added to about 20 μg of GST-beads and mixed by gentle rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. For pull-down in the presence of Ca2+, 2 mm CaCl2 was added. The beads were recovered by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, washed five times with ice-cold PBS, and eluted three times by gentle rotation at 4 °C for 20 min in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Western Blotting Analysis—SH-SY5Y cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested from the culture plates in ice-cold Tris/EDTA buffer. Lysis was performed by three cycles of freeze and thaw (–70 °C/37 °C). Loading of the samples was normalized for the total content of cellular proteins determined by the Bradford assay. Samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE Tris/HCl gel and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Western blottings were performed using the polyclonal antibody anti-DREAM (sc-9142; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GST (sc-138; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the polyclonal antibody PC235 (Oncogene) that recognizes the PS2 full-length protein of 54 kDa and the C-terminal fragment (CTF) of 20 kDa, the polyclonal antibody PC267 (Oncogene) that recognizes the PS1 CTF of 18 kDa, the mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (D-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and in the mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma). Detection was carried out by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and 30 min. The proteins were visualized by the chemiluminescent reagent Immun-Star horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analyses were performed by using the Kodak1D image analysis software (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT). Means of densitometric measurements of independent experiments, normalized by the endogenous β-actin or β-tubulin values, were compared by Student's t test. The results shown in the figures are representative of at least three separate experiments. RT-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from neuroblastoma cell culture was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). PCR assays were performed using specific primers designed using Primer3 software. RT-PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. The reaction was performed with PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. For NCX3, the primers used for amplification were as follows: forward, 5′-GAC AGT AGA AGG GAC AGC CA-3′; reverse, 5′-CTA GTT TGG GGT GTT CAC CC-3′. The results were normalized as shown by parallel amplification of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-CAA GGT CAT CCA TGA CAA CTT TG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGG CCA TCC ACA GTC TTC TG-3′. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene 3000 platform (Corbet Research, Sydney, Australia). The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 94 °C for 7 min, 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. An amount of cDNA corresponding to 1–10 ng of total RNA was amplified in 25 μl of a mixture containing 12.5 μl of Platinum SYBR-Green qPCR SuperMix-UGD (Invitrogen) and a 2-μl primer mixture (2.5 μm each) for each sample. The primers used were as follows: for DREAM, 5′-CAC CTA TGC ACA CTT CCT CTT CA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACC ACA AAG TCC TCA AAG TGG A-3′ (reverse); for InsP3R2, 5′-GGA CAT CGT GTC CCT GTA CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGA ACT TCT TGG GAG GGT TG-3′ (reverse); for InsP3R3, 5′-GGA CAT CGT CTC CCT GTA CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAC CAC ACA GCG GTC ATC-3′ (reverse); for SERCA2b, 5′-CCT CTA TGT CGA ACC CTT GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCA GGC TGC ACA CAC TCT T-3′ (reverse); for calreticulin, 5′-TCA AGG AGC AGT TTC TGG AC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTG CAT CCT GGC TTG TCT G-3′ (reverse); for calnexin, 5′-GCT AAG AGG CCA GAT GCA GA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCA TGT CAT TGA GCA GAT TTC C-3′ (reverse); for Grp78/BiP, 5′-TGT CCC CTT ACA CTT GGT ATT G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAA ATG TAC CCA GAA GAT GAT TG-3′ (reverse). The relative amount of amplified DNA was calculated as described (19Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25592) Google Scholar) using hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase cDNA as endogenous control. The hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-TTG GAT ACA GGC CAG ACT TTG TT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG AAG TAC TCA TTA TAG TCA AGG GCA TA-3′. Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as means ± S.D. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student's two-tailed t test for impaired samples, with p value 0.01 being considered statistically significant. Generation of Stable Clones of SH-SY5Y Cells Expressing WT and EFmDREAM—Expression vectors for WT DREAM and EFmDREAM were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells. A number of stable clones were obtained following G418 selection. The expression level of DREAM was verified in all selected clones by Western blotting on total cell lysates. Fig. 1A shows blots of representative DREAM-expressing clones. The specific DREAM antibody recognized a doublet of ∼50 kDa, corresponding to a dimer of the DREAM protein. Untransfected HeLa and untransfected SH-SH5Y cell lysates were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (endogenous DREAM is present in neuroblastoma cells but not in HeLa cells). A quantitative estimate by densitometric analysis of the doublet showed that the overexpressed DREAM was 2–4-fold higher than the endogenous DREAM. C12#4 (EFm) and D5#1 (WT) clones were selected for Ca2+ measurements, but similar results were obtained on two other independent clones for each cell type. Quantitative RT-PCR was also carried out. Fig. 1B shows the quantification, indicating that the DREAM mRNA rose about 6–7-fold above the endogenous content. Fig. 1C shows the immunolocalization of overexpressed WT and mutated DREAM; in both cases, a clear cytosolic and reticular distribution pattern was evident. The overexpression of a Ca2+-insensitive EFmDREAM mutant in the cerebellum of transgenic mice had been previously found to significantly reduce NCX3 mRNA and protein levels, increasing the basal concentration of Ca2+ in cultured cerebellar granules (16Gomez-Villafuertes R. Torres B. Barrio J. Savignac M. Gabellini N. Rizzato F. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adan A. Mellstrom B. Carafoli E. Naranjo J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10822-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was thus decided to investigate whether DREAM influenced the transcription of NCX3 also in SH-SY5Y cells we used. RT-PCR analysis indicated a reduction of about 25% in the transcript of NCX3 in the EFmDREAM cell clone, but no changes were detected in the WT clone (Fig. 1D). Values were normalized by the content of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. EFmDREAM acts as a constitutive repressor of transcription (i.e. as a dominant active mutant), since its inability to bind Ca2+ does not permit its detachment from the promoter region of the gene. For this reason, its effects on gene transcription are expected to be more marked and evident than those of the WT DREAM. The Overexpression of WT DREAM and EFmDREAM Decreases the Resting ER Ca2+ Content but Not the Agonist-stimulated Ca2+ Release—Since no work has so far directly analyzed ER free Ca2+ in neuroblastoma cells overexpressing DREAM, it was decided to directly monitor it with erAEQ (14Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) under resting conditions and following cell stimulation with an agonist coupled to the generation of InsP3. Fig. 2A shows that unstimulated cells overexpressing the two DREAM variants had significantly lower resting ER Ca2+ than control cells. The reduction was about 25% in both clones: 317 ± 32 μm (n = 30) in control cells, 241 ± 19 μm (n = 26) in the EFmDREAM cell clone, and 232 ± 32 μm (n = 9) in WT DREAM clone (p < 0.001). After BK stimulation, the release of Ca2+ set the ER Ca2+ content at about 100 μm in the clones expressing the two DREAM variants and to about 150 μm in control cells (144 ± 16 μm (n = 9) in control cells, 98 ± 26 μm (n = 11) in EFmDREAM clone, and 98 ± 3 μm (n = 4) in WT DREAM clone; p < 0.001). Thus, considering the different starting levels of ER Ca2+, the net amount of Ca2+ released from the ER store by InsP3 remained essentially constant in the three cell types. It was considered important to clarify the mechanism by which the overexpression of WT and EFmDREAM reduced the basal amount of ER Ca2+. The release of Ca2+ through passive leak channels (i.e. in the absence of agonists that would open the InsP3 receptor (InsP3R)) was evaluated after blocking Ca2+ uptake by the sarcoendoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA pump). Cytosolic Ca2+ elevations were monitored in KRB supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 using cytAEQ (13Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), after adding the SERCA pump inhibitor tBuBHQ (20Dettbarn C. Palade P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 739-745PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of cytosolic Ca2+ due to the enhanced Ca2+ leak from the ER was the same in control cells, in the WT DREAM, and in EFmDREAM clones (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether the changes in ER Ca2+ content were related to the activity of DREAM as transcriptional repressor, quantitative analysis of the transcripts of ER proteins, such as the SERCA pump, the InsP3R, and the Ca2+-dependent chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, was performed. In addition to buffering Ca2+ in the ER lumen (21Krause K.H. Michalak M. Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), the last two proteins also regulate InsP3Rs activity (22Arnaudeau S. Frieden M. Nakamura K. Castelbou C. Michalak M. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46696-46705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another Ca2+ storage-related protein, Grp78/BiP (23Lievremont J.P. Rizzuto R. Hendershot L. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30873-30879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which is involved in the Ca2+-activated ER stress response (24Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar), was also investigated. Quantitative RT-PCR on total RNA extracted from the three different batches of cells using the primers indicated under “Experimental Procedures” only showed differences for the transcript of the InsP3R2, which was increased by about 25% in the cells expressing WT and EFmDREAM (Fig. 2C). This finding was not surprising, since in some cases, DREAM has been described to activate transcription, rather than inhibit it, by acting on the promoters of certain genes (25Scsucova S. Palacios D. Savignac M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Aranda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cytosolic transients generated by the release of Ca2+ through the opening of the InsP3R were then analyzed using cytAEQ or the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. The two probes yielded similar results. In agreement with the findings that the amount of Ca2+ released by InsP3R was the same in the controls and in the two DREAM-expressing clones, the heights of the BK-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients were about the same in the three cell types. The peaks of the transients were 2.95 ± 0.32 μm (n = 8) in control cells, 2.85 ± 0.12 μm (n = 10) in the EFmDREAM clone, and 2.78 ± 0.24 μm (n = 8) in the WT DREAM clone (Fig. 3A). Previous work on cerebellar granules from EFmDREAM transgenic mice, which expressed reduced amounts of NCX3, had shown slower kinetics of the post-transient decline of the Ca2+ traces (16Gomez-Villafuertes R. Torres B. Barrio J. Savignac M. Gabellini N. Rizzato F. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adan A. Mellstrom B. Carafoli E. Naranjo J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10822-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar effect was found in the SH-SY5Y clones overexpressing EFmDREAM (i.e. a slower return of the postpeak Ca2+ trace to basal level); the t/2 decay of the peak was 13.9 ± 1.8s (n = 6) in control cells and 17.6 ± 1.6s (n = 9) in the EFmDREAM clone (p < 0.001). However, the WT DREAM clone behaved like control cells (14.5 ± 1.8 s, n = 8), possibly because the reduction of NCX3 in the plasma membrane was below detection level in the WT DREAM clone (see Fig. 1D). In principle, the overexpressed DREAM could have buffered cytosolic Ca2+, decreasing the amount available to the SERCA pump and thus the ER Ca2+ content. Fura-2 was used to evaluate the resting cytosolic Ca2+, since AEQ is inadequate to monitor Ca2+ at the low nanomolar level. Fura-2 signals (ratio of fluorescence emitted by illuminating cells at 340 and 380 nm) detected in DREAM clones were similar to those in control cells, suggesting that the Ca2+ levels were similar in all three cell batches (Fig. 3B) (i.e. the differences in the ER Ca2+ content were not due to the Ca2+ buffering effect of overexpressed DREAM). The effects of DREAM were analyzed in more detail by monitoring cytosolic Ca2+ in the presence of specific inhibitors of the three different Ca2+ transporter proteins that have roles in the reestablishment of the post-transient cytosolic Ca2+ conditions: tBuBHQ as a SERCA inhibitor, CE as a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor (26Gatto C. Hale C.C. Xu W. Milanick M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and KB-R7943 as an NCX inhibitor (27Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A indi"
https://openalex.org/W2128715928,"The glycoprotein H (gH)/gL heterodimer is crucial for herpesvirus membrane fusion. Yet how it functions is not well understood. The Murid Herpesvirus-4 gH, like that of other herpesviruses, adopts its normal virion conformation by associating with gL. However, gH switched back to a gL-independent conformation after virion endocytosis. This switch coincided with a conformation switch in gB and with capsid release. Virions lacking gL constitutively expressed the down-stream form of gH, prematurely switched gB to its down-stream form, and showed premature capsid release with poor infectivity. These data argue that gL plays a key role in regulating a gH and gB functional switch from cell binding to membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2050269222,"Myopia affects well over 30% of adult humans globally. However, the underlying physiological mechanism is little understood. This study tested the hypothesis that ocular growth and refractive compensation to optical defocus can be controlled by manipulation of potassium and chloride ion-driven transretinal fluid movements to the choroid. Chicks were raised with +/−10D or zero power optical defocus rendering the focal plane of the eye in front of, behind, or at the level of the retinal photoreceptors respectively. Intravitreal injections of barium chloride, a non-specific inhibitor of potassium channels in the retina and RPE or bumetanide, a selective inhibitor of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter were made, targeting fluid control mechanisms. Comparison of refractive compensation to 5mM Ba2+ and 10−5 M bumetanide compared with control saline injected eyes shows significant change for both positive and negative lens defocus for Ba2+ but significant change only for negative lens defocus with bumetanide ; ; ; ; ; ). Vitreous chamber depths showed a main effect for drug conditions with less depth change in response to defocus shown for Ba2+ relative to Saline, while bumetanide injected eyes showed a trend to increased depth without a significant interaction with applied defocus. The results indicate that both K channels and the NKCC cotransporter play a role in refractive compensation with NKCC blockade showing far more specificity for negative, compared with positive, lens defocus. Probable sites of action relevant to refractive control include the apical retinal pigment epithelium membrane and the photoreceptor/ON bipolar synapse. The similarities between the biometric effects of NKCC inhibition and biometric reports of the blockade of the retinal ON response, suggest a possible common mechanism. The selective inhibition of refractive compensation to negative lens in chick by loop diuretics such as bumetanide suggests that these drugs may be effective in the therapeutic management of human myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2167813756,"Background The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein can function as a DNA replication inhibitor as well as a transcription factor. Regulation of DNA replication may occur through interaction of Rb with the origin recognition complex (ORC). Principal Findings We characterized the interaction of Drosophila Rb, Rbf1, with ORC. Using expression of proteins in Drosophila S2 cells, we found that an N-terminal Rbf1 fragment (amino acids 1–345) is sufficient for Rbf1 association with ORC but does not bind to dE2F1. We also found that the C-terminal half of Rbf1 (amino acids 345–845) interacts with ORC. We observed that the amino-terminal domain of Rbf1 localizes to chromatin in vivo and associates with chromosomal regions implicated in replication initiation, including colocalization with Orc2 and acetylated histone H4. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that Rbf1 can associate with ORC and chromatin through domains independent of the E2F binding site. We infer that Rbf1 may play a role in regulating replication directly through its association with ORC and/or chromatin factors other than E2F. Our data suggest an important role for retinoblastoma family proteins in cell proliferation and tumor suppression through interaction with the replication initiation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2170922717,"We asked whether and how a sequence of a honeybee's experience with different reward magnitudes changes its subsequent unconditioned proboscis extension response (PER) to sucrose stimulation of the antennae, 24 hours after training, in the absence of reward, and under otherwise similar circumstances. We found that the bees that had experienced an increasing reward schedule extended their probosces earlier and during longer periods in comparison to bees that had experienced either decreasing or constant reward schedules, and that these effects at a later time depend upon the activation of memories formed on the basis of a specific property of the experienced reward, namely, that its magnitude increased over time. An anticipatory response to reward is typically thought of as being rooted in a subject's expectations of reward. Therefore our results make us wonder to what extent a long-term 'anticipatory' adjustment of a honeybee's PER is based upon an expectation of reward. Further experiments will aim to elucidate the neural substrates underlying reward anticipation in harnessed honeybees."
https://openalex.org/W2070591048,"Background Although retroviruses may invade host cells, a productive infection can be established only after the virus counteracts inhibition from different types of host restriction factors. Fv1, APOBEC3G/F, TRIM5α, ZAP, and CD317 inhibit the replication of different retroviruses by interfering with viral uncoating, reverse transcription, nuclear import, RNA stability, and release. In humans, although APOBEC3G/3F and CD317 block HIV-1 replication, their antiviral activities are neutralized by viral proteins Vif and Vpu. So far, no human gene has been found to effectively block wild type HIV-1 replication under natural condition. Thus, identification of such a gene product would be of great medical importance for the development of HIV therapies. Method and Findings In this study, we discovered a new type of host restriction against the wild type HIV-1 from a CD4/CXCR4 double-positive human T cell line. We identified a CEM-derived cell line (CEM.NKR) that is highly resistant to productive HIV-1 infection. Viral production was reduced by at least 1000-fold when compared to the other permissive human T cell lines such as H9, A3.01, and CEM-T4. Importantly, this resistance was evident at extremely high multiplicity of infection. Further analyses demonstrated that HIV-1 could finish the first round of replication in CEM.NKR cells, but the released virions were poorly infectious. These virions could enter the target cells, but failed to initiate reverse transcription. Notably, this restriction phenotype was also present in CEM.NKR and 293T heterokaryons. Conclusions These results clearly indicate that CEM.NKR cells express a HIV inhibitory gene(s). Further characterization of this novel gene product(s) will reveal a new antiretroviral mechanism that directly inactivates wild type HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2077295577,"Recent evidence suggests that the number and variety of functional RNAs (ncRNAs as well as cis-acting RNA elements within mRNAs) is much higher than previously thought; thus, the ability to computationally predict and analyze RNAs has taken on new importance. We have computationally studied the secondary structures in an alignment of six Aspergillus genomes. Little is known about the RNAs present in this set of fungi, and this diverse set of genomes has an optimal level of sequence conservation for observing the correlated evolution of base-pairs seen in RNAs.We report the results of a whole-genome search for evolutionarily conserved secondary structures, as well as the results of clustering these predicted secondary structures by structural similarity. We find a total of 7450 predicted secondary structures, including a new predicted approximately 60 bp long hairpin motif found primarily inside introns. We find no evidence for microRNAs. Different types of genomic regions are over-represented in different classes of predicted secondary structures. Exons contain the longest motifs (primarily long, branched hairpins), 5' UTRs primarily contain groupings of short hairpins located near the start codon, and 3' UTRs contain very little secondary structure compared to other regions. There is a large concentration of short hairpins just inside the boundaries of exons. The density of predicted intronic RNAs increases with the length of introns, and the density of predicted secondary structures within mRNA coding regions increases with the number of introns in a gene.There are many conserved, high-confidence RNAs of unknown function in these Aspergillus genomes, as well as interesting spatial distributions of predicted secondary structures. This study increases our knowledge of secondary structure in these aspergillus organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1974407957,"Xld (Xolloid) is a member of the Tolloid family of metalloproteases found in embryos of the frog Xenopus laevis. It cleaves Chordin, an inhibitory binding protein for BMP2/4, releasing fragments with reduced affinity for these important ventralizing signals. As a consequence, increasing Xld activity ventralizes Xenopus embryos. We have used this phenotype as an assay to determine the requirement for the C-terminal, nonprotease component of Xld for in vivo activity. This part of the protein is composed of five complement C1r/C1s-sea urchin epidermal growth factor-BMP1 (CUB) and two epidermal growth factor domains, which are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions and may confer substrate specificity. Our results show that the protease coupled to CUB1 and CUB2 is the minimum domain structure required to ventralize Xenopus embryos and to block the dorsal axis-inducing activity of Chordin. Xld-CUB1-CUB2 cleaves Chordin, and a protease-inactive version co-precipitates Chordin. Our results indicate that the first and second CUB domains bind Chordin and present it to the protease domain.

In amphibian embryos, the development of dorsal tissues, such as the nervous system, notochord, and somites, is dependent upon the Spemann organizer, a signaling center that is localized to the dorsal marginal zone of gastrulae (1.Spemann H.

Several transcripts have been identified that are localized to the dorsal marginal zone and exhibit organizer activity when injected into ventral regions of the embryo. They encode secreted proteins, such as Chordin, Noggin, and Follistatin (5.Smith W.C. Harland R.M.

Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Members of this family cleave Chordin at two locations (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L.

Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, BMP signaling increases when these proteases are overexpressed, and the resulting embryos are ventralized (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M.

The phenotype, reduced head and notochord coupled with expansion of ventral tissues, is identical to that of Chordin-depleted embryos (9.Oelgeschläger M. Kuroda H. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 219-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inhibiting these proteases produces dorsalized embryos with an enlarged head and notochord and reduced ventral tissues, presumably because uncleaved Chordin accumulates in the embryo and reduces BMP signaling (20.Piccolo S.

Thus, the Tld family regulates dorsal-ventral patterning by modulating activity levels of ventralizing BMPs (28.Dale L. Wardle F.C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism operates during the cellular blastoderm stage of Drosophila development, where Tld is required for dorsal, rather than ventral, development (29.O'Connor M.B. Umulis D. Othmer H.G. Blair S.S. Development. 2006; 133: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Drosophila Tld regulates development by cleaving SOG (short gastrulation), an orthologue of Chordin (30.Marques G. Musacchio M. Shimell M.J. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. Cho K.W. O'Connor M.B.

Tlds are complex proteins with several modules in addition to the protease domain. They are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide and proregion, which must be removed for biological activity (32.Leighton M. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The active protease domain is coupled to C-terminal CUB and EGF-like domains with the arrangement CUB1-CUB2-EGF1-CUB3-EGF2-CUB4-CUB5 (19.Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33.Greenspan D.S. Top. Cur. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). BMP1, a major splice variant of vertebrate Tld, has the arrangement protease-CUB1-CUB2-EGF1-CUB3. These C-terminal domains appear to be involved in binding substrates, with strongest binding requiring both CUB and EGF domains (34.Hintze V. Höwel M. Wermter C. Berkhoff E.G. Becker-Pauly C. Beermann B. Yiallouros I. Stöcker W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The full complement of CUB and EGF domains is not required for cleavage of substrates in vitro by mammalian Tlds, with CUB1 and/or CUB2 often sufficient (35.Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36.Petropoulou V. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

Indeed, efficient cleavage of probiglycan has been reported for the protease domain alone for both BMP1 and mTLL1 (mammalian Tld-like 1) (37.Ge G. Zhang Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10786-10798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the full complement of CUB and EGF domains is required for cleavage of SOG by Drosophila Tld (38.Canty E.G. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

Xld (Xolloid) is a member of the Tld family found in embryos of the frog Xenopus laevis (23.Goodman S.A. Albano R. Wardle F.C. Matthews G. Tannahill D. Dale L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 195: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It ventralizes injected Xenopus embryos, blocks the dorsalizing activity of co-injected Chordin, and cleaves Chordin in vitro (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M.

Dev. 1999; 86: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have used these in vivo assays to determine the role of the C-terminal CUB and EGF domains in Xld activity. Our results show that only CUB1 and CUB2 are required for the ventralizing activity of Xld and for its ability to cleave Chordin. However, all of the C-terminal domains are required for the dorsalizing activity of dominant negative Xld, indicating that the most distal domains stabilize interactions with this substrate. Stable interactions between Xld and Chordin were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Xenopus Embryos—Female X. laevis were induced to lay eggs by subcutaneous injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (Chorulon, Intervet). Eggs were fertilized with a macerated testis and dejellied with 2% cysteine (Sigma) (39.Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Embryos were injected at the 2–4-cell stage, in 5% normal amphibian medium (39.Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) plus 3% Ficoll (Sigma), with capped synthetic mRNAs and defects scored at early tailbud stages. Animal caps (20 per experiment) were isolated from late blastulae, in normal amphibian medium, and then incubated in a microcentrifuge tube for 6 h (at 18 °C) in 25 μl of calcium- and magnesium-free modified Barth's saline (39.Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Animal caps do not undergo wound healing under these conditions, allowing secreted proteins to diffuse into the incubation medium. Both media and cells were collected for Western blot analysis. For co-precipitation experiments, injected late blastulae (5 embryos/experiment) were bisected and incubated in 500 μl of calcium- and magnesium-free modified Barth's saline for 6 h (at 18 °C). DNA Constructs—PCR was used to make Xld deletion constructs, using pCS2+Xld-Myc (23.Goodman S.A. Albano R. Wardle F.C. Matthews G. Tannahill D. Dale L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 195: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as a template. The entire plasmid was copied with Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene) for 16 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 18 min), excluding domains to be deleted, using the following primers: C-term-F, 5′-TTCCAGGATGCCCTTCAC-3′; C2-F, 5′-TGCGGAGGAGACATCAAAAAAGACTCTGG-3′; C3-F, 5′-TGTGGAGGTTTTATTACACAAC-3′; MP-R, 5′-TGCTGGGCATTTATAGAGTTTC-3′; C1-R, 5′-TATAGCTTCATATGCTGCAA-3′; C2-R, 5′-TTTAAAGAAATTGGCAGAAA-3′; E1-R, 5′-TGCGGCTTCACAACTTTT-3′; C3-R, 5′-TTCATCCTTATCAGAGAAAAAG-3′; C4-R, 5′-ACCAGCCTCTTTACAGTCATGT-3′. Each construct (Fig. 1) was sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the deletion. Protease-inactive versions were generated by deleting the Sph1-Not1 fragment of pCS2+XldY296N (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), which encodes the C-terminal CUB and EGF domains, and replacing it with the SphI-NotI fragment of pCS2+Xld-Myc deletion constructs. This strategy was not possible for pCS2+XldY296NC2, which was created by PCR using pCS2+XldY296NC1-C2 as a template. Constructs were linearized with NotI and transcribed with SP6 polymerase using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Synthetic mRNA was purified on RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) and stored in RNase-free water (Sigma). Protein Analysis—Animal caps and embryos were homogenized (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and then microcentrifuged (10 min at 13,000 rpm) to remove yolk platelets. Cell extracts from one animal cap and half the culture medium were loaded onto Novex 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare) using a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad). Xld-Myc and Chordin-HA were detected by ECL, according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare), using either anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science) antibodies. For co-precipitation of Xld and Chordin, 50 μl of modified Barth's saline, 50 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 μl of 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to 500 μl of culture medium and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were pulled down by adding 50 μl of protein L-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubating for 2 h (at 18 °C) while rotating. Samples were washed at least four times and released from the bead by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (+β-mercaptoethanol) and boiling. All of the immunoprecipitate and one-quarter of an embryo of cell extract were used for SDS-PAGE. Secretion Analysis of Xld Deletion Mutants—A series of deletion mutants were constructed for Xld, removing specific C-terminal CUB and EGF domains (Fig. 1). Six Myc tags were added to the C terminus to enable detection on Western blots. Since Xld is an extracellular protease, we first analyzed the effect these deletions had on secretion by Xenopus embryonic cells. Embryos were injected with Xld mRNAs, and animal caps were isolated from late blastulae (Fig. 2A). They were cultured in dissociation medium that allows the accumulation of secreted proteins. Western blots of cell extracts showed that all mRNAs were translated, producing proteins that were larger, because of glycosylation (23.Goodman S.A. Albano R. Wardle F.C. Matthews G. Tannahill D. Dale L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 195: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), than predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 2B). Smaller proteins were also detected for Xld, XldC2, and XldC1–C3, which we believe are N-terminally processed and active proteases. Most of the deletion mutants were also found in the culture medium, the exceptions being XldC3–C5 and XldC1+C3–C5. For Xld, XldC2, and XldC1–C3, the predominant protein in the medium was the shorter N-terminally processed form. The longer, unprocessed, form predominated in the medium of animal caps expressing XldC1 and XldC1-C2, but shorter forms were also detected. The preponderance of N-terminally processed forms in the culture medium is consistent with cleavage late in the secretory pathway, as previously demonstrated for human BMP1 (32.Leighton M. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results show that the distal CUB and EGF domains are not required for either secretion or N-terminal processing of Xld. CUB1 and CUB2 Are Required for the Ventralizing Activity of Xld—To test the activity of the Xld deletion mutants we used an in vivo assay in which synthetic mRNA was injected into Xenopus embryos (Fig. 3A). Injection of full-length xld mRNA caused mild ventralization of Xenopus embryos, which displayed a reduced head size and an expansion of ventral-posterior structures (Fig. 3C). Previous studies have shown that this is caused by a mild ventralization of the mesoderm, with loss of the notochord and expansion of the ventral blood island (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23.Goodman S.A. Albano R. Wardle F.C. Matthews G. Tannahill D. Dale L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 195: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The same phenotype was observed for embryos injected with either xldC1–C3 or xldC1-C2 mRNA (Fig. 3, D and E), whereas embryos injected with either xldC1, xldC2, xldC3–C5, or xldC1+C3–C5 mRNA were always normal (Fig. 3, G and H). The absence of secretion and N-terminal processing can explain the lack of activity associated with XldC3–C5 and XldC1+C3–C5 but not XldC1 or XldC2. Inactive XldC2, for example, is processed and secreted as efficiently as active XldC1–C3 (Fig. 2B). All of the active proteins included the protease domain and at least the first two CUB domains, whereas the inactive proteins lacked one or more of these domains. Our results show that the first and second CUB domains are the minimal C-terminal domains required for the ventralizing activity of Xld. CUB1 and CUB2 are Required to Counteract Chordin—Our second in vivo assay took advantage of the ability of full-length Xld to counteract the dorsal axis-inducing activity of Chordin (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). chordin is normally expressed on the future dorsal side of Xenopus gastrulae, and injection into ventral blastomeres induces a second dorsal axis, albeit lacking a head (7.Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). We found that injection of chordin mRNA induced a second dorsal axis in 58% of cases (Fig. 4B), an activity that was completely blocked by coinjecting xld mRNA (Fig. 4C). Axis induction by chordin was also completely blocked by coinjecting either xldC1–C3 or xldC1-C2 mRNAs (Fig. 4, D and E) but not by coinjecting either xldC1, xldC2, xldC3–C5, or xldC1+C3–C5 mRNAs (Fig. 4, F–H). These results demonstrate that only ventralizing mutants, containing both CUB1 and CUB2, can block the dorsalizing activity of Chordin. As a further test of the activity of Xld deletion constructs, we used the animal cap assay (Fig. 2A) to look at cleavage of Chordin. Animal caps were isolated from embryos co-injected with chordin and xld mRNAs, and Western blots were used to detect Chordin protein. A protein of 120 kDa was detected in cell extracts and media for all injections, whereas a shorter protein of 96 kDa was only detected in the medium of animal caps co-injected with either xld or xldC1-C2 mRNAs (Fig. 5B). XldC1–C3 was not tested in this assay, and XldC1 and XldC2 did not produce the 96-kDa protein. We note that the 120-kDa protein is always less intense in medium for animal caps co-injected with XldC1, but the 96-kDa protein is never detected even after extreme overexposure. Xld cleaves Chordin at two sites (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), after the first and third cysteine-rich domains (Fig. 5A). Cleavage at the first site will generate the 96-kDa fragment observed in this study, whereas cleavage at the second site will generate a 16-kDa fragment that was never observed, probably because it is too small for the gel system we used. The results show that only ventralizing Xld mutants cleave Chordin at the N-terminal cleavage site and that the first and second CUB domains are the minimal C-terminal domains required for chordinase activity. CUB1 and CUB2 are Required for Xld to Bind Chordin—Our results suggest that the first and second CUB domains are required for Xld to interact with its substrate Chordin. To test this, we introduced a point mutation, Y296N, that inactivates the metalloprotease domain (Fig. 6A). We reasoned that this would permit more stable interactions with Chordin than active Xld, which would cleave Chordin. This might allow co-precipitation of Xld and Chordin, as demonstrated in Drosophila for protease-inactive Tld and its substrate SOG (40.Serpe M. Ralston A. Blair S.S. O'Connor M.B. Development. 2005; 132: 2645-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Embryos co-injected with chordin and xld mRNAs were incubated in dissociation medium for 6 h, when both medium and cells were collected. Western blots of cell extracts showed that all mRNAs were translated, producing proteins of the expected size (Fig. 6B). Anti-Myc antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Xld constructs from the media and Chordin detected on Western blots with anti-HA antibodies. As expected, Chordin was co-precipitated by XldY296N, XldY296NC1–C3, and XldY296NC1-C2, but not by XldY296NC1 (Fig. 6B). Thus, CUB1-CUB2 constitute the minimum domain required for Xld to interact with Chordin. CUB1 and CUB2 Are Not Sufficient for Dominant Negative Xld Activity—Previous studies have shown that full-length XldY296N acts as a dominant negative mutant, inhibiting cleavage of Chordin by active Xld and dorsalizing Xenopus embryos (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Injected embryos have expanded dorsal-anterior structures at the expense of ventral-posterior ones (Fig. 7B), the opposite phenotype to wild-type Xld. We have used this phenotype as an assay to measure the requirement for CUB and EGF domains. As expected, XldY296NC1, XldY296NC2, and XldY296NC1+C3–C5 had no discernible effect on Xenopus development (data not shown), consistent with lack of activity in the preceding assays. Surprisingly, XldY296NC1-C2 and XldY296NC1–C3 (Fig. 7C) also had no discernible effect on injected embryos, despite having the minimal structure required for binding Chordin (Fig. 6B). This was not because of poor translation, since Western blot analysis showed that all constructs were translated efficiently (see Fig. 6B). Thus, although the first and second CUB domains are sufficient for the ventralizing activity of wild-type Xld, they are not sufficient for the dorsalizing activity of the Y296N mutant. We next made a construct in which only the fifth CUB domain was deleted and introduced the Y296N point mutation. Injecting mRNA for this construct had no discernible effect on Xenopus development, demonstrating that all of the C-terminal domains are required for the dorsalizing activity of XldY296N. Finally, we have looked to see if XldY296N deletion constructs can act as dominant negatives, using the axis-inducing assay. chordin mRNA was injected into ventral-vegetal blastomeres at the 8-cell stage, inducing a second dorsal axis in 58% of cases (Fig. 8). As expected, including xldC1–C5 mRNA in the injection reduced the frequency of duplicated axes to just 11%. The frequency of secondary axes was increased to 66% by adding a third mRNA, xldY296NC1–C5, to the injection, consistent with the reported dominant negative activity of this mutant (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the deletion constructs we tested, XldY296NC1-C2, XldY296NC1–C3, and XldY296NC1–C4, increased the frequency of secondary axes when coexpressed with Chordin and XldC1–C5 (Fig. 8). Although the first and second CUB domains are sufficient for Xld to bind Chordin, they are not sufficient to confer dominant negative activity on XldY296N. To determine the minimal structure required for Xld activity, we have used in vivo assays in which Xld is overexpressed in Xenopus embryos. Injection of full-length xld mRNA into each blastomere at the 2-cell stage weakly ventralizes Xenopus embryos, which display a reduced head and enlarged posterior (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23.Goodman S.A. Albano R. Wardle F.C. Matthews G. Tannahill D. Dale L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 195: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Internally, dorsal tissues are either absent (notochord) or reduced (nervous system), and the ventral blood island is expanded. Our results show that only the protease and the first and second CUB domains are required for this phenotype, with constructs lacking either of these domains having no discernible effect on embryos. One explanation for the lack of activity observed with mutants lacking either CUB1 or CUB2 is that these domains are required for the secretion of this extracellular protease, as suggested by a report that CUB1 is required for secretion of human BMP1 (35.Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, we find that XldC3–C5 and XldC1+C3–C5, which are inactive in the ventralization assay, are not secreted by animal cap cells (Fig. 2B). However, the inactive mutants XldC1 and XldC2 and all of the active mutants are secreted by animal cap cells. Hence, lack of secretion cannot account for lack of activity in all cases. A second explanation is that either CUB1 or CUB2 is required for N-terminal processing, which is necessary for the protease activity of Tlds (32.Leighton M. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yet all of the secreted mutants appear to be N-terminally processed, including the inactive mutants XldC1 and XldC2. Thus lack of N-terminal processing cannot account for lack of activity. To date, the only known substrate for Xld is Chordin, although studies on its mammalian homologues suggest that there may be many more (33.Greenspan D.S. Top. Cur. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Chordin is a secreted protein that directly binds and inhibits BMP2 and BMP4 (10.Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), two molecules required for the development of ventral-posterior fates in Xenopus embryos (16.Reversade B. Kuroda H. Lee H. Mays A. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3381-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Xld cleaves Chordin at two locations (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), releasing fragments with reduced affinity for BMPs (22.Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, Xld increases BMP signaling, providing an explanation for the ventralized phenotypes of Xld-injected embryos (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23.Goodman S.A. Albano R. Wardle F.C. Matthews G. Tannahill D. Dale L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 195: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, identical phenotypes are obtained following injection of xld mRNA, low concentrations of BMP4 mRNA (13.Dale L. Howes G. Price B.M. Smith J.C. Development. 1992; 115: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1997; 124: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and injection of antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides that block translation of chordin mRNA (9.Oelgeschläger M. Kuroda H. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 219-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Chordin is normally synthesized in the dorsal mesoderm of early gastrulae, and expression in ventral mesoderm causes the formation of a second dorsal axis (7.Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). This phenotype can be blocked by co-expressing full-length Xld (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and we have used this as a second in vivo assay to measure the activity of Xld deletion constructs. Our results were entirely consistent with the ventralization assay, with protease-CUB1-CUB2 being the minimum domain structure required to block axis induction by Chordin. We used the animal cap assay to show that this is also the minimum domain structure required for normal cleavage of Chordin by Xld. Surprisingly, Chordin levels were consistently reduced by XldC1, although the specific 96-kDa cleavage product was not detected. Recently, Wermter et al. (41.Wermter C. Höwell M. Hintze V. Bombosch B. Aufenvenne K. Yiallouros I. Stöcker W. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have shown that BMP1 lacking all the C-terminal domains initially cleaves procollagen VII at the same site as full-length BMP1. However, proteolysis then continues until the substrate is completely degraded. Perhaps something similar is occurring here with XldC1. Whatever the explanation, degradation of Chordin by XldC1 must be specific to in vitro conditions, since XldC1 does not block the dorsalizing activity of Chordin in vivo. CUB and EGF domains are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions and may confer substrate specificity to the attached protease (19.Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For example, BMP1 lacking all of the C-terminal domains can cleave proteins that are not substrates for the full-length protease (41.Wermter C. Höwell M. Hintze V. Bombosch B. Aufenvenne K. Yiallouros I. Stöcker W. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of mammalian Tld have been shown to bind procollagen I, with greatest affinity requiring both the CUB and EGF domains (34.Hintze V. Höwel M. Wermter C. Berkhoff E.G. Becker-Pauly C. Beermann B. Yiallouros I. Stöcker W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding is highest for the more C-terminal domains, which may also explain why mammalian Tld interacts with the ECM to a greater extent than its shorter splice variant BMP1 (42.Reynolds S.D. Zhang D. Puzas J.E. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Reynolds P.R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the C-terminal CUB and EGF domains appear to regulate the reaction kinetics of Tld and its homologue Tlr (Tld-related). Both proteases cleave SOG at similar sites, but Tld has much faster kinetics (40.Serpe M. Ralston A. Blair S.S. O'Connor M.B. Development. 2005; 132: 2645-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the protease domains are swapped, the faster kinetics are associated with the C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domains of Tld may present SOG to the protease domain more efficiently than those of Tlr. Domain swaps have also shown that the C-terminal domains of BMP1 are sufficient to confer chordinase activity on mTLL2 (36.Petropoulou V. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22616-22623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which normally does not have this activity (21.Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All of this suggests that the first and second CUB domains of Xld should be sufficient to confer binding to its substrate Chordin. We have shown that this is true by co-precipitating Chordin with a catalytically inactive mutant coupled to CUB1 and CUB2. Presumably, the catalytically inactive form was necessary because it forms more stable interactions with Chordin than wild-type Xld, since the latter cleaves Chordin. To generate catalytically inactive Xld, we used mutagenesis to replace tyrosine 296 with asparagine (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 296 is located within the protease domain and is conserved in all members of the Tld family. This mutation generates a strong antimorphic allele in Drosophila Tld (43.Childs S.R. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44.Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar) and dominant negative activity in Xld (20.Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Full-length XldY296N blocks the chordinase activity of co-expressed wild-type Xld and dorsalizes Xenopus embryos. Injected embryos display an enlarged head, nervous system, and notochord as well as reduced ventral blood island and posterior structures. The most probable explanation is that XldY296N forms stable complexes with Chordin, blocking access to the endogenous wild-type protease. We have used this dorsalized phenotype as an assay to measure the requirement of the C-terminal CUB and EGF domains for the function of Xld in vivo. To our surprise, we found that all of the C-terminal domains were required for the dorsalizing activity of XldY296N. Presumably, the first and second CUB domains are sufficient for stable interactions with Chordin but not sufficient to prevent access to the wild-type protease. Consistent with this, we find that all of the CUB domains are necessary for XldY296N to act as a dominant negative. One explanation is that the most C-terminal CUB and EGF domains increase the binding affinity for Chordin, enabling full-length Xld to displace the truncated XldY296N constructs from this substrate. This is supported by a study on the binding affinities of the CUB and EGF domains of human Tld for its substrate procollagen I (34.Hintze V. Höwel M. Wermter C. Berkhoff E.G. Becker-Pauly C. Beermann B. Yiallouros I. Stöcker W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding affinity was greatest for constructs that included the most C-terminal CUB and EGF domains. A second explanation is that the most C-terminal CUB and EGF domains are required for interactions with an additional protein that might enhance the chordinase activity of Xld. Enhancer proteins, which lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, have been described for the C-proteinase activity of Tlds, but they have no effect on their chordinase activity (36.Petropoulou V. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22616-22623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45.Moali C. Font B. Ruggiero F. Eichenberger D. Rousselle P.

PCPE1 (procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 1) binds both procollagen I and mTLL1, an interaction that requires the full complement of C-terminal CUB and EGF domains (37.Ge G. Zhang Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10786-10798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The full complement of C-terminal CUB and EGF domains is also required for PCPE1 to enhance the C-proteinase activity of BMP1 (36.Petropoulou V. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22616-22623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A candidate for an enhancer of the chordinase activity of Xld is Tsg (twisted gastrulation), which can ventralize Xenopus embryos and inhibit axis duplication by Chordin (46.Oelgeschläger M. Larraín J. Geissert D. De Robertis E. Nature. 2000; 405: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 47.Ross J.J. Shimmi O. Vilmos P. Petryk A. Kim H. Guadenz K. Hermanson S. Ekker S.C.

Holmes W.E. Brivanlou A.H. Nature. 2001; 410: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Tsg does not possess an intrinsic protease activity but forms a ternary complex with Chordin and BMP4 and enhances the cleavage of Chordin by Xld (49.Larrain J. Oelgeschläger M. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. Zakin L. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2001; 128: 4439-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to clarify the requirement of the most C-terminal CUB and EGF domains for the dominant negative activity of XldY296N. In summary, our results show that the first and second CUB domains of Xld metalloprotease are required for interactions with its substrate Chordin. However, a much larger domain structure is required for the dominant negative activity of protease-inactive Xld, indicating that the distal CUB and EGF domains may increase the binding affinity for Chordin and/or be required for interactions with other proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2062901867,"The development of neural crest-derived pigment cells has been studied extensively as a model for cellular differentiation, disease and environmental adaptation. Neural crest-derived chromatophores in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) consist of three types: melanophores, xanthophores and iridiphores. We have identified the zebrafish mutant endzone (enz), that was isolated in a screen for mutants with neural crest development phenotypes, based on an abnormal melanophore pattern. We have found that although wild-type numbers of chromatophore precursors are generated in the first day of development and migrate normally in enz mutants, the numbers of all three chromatophore cell types that ultimately develop are reduced. Further, differentiated melanophores and xanthophores subsequently lose dendricity, and iridiphores are reduced in size. We demonstrate that enz function is required cell autonomously by melanophores and that the enz locus is located on chromosome 7. In addition, zebrafish enz appears to selectively regulate chromatophore development within the neural crest lineage since all other major derivatives develop normally. Our results suggest that enz is required relatively late in the development of all three embryonic chromatophore types and is normally necessary for terminal differentiation and the maintenance of cell size and morphology. Thus, although developmental regulation of different chromatophore sublineages in zebrafish is in part genetically distinct, enz provides an example of a common regulator of neural crest-derived chromatophore differentiation and morphology."

To investigate this, we scanned subjects, using functional MRI, while they inferred the reasoning processes conducted by human agents or by computers. We found that the inference of reasoning processes conducted by human agents but not by computers induced increased activity in the precuneus but decreased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and enhanced functional connectivity between the two brain areas. The findings provide evidence for distinct neurocognitive strategies of taking others' perspective and inhibiting the process referenced to the self that are specific to the comprehension of human intelligence."
