https://openalex.org/W1670573097,"Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, which is thought to result from the effect of environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. A gene location in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, IBD1, that contributes to susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been established through multiple linkage studies1,2,3,4,5,6, but the specific gene(s) has not been identified. NOD2, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to plant disease resistance gene products is located in the peak region of linkage on chromosome 16 (ref. 7). Here we show, by using the transmission disequilibium test and case-control analysis, that a frameshift mutation caused by a cytosine insertion, 3020insC, which is expected to encode a truncated NOD2 protein, is associated with Crohn's disease. Wild-type NOD2 activates nuclear factor NF-κB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides; however, this induction was deficient in mutant NOD2. These results implicate NOD2 in susceptibility to Crohn's disease, and suggest a link between an innate immune response to bacterial components and development of disease."

https://openalex.org/W1659955759,"Many animals are regarded as relatively sedentary and specialized in marginal parts of their geographical distributions. They are expected to be slow at colonizing new habitats. Despite this, the cool margins of many species' distributions have expanded rapidly in association with recent climate warming. We examined four insect species that have expanded their geographical ranges in Britain over the past 20 years. Here we report that two butterfly species have increased the variety of habitat types that they can colonize, and that two bush cricket species show increased fractions of longer-winged (dispersive) individuals in recently founded populations. Both ecological and evolutionary processes are probably responsible for these changes. Increased habitat breadth and dispersal tendencies have resulted in about 3- to 15-fold increases in expansion rates, allowing these insects to cross habitat disjunctions that would have represented major or complete barriers to dispersal before the expansions started. The emergence of dispersive phenotypes will increase the speed at which species invade new environments, and probably underlies the responses of many species to both past and future climate change."

https://openalex.org/W1838934154,"The discovery of superconductivity at 39 K in magnesium diboride offers the possibility of a new class of low-cost, high-performance superconducting materials for magnets and electronic applications. This compound has twice the transition temperature of Nb3Sn and four times that of Nb-Ti alloy, and the vital prerequisite of strongly linked current flow has already been demonstrated. One possible drawback, however, is that the magnetic field at which superconductivity is destroyed is modest. Furthermore, the field which limits the range of practical applications-the irreversibility field H*(T)-is approximately 7 T at liquid helium temperature (4.2 K), significantly lower than about 10 T for Nb-Ti (ref. 6) and approximately 20 T for Nb3Sn (ref. 7). Here we show that MgB2 thin films that are alloyed with oxygen can exhibit a much steeper temperature dependence of H*(T) than is observed in bulk materials, yielding an H* value at 4.2 K greater than 14 T. In addition, very high critical current densities at 4.2 K are achieved: 1 MA cm-2 at 1 T and 105 A cm-2 at 10 T. These results demonstrate that MgB2 has potential for high-field superconducting applications."

https://openalex.org/W2002854395,"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause of morbidity in preterm infants. We hypothesize that the intestinal injury in this disease is a consequence of synergy among three of the major risk factors for NEC: prematurity, enteral feeding, and bacterial colonization. Together these factors result in an exaggerated inflammatory response, leading to ischemic bowel necrosis. Human milk may decrease the incidence of NEC by decreasing pathogenic bacterial colonization, promoting growth of nonpathogenic flora, promoting maturation of the intestinal barrier, and ameliorating the proinflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1560885326,"Solids consist of 1022-1023 particles per cubic centimetre, interacting through infinite-range Coulomb interactions. The linear response of a solid to a weak external perturbation is well described by the concept of non-interacting 'quasiparticles' first introduced by Landau. But interactions between quasiparticles can be substantial in dense systems. For example, studies over the past decade have shown that Coulomb correlations between quasiparticles dominate the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors, in marked contrast to the behaviour of atomic systems. These Coulomb correlations and other many-body interactions are important not only for semiconductors, but also for all condensed-matter systems."

https://openalex.org/W1550180961,"A relatively high critical temperature, Tc, approaching 40 K, places the recently-discovered superconductor magnesium diboride (MgB2) intermediate between the families of low- and copper-oxide-based high-temperature superconductors (HTS). Supercurrent flow in MgB2 is unhindered by grain boundaries, unlike the HTS materials. Thus, long polycrystalline MgB2 conductors may be easier to fabricate, and so could fill a potentially important niche of applications in the 20 to 30 K temperature range. However, one disadvantage of MgB2 is that in bulk material the critical current density, Jc, appears to drop more rapidly with increasing magnetic field than it does in the HTS phases. The magnitude and field dependence of Jc are related to the presence of structural defects that can ""pin"" the quantised magnetic vortices that permeate the material, and prevent them from moving under the action of the Lorentz force. Vortex studies suggest that it is the paucity of suitable defects in MgB2 that causes the rapid decay of Jc with field. Here we show that modest levels of atomic disorder, induced by proton irradiation, enhance the pinning, and so increase Jc significantly at high fields. We anticipate that chemical doping or mechanical processing should be capable of generating similar levels of disorder, and so achieve technologically-attractive performance in MgB2 by economically-viable routes."

https://openalex.org/W2088272869,"As a source of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), mast cells have been implicated as potential effector cells in many pathological processes. However, the mechanisms by which mast cells express, secrete, and activate TGF-beta1 have remained vague. We show here by means of RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry that isolated rat peritoneal mast cells synthesize and store large latent TGF-beta1 in their chymase 1-containing secretory granules. Mast cell stimulation and degranulation results in rapid secretion of the latent TGF-beta1, which is converted by chymase 1 into an active form recognized by the type II TGF-beta serine/threonine kinase receptor (TbetaRII). Thus, mast cells secrete active TGF-beta1 by a unique secretory mechanism in which latent TGF-beta1 and the activating enzyme chymase 1 are coreleased. The activation of latent TGF-beta1 specifically by chymase was verified using recombinant human latent TGF-beta1 and recombinant human chymase. In isolated TbetaRI- and TbetaRII-expressing peritoneal macrophages, the activated TGF-beta1 induces the expression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), whereas in the mast cells, the levels of TbetaRI, TbetaRII, and PAI-1 expression were below detection. Selective stimulation of mast cells in vivo in the rat peritoneal cavity leads to rapid overexpression of TGF-beta1 in peritoneal mast cells and of TbetaRs in peritoneal macrophages. These data strongly suggest that mast cells can act as potent paracrine effector cells both by secreting active TGF-beta1 and by enhancing its response in target cells."

https://openalex.org/W1993119976,"Regulation of angiogenesis is dependent on the net biological balance between expression of angiogenic and angiostatic molecules in the injured tissue. Using a canine model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, we demonstrated that expression of the angiostatic chemokine interferon- inducible protein (IP-10) peaked at 1–3 h of reperfusion and virtually disappeared by 24 h of reperfusion. IP-10 mRNA and protein were localized in the venular endothelium during early reperfusion of ischemic myocardial segments and were not detected after 24 h. Endothelial cell proliferation was first noted after 24 h of reperfusion, and αv β3 expressing neovessels were seen after 72–120 h of reperfusion, suggesting that neovascularization began only when IP-10 expression was markedly reduced. Isolated canine venular endothelial cells expressed high levels of IP-10 and IL-8 mRNA upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and endotoxin. Transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, but not interleukin (IL) -10, decreased TNF-α-mediated IP-10 expression in canine endothelial cells. In contrast, TNF-α-mediated IL-8 induction was not affected by incubation with IL-10 or TGF-β. Induction of angiostatic factors, such as IP-10, in the first hours following injury may be important in inhibiting premature neovessel formation, until the appropriate supportive matrix is present. IP-10 down-regulation by active TGF-β may mediate the onset of neovascularization by allowing unopposed VEGF- and IL-8-mediated angiogenic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2141488374,"Angiogenesis is important for wound healing, tumor growth, and metastasis. Endothelial cells differentiate into capillary-like structures on a laminin-1-rich matrix (Matrigel). We previously identified 20 angiogenic sites on laminin-1 (alpha1beta1gamma1) by screening 559 overlapping synthetic peptides. C16, the most potent gamma1 chain peptide, blocked laminin-1-mediated adhesion and was the only gamma1 chain peptide to block attachment to both collagen I and fibronectin. This suggested that C16 was acting via a receptor common to these substrates. We demonstrated that C16 is angiogenic in vivo. Affinity chromatography identified the integrins alpha5beta1 and alpha(v)beta3 as surface receptors. Blocking antibodies confirmed the role of these receptors in C16 adhesion. C16 does not contain an RGD sequence and, as expected, an RGD-containing peptide did not block C16 adhesion nor did C16 act via MAP kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, we identified a C16 scrambled sequence, C16S, which antagonizes the angiogenic activity of bFGF and of C16 by binding to the same receptors. Because the laminin gamma1 chain is ubiquitous in most tissues, C16 is likely an important functional site. Since the biological activity of C16 is blocked by a scrambled peptide, C16S may serve as an anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent."

Our first aim was to test the hypothesis that accumulation of electrons in cytosolic free NADH, the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), functions as this sensor. The rationale for testing this hypothesis was based on the near equilibria between extracellular and intracellular lactate/pyruvate (L/P) and free cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratios; NADH was increased or decreased by injecting lactate or pyruvate, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1983588953,"Nuclear thyroid hormone (TH) receptors (TR) play a critical role in mediating the diverse actions of TH in development, differentiation, and metabolism of most tissues, but the role of TR isoforms in muscle development and function is unclear. Therefore, we have undertaken a comprehensive expression analysis of TRalpha 1, TRbeta 1, TRbeta 2 (TH binding), and TRalpha 2 (non-TH binding) in functionally distinct porcine muscles during prenatal and postnatal development. Use of a novel and highly sensitive RNase protection assay revealed striking muscle-specific developmental profiles of all four TR isoform mRNAs in cardiac, longissimus, soleus, rhomboideus, and diaphragm. Distribution of TR isoforms varied markedly between muscles; TRalpha expression was considerably greater than TRbeta and there were significant differences in the ratios TRalpha 1:TRalpha 2, and TRbeta 1:TRbeta 2. Together with immunohistochemistry of myosin heavy chain isoforms and data on myogenesis and maturation of the TH axis, these findings provide new evidence that highlights central roles for 1) TRalpha isoforms in fetal myogenesis, 2) the ratio TRalpha 1:TRalpha 2 in determining cardiac and skeletal muscle phenotype and function; 3) TRbeta in maintaining a basal level of cellular response to TH throughout development and a specific maturational function around birth. These findings suggest that events disrupting normal developmental profiles of TR isoforms may impair optimal function of cardiac and skeletal muscles."

https://openalex.org/W2103488255,"Leptin, the ob gene product, is produced by adipose tissue and is submitted to a complex hormonal and metabolic regulation. Leptin plays a critical role in the balance of body weight. Here we report on secretion and hormonal regulation of leptin by brown adipocytes. Using the recently established T37i cell line, we show that leptin expression and secretion occurred as a function of cell differentiation. In differentiated T37i cells, insulin induced leptin release ( approximately 0.25 ng/10(6) cells/h) in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=0.1 nM), and this was totally suppressed by beta3-adrenergic ligand, thiazolidinedione, cycloheximide, or actinomycin D. Insulin induced a strong, rapid (within 2 h) but transient fivefold increase in leptin mRNA levels. This transcriptional control of ob gene expression by insulin involved both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and MAP kinase-dependent pathways. Glucocorticoids inhibited both insulin-stimulated leptin secretion and ob gene expression without affecting leptin mRNA stability (t(1/2)=3h05). Altogether, our results demonstrate that brown adipocytes express and secrete leptin, whose hormonal regulation clearly differs from that described in white adipose tissue. These findings point to tissue-specific molecular mechanisms and suggest that leptin might exert direct effects on energy homeostasis through an autocrine mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2035223599,"Growth hormone (GH) has pleiotropic effects on cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism. Pituitary GH is important for the normal regulation of hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR), for the enzymatic activity of bile acid regulatory cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (C7alphaOH), and for the maintenance of resistance to dietary cholesterol. The present study aimed to determine whether GH has beneficial effects on plasma lipids and hepatic cholesterol metabolism in mice devoid of LDLR. Compared with wild-type controls, LDLR-deficient mice had approximately 250% elevated plasma total cholesterol and approximately 50% increased hepatic cholesterol levels; hepatic HMG CoA reductase activity was reduced by 70%, whereas C7alphaOH activity was increased by 40%. In LDLR mice, GH infusion reduced plasma cholesterol and triglycerides up to 40%, whereas HMG CoA reductase and C7alphaOH activities were stimulated by approximately 50% and 110% respectively. GH also stimulated HMG CoA reductase and C7alphaOH activities in control mice, whereas hepatic LDLR and plasma lipoproteins were unchanged. The effects of cholestyramine and atorvastatin on C7alphaOH in LDLR-deficient mice were potentiated by GH, and this was associated with a further reduction in plasma cholesterol. GH treatment reduces plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and stimulates C7alphaOH activity in mice devoid of LDLR, particularly in combination with resin or statin treatment. The potential of GH therapy in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia should be evaluated."
