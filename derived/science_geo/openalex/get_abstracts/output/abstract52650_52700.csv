https://openalex.org/W1651271817,"Abstract An ATPase that accounts for about 0.3% of the total cell protein has been isolated in 90% purity from Acanthamoeba castellanii. The enzyme has been identified as a myosin-like ATPase by the following criteria. Maximal enzymatic activity occurs in the presence of EDTA and 0.5 m KCl, and is only 10 to 20% as high in the presence of Ca2+ and less than 1% in the presence of Mg2+. The Mg2+ ATPase is activated by actin under physiological conditions and the enzyme binds to actin filaments in the absence but not in the presence of ATP. Acanthamoeba myosin shows some activity toward nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP but does not hydrolyze ADP or AMP. In contrast to myosins from other sources, Acanthamoeba myosin is soluble under physiological conditions, and its partition coefficient on gel filtration suggests a native molecular weight of about 180,000, which is smaller than other myosins. Several different experiments show that the isolated molecule is not formed by proteolytic cleavage of a larger native protein. The purified enzyme consists of three polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 140,000, 16,000, and 14,000. The amino composition is remarkable for the absence of cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1480709067,"Abstract Membranes have been isolated from fresh rectal glands of the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias, in which the specific activity of the (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NaK ATPase) is as high as 400 µmoles of Pi per mg of protein per hour. Membranes isolated from frozen rectal glands have only one-fourth to one-third this specific activity. Solubilization of membranes from frozen glands with the nonionic detergent Lubrol WX activates the NaK ATPase 2-fold, but there is no activation of the enzyme with membranes from fresh glands. Purification of Lubrol extracts by zonal centrifugation and a novel ammonium sulfate fractionation gives an enzyme preparation with a specific activity of 1,500 µmoles of Pi per mg of protein per hour. The same specific activity and gel pattern is obtained with enzyme purified from membranes from either fresh or frozen glands. The loss of Lubrol activation of the enzyme from frozen glands occurs on zonal centrifugation, where free Lubrol is removed. The over-all yield of enzyme from the membrane stage is 70%. A mince of 10 rectal glands weighing about 10 to 15 g fresh weight yields about 20 to 30 mg of purified enzyme. The enzyme is completely stable at 0° for 10 days in either the membranous form or in the most highly purified form. It is stable on freezing at -70°. Disc gel electrophoresis shows a gradual elimination of proprotein bands on purification. At the final stage of purification, scanning of Coomassie blue-stained gels gives 72% of the protein as the 97,000 molecular weight catalytic subunit, 19% as the 55,000 molecular weight glycoprotein, and 8.5% as the protein running with the tracking dye. The catalytic subunit and the glycoprotein can be isolated in milligram quantities by solubilization and chromatography on Sephadex G-150. About 90% of the protein applied to the column can be recovered. Sephadex chromatography gives a protein composition of 66% for the catalytic subunit, 28% for the glycoprotein, and 5% for the protein running with the tracking dye. The catalytic subunit and the glycoprotein enrich more or less in parallel as purification proceeds. At the last stage of purification, both proteins are found in the form of vesicles, which bear a striking resemblance on negative staining to purified cytochrome oxidase. Electron-translucent rods and rings which are approximately 80 A in diameter are also formed with projections of about 35 to 55 A at regular intervals. These rods and rings resemble reconstituted oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase. The projections appear to be more hydrophilic, and this, coupled with their size, suggests that they are the glycoprotein. Incubation of the enzyme with [γ-32P]ATP, magnesium, and sodium gives 4,080 pmoles of acyl phosphate per mg of protein, which is 2 to 3 times higher than the highest levels of phosphorylation previously reported, thus attesting to the high purity of the enzyme preparation (the level of phosphorylation is generally accepted as being proportional to the number of NaK ATPase molecules in the preparation). The turnover number of the preparation is 6,300 min-1, which is within the range found for most NaK ATPase preparations from different organs and species. Arguments are presented for and against the view that the glycoprotein is a subunit of the NaK ATPase. If the catalytic subunit of molecular weight of 97,000 and the glycoprotein of molecular weight of 55,000 are both integral components of the NaK ATPase, the enzyme is 90 to 95% pure. If the 97,000 molecular weight subunit is the only subunit in the enzyme, the present preparation is 66 to 72% pure."
https://openalex.org/W2160805842,"The changes in the subunit structure of human fibrinogen during plasmin digestion have been followed sequentially by examining the degraded products electrophoretically in sodium dodecyl sulfate on polyacrylamide gels in the absence or presence of mercaptoethanol. On the basis of the molecular weights of the products, their carbohydrate content, and the relative amounts of each product present during digestion, it has been possible to deduce the sequence of structural changes in fibrinogen during digestion and the polypeptide chain composition of the major transient and terminal digestion products. The α chains, which contain no detectable carbohydrate, were the first subunits in fibrinogen to be degraded by plasmin. The β chains, which contain carbohydrate, were degraded more slowly than α chains. The initial, but transient, degradation product, Fragment X, was structurally heterogeneous. Forms appearing early in the digestion contained extensively degraded α chains and intact β and γ chains. The next transient fragment formed contained extensively degraded α chains and partially degraded β chains. The γ chains of fibrinogen, which also contain carbohydrate, were more resistant than α and β chains, but on prolonged digestion, were cleaved by plasmin. As γ chains begin to be degraded, and the α and β chains are further degraded, other forms of Fragment X appear along with Fragments D and Y. On the basis of this sequence of structural changes it has been possible to deduce the general subunit structure of the major terminal digestion products (Fragments D and E). Fragment D contains partially degraded β and γ chains and extensively degraded α chains combined by disulfide bonds. Fragment E contains extensively degraded α, β, and γ chains which are also combined through disulfide bonds. A scheme describing these structural changes has been proposed. The ability of partially degraded fibrinogen to form visible clots on treatment with thrombin- and fibrin-stabilizing factor has also been examined. Digestion products with extensively degraded α chains retain the ability to form fibrin-like clots, although as these species are degraded further by digestion of their β and γ chains, the ability to clot is lost."
https://openalex.org/W1529206780,"Abstract Microsomal fraction from mouse mastocytoma was incubated for 60 min with UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid and unlabeled UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, producing nonsulfated labeled polysaccharide. Continued incubation for an additional 60-min period, in the presence of 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate, yielded sulfated, heparin-like polymer. The incorporation of 14C was terminated at the beginning of the sulfation period, by including an excess of unlabeled UDP-glucuronic acid in the incubation mixtures. The distribution in the nonsulfated and chase-sulfated 14C-polysaccharides, respectively, of N-unsubstituted, N-acetylated, and N-sulfated glucosamine residues was investigated by selective deamination with nitrous acid. Samples were treated at room temperature with 0.24 m NaNO2 in 1.8 m acetic acid for 80 min (Reaction A) or with 3.9 m NaNO2 in 0.28 m acetic acid for 10 min (Reaction B). In Reaction A the glycosidic bonds of glucosamine residues having either unsubstituted or sulfated amino groups were cleaved, whereas in Reaction B N-unsubstituted glucosamine units only were attacked. The effect of deamination on the labeled polysaccharide preparations was studied by gel chromatography of the products, on Sephadex G-25. Characterization of the nonsulfated polysaccharide, by use of these methods, indicated that about half of the glucosamine residues had unsubstituted amino groups. This result was confirmed by ion exchange chromatography, on DEAE-cellulose, which showed the presence of a polymer with less polyanion character than standard hyaluronic acid. After N-acetylation, the elution pattern of this intermediary polysaccharide was the same as that of hyaluronic acid. The sulfated polysaccharide contained N-sulfated and N-acetylated but no N-unsubstituted glucosamine units. It is concluded that N-deacetylation of the heparin precursor polysaccharide occurs in the absence of 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate and that the amino groups thus exposed can serve as acceptors of sulfate residues."

When given orally, AY-22,284 markedly decreased the accumulation of polyols in the lenses and sciatic nerves of galactosemic rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In addition, treatment of galactosemic rats with AY-22,284 effectively suppressed the formation of cataracts."

https://openalex.org/W2052573541,"The mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) and the cell mediated lympholysis (CML) assays are used as in vitro models of the afferent, or recognitive, and efferent, or destructive, phases of the homograft reaction. Activity in both of these tests has been related to differences at the major histocompatibility complex, HL-A in man and H-2 in mouse. Recent evidence suggests that the presumed cell surface differences which lead to cell proliferation in MLC are different from those which act as a target for CML. Data are presented providing further support for this hypothesis; in addition separate cell populations may respond to the differences which activate cells in MLC and to the differences which serve as targets for CML. There thus appears to be a dichotomy both for genetic control of, and cell populations involved in, the recognitive and destructive phases of cell mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1511723719,"Abstract Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle catalyze a rapid Pi ⇄ HOH exchange in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of ATP and Ca2+. The capacity for oxygen exchange is about 14 times the potential capacity for ATP cleavage in the presence of Ca2+. No detectable exchange is found without added MgCl2. The exchange is unaffected by oligomycin, 2, 4-dinitrophenol, or ouabain, but strongly inhibited by low concentrations of Ca2+ in the medium. The Ca2+ ion concentration giving a half-maximum inhibition is 2.0 µm in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. A Hill plot of the Ca2+ inhibition gives a straight line with a Hill coefficient of 1.8. The Ca2+ inhibition is competitively overcome by additional Mg2+. The Pi ⇄ HOH exchange is almost completely inhibited by the detergent Triton X-100 at low concentrations in which the ATPase activity is not disturbed. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles are phosphorylated by Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ under conditions similar to those for the Pi ⇄ HOH exchange. The phosphorylation requires Mg2+ and is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of Ca2+. The response of the phosphorylation to Ca2+ is quite similar to that of the Pi ⇄ HOH exchange; the Ca2+ ion concentration giving a half-maximum inhibition is 2.0 µm in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, and the Hill coefficient is about 2.0. The various properties of the exchange give strong support to the probability that it results from reversal of steps in the over-all process associated with Ca2+ transport driven by ATP cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1489122213,"This report describes a rapid procedure for purification of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase from canine kidney outer medulla with a yield of 16 to 18 mg of protein per 100 g of tissue. The purified enzyme manifests the highest specific activity reported to date for a mammalian tissue source and binds between 3,000 and 4,000 pmoles of [3H]ouabain per mg of protein. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the detergent-solubilized enzyme yields two protein peaks of 89,000 and 56,000 daltons. The former is phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of magnesium and sodium and the latter is stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent. [3H]-ouabain reacts with the purified enzyme in a manner similar to that of crude enzyme preparations. Ouabain-enzyme complexes were formed in the presence of different ligands [Mg + ATP + Na], [Mg + Pi], [Mn], [Mg + ATP], and all complexes dissociated at similar rates when chase was carried out in presence of binding ligands. Using ouabainbinding data, we calculate a turnover number of 6,480 min-1."
https://openalex.org/W1541441427,"In order to characterize part of an active center of sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase, namely the active site of phosphorylation, the enzyme was phosphorylated with [32P]ATP and denatured with acid. The denatured [32P]phosphoenzyme was digested to a limit [32P]phosphotripeptide with Pronase. The limit phosphotripeptide was compared with the synthetic model compounds, [32P]prolylphosphoaspartyllysine and [32P]prolylphosphoglutamyllysine with respect to pH-hydrolysis profile, sensitivity to digestion by carboxypeptidase B, and isoelectric point. The active site phosphotripeptide closely resembled the synthetic phosphoaspartyl peptide and clearly differed from the synthetic phosphoglutamyl peptide in these respects. These similarities are strong, but not conclusive, evidence that the active site of this enzyme is the β-carboxyl group of an aspartic acid residue. Previous work has shown that the limit phosphotripeptide contains an NH2-terminal serine or threonine residue and a COOH-terminal lysine residue. The enzyme source was guinea pig kidneys. In order to characterize the active site before denaturation, the sensitivity of the phosphate group to hydroxylamine was tested. The enzyme was first treated with N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit acceleration of dephosphorylation due to a resemblance between hydroxylamine and potassium ion. The treated enzyme was subsequently phosphorylated by [32P]adenosine triphosphate and the phosphoenzyme was chased with unlabeled adenosine triphosphate. During the chase, addition of hydroxylamine produced a dephosphorylation which was 45-fold faster than that of the isolated phosphotripeptide under the same experimental conditions. It is concluded that the phosphoenzyme has sufficient sensitivity to hydroxylamine before denaturation to qualify as an acyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1541557006,"Abstract Formation of a complex between aurovertin and soluble mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase (F1) was accompanied by a 55-fold enhancement of fluorescence, an increase in the polarization of fluorescence from 0.278 for the free form to 0.375 for the bound form and a decrease in absorption at 366 nm. The fluorescence intensity of the complex was partially quenched by addition of ATP or Mg++ and enhanced by ADP. Two binding sites for aurovertin were found on F1 in the presence of ATP and one site in the presence of either ADP, Mg++, or dilute buffer. The dissociation constants of the fluorescent complex were 0.52, 0.07, 0.013, and 0.04 µm in the presence of ATP, ADP, Mg++, or in buffer, respectively. It is proposed that of the two binding sites for aurovertin on F1, only one site participates in inhibition of ATPase activity. Addition of succinate to a fluorescent complex of aurovertin and submitochondrial particles gave rise to an enhancement of fluorescence which depended on maintenance of an energized state. The changes in fluorescence of bound aurovertin were interpreted in terms of changes in the conformational state of the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1975312710,"The activity of choline acetyltransferase was more than tenfold greater in combined cultures of spinal cord and muscle cells than in cultures of spinal cord cells alone. This increase was associated with the formation of functional neuromuscular junctions in culture. Counts of silver-stained cells and determinations of other enzyme activities indicated that the increased choline acetyltransferase activity was not due to nonspecific neuronal survival but reflected greater activity in the surviving neurons. Hence, muscle had a marked, highly specific trophic effect on the cholinergic neurons that innervated it."

https://openalex.org/W1503120391,"Abstract Calcium uptake, Ca2+-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase activity, and Ca2+-dependent transfer of the γ-phosphate of nucleoside triphosphate to the membrane protein of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments were studied using different substrates. Ca2+ is a limiting factor for maximal membrane phosphorylation. The Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal membrane phosphorylation varies with the temperature, the substrate used, and its concentration. Using ITP or GTP concentrations ranging from 10 µm to 60 µm at 0°, it is possible to measure the initial rate of membrane phosphorylation. With the use of ATP, this rate is very fast and cannot be measured by the techniques employed. The apparent Km for membrane phosphorylation at 0° was determined for GTP (0.45 µm) and ITP (0.31 µm). Through competitive experiments the apparent Km of other substrates were calculated. The values found were: acetyl phosphate, 3.8 x 10-4 m; UTP, 1.3 x 10-4 m; CTP, 4.0 x 10-5 m, and ATP, 2.4 x 10-8 m. The membrane phosphorylation reaction can be reversed by different nucleoside diphosphates. At 0° the ability of CDP, IDP, or GDP to reverse this reaction is 180 times lower than ADP. ITP, GTP, and ATP increase the rate of membrane dephosphorylation. Alkali ions inhibit the Ca2+ transport, substrate hydrolysis, and membrane phosphorylation of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The inhibitory activity of Na+ and K+ varies with the substrate used and its concentration, the Ca2+ concentration and the temperature. A reaction sequence is proposed on the basis of the data presented."
https://openalex.org/W1508180802,"Purified Acanthamoeba myosin binds reversibly to filaments of muscle actin forming a complex which is dissociated by Mg2+ and ATP. Electron microscopy reveals that the Acanthamoeba myosin binds to actin filaments in a regular way which accentuates the helical repeat of the actin filaments but the myosin does not form the distinct arrowhead-shaped complexes typical of other actin-myosin complexes. Actin filaments treated with Acanthamoeba myosin are usually found closely spaced in parallel arrays suggesting that the Acanthamoeba myosin crosslinks the filaments. Under physiological conditions actin activates the Mg2+ ATPase of the Acanthamoeba myosin but this activation requires the presence of another Acanthamoeba protein which we have named the cofactor protein. Cofactor protein has been partially purified and the available data suggest that it is composed of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 97,000. The Mg2+ ATPase activity that results from the interaction of Acanthamoeba myosin, cofactor, and actin is dependent on the concentration of each of these proteins but it is not affected by the concentration of Ca2+. The cofactor protein, therefore, does not seem to be analagous to the Ca2+-sensitive control proteins found in the muscles of higher animals."
https://openalex.org/W2240353708,"Abstract A large fraction with the properties of a dermatan sulfate-chondroitin sulfate copolymer was obtained from the meniscus (semilunar cartilage) of the human knee joint. This fraction appeared to be homogeneous with respect to charge density, as judged by its behavior on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, but it was further resolved into a number of subfractions by ethanol fractionation, by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate, and by chromatography on Sephadex G-200. Analyses of these subfractions showed that the copolymer was composed of a series of variants whose properties could be accounted for by a gradual variation in the proportion of l-iduronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate units and d-glucuronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate units. These results indicate that meniscus mucopolysaccharides represent a separate family of mucopolysaccharides that may be specifically adapted to the function of fibrous (collagen-rich) cartilages, and further suggest that any attempt to obtain a mucopolysaccharide sample for structural study must take into consideration this type of polymorphism as well as the scarcity of reliable methods for purification of such mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W2060789181,"Total activities of acid hydrolases in liver of two patients with mucopolysaccharidosis are decreased for beta-galactosidase, alpha-galactosidase, and arylsulfatase A; total activities of four other hydrolases are normal or increased. The isoenzyme distribution of five hydrolases (beta-glucuronidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta- galactosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and alpha-galactosidase) is ábnormal in that the isoelectric points (by isoelectric focusing) of these enzymes are more acid than in control liver. Along with the isoenzyme abnormalities different kinds of glycolipids were stored in kidney, liver, and brain. The isoenzyme abnormalities can be reproduced in vitro by addition of chondroitin sulfate to a homogenate of normal liver, suggesting that stable binding occurs between mucopolysaccharides and the hydrolase molecules. After the addition of chondroitin sulfate, the total activity of beta-galactosidase is inhibited, whereas other hydrolases are affected only slightly or not at all."
https://openalex.org/W1561824731,"Abstract 1. Aerobic lactic acid production in ascites tumor cells was not inhibited by rutamycin, indicating that the ADP and Pi required to sustain glycolysis were not supplied by mitochondrial ATPase. In contrast, the marked stimulation of lactic acid production induced by dinitrophenol was eliminated by rutamycin. 2. Parallel studies on the inhibition of lactic acid production and monovalent cation transport by ouabain revealed a close relationship between the two processes. About 1 mole of lactic acid was formed per mole of monovalent cation translocated. 3. The depression of glycolysis by ouabain was shown to result from the inhibition of (Na+, K+)-ATPase rather than from a lack of K+ as indicated by the high rate of aerobic glycolysis induced by dinitrophenol in the presence of ouabain. In the absence of dinitrophenol both Na+ and K+ were required for optimal glycolysis. 4. Evidence for a sodium-linked transport of Pi was obtained. 5. Dextran sulfate and other related compounds were found to have a profound effect on the permeability properties of ascites tumor cells. Glycolysis was markedly inhibited by dextran sulfate, and loss of intracellular ions, adenine nucleotides, and protein was demonstrated. In the presence of excess adenine nucleotides and Pi in the medium, dextran sulfate did not inhibit; in fact, it consistently stimulated glycolysis. It was shown that under these conditions AMP entered the cells and was converted into ATP. 6. The regulation of glycolysis in tumor cells by energy-linked ion transport is discussed."

Immunofluorescent and electron microscopic observations of the choroid plexus and renal glomeruli of (NZB x W)F(1) mice reveal deposits of host immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the third complement component which appear shortly after the development of ANA and ADNA in the circulation. Additionally, enhancement of ADNA responses accelerates the appearance and severity of IgG deposits in the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus may be a favored site for the deposition of immune complexes and the neuropsychiatric findings in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and some patients with acute or chronic infections may be related in part to immune complex disease of the choroid plexus."
https://openalex.org/W1564834666,"Abstract The behavior of the recBC DNase of Escherichia coli with a variety of substrates has been investigated. Duplex circular DNA is resistant to digestion, is not a cofactor for the DNA-dependent ATPase, and does not effectively compete for enzyme with substrate DNAs. Treatment of duplex circles with ultraviolet light or x-rays does not render them susceptible to the enzyme nor does nicking with pancreatic DNase. In the latter case the nicks are neither sealed nor translocated. Removal of the phosphomonoester group from a nick has no effect, but localized denaturation or removal of approximately five nucleotides at a nick renders duplex circles susceptible to digestion. The enzyme appears to digest linear DNA by a processive mechanism in which the rate is limited by the initiation of digestion of a molecule. It shows no apparent polarity of degradation, nor does it appear to be affected by the presence or absence of terminal phosphate groups. The original terminal nucleotides are dispersed among all classes of the products in a limit digest, so they do not constitute a special type of product. Linear DNA treated with ultraviolet light or x-rays is degraded by the enzyme, but RNA-DNA hybrid is resistant. The latter substrate can serve as cofactor for the DNA-dependent ATPase, however, effectively uncoupling the two activities. At ATP concentrations of 1 mm or greater the enzyme generates early in the reaction large, sedimentable DNA fragments, as well as nonsedimentable products. The large fragments are primarily duplex, but contain single-stranded regions at 5' termini and probably at 3' termini at roughly equal frequency."

https://openalex.org/W1590300599,"Abstract Plasma membranes isolated from rabbit muscle possessed the ability to bind and accumulate calcium ions; these processes required ATP and Mg2+. Binding of Ca2+ was rapid, reaching a maximum within 30 s and was greatly increased in the presence of oxalate or phosphate. The concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and ATP required for half-maximal ATP-dependent calcium binding were 20 µm, 150 µm, and 20 to 30 µm, respectively. In the presence of oxalate, half-maximal calcium accumulation occurred at 120 µm ATP and 500 µm Mg2+. Both binding and accumulation were highly sensitive to pH, the maximum being at pH 5.5 to 6.0. Bound calcium could be released by depleting ATP from the medium. Sodium or potassium (100 mm) and high concentrations of Mg2+ promoted, while La3+ up to 6 mm inhibited the release process. Rapidity of the binding and release of Ca2+ by the sarcolemma suggests its possible involvement in the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1597522600,"Abstract Isolated, perfused canine brain preparations were used to investigate cerebral metabolism during anoxia and subsequent recovery. The metabolic response of a 6-min perfusion with anoxic blood (poo2 l 10 mm Hg), followed by perfusion for up to 2 hours with normal oxygenated blood, was investigated in 41 separate experiments. Net uptake of glucose and efflux of lactate were calculated from their arteriovenous differences. Concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates, the adenine nucleotides, and glycogen were determined from analyses of cerebral cortex samples which were frozen in situ. In the canine brain there is approximately a 5-fold increase in the glycolytic rate after 1 min of anoxia. During this period, the rate of glucose uptake increases 140% by a mechanism which appears to be metabolically controlled. The regulatory enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and glycogen phosphorylase are also markedly stimulated. Although brain lactic acid increases from 1.78 to 16.1 µmoles per g during anoxia, the increase in lactate efflux from the brain is minimal. Six minutes of anoxia causes the adenylate energy charge to decrease from 0.89 to 0.56. As a result of aerobic perfusion following anoxia, the adenylate energy charge and the rate of glucose uptake return to normal within about 5 min. The rates of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase are clearly and significantly impeded, which serves to decrease the glycolytic flux. During the 2-hour recovery period, the rate of glycolysis and the levels of glycolytic intermediates return to normal, except for lactate, pyruvate, and glucose 6-phosphate which remain elevated. No net synthesis of glycogen occurs. An inhibiting effect of halothane anesthesia on brain phosphofructokinase was also observed."
https://openalex.org/W1505084238,"Abstract Sodium-potassium transport adenosine triphosphatase was partially purified from the outer medulla of rabbit kidney. Paired, identical aliquots of the enzyme were alkylated with N-ethyl[3H]maleimide and N-ethyl[14C]maleimide in the absence and presence of physiological ligands (Na+, Mg2+, ATP, and K+) and inhibitory drugs (ouabain and oligomycin). The pairs were then combined and submitted to preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. In the absence of physiological ligands (E1 conformation), a peptide of 98,000 daltons was found to contain sulfhydryl groups protected by Na+ plus ATP. In the presence of Mg2+ (E2 conformation), sulfhydryl groups on the same peptide were protected by K+ or ouabain. In the presence of Na+, Mg2+, and ATP (phosphorylated state), additional sulfhydryl groups on the 98,000-dalton peptide were exposed to alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide. Both ouabain and oligomycin produced further increases in sulfhydryl group exposure when present during the formation of the phosphopeptide intermediate. All effects of experimental ligands on sulfhydryl group reactivity were confined to the 98,000-dalton peptide, and attempts to further separate peptides within this band by repeated electrophoresis or by hydroxylapatite chromatography were unsuccessful."

https://openalex.org/W1514278752,"Abstract ATP induces calcium binding to a cardiac relaxing system preparation (sarcoplasmic reticulum; CRS) under specific conditions. This is followed by spontaneous calcium release, a thermodynamically and kinetically distinct process that represents a separate phase of an ATP-dependent binding-release cycle. Inhibitors of calcium binding studied include X537A, a broadly specific antibiotic ionophore, and arsenate. These inhibitors were significantly more potent on calcium uptake (accumulation in the presence of oxalate) than on binding (accumulation in the absence of oxalate). Inhibition decreased with decreasing magnesium concentration suggesting that the agents were acting primarily on a magnesium-dependent process. Computer analysis of the kinetics of ATP-dependent calcium binding to CRS suggested that there are two distinct binding sites or components that differ in response to magnesium, pH, and in their sensitivity to the actions of inhibitors. Under conditions of optimal ATP and calcium concentrations, a continuous curve for calcium binding adhered to a pseudo-first order model for occupation of free calcium binding sites: A + B = A0e-kat + B0e-kbt. Site A required very low magnesium (40% of maximal binding at 9 µm magnesium), was ATP-specific and was less sensitive to the inhibitors of calcium binding, X537A (Ki, 10 to 15 µg per mg) and arsenate (unaffected by concentrations up to 10 mm). Calcium was released spontaneously from Site A in the presence or absence of oxalate, therefore, this pool of calcium does not appear to be connected to an oxalate space (vesicular lumen). In contrast, Site B was related to calcium transport (i.e. uptake, see above) in that it required a relatively high concentration of magnesium (Km, 2.7 to 4.7 mm) and was much more sensitive to the noncompetitive inhibitors, X537A (Ki, 3.7 µg per mg) and arsenate (Ki, 1 to 2 mm). The predicted initial rates of calcium binding to Site B (rate = kB0) were similar to the average range of rates of calcium uptake in the presence of 5 mm oxalate. Nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP activated only Site B suboptimally (50 to 60%). When Site B was activated by nucleotides other than ATP, its sensitivity to pH, arsenate, and X537A was unchanged; however, the magnesium requirement of Site B disappeared. Nucleotides other than ATP did not activate the calcium-dependent ATPase and did not support continuous calcium uptake. Sodium azide specifically inhibited the rate of calcium release without affecting binding. All of the inhibitors were specific for the described individual phases and did not affect calcium-dependent ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1608238415,"Abstract To provide methods applicable to the study of human articular cartilage, we have studied the extraction, fractionation, and physical characterization of proteoglycans from bovine articular cartilage. Two dissociative solvents, MgCl2 and GuHCl, differ sharply in the amount of the proteoglycan extracted from articular cartilage and the macromolecular species present in the initially extracted crude proteoglycan. PG(MgCl2), the crude proteoglycan extracted with 3 m MgCl2, is obtained in a yield of 0.16 g per g of dry cartilage, and accounts for 50% of the uronate and 23% of the hexose of the whole cartilage. PG(GuHCl), the crude proteoglycan extracted with 4 m GuHCl, is obtained in a yield of 0.26 g per g of dry cartilage, and accounts for 81% of the uronate and 61% of the hexose of the whole cartilage. On analytical ultracentrifugation in associative solvents, PG(MgCl2) shows three components: a 4 S protein, a 16 S proteoglycan species, and a 60 to 70 S proteoglycan aggregate. Equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of PG(MgCl2) under associative conditions in 4 m CsCl results in a sharp separation of the 4 S protein into the top sixth of the gradient, and of the 16 S species and 70 S aggregate into the bottom sixth of the gradient. On analytical ultracentrifugation in associative solvents, PG(GuHCl) shows a 4 S protein, a 16 S proteoglycan species, and a 56 S proteoglycan aggregate. The proteoglycan aggregate in either PG(MgCl2) or PG(GuHCl) is completely and reversibly dissociable in either 3 m MgCl2 or 3 m GuHCl. However, while dissociation in 3 m MgCl2 yields the 16 S species, dissociation in 3 m GuHCl yields a 10.5 S proteoglycan subunit. The isolated 16 S proteoglycan species has an intrinsic viscosity of 184 ml per g, a partial specific volume of 0.594 ml per g, and a molecular weight of 1.6 x 106. PG(GuHCl) contains a high molecular weight complex, not present in PG(MgCl2). The complex differs from the 70 S proteoglycan aggregate in size, as indicated by its sedimentation properties; in composition, as indicated by its lower proteoglycan and higher protein and collagen contents; and, in the noncovalent bonds involved in its formation, as indicated by its dissociation in 3 m GuHCl but not in 3 m MgCl2. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the dissociated complex in 3 m GuHCl shows that a 2.7 S protein is a major component of the complex. None of the 2.7 S protein is detectable in preparations of PG(MgCl2) or of the 70 S aggregate. Two states of macromolecular organization of proteoglycans appear to exist in articular cartilage. The first, and lower level of organization is that of the 70 S proteoglycan aggregate. The second and higher level of organization is that of the complex formed by the noncovalent association of proteoglycans and collagen in the presence of the 2.7 S protein."
https://openalex.org/W2047968791,Extracts of cultured normal human skin fibroblasts released radioactivity from a (14)C-labeled heptasaccharide prepared by addition of [(14)C]N-acetylgalactosamine to the nonreducing terminus of a hexasaccharide derived from chondroitin 4-sulfate whereas fibroblast extracts from patients with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff-Jatzkewitz diseases did not. The results suggest that N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase A is responsible for degradation of the oligosaccharide substrate.
https://openalex.org/W1485267531,"Abstract The NH2-terminal 12-residue sequences of human and rabbit plasminogens were determined to be Glu-Pro-Leu-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Val-Asn-X-Gln-Gly-Ala-. The cat plasminogen 12-residue sequence differed only in the 1st residue, in which aspartic acid replaced glutamic acid. The bovine plasminogen NH2-terminal 7-residue sequence was determined to be Asp-Leu-Leu-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Val-. The NH2-terminal residue of dog plasminogen is blocked since the protein could not be sequenced. The NH2-terminal 5-residue sequences of the isolated S-carboxymethyl heavy (A) chain derivatives of cat, dog, rabbit, and bovine plasmins (urokinase-activated) were determined and found to be homologous with each other and with the human S-carboxymethyl heavy (A) chain 5-residue sequence. These NH2-terminal sequences were different from those found in the five mammalian zymogens studied, indicating a specific cleavage at the NH2-terminal end of each zymogen during activation at apparently the same position in the peptide chain. These sequences are also homologous with the human Lys-plasminogen NH2-terminal sequence. The NH2-terminal 21-residue sequences of the isolated S-carboxymethyl light (B) chain derivatives of cat, dog, rabbit, and bovine plasmins (urokinase-activated) were determined and found to be homologous with each other and with a previously reported human S-carboxymethyl light (B) chain 20-residue sequence (Robbins, K. C., Bernabe, P., Arzadon, L., and Summaria, L. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6757–6762). The human NH2-terminal 21-residue sequence was determined to be Val-Val-Gly-Gly-Cys-Val-Ala-His-Pro-His-Ser-Trp-Pro-Trp-Gln-Val-Val-Leu-Leu-Arg-Arg-. The 5th residue previously reported as glutamine is incorrect and is cysteine in all the sequences. This cysteine is part of the hinge disulfide bond connecting the heavy (A) and light (B) chains of human plasmin. The evolutionary changes in this portion of the molecule appear to be in the pairs of basic residues at positions 8 and 10, and 20 and 21, and in the pairs of neutral residues at positions 16 and 17. The replacement of serine at the 17th residue of bovine light (B) chain is a rather significant evolutionary change which could be related to the activator binding site in bovine plasminogen for streptokinase. The mechanism of activation of plasminogen to plasmin by urokinase involves two specific peptide bond cleavages instead of one previously reported by us for the activation of human Lys-plasminogen (Robbins, K. C., Summaria, L., Hsieh, B., and Shah, R. J. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 2333–2342). The specific cleavage of the sensitive arginyl-valine peptide bond in the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule to give the two-chain plasmin molecule and the specific cleavage of an X-arginyl, or X-lysyl, peptide bond in the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule are the two principal events which occur during activation of the zymogen. The latter event apparently results in the release of a peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1601365962,"Abstract Human blood platelets exposed to 2 um tritiated cytochalasin D showed maximum incorporation within 5 min. Tritiated cytochalasin D was found to be bound to thrombosthenin M (platelet myosin), when subjected to gel exclusion chromatography in 0.6 m KCl. Using a Millipore filtration technique, binding at low ionic strength of tritiated cytochalasin D to purified preparations of contractile proteins, showed that platelet thrombosthenin M and muscle myosin, but not actin, was involved (0.9 mole of cytochalasin D per mole of protein). Prior treatment of these proteins with nonradioactive cytochalasin D, followed by exposure to the labeled alkaloid, showed little exchange under these conditions. Binding data gave a value of 0.99 ± 0.11 sites per 4.6 x 106 g of muscle myosin, an average intrinsic association constant of 6.2 x 107 m-1 with an heterogeneity index of 1. Although the Ca2+- or Mg2+-stimulated ATPase activities of actomyosin from platelets (thrombosthenin) or muscle were not inhibited by 2 um cytochalsin D, this concentration depressed thrombosthenin M and myosin ATPase. Recombination experiments indicated that actin and cytochalasin D compete for a binding region on myosin. The inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D on myosin ATPase was restored following dialysis against 0.6 m KCl; with concomitant removal of the drug. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of superprecipitation indicated that, although cytochalasin D did not interfere with dissociation of actomyosin by MgATP, increasing concentrations of cytochalasin D inhibited reassociation. Labeled cytochalasin D associated with thrombosthenin M could be removed by solvent extraction on thin layer chromatography and by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the bond between cytochalasin D and thrombosthenin M or muscle myosin is not covalent."
https://openalex.org/W1588459766,"Abstract The phosphofructokinase reaction was studied at pH 8 with a free magnesium ion concentration of 4 mm. Under these conditions, inhibition by ATP and cooperativity in fructose 6-phosphate kinetics are not apparent. Plots of reciprocal velocity versus the reciprocal of the concentration of either substrate at different fixed concentrations of the other substrate yield intersecting lines for both the forward and reverse reactions. The Michaelis constants for fructose 6-phosphate and MgATP are 21 and 20 µm, respectively, and the turnover number is 8.6 x 104 moles min-1 per 3.8 x 105 g of enzyme, while the Michaelis constants for MgADP and fructose diphosphate are 20 µm and 0.42 mm, respectively, and the turnover number for the reverse reaction is 3.7 x 103 moles min-1 per 3.8 x 105 g of enzyme. MgADP is a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP, with an inhibition constant, 0.11 mm, independent of fructose 6-phosphate concentration. The other product inhibition patterns, MgADP versus fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose diphosphate versus either MgATP or fructose 6-phosphate, are all noncompetitive. No isotopic exchange of fructose 6-phosphate with fructose diphosphate could be detected in the absence of nucleotides. In the absence of sugar phosphates, the isotopic exchange of ATP with ADP proceeded at less than 1% of the rate of the over-all reaction. d-Arabinose 5-phosphate was found to be a competitive inhibitor of both fructose 6-phosphate and fructose diphosphate and noncompetitive relative to both MgATP and MgADP. MgGDP, an alternative substrate in the reverse direction, was competitive with MgADP with respect to ATP production and noncompetitive relative to fructose diphosphate. These results are most consistent with a sequential mechanism in which the order of addition of substrates is random and is approximated kinetically by the rapid equilibrium assumption. The equilibrium constant for the phosphorylation of free fructose 6-phosphate by MgATP to produce free fructose diphosphate and MgADP is 1.2 x 103 at pH 8 and 30°. Thus the free energy of hydrolysis of the 1-phosphate in fructose diphosphate is identical with that of glucose 6-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1496883076,"Abstract Energy coupling for the concentrative uptake of galactose via the β-methylgalactoside transport system occurs via an intermediate produced during oxidative phosphorylation but before ATP formation. The membrane-bound ATPase, necessary for ATP formation during oxidative phosphorylation, is not obligatory for energy coupling of transport but can, under anaerobic conditions, accomplish energy coupling by ATP hydrolysis. These conclusions are supported by the following findings: (a) galactose uptake in intact cells can be stimulated by substrates of the respiratory chain and inhibited by inhibitors of the respiratory chain and by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation; (b) cells made anaerobic for the transport assay are fully transport active; (c) a mutant defective in the membrane-bound ATPase has lost transport activity unless supplied with exogenous d-lactate, and the additional presence of arsenate completely blocks the stimulation by d-lactate; (d) a mutant defective in the respiratory chain due to a defect in ubiquinone biosynthesis still exhibits transport activity, which cannot be stimulated by d-lactate."
https://openalex.org/W1533496253,Abstract Isolated sarcolemma hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+. MgATPase was stimulated by low concentrations of Ca2+ and inhibited by high concentrations of this cation. Membranes hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylphosphate in the presence of Mg2+; this activity was stimulated by Ca2+ and K+. La3+ stimulated MgATPase at low concentrations (up to 50 µm) and caused inhibition at higher concentrations (above 0.2 mm). Phosphoprotein was formed when the membranes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. Formation of phosphoprotein was strongly dependent on Ca2+ and Mg2+. The phosphoprotein was acid-stable and hydroxylamine-sensitive. In the presence of Mg2+ high concentrations of Ca2+ (above 0.3 mm) inhibited ATPase activity but not the level of phosphoprotein formation.
https://openalex.org/W1560633731,"Comparison of the biochemical characteristics of enzymes inhibited by α-1-antitrypsin shows that thrombin, elastase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and plasmin are serine proteases with serine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues at their active center and cleave proteins at lysine and arginine or at aromatic or leucine residues. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that α-1-antitrypsin has two inhibitor sites, one containing a positively charged residue and the other containing an aromatic or leucine residue, and that both sites have a binding site for the active site of serine proteases. Experiments designed to test this hypothesis showed the following: 1. Trypsin and chymotrypsin compete for inhibitory sites on purified α-1-antitrypsin, suggesting that the inhibitor has the same or overlapping inhibitory sites for these two enzymes. 2. Trypsin inactivated by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate fails to occupy inhibiting sites on α-1-antitrypsin. 3. α-1-Antitrypsin inhibits subtilisin, a proteolytic enzyme that contains serine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues at its active site in common with mammalian serine proteases. 4. α-1-Antitrypsin fails to inactivate acetylcholinesterase, a nonproteolytic enzyme whose active site contains a reactive serine residue, suggesting that this residue alone is not sufficient for inhibition by α-1-antitrypsin. 5. Treatment of α-1-antitrypsin with phenylglyoxal hydrate blocks the action of α-1-antitrypsin on trypsin but not on chymotrypsin. The change in activity is presumptive evidence that arginine residues were modified by the treatment. Antitryptic activity can be regenerated with removal of the blocking groups. These data indicate that trypsin and chymotrypsin are inhibited at two different sites on α-1-antitrypsin and suggest that the trypsin inhibitory site contains a positively charged amino acid. While these experiments have not proved this hypothesis, they are consistent with it."

Half-maximal effect is obtained at insulin concentrations between 30 and 60 microunits per ml.

The type of inhibition is pseudo competitive.
https://openalex.org/W1564396987,"Abstract A group of oligomycin-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been selected. Most are cytoplasmically inherited and have altered ATPase sensitivity in isolated mitochondria. Two mutants, resistant to growth on oligomycin, are not resistant when ATPase is tested in isolated mitochondria. One of these mutants shows normal Mendelian inheritance while the other is cytoplasmic. Studies on the isolated soluble ATPase enzyme from wild type cells show that the solubilized enzyme is not inhibited by oligomycin but the reconstituted enzyme complex is sensitive. ATPases from oligomycin-resistant mutants can also be separated into their component parts and subsequently reconstituted. The reconstituted enzyme complex resembles the mitochondrial-bound enzyme in its resistance to oligomycin inhibition. Preparation of hybrid reconstituted ATPase complexes from mixed components of the mutant and wild type enzymes shows that the resistance is contributed by the membrane fraction of the mutant ATPase. Thus, the mitochondrial DNA has been shown to direct the synthesis of a membrane component influencing the activity of the mitochondrial ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1513398781,"Abstract ATP-dependent deoxyribonuclease was first purified up to 580-fold from a crude extract of Bacillus subtilis W168 by ammonium sulfate fractionation, agarose and DEAE-cellulose column fractionation. Enzyme instability was reduced by use of Tris-HCl media and an in-line dialysis apparatus directly connected to a chromatographic column. During the course of the enzyme purification, an inhibitor to this enzyme was detected in the crude extract prepared by sonication and was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Based on various criteria, it was concluded that the inhibitor is fragmented DNA or DNA in complex with some other compounds. The ATP-dependent DNase of B. subtilis has relatively narrow limits of ATP concentration for its optimal activity, and there is a marked inhibition above the optimal ATP concentration (20 µm). However, a rather constant level of residual activity is found above 100 µm, up to at least 1 mm ATP. The enzyme also requires Mg2+ for its activity; Km for this is 1.02 mm. The ATP-dependent DNase of B. subtilis has unusal substrate specificities for native and denatured DNA. The enzyme (Fraction VI) requires ATP to hydrolyze native DNA, but is not at all necessary for the hydrolysis of denatured DNA. The activity on the native DNA with optimal concentration of ATP (20 µm) was 3-fold greater than on the denatured DNA with or without ATP, while at a higher ATP concentration (500 µm), the factor was 0.5-fold. Among chemical inhibitors tested, β,γ-methyleneadenosine triphosphate inhibited the enzyme activity with native DNA as a substrate, while with denatured DNA the activity remained unaltered. The possibility of a contaminating enzyme which would hydrolyze single strand DNA preferentially appears unlikely because of the coincidence of the two activities on both agarose and DEAE-cellulose column chromatographies, together with the salt inactivation behavior. A glycerol gradient centrifugation of the above partially purified enzyme raised the purity to approximately 4800-fold. This procedure, however, made a drastic change in the property of the enzyme. Thus, the ratio of activities on native DNA to denatured DNA at 20 µm ATP increased from 3 in Fraction VI to more than 30. A possibility of removing a contaminating enzyme specific to denatured DNA as the substrate was made unlikely. DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity was found inseparable from the purified enzyme."

These plasminogens showed multiple electrophoretic forms in acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid at pH 8.4 and in acrylamide gel-isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. The isoelectric points of the multiple forms of rabbit and bovine plasminogens were similar to the isoelectric points of the multiple isoelectric forms of human Lys-plasminogen; the cat and dog plasminogen isoelectric forms were similar to one another and more electronegative than the human Lys-plasminogen isoelectric forms. Cat, dog, rabbit, and bovine plasmins (urokinase-activated plasminogens) reacted stoichiometrically with l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and were completely inhibited. Cm-heavy (A) and Cm-light (B) chain preparations were isolated from reduced and alkylated plasmin preparations from each species by dialysis against 0.002 m ammonium bicarbonate. The incorporation studies with l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone indicated a single active site histidine, for each species of plasmin, located in the Cm-light (B) chain. The Cm-light (B) chain derivatives of the cat, dog, rabbit, and bovine plasmins were essentially homogeneous and similar in molecular weight to the human Cm-light (B) chain derivative in acrylamide gel-urea-dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. These derivatives showed multiple isoelectric forms in acrylamide gel-urea-isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. The isoelectric points of cat and dog Cm-light (B) chain forms were similar to the isoelectric points of the human Cm-light (B) chain forms; the rabbit Cm-light (B) chain forms were more electronegative and the bovine Cm-light (B) chain forms were more electropositive than the human Cm-light (B) chain forms. The Cm-heavy (A) chain preparations of cat, dog, rabbit, and bovine plasmins all contained both major and minor chains in acrylamide gel-urea-dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. The cat, dog, and rabbit preparations contain a Cm-heavy (A) chain that had the same molecular weight as the major human Cm-heavy (A) chain. The major cat Cm-heavy (A1) chain was similar in molecular weight to the minor human Cm-heavy (A1) chain. The major dog Cm-heavy (A2) chain had a lower molecular weight than both the major and minor human Cm-heavy (A and A1) chains. The bovine Cm-heavy (A3) chain was of lower molecular weight than the dog, Cm-heavy (A2) chain.

https://openalex.org/W1608725638,"Abstract The effects of oligomycin on Na+-ATPase of high K (HK) and low K (LK) sheep erythrocyte membranes have been investigated. Activation of LK Na+-ATPase is observed with ATP ≤ 0.2 µm; activation of HK is observed with ATP ≤ 0.02 µm. Inhibition occurs with higher ATP. At 0.2 µm ATP, oligomycin stimulation of LK Na+-ATPase is associated with a 3- to 4-fold increase in the 32P-intermediate; inhibition of HK is associated with only a slight increase (1.3-fold) in 32P-intermediate. The effects of oligomycin are similar for HK and LK in that activation occurs at low catalytic rates (≤ 20 pmoles mg-1 min-1); inhibition occurs at higher rates, irrespective of the means of altering the rate (varying ATP or Na+ concentration, or both; stimulation of LK with specific isoimmune antiserum). Oligomycin counteracts K+-inhibition (LK) and K+ counteracts oligomycin inhibition (HK). The results are consistent with a reaction sequence involving oligomycin-sensitive conformational changes of phosphorylated and probably unphosphorylated intermediate, i.e. [see PDF for equation] and [see PDF for equation] the resulting shift in equilibrium can, at low catalytic rates, be evidenced in stimulation of Na+-ATPase. Interaction of HK and LK Na+-ATPase with Na+, K+, and ATP are interdependent and markedly different for the two; at constant ATP (0.2 µm), HK is more sensitive to activation by Na+ and less sensitive to inhibition by K+ than LK ATPase. Although effects of both K+ and oligomycin are dependent on ATP concentration, a difference in affinity for ATP in addition to, or as a result of, a different relative affinity for Na+ and K+ may be the basis for the distinctions between HK and LK membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1581763952,"Abstract Two major membrane fractions have been isolated from denervated and contralateral limb control rat muscle by a subcellular fractionation technique involving lithium bromide and potassium chloride extraction and differential and density gradient centrifugation. Membranes isolated from the initial nuclear pellet (Fraction I) contained Na+K+(Mg++)ATPase (20 µ moles of Pi per hour per mg), sialic acid (24 nmoles per mg), and Ca++/Mg++ATPase (19 µmoles of Pi per hour per mg). With subfractionation of Fraction I the membranes enriched in Na+K+(Mg++)ATPase and sialic acid (IMl) also had the highest specific activity of membrane protein iodination using extracellular lactoperoxidase. These membrane subfractions were separated from ones containing Ca++/ Mg++ATPase activity (IMh). Membranes isolated from the post mitochondrial supernatant (Fraction II) contained Ca++/Mg++ATPase (22 µmoles of Pi per hour per mg), Na+K+(Mg++)ATPase (5 µmoles of Pi per hour per mg), and sialic acid (10 nmoles per mg). With further subfractionation the Ca++/Mg++ATPase containing membranes (IIMm and IIMh) were separated from those most accessible to iodination by extracellular lactoperoxidase and containing Na+K+(Mg++)ATPase and sialic acid (IIMl and IIL). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed different protein profiles for Fractions I and II with polypeptide molecular weights ranging from 20,000 to 200,000. Both subfractions IMl and IIMl contained a single major glycoprotein species with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 110,000. These data would suggest that both lighter subfractions (IMl and IIMl) derived from the nuclear pellet (Fraction I) and the postmitochondrial supernatant (Fraction II), respectively, were enriched in surface membranes. The heavier subfraction (IIMh) from the postmitochondrial supernatant was enriched in membranes derived from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Following 1 week of denervation no change was observed in either electron micrographs or sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels of the membrane fractions. The ATPase and sialic acid of Fraction I remained unaltered while a 2-fold increase was noted in the Ca++/Mg++ATPase (51 µmoles of Pi per hour per mg) of heavier membranes of Fraction II and sialic acid (20 nmoles per mg) of lighter membranes of Fraction II."
https://openalex.org/W1496652689,"Control of P-enolpyruvate synthesis has been studied in guinea pig liver mitochondria with respect to the relative rates of GTP generation directly from substrate level phosphorylation or indirectly from ATP via nucleoside diphosphate kinase. With malate or pyruvate plus malate as substrates, P-enolpyruvate production was greatly decreased in State 3 by addition of fluorocitrate (an inhibitor of aconitase) to prevent flux through substrate level phosphorylation. On the other hand, when ATP production by the electron transport chain was prevented by use of an uncoupling agent (together with oligomycin to inhibit ATPase activity), rates of P-enolpyruvate production from α-ketoglutarate were the same as in State 3, and were also unaffected by addition of fluorocitrate. In the absence of oxidative phosphorylation and with fluorocitrate present together with malate or pyruvate plus malate, addition of exogenous ATP was much less effective than α-ketoglutarate in promoting P-enolpyruvate synthesis. Intramitochondrial GTP levels and rates of P-enolpyruvate formation were consistently lower in State 4, State 3, and the uncoupled plus oligomycin state with pyruvate plus malate than with α-ketoglutarate plus malate as substrate when fluorocitrate was present, indicating a limitation in the rate of phosphorylation of GDP by intramitochondrial ATP for optimal rates of P-enolpyruvate synthesis. The maximal rate of conversion of ATP to GTP by nucleoside diphosphate kinase in the intact mitochondria was estimated to be 2 to 3 nmoles per min per mg of protein compared with a maximal rate of P-enolpyruvate formation of about 22 nmoles per min per mg of protein obtained with α-ketoglutarate plus malate as substrate. It is concluded that provision of GTP by substrate level phosphorylation is essential to support rates of P-enol-pyruvate formation by guinea pig liver mitochondria greater than 3 nmoles per min per mg of protein."
