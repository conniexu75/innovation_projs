https://openalex.org/W1981799488,"The STAT family of proteins carries out a dual function: signal transduction and activation of transcription. A new family member, Stat3, becomes activated through phosphorylation on tyrosine as a DNA binding protein in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not interferon γ (IFN-γ). It is likely that this phosphoprotein forms homodimers as well as heterodimers with the first described member of the STAT family, Stat91 (renamed Stat1 α), which is activated by the IFNs and EGF. Differential activation of different STAT proteins in response to different ligands should help to explain specificity in nuclear signaling from the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2079126167,"Concentration of urine in mammals is regulated by the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. Binding of vasopressin to its V2 receptor leads to the insertion of water channels in apical membranes of principal cells in collecting ducts. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), the kidney fails to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin. A male patient with an autosomal recessive form of NDI was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the gene encoding aquaporin-2, a water channel. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that each mutation resulted in nonfunctional water channel proteins. Thus, aquaporin-2 is essential for vasopressin-dependent concentration of urine."

Embryonic day 15 transgenic cardiomyocytes delivered directly into the myocardium of syngeneic hosts formed stable grafts, as identified by nuclear beta-galactosidase activity. Grafted cardiomyocytes were observed as long as 2 months after implantation, the latest date assayed. Intracardiac graft formation did not induce overtly negative effects on the host myocardium and was not associated with chronic immune rejection. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of nascent intercalated disks connecting the engrafted fetal cardiomyocytes and the host myocardium. These results suggest that intracardiac grafting might provide a useful approach for myocardial repair, provided that the grafted cells can contribute to myocardial function."
https://openalex.org/W2028854652,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin exert their effects by binding to heteromeric complexes of type I and type II receptors. The type II receptors for TGF-beta and activin are transmembrane serine-threonine kinases; a series of related receptors, denoted activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 to 5, have recently been identified, and ALK-6 is described here. ALK-5 has been shown to be a functional TGF-beta type I receptor. A systematic analysis revealed that most ALKs formed heteromeric complexes with the type II receptors for TGF-beta and activin after overexpression in COS cells; however, among the six ALKs, only ALK-5 was a functional TGF-beta type I receptor for activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and only ALK-2 and ALK-4 bound activin with high affinity."

An IL-8 analog was chemically synthesized, with the amide nitrogen of leucine-25 methylated to selectivity block formation of hydrogen bonds between monomers and thereby prevent dimerization. This analog was shown to be a monomer, as assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation and NMR. Nevertheless, it was equivalent to IL-8 in assays of neutrophil activation, which indicates that the monomer is a functional form of IL-8."
https://openalex.org/W1511763846,"CryIA(c) delta-endotoxin, a member of the CryI family of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal proteins, specifically recognizes and binds with high affinity to target proteins in the midgut of susceptible insects. Protein blots of Manduca sexta brush-border membranes probed with 125I-CryIA(c) identify a major binding protein of 120 kDa and a minor binding protein of 65 kDa. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against the 120-kDa toxin binding protein. Using isoelectric focusing and monoclonal antibodies (2B3, 8G1, and 12B8) 120- and 65-kDa brush-border proteins were isolated. Labeled CryIA(c) and monoclonal antibodies probed to blots of the affinity-selected proteins recognized the 120- and 65-kDa proteins. When reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, antibody-selected proteins increased toxin binding (35%) and enhanced toxin-induced 86Rb+ release up to 1000-fold. The 120-kDa protein was identified as aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2). A CryIA(c)-sensitive phosphatase was also present in the 120/65-kDa protein mixture. These findings provide the first identification of B. thuringiensis toxin binding proteins, although confirmation is needed in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1544789543,"Human lung mast cell tryptase is a trypsin-like serine proteinase that is stored in mast cell granules and released by activated mast cells. Here we report that mast cell tryptase is a potent activator of single-chain urinary-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA, or prourokinase), the zymogen form of urinary-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Activation was complete within 75 min using an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:50 and was accompanied by cleavage of scu-PA at Lys158-Ile159, generating active two-chain u-PA. The reaction was dependent on enzyme concentration and obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Kinetic constants calculated for scu-PA activation by mast cell tryptase are Km = 34 microM, Vmax = 3.6 pmol of u-PA/min, and kcat = 0.08 s-1. These data suggest that tryptase from tumor-associated mast cells may participate in the activation of scu-PA."

https://openalex.org/W2082190144,"The crystal structure of a ternary protein complex has been determined at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The complex is composed of three electron transfer proteins from Paracoccus denitrificans, the quinoprotein methylamine dehydrogenase, the blue copper protein amicyanin, and the cytochrome c551i. The central region of the c551i is folded similarly to several small bacterial c-type cytochromes; there is a 45-residue extension at the amino terminus and a 25-residue extension at the carboxyl terminus. The methylamine dehydrogenase-amicyanin interface is largely hydrophobic, whereas the amicyanin-cytochrome interface is more polar, with several charged groups present on each surface. Analysis of the simplest electron transfer pathways between the redox partners points out the importance of other factors such as energetics in determining the electron transfer rates."
https://openalex.org/W1630550847,"Several observations in eukaryotic cells suggest that the processes of translation and mRNA turnover are interrelated. To understand this relationship, we examined the effects of translational inhibition on the decay of the unstable yeast MFA2 mRNA, which is degraded in a 5' to 3' direction following deadenylation (1). Although inhibition of translation in cis stabilizes several unstable mammalian transcripts, inhibiting translation of the MFA2 mRNA in cis, by the insertion of a large stem-loop structure in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), did not affect the half-life, deadenylation rate, or appearance of specific decay intermediates. Therefore, efficient translational elongation on the MFA2 mRNA is not a requirement for the normal rate, or mechanism, of degradation of this transcript. In contrast, inhibition of translation in trans, by the addition of cycloheximide, stabilized the deadenylated form of MFA2 mRNA. Furthermore, the MFA2 transcripts that were not translated due to a stem-loop in the 5'-UTR were also stabilized in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that cycloheximide is likely to affect mRNA stability indirectly. These results suggest possible relationships between the mechanisms of mRNA decay and the translational process."
https://openalex.org/W2139518648,"We have developed an assay for chaperone-mediated protein renaturation using thermally denatured Firefly luciferase. Dilution of denatured luciferase (> 99% loss of activity) into reticulocyte lysate typically results in recovery of 5-15% activity. Addition of an ATP-regenerating system increases yields to > 60%, while heat shock or the addition of denatured proteins inhibits the chaperoning activity. Reticulocyte lysate contains abundant quantities of the heat shock proteins, hsp90 and hsp70, and a 60-kDa protein homologous to the yeast stress protein, STI1. Immune isolated samples of these three proteins support recovery of up to 35% of luciferase activity in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting that these or associated proteins are involved in the renaturation of luciferase. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between luciferase renaturation activity and the levels of hsp70 and hsp90 in reticulocyte lysate preparations. Purified hsp90 and hsp70, along with an ATP-regenerating system, are able to renature luciferase to greater than 20% of its original activity. This renaturation is most efficient when hsp90 and hsp70 are at about a 2:1 ratio and at concentrations similar to those found in reticulocyte lysate. This study provides evidence for an ATP-dependent chaperoning activity in reticulocyte lysate that involves a cooperative action of hsp70 and hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W1522794224,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide originally purified from endothelial cell-conditioned medium. It has multiple biological activities and has been implicated in a number of human diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Contradictory reports have been published regarding whether ET-1 is a mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC); thus, this issue is presently unresolved. In this study, we demonstrate that rat aortic SMC express functional endothelin cell surface receptors but do not proliferate when ET-1 is added to serum-free culture medium on every other day for a period of 1 week. To determine whether ET-1 could function in an autocrine manner to promote SMC growth, we transfected this same cell line with an ET-1 expression plasmid. Several independent lines expressing variable levels of ET-1 mRNA and biologically active ET-1 were obtained. Cell proliferation assays indicated that the transfected SMC line secreting the highest level of ET-1 had an enhanced growth rate when compared with untransfected or vector-alone transfected cells. The growth rate of this SMC line, but not of untransfected cells, was significantly reduced when the ETA receptor subtype-selective antagonist BQ-123 was included in the culture medium. These results indicate that constitutive ET-1 overexpression can promote SMC proliferation. Therefore, it is possible that under certain conditions ET-1 could be an important factor controlling SMC replication in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1543901357,"An acrosomal protein, sp32, was completely purified from acid extracts of ejaculated porcine sperm. Purified sp32 gave a single 32-kDa protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was characterized as a binding protein specific for 55-, 53-, and 49-kDa forms of (pro)acrosin. This protein was not capable of binding a 43-kDa acrosin intermediate and 35-kDa mature acrosin. sp32 significantly accelerated autoactivation of proacrosin at a basic pH in vitro and affected the maturation pathway of proacrosin. In the presence of sp32, the 49-kDa acrosin intermediate from the 55- and 53-kDa proacrosins was accumulated, instead of the 43-kDa acrosin intermediate. These results suggest that sp32 interacts with both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of the 53-kDa proacrosin. The cDNA clones coding for porcine and guinea pig sp32 have been identified from testis cDNA libraries in lambda gt11. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that sp32 is initially synthesized as a 61-kDa precursor protein with a putative signal peptide at the amino terminus. The carboxyl-terminal half of the precursor molecule corresponds to the mature sp32. Thus, sp32 is produced by post-translational modification of the precursor. The binding of sp32 to proacrosin may be involved in packaging the acrosin zymogen into the acrosomal matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1513441752,"Ferredoxin isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been chemically cross-linked to purified photosystem I from the same organism. The reaction was catalyzed by N-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in the presence of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide. A short reaction time and neutral pH values can be used in the presence of the two reagents, ensuring the integrity of both of the proteins and the iron-sulfur cluster of the ferredoxin. The only covalent complex detected comprised ferredoxin and the photo-system I (PSI)-D subunit, as identified by antibodies probing after electrophoresis. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of this covalent complex have shown that the cross-linked ferredoxin was entirely photoreducible by photosystem I and that the molar ratio of ferredoxin to PSI was close to 1. Extensive sequencing of the peptides obtained after proteolysis of the purified cross-linked product led to the identification of a covalent bond between glutamic acid 93 of ferredoxin and lysine 106 of the PSI-D subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1583196972,"Abstract The tumor suppressor protein p53 is extremely unstable in most cell lines. In contrast, many mutant and oncogenic species of the protein are stable. The degradation of p53 in vivo requires metabolic energy; however, the proteolytic system(s) involved have not been identified. The ubiquitin system has been implicated in the degradation of p53 in vitro. The degradation is stimulated significantly by the human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 that associates with p53 and facilitates conjugate formation and subsequent degradation. Complex formation between E6 and p53 is promoted by a cellular protein designated E6-associated protein (E6-AP). Initial dissection of the conjugation process have demonstrated a role for the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, but the ubiquitin-carrier protein (E2, UBC) and the ubiquitin protein ligase, E3, have not been identified. In this study, we report that a novel species of ubiquitin-carrier protein designated E2-F1 (Blumenfeld, N., Gonen, H., Mayer, A., Smith, C., Siegel, N.R., Schwartz, A.L., and Ciechanover, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9574-9581) is involved in the conjugation and degradation of p53. This E2 enzyme recognizes non-N-end rule protein substrates and appears to mediate their conjugation via a novel species of E3. The process of recognition appears to be selective; E2-F1 is not required for the conjugation and degradation of human N-myc. The involvement of E2-F1 in the in vitro process appears to be physiologically meaningful and to reproduce the in vivo process; mutant species of p53 that do not interact with E6 and are stable in vivo are not recognized by the cell free system."
https://openalex.org/W1624519387,"In mammalian cells, hyperphosphorylation of histone H1 and phosphorylation of histone H3 correlate well with the G2 phase to metaphase condensation of chromosomes, and these phosphorylations most probably have a role in initiating and controlling the entry into mitosis. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine has been used to examine the role of H1 and H3 phosphorylations in controlling chromosome condensation in the mouse FM3A cell line. We present evidence that (i) staurosporine inhibits the protein kinases that phosphorylate histone H1 during mitosis, (ii) staurosporine also inhibits the histone H3-specific kinase, (iii) the inhibition of these kinase activities prevent cells from entering mitosis, and (iv) addition of staurosporine to cells already arrested at metaphase by nocodazole causes a rapid dephosphorylation of histones H1 and H3 and the decondensation of the metaphase chromosomes. The results show that the hyperphosphorylation of histone H1 and phosphorylation of histone H3 are required to maintain metaphase chromosomes in their condensed state."
https://openalex.org/W1536916610,"We have shown that vanadium mimics several insulin effects in rat adipocytes, via a staurosporine sensitive cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase (CytPTK; Shisheva, A., and Shechter, Y. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6463). Here we demonstrate that vanadium effects on protein tyrosine kinases are preserved after cell disintegration. Vanadium inhibits or activates protein tyrosine kinases depending on its oxidation state and the tyrosine kinase studied. Vanadyl (4+) but not vanadate (5+) inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin receptor (IC50 value = 23 +/- 4 microM) and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IC50 = 19 +/- 3 microM). Inhibition is non-competitive with respect to ATP, Mn2+, or substrate concentrations. Preincubation of adipocytes with vanadyl (0.4 mM), and staurosporine (which arrests the cytosolic enzyme) substantially inhibited insulin-stimulated lipogenesis. Vanadyl is readily oxidized to vanadate by hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, CytPTKs were poorly inhibited by vanadyl, and vanadate stimulated several CytPTKs 2-6 fold. CytPTK derived from rat adipocytes, liver and brain were activated, and CytPTK from Nb2 lymphoma cells was not affected. CytPTK extracted from insulin-responsive tissues are more sensitive to vanadate activation (ED50 = 3 +/- 0.7 microM), whereas the brain enzyme is less sensitive (ED50 = 27 +/- 3 microM). Tungstate, molybdate, and phenylarsine oxide also stimulate CytPTK, suggesting that the vanadate effect is secondary to inhibiting protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases. This study supports a working hypothesis implicating the intracellular vanadyl pool in modulating CytPTK activity. Any physiological conditions converting vanadyl to vanadate (i.e. H2O2 production) will activate CytPTK and consequently CytPTK-dependent bioeffects."
https://openalex.org/W1569456617,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) produce the bulk of the connective tissue of major arteries, including collagen types I, III, and V. Recently, we have shown, they also have the capacity to synthesize the alpha 1 chain of type XI, a collagen related to type V (Brown, K., Lawrence, R., and Sonenshein, G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23268-23273). Furthermore, expression of types V and XI collagen were coordinately regulated with respect to serum deprivation and cell density in a fashion distinct from that for types I and III. To begin to determine the factors that influence vascular SMC production of types V/XI collagen, we have examined the effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, a major modulator of connective tissue expression. In serum-deprived confluent cultures of bovine pulmonary artery SMCs, TGF-beta 1 treatment increased the steady-state levels of the mRNAs of collagen types V and XI, as well as of types I and III, elastin and fibronectin. The largest increase was seen for alpha 2(V) procollagen. The increase in alpha 2(V) mRNA was detectable by 12 h after addition of 2 ng/ml TGF-beta 1, and concentrations as little as 0.5 ng/ml were effective. A similar increase in alpha 2(V) mRNA levels was observed with SMCs derived from the aortic arch and carotid artery. Type V collagen protein was found to be elevated by TGF-beta 1 treatment in both the conditioned media and the cell layer associated fraction of pulse-labeled cultures. A slight decrease in SMC proliferation as judged by DNA content, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and steady-state levels of histone H3.2 mRNA resulted from TGF-beta 1 treatment. These results suggest that the elevated levels of TGF-beta 1 in the vessel wall during atherosclerosis may be, in part, responsible for the increase in type V collagen that typifies advanced fibrotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1590399316,"Knowledge of the organization of the kininogen gene and protein structure and function correlations has allowed the development of a model of high molecular weight kininogen. Domains 1-3 on the heavy chain are evolutionarily related to cystatin and the latter two are inhibitors of cysteine proteases. Proteolytic cleavage in domain 4 to release bradykinin causes a conformational change, exposing a surface-binding region (domain 5) on the disulfide-linked light chain. The carboxyl-terminal domain 6 contains a zymogen binding sequence for factor XI and prekallikrein which, with domain 5, accounts for its cofactor activity. To explore further the domain structure, we have determined the shapes of high molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein by electron microscopy of rotary shadowed preparations and computer image processing. High molecular weight kininogen appears to be a linear array of three linked globular regions about 16 nm long, with the two ends also connected by another thin strand. Both prekallikrein and kallikrein have a compact globular shape, with a subdivision that is sometimes visible. Different functional domains of high molecular weight kininogen were identified by monoclonal antibodies against these regions, as well as ligand binding of prekallikrein. These studies indicate that one end globular region is the prekallikrein-binding domain, the other comprises the cysteine protease inhibitor domains and the smaller central nodule is the surface-binding domain. Cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen with plasma kallikrein to yield two-chain high molecular weight kininogen results in a striking change in conformation: the central surface-binding domain swings out so that it is still adjacent to the prekallikrein-binding domain but no longer in the middle. These structural studies provide insight into the interactions of these proteins and aspects of the mechanisms of their actions."
https://openalex.org/W1639776510,"Factor VIIIa is inactivated by both factor IXa and activated protein C. The latter protease rapidly attacked a site at Arg562 (A2 subunit), whereas both proteases slowly cleaved factor VIIIa at Arg336 (A1 subunit). Cofactor inactivation catalyzed by activated protein C was 8-fold faster than that catalyzed by factor IXa. Simultaneous reaction of factor VIIIa with the two enzymes resulted in a rate of inactivation intermediate to that observed for the individual proteases. Under these conditions, the activated protein C-catalyzed cleavage at Arg562 was inhibited such that cofactor inactivation resulted primarily from cleavage at Arg336. Substitution of factor IXa modified in its active site with 6-(dimethylamino)-2-naphthalenesulfonyl-glutamylglycylarginyl++ + chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-IXa) for the native enzyme yielded a similar rate of activated protein C-catalyzed cleavage at the A1 site, whereas cleavage at the A2 site was virtually eliminated. However, the inclusion of protein S resulted in a marked increase in cleavage at the A2 site that correlated with an increased rate of cofactor inactivation. Active site-modified activated protein C inhibited the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution from isolated subunits. In addition, the factor VIIIa-dependent fluorescence enhancement of DEGR-activated protein C was inhibited by EGR-IXa. These results indicate that factor IXa can reduce the rate of activated protein C-catalyzed cofactor inactivation by selectively blocking cleavage at the A2 domainal site, an effect reversed by protein S. One mechanism consistent with the reciprocal inhibitory effects of the proteases is that activated protein C and factor IXa occupy overlapping sites on the cofactor. Thus, factor IXa may protect factor VIIIa by preventing activated protein C binding."
https://openalex.org/W1513712228,"The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor modulates expression of genes involved in growth regulation, differentiation, and neoplastic transformation. Several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) as well as other kinases phosphorylate c-Jun and c-Fos in vitro and are postulated to control AP-1 activity. However, since many protein kinases phosphorylate substrates in vitro with which they have no association in vivo, we sought evidence for interaction in vivo between AP-1 and MAP kinase proteins. We now report detection of an association in vivo of MAP kinase-related proteins with c-Jun and AP-1 dimers by peptide mapping and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with AP-1 antigens. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 and several apparently novel MAP kinase-related proteins are among the species that bind to AP-1. The large number of MAP kinase-related proteins associated with AP-1 implicates them on an important gene regulation pathway. Combinatorial association between MAP kinase-related proteins and AP-1 dimers could potentially create numerous distinct complexes that could regulate diverse genes."
https://openalex.org/W1484504127,"Substitution of glycine or alanine for phenylalanine 31 in human dihydrofolate reductase produces variants that are inhibited less by methotrexate (MTX) than the previously reported serine variant. The 100 times decrease in MTX affinity for the glycine variant is due to slower binding, and to inability of the initial complex to isomerize to a nondissociating conformer. A polar group at position 31 is unnecessary for resistance, but residues larger than serine confer no resistance. The glycine variant best fulfills criteria for gene therapy: low Km for H2folate, high kcat, and good stability. Although kcat is unaltered by these mutations, the rate of hydride transfer is greatly decreased. Presteady-state measurements have enabled a complete catalytic scheme to be constructed for the glycine variant that predicts observed steady-state behavior. The crystal structures of inhibitor complexes of the serine, alanine, and glycine mutants and of the wild-type enzyme show that the mutations cause little perturbation of the protein backbone, of side chains of residues at the active site, or of the bound inhibitor. A molecule of bound water occupies the space vacated by the phenyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1482573093,"Incubation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with chemoattractants, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) activated both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activation by chemoattractants was rapid and transient, being maximal by 1 min and decreasing by 10 min. The order of efficacy was formyl-met-leu-phe > C5a > > LTB4 > interleukin 8 > platelet-activating factor. In contrast, activation by GM-CSF or PMA was slow and sustained being maximal at 5 min and with little decrease by 30 min. Sustained MAPK activation required continuous activation of the MAPKK. The MAPKK induced by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, GM-CSF, or PMA was resolved into two forms by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q). Both corresponded to a 45-kDa MAPKK antigen by Western blotting and were inactivated by serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. Rechromatography of both forms after dephosphorylation resulted in the antigen's eluting slightly earlier on the Mono Q gradient than when in the active state. However, the two peaks remained separate, suggesting that they are not merely different phosphoforms of the same enzyme. The MAPK cascade is a signaling pathway common to many polymorphonuclear leukocyte stimulants, which may be activated transiently or in a sustained manner."
https://openalex.org/W1496537660,"Abstract A subunit of the interferon alpha receptor (IFN alpha R) that confers biologic response to and specific for IFN alpha 8 has recently been cloned. We have explored the biological consequences of expressing the cloned IFN alpha R subunit in human cells resistant to IFN alpha and in mouse cell lines nonresponsive to human IFN alpha. The expression of the cloned IFN alpha R subunit in the human IFN alpha-resistant K-562 cell line restored sensitivity to the antiviral effect of not only IFN alpha 8 but also IFN alpha 2 and IFN alpha Con1. In mouse L-929 cells the expression of the cloned receptor subunit markedly increased antiviral sensitivity to human type I IFNs. In either human K-562 or mouse L-929 cells these effects were observed without a detectable increase in the binding for any of the subtypes of IFN alpha tested. We propose that the cloned IFN alpha R subunit functions as a transducer subunit for the IFN alpha R. This concept is supported by the finding that the cloned receptor protein, when it is expressed in Cos cells, has an M(r) of 75 kDa, which is different from the main IFN alpha-binding proteins, the alpha and beta subunits of the IFN alpha R. This report also suggests that alterations at the receptor level could be involved in IFN alpha resistance in some cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1605483534,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the principal enzyme which hydrolyzes triglycerides in circulating plasma lipoproteins, functions while bound to the luminal surface of endothelial cells. LPL is a heparin-binding protein and has been assumed to associate with endothelial cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Recently, using ligand blotting and affinity chromatography we identified a 116-kDa heparin-releasable LPL-binding protein (hrp-116) from endothelial cells which was not a HSPG (Sivaram, P., Klein, M. G., and Goldberg, I. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16517-16522). This suggested that, like a number of other heparin-binding proteins, LPL binding to cells also involves non-HSPG proteins. Using heparin-agarose affinity chromatography, a 116-kDa LPL-binding protein was purified from endothelial cell extracts. Microsequencing of peptides generated by Lys-C protease digestion revealed complete homology with four different regions in the NH2-terminal part of human apolipoprotein B (apoB). Western blots using anti-apoB monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognize the NH2-terminal region of apoB confirmed that a 116-kDa fragment of apoB was present on endothelial cell membranes. Further evidence that LPL associates with the NH2-terminal region of apoB was obtained by showing 1) that an NH2-terminal fragment of apoB obtained from apoB-transfected CHO cells bound LPL on ligand blots and 2) that NH2-terminal fragments of apoB generated by thrombin digestion of low density lipoprotein bind LPL. Evidence that the NH2-terminal region of apoB mediates LPL interaction with endothelial cells was obtained using monoclonal antibodies. mAb3 and mAb19, which recognize epitopes near the NH2 terminus of apoB, inhibited 125I-LPL binding to cells by 60-65%. In contrast, mAb47, which has determinants at the COOH-terminal end of apoB, inhibited LPL binding by only about 10%. The inhibitory effects of mAb3 and mAb19 were abolished following treatment of cells with heparin, which removes the 116-kDa LPL-binding protein. Furthermore, incubation of 125I-LPL in medium containing an NH2-terminal apoB fragment reduced LPL binding to cells. These data suggest that an NH2-terminal fragment of apoB that binds to endothelial surfaces facilitates LPL binding to cells."
https://openalex.org/W1494954858,"It has been recently shown that in developing chicken embryonic nuclear extracts there is a 5-methyldeoxycytidine excision repair activity (Jost, J. P. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 4684-4688). We show that in differentiating mouse myoblasts, a similar enzymatic reaction may be responsible for the genome-wide DNA demethylation (up to 50% of all CmCGG) occurring between the 3rd and 5th days of differentiation. Furthermore, in differentiating myoblasts, there is first a 50% transient decrease in DNA methyltransferase activity and a 90% drop in the rate of DNA synthesis, followed by an increase in 5-methyl-CpG endonuclease and 5-methyldeoxycytidine excision repair activities. As tested in vitro, the maximal activity of the 5-methyldeoxycytidine excision repair coincides with the maximal in vivo genome-wide DNA demethylation. We also find that 3-aminobenzamide, a potent inhibitor of ADP-ribosyltransferase, blocks the differentiation of myoblasts, the 5-methyldeoxycytidine excision repair activity, and the genome-wide demethylation."
https://openalex.org/W1485782642,"An amino acid starvation-induced mRNA, increased up to 4-fold in the absence of amino acids, was identified previously as rat 60 S subunit ribosomal protein L17. The data presented here demonstrate that among ribosomal proteins, L17, as well as the smaller subunit ribosomal protein S25, are uniquely regulated by amino acid deprivation of cells; the increase in L17 and S25 mRNA content in response to substrate starvation is not shared by the 11 other ribosomal proteins tested. When rat Fao hepatoma cells were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D, the L17 mRNA level decayed below the basal level, regardless of medium amino acid content, and nuclear run-off assays confirmed that nutrient starvation leads to enhanced transcription of the L17 ribosomal protein gene. Likewise, the induction of S25 mRNA also was prevented in the presence of actinomycin D. Furthermore, the induction of L17 and S25 mRNA content was blocked by cycloheximide, demonstrating the requirement for a newly synthesized protein in the signaling pathway. Northern analysis with RNA isolated from cytoplasmic, polysomal, and nuclear enriched fractions indicated that the starvation-dependent increase in the S25 and L17 mRNAs is retained within the nucleus and not is available for translation. Amino acid refeeding of the cells caused the translocation of the stored nuclear mRNAs to the polysomal fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1524985622,"Fatty acid beta-oxidation was investigated in highly purified mitochondrial and peroxisomal preparations from rat liver. Under isotonic conditions, pristanic and homophytanic acid beta-oxidation in purified peroxisomes was severalfold greater compared to the oxidation in purified mitochondria. Branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation in purified mitochondria was very low, and the oxidation was not stimulated by exogenous L-carnitine or L-malate. In contrast, stearic acid beta-oxidation by purified mitochondria depended upon exogenous L-carnitine, and the oxidation was stimulated by L-malate. Both mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids was strongly inhibited by fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, whereas stearic acid oxidation was either unaffected or slightly inhibited by bovine serum albumin. The results presented clearly indicate that branched chain fatty acids are mainly degraded in peroxisomes in rat liver. Branched chain fatty acids were efficiently converted to coenzyme A thioesters by purified mitochondria, peroxisomes, and microsomes. Although pristanic and phytanic acids were rapidly converted to pristanoyl-CoA and phytanoyl-CoA, respectively, they were not converted to carnitine esters by mitochondrial outer membranes. The results indicate that acyl-CoA synthetase and carnitine acyltransferase located at the mitochondrial outer membranes regulate entry of branched chain fatty acids into mitochondria. Mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase I appears to be highly specific for straight chain fatty acids and restricts entry of branched chain fatty acids into mitochondria. Thus, branched chain fatty acids which cannot be transported across the mitochondrial membranes via the carnitine acyltransferase system are directed to peroxisomes for beta-oxidation. The results reported indicate that phytanic acid, the fatty acid which can be initially degraded by alpha-oxidation due to the presence of a beta-methyl group in the molecule, cannot be transported across the mitochondrial membranes. The data presented strongly suggest that phytanic acid alpha-oxidation occurs in organelles other than mitochondria and possibly in peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1589311901,"Transcription termination during synthesis of vaccinia early mRNAs occurs downstream of a UUUUUNU signal in the nascent transcript and requires a virus-encoded termination factor (VTF), which is identical with the vaccinia mRNA capping enzyme. Using purified transcription complexes halted at defined sites on linear DNA templates, we have examined the order and timing of events during a single round of elongation and termination. We find that although cap synthesis occurs by the time the nascent RNA is 31 nucleotides long, capping enzyme is not stably associated with the elongation complex at this stage. Stable interaction, defined by the formation of a termination-competent complex, requires a longer nascent RNA, e.g. 51 nucleotides, but does not depend on prior transcription of the termination signal. The acquisition of termination competence correlates temporally with the physical association of capping enzyme/VTF with the elongation complex, as revealed by UV cross-linking of the capping enzyme large subunit to the nascent RNA chain. Subsequent induction of termination and transcript release by capping enzyme requires energy, specifically the hydrolysis of ATP. The choice of termination site is flexible and is determined by a kinetic balance between the rate of polymerase elongation and the rate of signaling. Signaling rate is related directly to the concentration of hydrolyzable ATP. An apparent lower limit of 33 nucleotides between the 5' boundary of the termination signal and the most proximal termination site implies that the UUUUUNU signal must be extruded from the RNA polymerase before it can be acted upon by VTF. Similarities between VTF-dependent termination and rho-dependent termination underscore an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for RNA signal transduction to the elongating RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1524240684,"Abstract Downstream mediators of insulin signaling are thought to include multiple cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases such as the product of the cellular proto-oncogene c-raf-1. To investigate a role for the Raf-1 protein kinase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, a gene encoding an oncogenically activated Raf-1 mutant was introduced into 3T3-L1 fibroblasts by retroviral gene transfer. Expression of activated Raf-1 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes markedly increases hexose uptake compared to control adipocytes or those infected with the retroviral vector. Basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake in adipocytes expressing activated Raf-1 is approximately 40-fold higher than in parental adipocytes, and insulin further increases uptake about 1.2-fold. As determined by the plasma membrane sheet assay, Raf-1-expressing adipocytes contain greatly elevated levels of the ubiquitous glucose transporter (GLUT1) on the cell surface in the absence or presence of insulin. Total cellular GLUT1 protein is increased about 5-fold. In contrast, activated Raf-1 affects neither the expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) nor its cellular distribution; GLUT4 is virtually undetectable on the plasma membrane in the absence of insulin and translocates normally following the addition of hormone. These data suggest that activation of Raf-1 mediates the chronic effect of insulin on hexose uptake but is not sufficient for the rapid translocation of GLUT4. Moreover, the differential effects of activated Raf-1 expression on the two transporter isoforms define divergent signaling pathways by which insulin regulates glucose transport in cultured adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1554422725,"The acceptor helix of histidine tRNAs in Escherichia coli is capped by a unique base pair in which the cytosine at the discriminator position is paired with an extra guanosine at -1. In previous in vitro studies, the presence of the G-1:C73 base pair was found to be required to obtain both optimal histidylation by histidyl-tRNA synthetase and accurate 5' processing by RNase P. We investigated the role of G-1:C73 in histidine tRNA identity and found that nucleotide substitutions conferred mischarging by other amino acids in a pattern that correlated with the discriminator base and not with the extra nucleotide at -1. As shown by primer extension experiments, the relatively minor role of the -1 nucleotide in vivo could be attributed to altered RNase P processing. These studies show that interactions of tRNAs in vivo both with RNase P during tRNA biosynthesis and with the pool of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can modulate the effects of substitutions at recognition nucleotides, eliciting changes in transfer RNA identity."
https://openalex.org/W1599787368,"Stromelysin is a metalloproteinase with the widest substrate specificity that plays a critical role in the induction of the metastatic phenotype in cancer cells. The mechanisms whereby growth factors and oncogenes control stromelysin expression are beginning to be characterized. We have recently demonstrated that protein kinase C isotypes down-regulatable by chronic exposure to phorbol esters are not involved in stromelysin gene expression in response to platelet-derived growth factor, ras oncogene, and phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C. We also identified a region in the stromelysin promoter, distinct from the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element, responsible for the promoter activity in response to these stimulants. In this paper, we further characterize that promoter fragment and demonstrate that the region encompassing nucleotides -1218 to -1202, including the palindromic sequence ACTAGT, is necessary and sufficient for the control of stromelysin gene expression. The involvement of zeta-protein kinase C but not of c-raf in the stimulation of stromelysin promoter activity in response to platelet-derived growth factor is also demonstrated here. All these data suggest the existence of a bifurcation downstream of ras in the signaling mechanisms leading to stromelysin expression and DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2169821311,"Treatment of the hepatoma cell line, Hep3B, with gamma-interferon (IFN) enhanced expression of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) mRNA, primarily due to an enhanced transcription rate. Hep3B cells transfected with reporter constructs containing various regions of the C1INH gene between positions -1182 and +587, and stimulated with gamma-IFN, expressed increased levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in the presence of the first intron and as few as 12 bases of the 5'-flanking region. However, a 66% reduction in the inducibility of the constructs was observed when the upstream region between -582 and -252 was eliminated. Successive deletions mapped the first intron IFN-responsive elements to a region between +368 and +410. The data indicate that both the upstream and the first intron sequences can independently enhance induction of C1INH gene expression. Examination of the immediate upstream sequence of the C1INH gene reveals the absence of a TATA box. The promoter of the C1INH gene was mapped to a region within 81 bases of the upstream sequence and the first exon. Further examination indicated two regions that were potentially important for promoter activity as follows: 1) a G-C-rich region from -81 to -49, and 2) an initiator element at -3 to +5. The results indicate that the upstream sequences including -81 to -49 and the H-DNA region between -48 and -17 are not necessary for promotor activity. The initiator element from -3 to +5 is sufficient and necessary for promoter function."
https://openalex.org/W1544774760,"A deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase B results in the lysosomal storage disorder Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type VI. Severe, intermediate and mild forms of this autosomal recessively inherited disease can be clinically differentiated. To determine the molecular defect in a patient with the intermediate form of the disorder, DNA fragments generated from the patient's mRNA by reverse transcription and subsequent amplification by the polymerase chain reaction were subcloned and sequenced. The mRNA transcribed from one allele contains a 244-base pair deletion causing a frameshift and a truncation of the open reading frame. The C-terminal third of the encoded mutant polypeptide has a nonsense sequence. This mutation is due to a deletion of exon 5 in this allele. A silent A to G transition at nucleotide 1191 was present in the same allele, and the second allele was characterized by a T to C transition at nucleotide 1600 causing a mutation of the translational stop codon to a glutamine codon (*534Q) and extending the encoded polypeptide by 50 amino acids. Stable expression of the *534Q allele in LTK- cells resulted in a mutant precursor 4 kDa larger than the wild-type precursor. The majority of the mutant precursor appears to be degraded before reaching the trans Golgi. This is consistent with an altered polypeptide structure, where a number of missing or masked epitopes were observed in an enzyme immunobinding assay using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Immunoquantification analysis showed that epitopes were most likely masked, as missing epitopes could be reformed by binding the mutant protein to a polyclonal antibody of arylsulfatase B. It is suggested that the additional amino acids at the C terminus of the arylsulfatase B polypeptide induce a protein conformational change. *534Q mutant polypeptide escaping degradation is sorted to dense lysosomes. The mutant polypeptide has an approximately 9-fold higher catalytic efficiency than wild-type arylsulfatase B."
https://openalex.org/W2043123347,"When human peripheral blood granulocytes were metabolically labeled at 37 degrees C with [32P]orthophosphate, inorganic polyphosphates became preferentially radiolabeled. Incorporation of radiolabel into the polymer appeared to be ATP-independent. [32P]Polyphosphate was identified by its (i) characteristic lability to acid hydrolysis, (ii) insolubility in barium acetate (pH 4.5), (iii) conversion to [32P]trimetaphosphate, (iv) hydrolysis to [32P]orthophosphate by an exopolyphosphate (Saccharomyces cerevisiae scPPX1), and (v) conversion to a ladder which co-migrated on a polyacrylamide gel with a synthetic phosphate ladder. Also, indirect evidence suggested that the [32P]polyphosphate was strongly, noncovalently associated with another unknown molecule. Particulate fractions (13,000 x g) from lysates of human granulocytes, skin fibroblasts, HL-60 and SK-N-SH cells, all demonstrated radiolabeling of polyphosphate when incubated at 37 degrees C with [32P]orthophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1564631931,"Cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptophytes contain phycobiliproteins which function as photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments. The chromophores of phycobiliproteins are phycobilins, open-chain tetrapyrroles that are synthesized from protoheme. The first step of phycobilin formation is the conversion of protoheme to biliverdin IX alpha in a reaction that is catalyzed by heme oxygenase. In the unicellular red alga, Cyanidium caldarium, light is required for the accumulation of phycobiliproteins. It has been reported previously that the synthesis of the apoprotein components of allophycocyanin and phycocyanin is induced by light in C. caldarium, that the phycobilin precursors, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), protoporphyrin IX, and protoheme can substitute for light, and that the regulation is exerted at the level of mRNA synthesis. We have determined that a key enzyme of phycobilin formation is induced by light in C. caldarium. Extractable heme oxygenase activity is low in dark-grown cells, and it increases approximately 6-fold during the first 24 h after the cells are illuminated. After 24 h, the activity decreases to a level approximately equal to the initial activity. Heme oxygenase is induced in unilluminated cells by administration of ALA. D-Glucose, which is known to inhibit phycocyanin accumulation in C. caldarium, inhibits the induction of heme oxygenase by light or ALA. Induction of heme oxygenase by light or ALA is blocked by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, but not by chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of chloroplast protein synthesis. Rifampicin, an inhibitor of algal chloroplast RNA synthesis, and gabaculine, a competitive inhibitor of ALA biosynthesis, block the induction of heme oxygenase by light but not by ALA. These results indicate that heme oxygenase in C. caldarium is induced by phycobilin precursors. The induction by light and the repression of the induction by D-glucose are probably indirect effects mediated by the effects of light and D-glucose on phycobilin precursor formation. The results also indicate that heme oxygenase is encoded by a nuclear gene and is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1496402490,"The cell type-specific element and 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (thyroid hormone) (T3) response element of the rat growth hormone gene act synergistically to produce cell type-specific, T3-regulated expression. Pit-1 is a pituitary cell type-specific transcription factor that binds the cell type-specific element and is essential to its activity. T3 receptors bind as homodimers and heterodimers to the T3 response element and are essential for its activity. Here, we report the use of ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting to study the effects of T3 on protein-DNA interactions in the rat growth hormone gene promoter in vivo. T3-responsive guanine methylation was detected only in and near the T3 response element and the Pit-1 binding sites. The results indicate that within 2 h, T3 induces occupancy of the T3 response element and Pit-1 sites by their respective trans-acting factors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1534409646,"Thyroid hormone receptors are transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner. Thyroid hormone response elements can be composed of direct repeat or palindromic arrangements of half-sites. The traditional half-site has been considered to be the sequence 5'-AGGTCA, although we recently demonstrated that the optimal monomer-binding site is 2 base pairs larger, 5'-TAAGGTCA. It has generally been presumed that alterations in half-site sequence have commensurate effects on gene expression from direct repeat and palindromic response elements. However, in the present studies we demonstrate that palindromic elements are highly dependent on the presence of the two 5'-nucleotides (TA) for function, whereas this portion of the response element has minimal influence on hormone induction from direct repeat elements. Hormone induction correlates poorly with binding affinity for thyroid hormone receptor monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with retinoid X receptors, either in the absence or presence of ligands. We speculate that the magnitude of hormone induction may reflect protein conformation differences induced by a combination of the presence of the appropriate 5'-nucleotides plus half-site orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1573013630,"The strand exchange reaction that is widely used for in vitro studies on recombination of DNA molecules is generally presumed to result from a preceding homologous pairing step. With the use of a single-stranded circular DNA and a short homologous linear duplex fragment as substrates in a model strand exchange reaction, it was found that modest concentrations of polyethylene glycol or salt promote formation of heteroduplex molecules and strand exchange. When the duplex fragment was partially resected with an exonuclease exposing a short single-stranded stretch on the ends, the reaction was promoted by the addition of commercial bovine serum albumin. The transcription factor TFIIIA promoted strand exchange when the DNA substrates contained the cognate DNA binding sequence recognized by the protein. These observations suggest that detection of strand exchange in vitro does not necessarily imply a preceding homologous pairing step."
https://openalex.org/W122457087,"A macromolecule in human platelet secretory products was demonstrated previously to inhibit the binding and uptake of acetoacetylated (AcAc) low density lipoproteins (LDL) by scavenger receptors on mouse peritoneal macrophages. In the current study, this macromolecule was purified to apparent homogeneity by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, Sephacryl S-300 chromatography, and sucrose gradient centrifugation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. Chemical analysis indicated that the macromolecule (designated platelet-derived macrophage-binding proteoglycan (PDMBP)) was a chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan with an approximately 32-kDa core protein. A polyclonal antibody produced against this proteoglycan identified only PDMBP on Western blots of platelet secretory products and removed all ability of these products to inhibit the binding of AcAc LDL to macrophages. Treatment of purified PDMBP with protease or chondroitinase AC or ABC abolished the ability of the proteoglycan to inhibit the binding of AcAc LDL to macrophages. Binding studies using radiolabeled PDMBP demonstrated that the proteoglycan bound directly to the macrophage cell surface and was competitively inhibited by AcAc LDL, acetyl-LDL, fucoidin, and unlabeled PDMBP. PDMBP inhibited binding of 125I-labeled AcAc LDL to macrophages but had no effect on binding to endothelial cells. The finding that PDMBP binds to the scavenger receptor on macrophages suggests a mechanism for the inhibition of foam cell formation and suggests that the receptor could be involved in the plasma clearance of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1539598707,"Analysis of the nuclear factors responsible for erythroid gene regulation has led to the cloning of several transcriptional regulatory proteins with clear lines of evidence suggesting or demonstrating their roles in tissue-specific gene expression. However, the erythroid cell lineage-restricted proteins that have been characterized to date do not differ significantly in activity during the distinct developmental stages of erythropoiesis, a characteristic that might be expected for a nuclear factor that actively participates in the differential regulation of various alpha- or beta-type globin genes (called globin gene switching) at distinct stages of embryonic development. We reported previously the identification of such a differentially expressed DNA binding activity, which appeared to be present in mature definitive (adult) erythroid cells but absent in immature definitive or primitive (embryonic) erythroid cells. Here we detail the biochemical properties of this erythroid tissue- and developmental stage-specific DNA binding activity (called nuclear factor-erythroid 4; NF-E4), which contains characteristics of a molecule that may be intimately involved in globin gene switching."
https://openalex.org/W1570064687,"Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigens are heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins consisting of an alpha and a beta chain. Although one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified MHC class II antigens shows a single diffuse band for each chain, multiple spots of identical molecular size were observed for each chain when analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The basis of this heterogeneity has not been clearly defined and has been predicted partially to be due to glycosylation and/or phosphorylation of the mature protein. To investigate the role of the three N-linked oligosaccharides of the alpha and beta chains in determining the isoelectric point of each chain, affinity-purified MHC class II antigens from human and rat sources were deglycosylated using asparagine amidase. The complete enzymatic removal of all three N-linked oligosaccharides was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as well as by four different lectin-linked Western blot analyses. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the deglycosylated molecules shows no significant difference from the fully glycosylated chains. We have expressed truncated forms of the HLA DR2 chains which lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmically exposed regions in Escherichia coli. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of these single chains also reveal multiple banding patterns. The two-dimensional banding patterns described are unaffected by exposure to acidic or basic conditions, increased gel running time in the first dimension, treatment of the proteins with alkaline phosphatase to remove any potential phosphorylation, or preincubation in the presence of iodoacetamide. Multiple forms of recombinant alpha and beta chains were also observed in Tris-glycine-urea gels which merged into a single band in the presence of SDS. In addition, partially fractionated bands from preparative isoelectric focusing gels, when refocused, showed an identical number of multiple spots spanning the same range of isoelectric points. These results together suggest that each polypeptide chain of MHC class II antigens may exist in multiconformational forms, and the observed charge heterogeneity is independent of glycosylation and phosphorylation of the proteins."

In this report subclones of the arsA gene were constructed to produce polypeptide fragments of the ArsA protein. By themselves none of the fragments exhibited anion-stimulated ATPase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2134523551,"A previously undescribed high molecular mass protein (HMP) from human erythrocyte membranes was solubilized by Triton X-100 and purified on a calmodulin-agarose column in the presence of Ca2+. It was shown to have a native molecular mass of 522-560 kDa, comprised of a single subunit of a molecular mass of 28 kDa (p28). The protein is associated with the lipid bilayer rather than with the cytoskeletal component of the membrane. The purified HMP showed peptidase-hydrolyzing activity toward substrates containing hydrophobic amino acids at the P1 position of the P2-P1 cleavage site. The activity was inhibited by serine proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, phenylmethansulfonyl fluoride) and chymotrypsin inhibitors in particular (chymostatin, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone). The enzyme exhibited maximal activity at slightly alkaline pH (7.5-8.5) and at 37 degrees C and was stimulated over a narrow range of SDS concentrations (maximal at 0.05%). HMP was found to cross-react in Western blots with an antibody raised against the rabbit multicatalytic proteinase. The single subunit of HMP therefore contains both the catalytic activity and a sequence necessary for its association into a multimeric complex. The properties of the human erythrocyte membrane HMP described indicate that it is a novel peptidase related to the ubiquitous multicatalytic proteinase."
