https://openalex.org/W4307569409,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 suppresses cancer by regulating processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, senescence, and ferroptosis, which is an iron-mediated and lipid peroxide-induced cell death pathway. Whereas numerous p53 target genes have been identified, only a few appear to be critical for the suppression of tumor growth. Additionally, while ferroptosis is clearly implicated in tumor suppression by p53, few p53 target genes with roles in ferroptosis have been identified. We have previously studied germline missense p53 variants that are hypomorphic or display reduced activity. These hypomorphic variants are associated with increased risk for cancer, but they retain the majority of p53 transcriptional function; as such, study of the transcriptional targets of these hypomorphs has the potential to reveal the identity of other genes important for p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here, using RNA-seq in lymphoblastoid cell lines, we identify PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein) as a p53 target gene that shows impaired transactivation by three different cancer-associated p53 hypomorphs: P47S (Pro47Ser, rs1800371), Y107H (Tyr107His, rs368771578), and G334R (Gly334Arg, rs78378222). We show that enforced expression of PLTP potently suppresses colony formation in human tumor cell lines. We also demonstrate that PLTP regulates the sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal PLTP to be a p53 target gene that is extremely sensitive to p53 transcriptional function and which has roles in growth suppression and ferroptosis."

However, the isolation, culturing, and dissociation procedures likely affect the transcriptome profiles, distorting the biological conclusions. The aim of the current study was to characterize the cells of the islets of Langerhans from subjects with and without type 1 diabetes in a way that reflects the in vivo situation to the highest possible extent. Methods Islets were excised using laser capture microdissection directly from frozen pancreatic tissue sections obtained from organ donors with (n = 7) and without (n = 8) type 1 diabetes. Transcriptome analysis of excised samples was performed using AmpliSeq. Consecutive pancreatic sections were used to estimate the proportion of beta-, alpha-, and delta cells using immunofluorescence and to examine the presence of CD31 positive endothelial regions using immunohistochemistry. Results The proportion of beta cells in islets from subjects with type 1 diabetes was reduced to 0% according to both the histological and transcriptome data, and several alterations in the transcriptome were derived from the loss of beta cells. In total, 473 differentially expressed genes were found in the islets from subjects with type 1 diabetes. Functional enrichment analysis showed that several of the most upregulated gene sets were related to vasculature and angiogenesis, and histologically, vascular density was increased in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Downregulated in type 1 diabetes islets was the gene set epithelial mesenchymal transition . Conclusion A number of transcriptional alterations are present in islets from subjects with type 1 diabetes. In particular, several gene sets related to vasculature and angiogenesis are upregulated and there is an increased vascular density, suggesting an altered microvasculature in islets from subjects with type 1 diabetes. By studying pancreatic islets extracted directly from snap-frozen pancreatic tissue, this study reflects the in vivo situation to a high degree and gives important insights into islet pathophysiology in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4307331432,"Inflammation contributes to the progression of retinal pathology caused by diabetes. Here, we investigated a role for the stress response protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) in the development of retinal inflammation. Increased REDD1 expression was observed in the retina of mice after 16-weeks of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, and REDD1 was essential for diabetes-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In human retinal MIO-M1 Müller cell cultures, REDD1 deletion prevented increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in response to hyperglycemic conditions. REDD1 deletion promoted nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) hyperactivation; however, Nrf2 was not required for reduced inflammatory cytokine expression in REDD1-deficient cells. Rather, REDD1 enhanced inflammatory cytokine expression by promoting activation of nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB). In WT cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), inflammatory cytokine expression was increased in coordination with activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-dependent REDD1 expression and sustained activation of NF-κB. In both Müller cell cultures exposed to TNFα and in the retina of STZ-diabetic mice, REDD1 deletion promoted inhibitor of κB (IκB) expression and reduced NF-κB DNA-binding activity. We found that REDD1 acted upstream of IκB by enhancing both K63-ubiquitination and auto-phosphorylation of IκB kinase complex. In contrast with STZ-diabetic REDD1+/+ mice, IκB kinase complex autophosphorylation and macrophage infiltration were not observed in the retina of STZ-diabetic REDD1-/- mice. The findings provide new insight into how diabetes promotes retinal inflammation and support a model wherein REDD1 sustains activation of canonical NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4307394254,"Autophagy is a major cellular degradation pathway that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. The identification of cargos captured by autophagosomes is critical to our understanding of the physiological significance of autophagy in cells, but these studies can be challenging because autophagosomes disintegrate easily. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells deficient in the vacuolar lipase Atg15 accumulate autophagic bodies (ABs) within the vacuole following the induction of autophagy. As ABs contain cytosolic components including proteins, RNAs, and lipids, their purification allows the identification of material targeted by autophagy for degradation. In this study, we demonstrate a method to purify intact ABs using isolated vacuoles from atg15Δ cells. Taking advantage of the size discrepancy between the vacuoles and ABs, the vacuolar membrane was disrupted by filtration to release ABs. Filtered vacuolar lysates were subjected to density gradient centrifugation to obtain AB fractions. Purified ABs retain membrane integrity and contain autophagic cargos. This technique offers a valuable tool for the identification of the cargos of autophagy, examination of autophagic cargo selectivity, and biochemical characterization of autophagosome membranes.

This technique offers a valuable tool for the identification of the cargos of autophagy, examination of autophagic cargo selectivity, and biochemical characterization of autophagosome membranes. Autophagy is an evolutionally conserved intracellular degradation process in which cytoplasmic constituents and organelles are delivered to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation (1Klionsky D.J. Autophagy: From phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 2Ohsumi Y. Historical landmarks of autophagy research.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Upon induction of autophagy, a curved, membranous structure (the isolation membrane) forms, expands, and eventually forms a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome (AP) that captures a portion of the cytoplasm. The outer membrane of the AP subsequently fuses with the vacuole (or a lysosome in mammalian cells), releasing the inner membrane–bound structure into the vacuolar lumen; this structure, termed the autophagic body (AB), is then degraded by resident hydrolases. Autophagy occurs constitutively at a low level and is strongly induced when cells are starved for nutrients; in the latter case, cytosolic constituents are sequestered in an apparently random fashion into APs by macroautophagy (herein simply ‘autophagy’). Nitrogen starvation, which is sensed through the Target of rapamycin signaling pathway, is one of the strongest autophagy-inducing stimuli, and inhibition of rapamycin by rapamycin also induces autophagy at a level comparable to nitrogen starvation (3Kamada Y. Yoshino K. Kondo C. Kawamata T. Oshiro N. Yonezawa K. et al.Tor directly controls the Atg1 kinase complex to regulate autophagy.Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 30: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the degradation products of autophagy are returned to the cytosol for reuse by the cell. Autophagy therefore acts as a fundamental cellular degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis and forms a central plank of the starvation response. Autophagy is essential for survival during nitrogen starvation in yeast (4Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. Isolation and characterization of autophagy-defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar), and perturbations in autophagy have been associated with many diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative pathologies in mammals (5Mizushima N. White E. Rubinsztein D.C. Breakthroughs and bottlenecks in autophagy research.Trends Mol. Med. 2021; 27: 835-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). AP formation is a membranous phenomenon characterized by intricate membrane dynamics. So far, 18 Atg (autophagy-related) proteins (Atg1-10, Atg12–14, Atg16–18, Atg29, Atg31) have been identified as ‘core’ Atg proteins required for AP formation in yeast (6Nakatogawa H. Mechanisms governing autophagosome biogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Atg8 forms a conjugate with an amino group of a membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The formation of Atg8-PE requires Atg7 (an E1 enzyme), Atg3 (an E2 enzyme), and Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 (an E3 like enzyme). Atg4 protease functions in the processing of Atg8 precursor and delipidation of Atg8-PE. Structural and biochemical studies have recently revealed that Atg2 functions to transport phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum to the isolation membrane and that Atg9 acts as a phospholipid scramblase on the isolation membrane (7Maeda S. Yamamoto H. Kinch L.N. Garza C.M. Takahashi S. Otomo C. et al.Structure, lipid scrambling activity and role in autophagosome formation of ATG9A.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nakatogawa H. et al.Atg2 mediates direct lipid transfer between membranes for autophagosome formation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition to the canonical autophagy pathway, many selective or preferential types of autophagy have been reported (12Faruk M.O. Ichimura Y. Komatsu M. Selective autophagy.Cancer Sci. 2021; 112: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki K. Selective autophagy in budding yeast.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These mechanisms employ receptor and adaptor proteins to ensure the expansion of isolation membranes closely around the surface of proteins/organelles targeted by selective autophagy, indicating that the autophagy machinery can be adapted to the highly specific removal of cellular components. Whether bulk autophagy is a truly random process or exhibits some preference in cargo isolation has not yet been thoroughly investigated. A further question that remains poorly addressed in the field concerns the proteins and lipid membrane composition of AP membranes, as well as their physical properties, which so far have proven challenging to analyze due to the technical difficulties involved in specifically isolating AP membranes. In this study, we develop a novel method for the isolation of ABs from yeast. Early electron microscopic studies of autophagy in yeast revealed that APs range in size from 300 to 900 nm in diameter and are bound by a double layer of membranes that contain very little protein, especially within the inner membrane (14Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. Ultrastructural analysis of the autophagic process in yeast: Detection of autophagosomes and their characterization.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These properties of AP membranes make it challenging to purify AP by biochemical methods such as immunoisolation. In WT yeast cells, ABs disintegrate almost immediately within the vacuole, preventing their visualization even by live cell microscopy. In contrast, cells lacking vacuolar proteases (Pep4 and Prb1) or the vacuolar lipase (Atg15) accumulate ABs within the vacuole (15Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Aut5/Cvt17p, a putative lipase essential for disintegration of autophagic bodies inside the vacuole.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a density gradient centrifugation method for the isolation of ABs from vacuoles in yeast. This approach allows for the investigation of cellular materials targeted for degradation by autophagy under diverse physiological conditions, as well as the interrogation of AB properties, such as membrane composition and biochemical features. We have previously reported a method for the isolation of vacuoles by taking advantage of the low density of this organelle (19Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Active transport of basic amino acids driven by a proton motive force in vacuolar membrane vesicles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To purify ABs, we started by purifying vacuoles containing ABs from cells following autophagy induction. We used atg15Δ cells, in which ABs accumulate within vacuoles, atg15Δ atg2Δ cells, in which APs and thus also ABs do not form, and WT cells, in which ABs and their cargo are degraded within vacuoles (Fig. 1A). Cells were cultured in a rich medium (YPD) and treated with rapamycin for 3 h to induce autophagy. Following this, spheroplasts were prepared by incubating cells with Zymolyase, an enzyme that digests the yeast cell wall. Spheroplasts were then lysed by osmotic shock and vacuoles were purified from cell lysates by floatation in a Ficoll step gradient. Phase-contrast microscopy revealed that vacuoles purified from atg15Δ cells contain a large number of ABs, whereas vacuoles from atg15Δ atg2Δ (defective for autophagy) and WT (ABs degraded within the vacuole) cells are almost completely devoid of AB-like structures (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined organelle marker proteins to assess the purity of obtained vacuoles. Vacuolar membrane proteins (Pho8 and Vph1) and vacuolar luminal proteins (Pep4 and Cpy1) were enriched in purified vacuolar extracts of WT, atg15Δ, and atg15Δ atg2Δ cells compared to total cell lysates (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, mitochondrial (Por1 and Cox2), Golgi (Van1), and nuclear marker proteins (Gsp1) were largely excluded from purified vacuolar extracts, indicating the strong and specific enrichment of vacuole. Previous studies have suggested that the ER is a source of membranes for APs and that most APs contain ER fragments (20Hamasaki M. Noda T. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Starvation triggers the delivery of the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole via autophagy in yeast.Traffic. 2005; 6: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We investigated whether ER membrane proteins are detected in purified vacuolar extracts isolated from WT, atg15Δ, and atg15Δ atg2Δ cells, finding that the ER membrane protein Dpm1 is detected at a similar level in all strains (Fig. 1C). This suggests that a part of the ER may contaminate purified vacuolar fractions. We also examined Pep12, a t-SNARE that localizes mainly to endosomes/MVBs. After fusion of an MVB with the vacuole, internal vesicles of the MVB are degraded in the vacuole. It has previously been reported that Atg15 is involved in the degradation of the internal vesicles of MVB (16Epple U.D. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. Intravacuolar membrane lysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Does vacuolar targeting of Cvt17/Aut5p affect its function.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7810-7821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, Pep12 was detected in the vacuolar fraction of atg15Δ and atg15Δ atg2Δ, while no signal was detected in WT vacuolar fractions (Fig. 1C). The absence of a Pep12 signal in the WT vacuoles suggests that Pep12 was degraded in this organelle. We conclude that vacuoles purified from atg15Δ or atg15Δ atg2Δ cells contain internal vesicles of MVB. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is widely used as a marker of APs. It has been reported that Atg8 localizes to the vacuolar membrane independently of the autophagy machinery (21Liu X.M. Yamasaki A. Du X.M. Coffman V.C. Ohsumi Y. Nakatogawa H. et al.Lipidation-independent vacuolar functions of Atg8 rely on its noncanonical interaction with a vacuole membrane protein.Elife. 2018; 7e41237Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We detected Atg8-PE in vacuole extracts from WT, atg15Δ, and atg15Δ atg2Δ cells, but a nonconjugated form of Atg8 was additionally detected in atg15Δ cells (Fig. 1C). The Atg8-PE observed in atg15Δ atg2Δ vacuolar fractions may arise from Atg8 bound to the outer face of the vacuolar membrane in an autophagy-independent manner. Meanwhile, free Atg8 observed only in atg15Δ cell extracts suggests cleavage of Atg8-PE bound to the inner side of ABs by Atg4 (See also Atg8 and Atg8-PE in Fig. 3B). When autophagy is induced, the well-established autophagy cargo protein Ape1 is delivered to the vacuole by autophagy (6Nakatogawa H. Mechanisms governing autophagosome biogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). prApe1 is selectively taken up by APs and transported to the vacuole where AB membranes are subsequently disintegrated. prApe1 is then processed by vacuolar proteases at the N-terminal region, yielding a mature form (mApe1). In vacuoles isolated from WT cells, mApe1 was detected (Fig. 1C). Meanwhile, vacuoles isolated from atg15Δ cells showed a prApe1 band which was not observed in atg15Δ atg2Δ vacuoles. mApe1 detected in vacuoles isolated from atg15Δ cells is likely due to partial degradation of prApe1 during the vacuole purification process, resulting in the cleavage of prApe1 to the mature form. We further examined several cytosolic proteins, including Adh1 (alcohol dehydrogenase), Hsp90 (heat-shock protein), and Pgk1 (3-phosphoglycerate kinase). These proteins were detected in vacuolar extracts purified from atg15Δ cells but not WT or atg15Δ atg2Δ cells, indicating that these proteins reside in the AB and are degraded in WT cells. Taken together, these data indicate that our procedure yields vacuoles containing intact ABs (Fig. 1C). We next examined methods to isolate intact ABs from the isolated vacuoles. Neither sonication nor detergent are appropriate for this purpose. We instead reasoned specific disruption of the vacuole membrane could liberate intact ABs. To this end, we focused on the size difference between vacuoles and ABs. Vacuoles in yeast are large, usually 1 to 4 μm in diameter, whereas ABs are about 500 nm in diameter. Taking advantage of this difference, we attempted to break the vacuolar membrane by filtration (Fig. 1A). We isolated vacuoles from atg15Δ cells under rapamycin-treated conditions. After passing the purified vacuoles through membrane filters of various sizes, we examined vacuoles by microscopy. When a 1.2 μm pore size membrane filter was used, intact vacuoles were barely visible, but small vacuoles were still observed, indicating incomplete destruction of the vacuole (Fig. 2A). We found that a 0.8 μm pore size membrane filter, which is larger than the average AB diameter, could efficiently disrupt vacuoles (Fig. 2A). We subjected unfiltered or filtered vacuoles by 0.8 μm filters to OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation and further processed these samples into 12 fractions (Fig. 2B). When unfiltered vacuoles were fractioned by 0 to 30% OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation, Vph1 (vacuolar membrane protein), prApe1, and mApe1 (autophagy cargo protein) were all distributed in the light fractions. On the other hand, fractionation of the vacuolar filtrates through 0.8 μm filters showed a characteristic distribution of Ape1: prApe1 was detected in the heavy fractions, whereas mApe1 was identified in the top fractions (Fig. 2B). Vph1 was distributed in the light fractions. These results indicate that the filtration of vacuoles can separate the vacuolar membrane fraction from the fraction containing prApe1. Since prApe1 was distributed in the heavy fractions, the same experiment was performed with a higher density gradient. We found that in the 0 to 45% OptiPrep condition, the fractionation pattern of prApe1 shifts to a lighter fraction and becomes closer to the distribution of Vph1 than in the 0 to 30% OptiPrep condition (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we decided to investigate the behavior of other marker proteins under 0 to 30% OptiPrep conditions, where Vph1 and prApe1 can be better separated. In order to provide an additional unbiased reporter of cytosolic protein sequestration in APs, we expressed a vector-borne GST-GFP chimeric protein in cells. GST-GFP localized to the cytoplasm of cells under growing conditions. When autophagy was induced by rapamycin treatment, GST-GFP expressed in atg15Δ cells was delivered to the vacuole and localized to the AB, while it was not observed in atg15Δ atg2Δ cells (Fig. 3A). GST-GFP therefore provides a useful marker to assess bulk autophagy. We isolated vacuoles from atg15Δ and atg15Δ atg2Δ cells expressing GST-GFP under rapamycin-treated conditions and passed these samples through 0.8 μm filters. We subjected these filtrates to OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3B). In atg15Δ and atg15Δ atg2Δ cells, the vacuolar luminal proteins Pep4 and Cpy1 appeared in the top fractions (fractions 1–2). Pho8 and Vph1 (vacuolar membrane) and Pep12 (the internal vesicles of MVB) were distributed throughout the lighter fractions (fractions 3–5). Dpm1 (ER membrane) was widely distributed, gradually increasing towards the bottom fraction. Meanwhile, in atg15Δ cells, prApe1 was detected in heavier fractions (fractions 7–12), whereas mApe1 was identified in the top fractions (fractions 1–3). Cytosolic proteins (Adh1, Hsp90, Pgk1) fractionated into similar fractions as prApe1. However, these cytosolic markers were not detected in the heavy fraction derived from atg15Δ atg2Δ cells. We also examined the distribution of the reporter GST-GFP construct. In atg15Δ samples, full-length GST-GFP was clearly observed in heavier fractions, whereas cleaved GFP was recovered in the light fractions. In atg15Δ atg2Δ samples, cleaved GFP was detected in light fractions. The distribution of Atg8 was examined along similar lines. In samples isolated from atg15Δ cells, the localization of Atg8-PE was widely distributed between fractions 1 to 12, but the localization of free Atg8 was found only in fractions 7 to 12. In atg15Δ atg2Δ samples, Atg8-PE was mainly found in fractions 1 to 5. Based on these results, we regard fractions 7 to 12, which showed prApe1, cytoplasmic marker protein, and free Atg8 signals, to be AB-enriched fractions. We hypothesized that the reason why the AB fraction is denser than vacuolar membranes is due to the presence of ribosomes within ABs. Ribosomes are markedly dense supramolecular structures due to the large amount of RNA, and prior electron microscopy (EM) analyses indicate that most APs contain a similar density of ribosomes to the cytoplasm (14Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. Ultrastructural analysis of the autophagic process in yeast: Detection of autophagosomes and their characterization.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We assessed 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in each fraction by quantitative real‑time PCR (qRT-PCR). In samples extracted from atg15Δ cells, 18S rRNA was observed in fractions 7 to 12, which is consistent with the detection of cytoplasmic cargo proteins and Atg8 in these fractions (Fig. 3B). 18S rRNA showed a peak at fraction 9. In contrast, atg15Δ atg2Δ samples yielded no 18S rRNA signal at all. Based on these results, we concluded that our density gradient centrifugation yields three fractions. The top two fractions are made up of soluble proteins, including vacuolar luminal proteins. Fractions 3 to 5 are made up of vacuolar membranes and internal vesicles of MVB. Fractions 8 to 12 are AB-enriched fractions. To address the degree to which ABs are purified, the proteins in each fraction after fractionation were visualized (Fig. 4). The ponceau S staining in Figure 4 shows that many proteins were visible in the AB fraction from atg15Δ cells. However, for atg15Δ atg2Δ cells, few proteins were observed in the AB fraction. We checked another vacuolar membrane protein in AB fractions by Western blotting. Vma1, one of the Vo subunits of V-ATPase, was found to exhibit the same behavior as the V1 subunit, Vph1, and the signal was significantly reduced in AB fractions (Fig. 4). We characterized the bottom fraction more closely because the ER membrane protein Dpm1 was detected in the fraction, independent of autophagy (Fig. 3B). For this purpose, we examined other ER proteins (Sec63, Sar1, Kar2). Sec63, ER membrane protein, and Sar1, ER-localized protein, showed the same behavior as prApe1 and Pgk1, indicating that these proteins are included in the AB fraction in an autophagy-dependent manner (Fig. 4), which is in good agreement with our previous EM analysis (20Hamasaki M. Noda T. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Starvation triggers the delivery of the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole via autophagy in yeast.Traffic. 2005; 6: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kar2, ER luminal protein, had the same pattern as Dpm1. Thus, we do not know the exact reason, but the localization of ER proteins was found to be different depending on the ER protein used. Since ER is inherently included in AB (20Hamasaki M. Noda T. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Starvation triggers the delivery of the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole via autophagy in yeast.Traffic. 2005; 6: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it is quite difficult to determine the extent to which ERs are contaminated. For subsequent analyses, we adopted a conservative definition of fractions 8 to 11 to use as the AB fraction, because fraction 12 is a bottom fraction that is likely to contain contaminating proteins and membranes due to nonspecific aggregation. Meanwhile, fraction 7 is close to the vacuolar membrane fraction. We next set out to characterize ABs isolated using this method by collecting AB fractions and subjecting them to biochemical and EM analyses. First, a protease protection assay was performed to examine the membrane integrity of purified ABs. prApe1 and Hsp90 were resistant to proteinase K treatment, indicating that AB membranes remain intact (Fig. 5A). Second, AB fractions were examined by EM and compared with the vacuolar membrane fraction (Fig. 5B). In the vacuolar membrane fractions, fairly large membrane fragments were clearly observed. On the other hand, the AB membrane was hard to visualize, which reproduced our previous findings (22Baba M. Osumi M. Ohsumi Y. Analysis of the membrane structures involved in autophagy in yeast by freeze-replica method.Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and suggests that AB membranes have very low electron density. These ABs contained ribosomes, in agreement with 18S rRNA data (Fig. 3B). Third, we analyzed the size of the AB fractions by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The average diameter of ABs was 379 nm, which is consistent with the size of ABs shown in our EM data (Fig. 5C). Finally, we compared the total protein complement purified from atg15Δ and atg15Δ atg2Δ cell–derived fractions. Many protein bands presumably representing diverse cytosolic proteins were detected in the AB fraction of atg15Δ cells (Fig. 5D). In contrast, such protein bands were barely detectable in atg15Δ atg2Δ samples. We conclude that the proteins detected in the atg15Δ AB fraction are cargo proteins captured by APs and delivered to the vacuole. In this study, we present a purification method of ABs from yeast, which is the first report on the isolation of the inner membrane structure of APs. The procedure outlined in this study allows for the detailed examination of the molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of autophagy. Our approach exploits the accumulation of ABs under autophagy-inducing conditions in the atg15Δ strain and the large size of budding yeast vacuoles, which are relatively easy to isolate. In order to obtain intact ABs from vacuoles, we took advantage of the size discrepancy between vacuoles and ABs, employing filtration through ideal pore size membrane filter to disrupt the vacuolar membrane and release ABs for subsequent fractionation (Fig. 2A). In this method, we cannot exclude the possibility that large ABs may be broken in the process of passing through the filter. If there is a method to specifically disrupt only the vacuolar membrane, these problems will be improved. However, we believe at least a qualitative characterization of AB is possible with this method. The purity of ABs was verified by Western blotting of a range of representative marker proteins, and we showed that cytosolic proteins and an additionally expressed chimeric GST-GFP protein were recovered in the AB fraction in an autophagy-dependent manner. Representative mitochondrial, Golgi, and nuclear protein markers were detected only marginally, if at all, in the AB fraction. Meanwhile, Vph1, a marker of the vacuolar membrane, was observed in the AB fraction, although the majority of this protein was eliminated from ABs by density gradient centrifugation. For ER proteins, we found that the localization of ER proteins in the AB fraction was different depending on the ER protein used as marker proteins. While small amount of contamination of ER membranes cannot be ruled out, fractions 8 to 11 most likely include ER proteins that are naturally present in ABs due to close localization of ER or the supply of ER membranes during AP formation (Figs. 3B and 4). Considering the overall fractionation patterns of rRNA, EM data, and SDS-PAGE analyses of total protein content, we conclude that the AB is highly enriched using the fraction strategy described in this report. We developed this technique by purifying ABs from atg15Δ cells after rapamycin treatment for 3 h. We anticipate that our method is applicable to other cells that accumulate autophagic bodies, such as the pep4Δ prb1Δ strain, as well as cells treated with PMSF (15Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S.

Purification of ABs offers a valuable and previously unavailable method for the determining and analysis of autophagy cargos. While bulk degradation via autophagy is generally described as a nonselective, “random” process, recent studies have demonstrated the selective and preferential degradation of proteins, mRNAs, and organelles by bulk autophagy (23Onodera J.

This method would allow us to determine what and how much is degraded under various autophagy-inducing conditions. Furthermore, this method allows us to identify temporal changes in the complement of proteins that are degraded by autophagy. A further implication of this study is that isolated ABs can be used to reveal characteristic features of AP membranes. A long-standing question in autophagy research concerns the origin of the AP membrane and the process of its formation. Marker prot"
https://openalex.org/W4307715223,"Skin cancer is considered to be the most common human malignancy. Around 5 million new cases of skin cancer are recorded in the United States annually. Early identification and evaluation of skin lesions are of great clinical significance, but the disproportionate dermatologist-patient ratio poses a significant problem in most developing nations. Therefore a novel deep architecture, named as SkiNet, is proposed to provide faster screening solution and assistance to newly trained physicians in the process of clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The main motive behind SkiNet’s design and development is to provide a white box solution, addressing a critical problem of trust and interpretability which is crucial for the wider adoption of Computer-aided diagnosis systems by medical practitioners. The proposed SkiNet is a two-stage pipeline wherein the lesion segmentation is followed by the lesion classification. Monte Carlo dropout and test time augmentation techniques have been employed in the proposed method to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. A novel segmentation model named Bayesian MultiResUNet is used to estimate the uncertainty on the predicted segmentation map. Saliency-based methods like XRAI, Grad-CAM and Guided Backprop are explored to provide post-hoc explanations of the deep learning models. The ISIC-2018 dataset is used to perform the experimentation and ablation studies. The results establish the robustness of the proposed model on the traditional benchmarks while addressing the black-box nature of such models to alleviate the skepticism of medical practitioners by incorporating transparency and confidence to the model’s prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4307569023,"Succination is the spontaneous reaction between the respiratory intermediate fumarate and cellular thiols that forms stable S-(2-succino)-adducts such as S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC). 2SC is a biomarker for conditions associated with elevated fumarate levels, including diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers, and succination likely contributes to disease progression. Bacillus subtilis has a yxe operon-encoded breakdown pathway for 2SC that involves three distinct enzymatic conversions. The first step is N-acetylation of 2SC by YxeL to form N-acetyl-2SC (2SNAC). YxeK catalyzes the oxygenation of 2SNAC, resulting in its breakdown to oxaloacetate and N-acetylcysteine, which is deacetylated by YxeP to give cysteine. The monooxygenase YxeK is key to the pathway but is rare, with close homologs occurring infrequently in prokaryote and fungal genomes. The existence of additional 2SC breakdown pathways was not known prior to this study. Here, we used comparative genomics to identify a S-(2-succino) lyase (2SL) that replaces yxeK in some yxe gene clusters. 2SL genes from Enterococcus italicus and Dickeya dadantii complement B. subtilis yxeK mutants. We also determined that recombinant 2SL enzymes efficiently break down 2SNAC into fumarate and N-acetylcysteine, can perform the reverse reaction, and have minor activity against 2SC and other small molecule thiols. The strong preferences both YxeK and 2SL enzymes have for 2SNAC indicate that 2SC acetylation is a conserved breakdown step. The identification of a second naturally occurring 2SC breakdown pathway underscores the importance of 2SC catabolism and defines a general strategy for 2SC breakdown involving acetylation, breakdown, and deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W4307699522,"Senile plaques, which are mostly composed of beta-amyloid peptide, are the main signature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Two main forms of beta-amyloid in humans are 40 and 42-amino acid, long; the latter is considered more relevant to AD etiology. The concentration of soluble beta-amyloid-42 (Aβ42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-Aβ42) and the density of amyloid depositions have a strong negative correlation. However, AD patients have lower CSF-Aβ42 levels compared to individuals with normal cognition (NC), even after accounting for this correlation. The goal of this study was to infer deviations of Aβ42 metabolism parameters that underlie this difference using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Aβ42 is released to the interstitial fluid (ISF) by cells and is removed by several processes. First, growth of insoluble fibrils by aggregation decreases the concentration of soluble beta-amyloid in the ISF. Second, Aβ42 is physically transferred from the brain to the CSF and removed with the CSF flow. Finally, there is an intratissue removal of Aβ42 ending in proteolysis, which can occur either in the ISF or inside the cells after the peptide is endocytosed. Unlike aggregation, which preserves the peptide in the brain, transfer to the CSF and intratissue proteolysis together represent amyloid removal. Using a kinetic model of Aβ42 turnover, we found that compared to NC subjects, AD patients had dramatically increased rates of amyloid removal. A group with late-onset mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) also exhibited a higher rate of amyloid removal; however, this was less pronounced than in the AD group. Estimated parameters in the early-onset MCI group did not differ significantly from those in the NC group. We hypothesize that increased amyloid removal is mediated by Aβ42 cellular uptake; this is because CSF flow is not increased in AD patients, while most proteases are intracellular. Aβ cytotoxicity depends on both the amount of beta-amyloid internalized by cells and its intracellular conversion into toxic products. We speculate that AD and LMCI are associated with increased cellular amyloid uptake, which leads to faster disease progression. The early-onset MCI (EMCI) patients do not differ from the NC participants in terms of cellular amyloid uptake. Therefore, EMCI may be mediated by the increased production of toxic amyloid metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W4307715245,"Wind velocity field knowledge is crucial for the future air traffic management paradigm and is key in many applications, such as aircraft performance studies. This paper addresses the problem of spatio-temporal windc velocity field estimation. The north and east wind components within a given air space are estimated as a function of time. Both wind velocity field reconstruction in space for a past or present time instant and short-term prediction are performed. Wind data are obtained indirectly from the states of the aircraft broadcast by the Mode-S and ADS-B aircraft surveillance systems. The Gaussian process regression method, which is a flexible and universal estimator, is employed to solve both problems. Under general conditions, the method is statistically consistent, meaning that the method converges to the ground truth when increasingly more data are available, which is especially interesting, since aircraft data availability is expected to grow in the future through the deployment of the European System-Wide Information Management. Besides estimation, the Gaussian process regression method provides the probability distribution of any particular estimate, allowing confidence intervals to be computed. Moreover, the spatial modelling is performed using raw data without relying on grids and estimation can be performed at any spatio-temporal location. Furthermore, since the training phase of the method described in this paper is fast, requiring less than 5 minutes on a standard desktop computer, it can be used online to continuously track the state of the wind velocity field, thus allowing for data assimilation. In the case study presented in this paper, the Gaussian process regression method is tested on different days with different wind intensities. The available data set is split into several training and testing data sets, which are used to check the consistency of the results of wind velocity field reconstruction and prediction. Finally, the Gaussian process regression method is validated using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data. The obtained results show that Gaussian process regression can be used to reliably estimate the wind velocity field from aircraft derived data."

To identify transiently interacting proximal partner(s) of TbTim17, we used Biotinylation Identification (BioID) by expressing a modified biotin ligase-TbTim17 (BirA∗-TbTim17) fusion protein in T. brucei. BirA∗-TbTim17 was targeted to mitochondria and assembled in the TbTIM complex. In the presence of biotin, BirA∗-TbTim17 biotinylated several mitochondrial proteins. Interestingly, TbHsp84/TbTRAP1, a mitochondrial Hsp90 homolog, was identified as the highest enriched biotinylated proteins. We validated that interaction and colocalization of TbTim17 and TbHsp84 in T. brucei mitochondria by coimmunoprecipitation analysis and confocal microscopy, respectively. TbTim17 association with TbTRAP1 increased several folds during denaturation/renaturation of mitochondrial proteins in vitro, suggesting TbTRAP1 acts as a chaperone for TbTim17 refolding. We demonstrated that knockdown of TbTRAP1 reduced cell growth and decreased the levels of the TbTIM17, TbTim62, and mitochondrial (m)Hsp70 complexes. However, ATPase, VDAC, and Atom69 complexes were minimally affected. Additionally, the steady state levels of TbTim17, TbTim62, and mHsp70 were reduced significantly, but Atom69, ATPase β, and RBP16 were mostly unaltered due to TbTRAP1 knockdown. Quantitative proteomics analysis also showed significant reduction of TbTim62 along with a few other mitochondrial proteins due to TbTRAP1 knockdown. Finally, TbTRAP1 depletion did not hamper the import of the ectopically expressed TbTim17-2xMyc into mitochondria but reduced its assembly into the TbTIM17 complex, indicating TbTRAP1 is critical for assembly of TbTim17.

This is the first report showing the role of TRAP1 in the TIM complex assembly in eukaryotes. The flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) possesses a single mitochondrion per cell and has a complex concatenated disk-like structure of mitochondrial DNA known as the kinetoplast (1Jensen R.E.

Rep. 2016; 6: 260-265PubMed Google Scholar). Despite an elaborate mitochondrial DNA structure, the T. brucei mitochondrion encodes only 18 proteins. Thus, as with other eukaryotes, trypanosomes import 99% of mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol (7Schneider A. Unique aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis in trypanosomatids.Int. J.

Biogenesis pathways of alpha-helical mitochondrial outer membrane proteins.Biol. Chem. 2020; 401: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Once across the mitochondrial outer membrane, these proteins are sorted into two different translocases of the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) (TIM23 and TIM22) to be destined to the mitochondrial matrix, MIM, and the intermembrane space (IMS) (9Schmidt O.

BirA∗ biotinylates lysine residues on a neighboring protein (∼10 nm distance), enabling the purification of close-proximity proteins (31Gentzel M. Pardo M. Subramaniam S. Stewart A.F. Choudhary J.S.

Once biotinylated, proteins are extracted from cells under stringent denaturing conditions, recovered by streptavidin affinity purification, and identified by mass spectrometry (MS) (31Gentzel M.

Despite the advantages of the BioID approach, the techniques have not yet been applied for characterization of the TbTIM17 complex from T. brucei. We employed the BioID approach using TbTim17, the main component of the TbTIM complex as bait. We identified a few previously confirmed interacting proteins of TbTim17, as well as several additional candidates. One of the top-hit candidates was mitochondrial heat-shock protein 84 (Hsp84), a member of the Hsp90 family and known as TbTRAP1. A recent study showed that TbTRAP1 is involved in the kinetoplast replication in T. brucei (33Meyer K.J. Shapiro T.A. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Hsp90 in cytokinesis, mitochondrial DNA replication, and drug action in Trypanosoma brucei.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2021; 65e0063221Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, no previous reports exist of interaction between TbTim17 and TbTRAP1. TRAP1 functions have been studied in greater detail in humans (34Serapian S.A. Sanchez-Martin C. Moroni E. Rasola A. Colombo G.

A. 2013; 110: E1604-E1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). TRAP1 knockdown increases oxidative phosphorylation (39Joshi A. Dai L. Liu Y. Lee J. Ghahhari N.M. Segala G. et al.The mitochondrial Hsp90 paralog TRAP1 forms an OXPHOS-regulated tetramer and is involved in mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis.BMC Biol. 2020; 18: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TRAP1 is upregulated in many types of cancer cells, where it promotes glycolysis and reduces the OXPHOS pathway of ATP generation (36Xie S. Wang X. Gan S. Tang X. Kang X. Zhu S. The mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 as a candidate target of oncotherapy.Front. Oncol. 2020; 10585047Google Scholar). Therefore, production of reactive oxygen species is reduced by the increased levels of NADPH, and cells become more resistant to apoptosis (36Xie S. Wang X. Gan S. Tang X. Kang X. Zhu S. The mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 as a candidate target of oncotherapy.Front. Oncol. 2020; 10585047Google Scholar). Other studies showed that TRAP1 depletion increases glutamine metabolism to increase oxidative phosphorylation and an increase in GSH levels reduces reactive oxygen species in these cells (39Joshi A. Dai L. Liu Y. Lee J. Ghahhari N.M. Segala G. et al.The mitochondrial Hsp90 paralog TRAP1 forms an OXPHOS-regulated tetramer and is involved in mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis.BMC Biol. 2020; 18: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Bacterial homolog of Hsp90, HtpG, is also a conserved and abundant protein (40Wickner S. Nguyen T.L. Genest O. The bacterial Hsp90 chaperone: cellular functions and mechanism of action.Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 75: 719-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It has been shown that HtpG acts in cooperation with bacterial Hsp70, DnaK, to protect proteins from aggregation and helps to fold proteins properly to form large complexes, like the phycobilisome in cyanobacteria (41Sato T. Minagawa S. Kojima E. Okamoto N. Nakamoto H. HtpG, the prokaryotic homologue of Hsp90, stabilizes a phycobilisome protein in the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, we identified TbTRAP1 as an interacting partner of TbTim17 and showed that TbTRAP1 is required for TbTim17 complex assembly. Knockdown of TbTRAP1 not only reduced the levels of the TbTIM17 complex but also decreased the levels of TbTim17, TbTim62, and mHsp70, the core components of the TbTIM17 complex. Some of the higher molecular mass protein complexes of mHsp70 were also severely affected by TbTRAP1 knockdown. Furthermore, TbTRAP1 depletion did not hamper the import of the ectopically expressed TbTim17-2xMyc into T. brucei mitochondria but reduced its assembly into the TbTIM17 complex. Therefore, TbTRAP1 appears to act in cooperation with mHsp70 for formation of the TbTIM complex in T. brucei, thus essential for cell growth. As in other Tim17/22/23 family proteins, TbTim17 has four predicted transmembrane domains with hydrophilic N- and C-terminal domains exposed in the IMS (42Meier S. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Conserved N-terminal negative charges in the Tim17 subunit of the TIM23 translocase play a critical role in the import of preproteins into mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7777-7785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar to other family members, TbTim17 does not have an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal but uses internal targeting signals for its entry into mitochondria (29Weems E. Singha U.K. Smith J.T. Chaudhuri M. The divergent N-terminal domain of Tim17 is critical for its assembly in the TIM complex in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2017; 218: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), suggesting that tagging at the N-terminal of TbTim17 would not prevent its localization into mitochondria. Therefore, we generated an N-terminally BirA∗-tagged TbTim17 construct using the pLew-Myc-BirA expression vector (Fig. 1A) and developed a stable T. brucei cell line (BirA∗-TbTim17) to express this fusion protein. We performed immunoblot analysis with BirA antibody of total cellular proteins harvested at different time points (0 h–96 h) after induction of expression by addition of doxycycline in the medium. We observed that BirA∗-TbTim17 is expressed at expected size (∼50 kDa), and maximum level of expression was within 24 h to 72 h (Fig. S1). We verified that expression of BirA∗-TbTim17 caused no adverse effects on cell growth (Fig. 1B). Next, we harvested cells after 24 h of induction and performed cell fractionation to separate mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Analysis of the total, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions by immunoblot analysis using BirA antibody showed that BirA∗-TbTim17 is present in the total and mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1C). To verify the specificity of the antibody, we analyzed similar fractions from the parental T. brucei and did not observe any bands, as expected. Probing the blot with TbTim17 antibody showed the presence of endogenous TbTim17 in the total and mitochondrial fractions from both parental and BirA∗-TbTim17 cell lines; however, the 50 kDa fusion protein was detected by this antibody only from the BirA∗-TbTim17 cells. The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein and T. brucei protein phosphatase 5 (TbPP5) were used as markers for the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, respectively. In situ immunofluorescence studies of BirA∗-TbTim17 T. brucei using BirA antibody showed colocalization of BirA∗-TbTim17 with Mitotracker-stained mitochondria (Fig. S2). We also have attempted to express C-terminally BirA∗-tagged TbTim17 (TbTim17-BirA∗). However, we did not get good expression of this fusion protein, likely because the protein was not localized/assembled in mitochondria and rapidly degraded. To determine whether the N-terminally tagged BirA∗-TbTim17 was integrated in the mitochondrial membrane, isolated mitochondria was treated with alkaline sodium carbonate, and the soluble and membrane-integral proteins were separated by centrifugation. Immunoblot analysis of the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions showed that similar to the endogenous TbTim17, BirA∗-TbTim17 was present in pellet fraction (Fig. 1D). VDAC was used as the control for another membrane integral protein, and RBP16, a matrix protein, was found in the supernatant as expected. We also analyzed mitochondrial membrane protein complexes from the control and BirA∗-TbTim17 cells by BN-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies for BirA, TbTim17, and VDAC. Results showed that BirA∗-TbTim17 was assembled in a higher molecular mass complex (∼800 kDa), such as endogenous TbTim17 (Fig. 1E). BirA antibody did not detect any protein bands from the control sample. As reported previously, TbTim17 antibody detected multiple protein complexes within the range of (300 kDa to >800 kDa) from both samples. As anti-TbTim17 detected both the endogenous and the fusion proteins, the ∼800 kDa complex was detected with greater intensity in the BirA∗-TbTim17 mitochondria sample than in the control. As a loading control, we probed using VDAC antibody and detected different-sized, multimeric forms of VDAC at similar intensity from both samples (Fig. 1E). Altogether, our results showed that BirA∗-TbTim17 was expressed, targeted to the mitochondrial membrane, and assembled in the TbTIM17 complex. Next, we investigated whether BirA∗-TbTim17 biotinylates other T. brucei proteins. For this purpose, BirA∗-TbTim17 cells were grown in the presence and absence of doxycycline, either in biotin-free (I) or regular medium (II). After 12 h of induction, cells grown in regular medium were divided into two flasks, and in one of the flasks excess biotin (50 μM) was added (III). All cells were allowed to grow for an additional 12 h. Parental control cells also were grown under similar conditions in parallel. Next, cells were harvested, and the total, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were separated. Analysis of proteins from these fractions by immunoblot using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated streptavidin showed the presence of biotinylated proteins of different sizes in the cell lysate obtained from induced BirA∗-TbTim17 cells, grown either in the normal or excess biotin-containing medium (Fig. 2A), but not in biotin-free medium. A few biotinylated proteins >100 kDa in size, which could be endogenously biotinylated proteins, were common in the control and BirA∗-TbTim17–induced and BirA∗-TbTim17–uninduced samples. However, multiple proteins (15 kDa to 80 kDa) detected by HRP-streptavidin were very specific for the induced BirA∗-TbTim17 samples and absent either in control or uninduced cells (Fig. 2). Among these, only one or two proteins (>80 kDa) were found in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2B) but remaining biotinylated proteins (15 kDa to 50 kDa) were present in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2C). This demonstrated that BirA∗-TbTim17 biotinylated more mitochondrial proteins, as expected. TbPP5 was used as a l"
https://openalex.org/W4307570496,"Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a membrane-bound protease expressed in many human epithelial tissues, including the airway and lung. TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of viral spike protein is a key mechanism in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 activation and host cell entry. To date, the cellular mechanisms that regulate TMPRSS2 activity and cell surface expression are not fully characterized. In this study, we examined two major post-translational events, zymogen activation and N-glycosylation, in human TMPRSS2. In experiments with human embryonic kidney 293, bronchial epithelial 16HBE, and lung alveolar epithelial A549 cells, we found that TMPRSS2 was activated via intracellular autocatalysis and that this process was blocked in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors 1 and 2. By glycosidase digestion and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that human TMPRSS2 was N-glycosylated. N-glycosylation at an evolutionarily conserved site in the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain was required for calnexin-assisted protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent intracellular trafficking, zymogen activation, and cell surface expression. Moreover, we showed that TMPRSS2 cleaved severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein intracellularly in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results provide new insights into the cellular mechanism in regulating TMPRSS2 biosynthesis and function. Our findings should help to understand the role of TMPRSS2 in major respiratory viral diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4307658948,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and normally fatal disease with limited treatment options. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib has recently been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and its effectiveness has been linked to its ability to inhibit a number of receptor tyrosine kinases including the platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. We show here that nintedanib also inhibits salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), with a similar IC50 to its reported tyrosine kinase targets. Nintedanib also inhibited the related kinases SIK1 and SIK3, although with 12-fold and 72-fold higher IC50s, respectively. To investigate if the inhibition of SIK2 may contribute to the effectiveness of nintedanib in treating lung fibrosis, mice with kinase-inactive knockin mutations were tested using a model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We found that loss of SIK2 activity protects against bleomycin-induced fibrosis, as judged by collagen deposition and histological scoring. Loss of both SIK1 and SIK2 activity had a similar effect to loss of SIK2 activity. Total SIK3 knockout mice have a developmental phenotype making them unsuitable for analysis in this model; however, we determined that conditional knockout of SIK3 in the immune system did not affect bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Together, these results suggest that SIK2 is a potential drug target for the treatment of lung fibrosis."

Urban residence was associated with a lower rate of OAC therapy initiation (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) (95% CI) 0.96 (0.95-0.97)). Correspondingly, an inverse graded dose-response relationship was observed between higher urbanization degree tertile and OAC initiation rate (highest tertile compared to lowest: adjusted SHR (95% CI) 0.94 (0.93-0.95)).

This study explored the neuropathy of chemotherapy pain and investigated the analgesic effect of 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) on the pain behavior of OXA-induced rats. The chemotherapy pain rat model was established by the five consecutive administration of OXA (intraperitoneal, 4 mg/kg). After the establishment of OXA-induced rats, the pain behavior test, inflammatory signal analysis and mitochondrial function measurement were conducted. OXA-induced rats exhibited mechanical allodynia and spinal inflammatory infiltration. Our fluorescence and western blot analysis revealed spinal astrocytes were activated in OXA rats with up-regulation of astrocytic markers. In addition, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome mediated inflammatory signal cascade was also activated. Inflammation was triggered by dysfunctional mitochondria which represented by increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) level and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) activity. Intrathecally injection of 2-BP significantly attenuated dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) mediated mitochondrial fission, recovered mitochondrial function, suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome cascade, and consequently decreased mechanical pain sensitivity. For cell research, 2-BP treatment significantly reversed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced mitochondria membrane potential deficiency and high reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. These findings indicate 2-BP decreases spinal inflammation and relieves OXA-induced neuropathic pain via reducing Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction."

A number of mutations and polymorphisms of NLRP1 are known to cause autoinflammatory diseases, the functional characterization of which contributes to a better understanding of NLRP1 regulation. Here, we assessed the effect of the common NLRP1 variant M1184V, associated with asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetes, on the protein level. Our size-exclusion chromatography experiments show that M1184V stabilizes the “function-to-find” domain (FIIND) in a monomeric conformation. This effect is independent of autoproteolysis. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the methionine residue increases flexibility within the ZU5 domain, whereas valine decreases flexibility, potentially indirectly stabilizing the catalytic triad responsible for autocleavage. By keeping the FIIND domain monomeric, formation of a multimer of full-length NLRP1 is promoted. We found that the stabilizing effect of the valine further leads to improved dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9)-binding capacities for the FIIND domain as well as the full-length protein as determined by surface plasmon resonance.

Inflammasome sensor proteins like the nucleotide oligomerization domain–like receptors NLRP1 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor containing a pyrin domain 1), NLRP3, or NLRC4 are recognized as key components of the innate immune system (1Tschopp J.

Vance R.E. The NLRP1 inflammasome: new mechanistic insights and unresolved mysteries.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 60: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The general concept of their mode of action is described as a sequence of events upon activation by specific triggers. These triggers include a range of molecular patterns and can be of endogenous (danger-associated) or exogenous (pathogen-associated) origin (3Broz P. Dixit V.M. Inflammasomes: mechanism of assembly, regulation and signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Activation of the sensor protein induces conformational changes resulting in oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain [CARD]) and procaspase-1, forming an active inflammasome (4Martinon F.

Within this protein complex, procaspase-1 is cleaved into its active form and can in turn cleave gasdermin D and proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 into their active forms, leading to pyroptosis and inflammation (3Broz P.

The inflammasome sensor proteins are typically comprised of an N-terminal effector domain, a central NACHT (domain found in NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, and TEP1) domain, and a number of C-terminal leucine-rich repeats. Recruitment of ASC is mediated via the N-terminal effector domain, which is a pyrin domain (PYD) for NLRP3 or a CARD for NLRC4 (3Broz P. Dixit V.M. Inflammasomes: mechanism of assembly, regulation and signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Besides an N-terminal PYD, NLRP1 contains an additional “function-to-find” domain (FIIND) and CARD on its C terminus and is thus unique among NLRs (6Schroder K. Tschopp J.

A key component for keeping this system in check is dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), which forms a complex with NLRP1 by binding one full NLRP1 molecule (N- and C-terminal fragments) and one free C-terminal cleavage fragment that inserts into the active site of DPP9 without being processed by the peptidase (16Hollingsworth L.R.

By capturing free UPA–CARD fragments, it prevents oligomerization of these and therefore the formation of an active inflammasome.

All these triggers directly affect the N-terminal domains of the NLRP1 protein either by protein cleavage, direct binding, or induced phosphorylation, respectively. An exception to this is the DPP9 inhibitor Val-boroPro (VbP, also named Talabostat), which binds to the active site of the peptidase and consequently replaces the part of the UPA–CARD fragment that binds this site (16Hollingsworth L.R.

As a result, the C-terminal fragment of NLRP1 is released from the NLRP1–DPP9 complex and thus able to form an active inflammasome. Among the known triggers leading to NLRP1 activation are also missense mutations found in patients presenting with symptoms of autoinflammation (9Zhong F.L. Mamaï O. Sborgi L. Boussofara L.

To protect or adversely affect? The dichotomous role of the NLRP1 inflammasome in human disease.Mol. Aspects Med. 2020; 76100858Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Aiming to investigate the molecular basis for the observed effects of this variant, we sought to assess the impact of the M1184V mutation directly on the protein level. Interestingly, we found that this single amino acid substitution stabilizes a monomeric conformation of the FIIND domain and a multimeric conformation of full-length NLRP1. This effect translates to increased autoproteolysis and enhanced DPP9 binding. Functional analysis in cells revealed that this amino acid exchange increased the capacities of NLRP1 to form an autoinhibited complex with DPP9. Combining biochemical analyses, molecular modeling, and functional assays in cells, this work provides a molecular rationale for the functional consequences of the M1184V variant in NLRP1. To date, the main observed difference between wt NLRP1 and the disease-associated M1184V mutant is the increased autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain (13Finger J.N. Lich J.D. Dare L.C. Cook M.N. Brown K.K. Duraiswamis C. et al.Autolytic proteolysis within the function to find domain (FIIND) is required for NLRP1 inflammasome activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25030-25037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for this increase is still unknown. To gain a detailed understanding of the effects of this variant at the protein level, we designed expression constructs of full-length NLRP1 as N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins (Fig. 1A). Both wt and mutant proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified via affinity pull down to homogeneity. Interestingly, in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments, the wt protein displayed a markedly dissimilar elution behavior compared with the M1184V variant protein. Full-length, wt MBP-NLRP1 eluted as a single peak in the void volume of the chromatography column, indicating a high molecular weight (MW) species (Fig. 1B). Only the right flank of this peak transitioned into a less pronounced second peak. All fractions spanning these two peaks contained the full-length NLRP1 protein as confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1C, left panel). Importantly, the protein appears almost completely as full-length variant and uncleaved from autoproteolysis. The second peak instead indicates the presence of the N-terminal cleavage fragment resulting from FIIND domain autocleavage. Based on the elution volume, the MW of the second peak suggests the existence of a defined multimer of NLRP1. For MBP-NLRP1 M1184V, this second peak was significantly more pronounced (Fig. 1B). Consistent with previous findings, the variant exhibited increased autoproteolysis activity (13Finger J.N. Lich J.D. Dare L.C. Cook M.N. Brown K.K. Duraiswamis C. et al.Autolytic proteolysis within the function to find domain (FIIND) is required for NLRP1 inflammasome activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25030-25037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the corresponding elution fractions clearly showed that the second peak contained more of the cleavage fragments (Fig. 1C, right panel). The identity of all bands, the full-length, the N-terminal, and the C-terminal fragments, was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprint analysis (Fig. S1A). To further corroborate that the observed effect of the M1184V variant on the oligomerization state of the full-length protein is a direct effect of this substitution, we focused on the FIIND domain itself. The FIIND was expressed in Sf9 insect cells as N-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, with the tag being removed by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage before SEC analysis (Fig. 1D). Comparing SEC elution profiles of the wt and M1184V variant, a difference in the oligomerization state of the proteins was observed. While the wt protein eluted in three peaks (a void peak, an oligomer peak, and a monomer peak), the M1184V variant eluted almost exclusively as monomeric protein (Figs. 1E, S1, B and C). Analyzing the elution fractions revealed that the vast majority of the monomeric protein species of both the wt and variant FIIND protein appears as cleaved fragments (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the void and oligomeric species of the wt FIIND protein appear largely uncleaved. Off note, even the fully cleaved FIIND still runs as one protein in gel filtration experiments and not separated into its two entities. From these experiments, we conclude that the M1184V variant prevents oligomerization of the FIIND domain. For the full-length protein, this means that this variant is found less frequently in high MW fractions and is instead stabilized in a defined multimeric conformation. Interestingly, the multimeric species of the full-length NLRP1 protein and the monomeric species of the FIIND domain consist of mainly autocleaved protein. This prompted the question, whether autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain is the main driver of the observed differences in the multimeric assemblies between wt and M1184V variant protein. To determine the effects of autoproteolysis on FIIND domain oligomerization, we introduced the S1213A mutation that completely abolishes proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 2A) (13Finger J.N. Lich J.D. Dare L.C. Cook M.N. Brown K.K. Duraiswamis C. et al.Autolytic proteolysis within the function to find domain (FIIND) is required for NLRP1 inflammasome activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25030-25037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The elution behavior in SEC analysis of the S1213A mutant FIIND protein in context of the wt protein or the M1184V variant was directly compared (Fig. 2B). Overall, both elution profiles are similar to the cleavable version of the respective FIIND proteins (Figs. 1E, 2B, and S1D). Analysis of corresponding elution fractions by SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of the FIIND domain in all observed peaks and the absence of any cleavage fragments (Fig. 2C). Thus, we conclude that the effect of M1184V to prevent oligomer formation of the FIIND domain is independent of autoproteolysis. In SEC experiments with wt and M1184V FIIND protein, we noticed that only the monomeric but not the oligomeric FIIND protein peaks contained significant amounts of the cleavage fragments (Fig. 1, E and F). We therefore hypothesized that only FIIND monomers are capable of undergoing autoproteolysis. To test this hypothesis, different variants of purified FIIND protein were incubated at 37 °C for up to 24 h and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the monomeric species, a slight decrease of uncleaved FIIND for both wt and the mutant variant was observed over time, indicating that autoproteolysis is occurring under these conditions (Fig. 2, D, left panel, and E). In contrast, the oligomeric species of the wt FIIND protein did not show any decrease in uncleaved FIIND protein over time (Fig. 2D, right panel). The M1184V–S1213A autoproteolysis-deficient FIIND protein was used as a control and displayed no cleavage over time (Fig. 2F). This suggests that the increased autoproteolysis observed for the M1184V variant occurs because of its stabilizing effect on the monomeric conformation of the FIIND domain. We next sought to assess the impact of the M1184V amino acid substitution on a structural level. As the data suggest that the described effect is largely independent of autoproteolysis, a model of the FIIND (amino acids 1064–1376) in its uncleaved state was generated using the AlphaFold2 (AF2) algorithm (Fig. S2A). Alignment to the existing structure of the rat NLRP1 FIIND (Protein Data Bank code: 7CRV) (18Huang M. Zhang X. Toh G.A. Gong Q. Wang J. Han Z. et al.Structural and biochemical mechanisms of NLRP1 inhibition by DPP9.Nature. 2021; 592: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) resulted in an RMSD value of 0.958 Å for the wt FIIND model and 1.004 Å for the FIIND (M1184V) model indicating good conformity. As previously described, M1184 is located proximal to H1186, a critical residue of the catalytic triad consisting of E1195, H1186, and S1213 involved in autoproteolysis (Fig. 3A) (13Finger J.N. Lich J.D. Dare L.C. Cook M.N. Brown K.K. Duraiswamis C. et al.Autolytic proteolysis within the function to find domain (FIIND) is required for NLRP1 inflammasome activity.J. Biol.

Immunol. 2021; 147: 2134-2145.e20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As indicated by the RMSD values, using the same input sequence with M1184 replaced by valine had no significant effect on the overall conformation of the FIIND domain in the resulting AF2 prediction (Fig. S2A). Taking a closer look at the methionine residue, we hypothesized that it can potentially adapt different rotamer conformations and therefore increase flexibility within the autoproteolysis site. In line with that, the monomeric wt FIIND protein displayed a significantly lower Tm (67.5 °C) compared with the M1184V FIIND protein (Tm: 70.6 °C) in thermal stability experiments using nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) (Fig. 3B). Off note, these Tms are unusually high for human proteins indicating the vast stability of the FIIND domain. The protein stability was further analyzed by applying molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the uncleaved FIIND. A total of 10 × 100 ns was simulated for the wt and M1184V variant FIIND domain. To get a quantitative estimate of differences between these two simulations, the resulting datasets were analyzed"

Hydrolysis of FMN and FAD by alkaline phosphatase of the intestinal brush-border membrane.Int. J. Vitam Nutr. Res. 1983; 53: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar) reported that FMN and FAD were hydrolyzed by ALP purified from the brush-border membrane of rat jejunum. ALP hydrolyzes compounds with a phosphate moiety, such as pyrophosphate, phosphoethanolamine, and PLP (8Millán J.L. Whyte M.P. Alkaline phosphatase and hypophosphatasia.Calcif Tissue Int. 2016; 98: 398-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). There are four main isoforms of ALP in humans—tissue-nonspecific ALP (TNSALP), intestinal ALP, germ cell ALP, and placental ALP—all of which are GPI-APs (13Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N. Cellular function and molecular structure of ecto-nucleotidases.Purinergic Signal. 2012; 8: 437-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Among them, TNSALP is ubiquitously expressed and is the major isoform expressed in liver, bone, kidney, blood, and brain (14Millán J.L. Alkaline phosphatases.Purinergic Signal. 2006; 2: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Although, Daniel et al. (11Daniel H. Binninger E. Rehner G. Hydrolysis of FMN and FAD by alkaline phosphatase of the intestinal brush-border membrane.Int. J. Vitam Nutr. Res. 1983; 53: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar) reported that both FMN and FAD were hydrolyzed by ALP, there are several reports suggesting that two enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of FMN and FAD. Akiyama et al. purified two independent enzymes, FAD pyrophosphatase and FMN phosphatase, from rat intestinal brush-border (10Akiyama T. Selhub J. Rosenberg I.H. FMN phosphatase and FAD pyrophosphatase in rat intestinal brush borders: role in intestinal absorption of dietary riboflavin.J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Okuda showed that the inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate was greater against FMN hydrolysis than FAD hydrolysis in dog intestinal mucosa and suggested that the small intestine contains at least two kinds of phosphatase: nucleotide pyrophosphatase with low affinity for pyrophosphate and phosphomonoesterase with high-affinity for pyrophosphate (15Okuda J. Metabolism of flavin nucleotides. I. Of flavin nucleotides in digestive juice. Decomposition.Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1958; 6: 662-665Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Okuda also reported that gastric juice hydrolyzes only FAD, and bile and pancreatic juice hydrolyze only FMN (16Okuda J. Metabolism of flavin nucleotides. II. Decomposition of flavin nucleotides in the small intestine.Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1958; 6: 665-669Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Lee and Ford showed that an enzyme purified from placental trophoblastic microvilli possessed FAD pyrophosphatase activity and the enzyme did not hydrolyze FMN (17Lee R.S.F. Ford H.C. 5’-Nucleotidase of human placental trophoblastic microvilli possesses cobalt-stimulated FAD pyrophosphatase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14878-14883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest a two-step hydrolysis of FAD (i.e., FAD–FMN, then FMN–RF). Here, we show that, in human cells, FAD is hydrolyzed in two steps: FAD to FMN by CD73 and FMN to RF by ALP. CD73, also known as ecto-5′ nucleotidase, is a GPI-AP encoded by the NT5E gene and catalyzes conversion of adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine (13Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N. Cellular function and molecular structure of ecto-nucleotidases.Purinergic Signal. 2012; 8: 437-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 18Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine the hydrolytic activity of human bone ALP and recombinant human CD73 toward vitamin B2 analogues, RF formation from FMN and FMN formation from FAD were measured. The contributions of these GPI-APs to vitamin B2 uptake, vitamin B2-dependent vitamin B6 metabolism, and mitochondrial function were determined using GPI-deficient cells. Because CD73 and ALP are both GPI-APs (13Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N. Cellular function and molecular structure of ecto-nucleotidases.Purinergic Signal. 2012; 8: 437-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 19Misumi Y. Ogata S. Ohkubo K. Hirose S. Ikehara Y. Primary structure of human placental 5′-nucleotidase and identification of the glycolipid anchor in the mature form.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), GPI-deficient cells contained a decreased amount of intracellular vitamin B2 when cultured with FAD as the vitamin B2 source, leading to changes in vitamin B6 metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. These lines of evidence suggest that the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in some severe cases of inherited GPI deficiency (IGD) might be caused by vitamin B2 deficiency, which would be prevented by the administration of RF. To analyze the two-step hydrolysis of FAD, RF and FMN concentrations were measured in vitro by HPLC after incubation of 10 μM FMN and FAD, respectively, with human bone ALP and CD73 containing a C-terminal His tag in solution for 15 min. An increase in the RF concentration was detected after incubation of FMN with ALP but not with CD73. In contrast, the FMN concentration was increased after incubation of FAD with CD73 but not with ALP (Fig. 1B). ALP-dependent RF formation from FMN is shown in Figure 2, A–C, including a time course and the dependence on the concentrations of ALP and FMN, respectively. RF production increased linearly for 10 min (Fig. 2A) in an ALP concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). RF production from FMN by ALP was substrate saturable (Fig. 2C), the Km and Vmax values being 0.309 ± 0.051 μM and 7.47 ± 0.25 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively (Table 1). These results demonstrate that purified bone ALP, that is, TNSALP, hydrolyzes FMN, producing RF.Table 1Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by human bone ALP and recombinant human CD73a) ALPKmVmax(μM)(nmol/min/mg protein)FMN → RF0.309 ± 0.0517.47 ± 0.25AMP → adenosine0.538 ± 0.04713.8 ± 0.4b) CD73KmVmax(μM)(nmol/min/μg protein)FAD → FMN18.4 ± 0.312.3 ± 0.3FAD → adenosine23.7 ± 1.513.2 ± 0.3AMP → adenosine3.94 ± 0.51188 ± 7The Vmax was expressed in product concentration per minute per mg or μg protein.

Abbreviations: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; AMP, adenosine 5′-monophosphate; FAD, flavin-adenine dinucleotide; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; RF, riboflavin. Recombinant CD73-dependent FMN formation from FAD is shown in Figure 2, D–F. Because FAD consists of RF, diphosphate, and adenosine moieties, AMP (adenosine + phosphate) or adenosine could be produced by FAD hydrolysis (Fig. 1A). To determine the products of FAD hydrolysis by CD73, we simultaneously determined FMN, AMP, and adenosine by HPLC after incubation of FAD with CD73. Increased concentrations of FMN and adenosine were detected, but no increase in AMP was observed. The concentrations of FMN and adenosine increased linearly for 30 min (Fig. 2, D and G) in a CD73 concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, E and H). FMN and adenosine production by CD73 was dependent on the concentration of the substrate, FAD, and was saturable (Fig. 2, F and I). CD73 is known to hydrolyze AMP to adenosine; in addition, here, we show evidence that recombinant CD73 also hydrolyzes FAD to produce FMN and adenosine. We determined kinetic parameters of the activities of ALP and CD73 (Table 1). Because AMP is a substrate for both CD73 and ALP (13Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N. Cellular function and molecular structure of ecto-nucleotidases.Purinergic Signal. 2012; 8: 437-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 18Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. Ecto 5′-nucleotidase and nonspecific alkaline phosphatase: two AMP-hydrolyzing ectoenzymes with distinct roles in human airways.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the results for kinetic analysis of FMN and FAD hydrolysis are compared with those for AMP hydrolysis in Table 1. The Km value for FAD hydrolysis by CD73 was higher than that for AMP, and the Vmax value for AMP hydrolysis was higher than that for FAD hydrolysis, suggesting that CD73 binds AMP with higher affinity than FAD and more efficiently hydrolyzes AMP than FAD. In contrast, the Km values for FMN and AMP hydrolysis by ALP were comparable. Several types of inhibitors were used to characterize the hydrolytic properties of CD73 and ALP (Fig. 3). FMN hydrolysis and AMP hydrolysis by ALP showed similar patterns of inhibition (Fig. 3A). FAD hydrolysis and AMP hydrolysis by CD73 also showed similar patterns of inhibition (Fig. 3B). However, the inhibition properties of AMP hydrolysis mediated by ALP and CD73 were different. FMN and nicotinamide mononucleotide, which are phosphorylated vitamins, and levamisole, which is an inhibitor of TNSALP (20Kozlenkov A. le Du M.H. Cuniasse P. Ny T. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. Residues determining the binding specificity of uncompetitive inhibitors to tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase.J. Bone Miner Res. 2004; 19: 1862-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), decreased the activity of ALP but not CD73. In contrast, α,β-methylene adenosine 5′-diphosphate (APCP), an inhibitor of CD73 (21Bhattarai S. Freundlieb M. Pippel J. Meyer A. Abdelrahman A. Fiene A. et al.α,β-Methylene-ADP (AOPCP) derivatives and analogues: development of potent and selective ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2015; 58: 6248-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), inhibited CD73 but not ALP. Guanosine 5′-monophosphate, a nucleotide, inhibited both CD73 and ALP, which is consistent with AMP being a common substrate of CD73 and ALP (Fig. 3C). Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate that TNSALP hydrolyzes FMN, producing RF, and CD73 hydrolyzes FAD, producing FMN. Both CD73 and ALP are GPI-APs (13Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N. Cellular function and molecular structure of ecto-nucleotidases.Purinergic Signal. 2012; 8: 437-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 19Misumi Y. Ogata S. Ohkubo K. Hirose S. Ikehara Y. Primary structure of human placental 5′-nucleotidase and identification of the glycolipid anchor in the mature form.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class T (PIGT) is required for GPI-AP generation, and therefore, PIGT-KO SH-SY5Y cells (PIGT− cells) were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to obtain CD73-and ALP-defective cells. SH-SY5Y is the human neuroblastoma cell line. The activities of CD73 and ALP in PIGT− cells were significantly lower than in PIGT rescued cells (PIGT+ cells) (Fig. 4, A and B). Surface expression levels of CD73, TNSALP, and CD59 (another GPI-AP) on PIGT− and PIGT+ cells were compared by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 4C). The surface expression of CD73, TNSALP, and CD59 was deficient in PIGT− cells. PIGT− and PIGT+ cells were cultured in vitamin B2-depleted medium for 5 days, followed by culture for 24 h in a medium containing one of the vitamin B2 derivatives (FMN, FAD, or RF) or a medium without vitamin B2. Vitamin B2 concentrations in the cell and culture medium were measured by HPLC. FAD was the major form of vitamin B2 in the PIGT+ and PIGT− cells after cultured in medium containing RF, FMN, or FAD, indicating that imported RF was intracellularly converted to FAD (9Barile M. Giancaspero T.A. Leone P. Galluccio M. Indiveri C. Riboflavin transport and metabolism in humans.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2016; 39: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The intracellular total vitamin B2 concentrations were significantly lower in PIGT− cells than in PIGT+ cells after cultured in FMN- or FAD-containing medium, while they were similar after cultured in RF-containing or vitamin B2-depleted medium (Fig. 4D) (because RF can be transported into the cells by RF transporters). In the media, total vitamin B2 and FAD were significantly higher (91.2 ± 2.1% versus 47.3 ± 0.3%, p < 0.01) and FMN was significantly lower (2.2 ± 0.4 % versus 36.2 ± 2.0%, p < 0.01) for PIGT− cells cultured with medium containing FAD than for PIGT+ cells, suggesting that FAD was not efficiently hydrolyzed to FMN by PIGT− cells (Fig. 4E). FMN was significantly higher (80.1 ± 2.1% versus 75.0 ± 0.3%, p < 0.05) for PIGT− cells cultured with medium containing FMN than for PIGT+ cells, suggesting that FMN was not efficiently hydrolyzed to RF by PIGT− cells (Fig. 4E). However, when cultured with medium containing RF, there was no difference in vitamin B2 concentration in medium between PIGT− and PIGT+ cells (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that the presence of FAD and FMN in the medium did not lead to efficient uptake of vitamin B2 into GPI-deficient cells; this is because FAD and FMN were inefficiently hydrolyzed to FMN and RF, respectively, because of the defective expression of CD73 and ALP; this resulted in intracellular vitamin B2 deficiency. To analyze the effect of intracellular vitamin B2 deficiency on the activity of vitamin B2-dependent enzymes, concentrations of vitamin B6 derivatives in the medium were measured. Pyridoxine (PN, a form of vitamin B6) is imported into cells and phosphorylated to pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP). PNP is then converted to PLP by the FMN-dependent enzyme PNP oxidase, and PLP is in turn dephosphorylated to PL; PL and PLP are efficiently exported to the medium (22Anderson B.B. Fulford-Jones C.E. Child J.A. Beard M.E. Bateman C.J. Conversion of vitamin B 6 compounds to active forms in the red blood cell.J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Anderson B.B. Saary M. Stephens A.D. Perry G.M. Lersundi I.C. Horn J.E.

Vitamin B6.Present Knowledge in Nutrition. 10th Ed. Wiley-Blackwell, Hoboken, New Jersey2012: 307-320Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Extracellular PL and PLP should be a biomarker for intracellular vitamin B2 status because sum of PLP and PL is a net produced amount of metabolites by FMN-dependent PNP oxidase from PN which is contained in all precultured media as a vitamin B6 source. After cultivation of PIGT+ and PIGT− cells in the presence of PN and FAD, the combined PL and PLP concentration in the medium was significantly lower for PIGT− cells than for PIGT+ cells (Fig. 4F). There was a significant positive relationship between the sum of PL and PLP concentrations in the medium and the intracellular FMN concentration (p < 0.001, Fig. 4G). These results suggest that the amount of vitamin B2 imported into the cells affected the vitamin B2-dependent PLP and PL production. FMN and FAD act as coenzymes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and a decreased intracellular FAD concentration might cause mitochondrial dysfunction (25Udhayabanu T. Manole A. Rajeshwari M. Varalakshmi P. Houlden H. Ashokkumar B. Riboflavin responsive mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.J. Clin. Med. 2017; 6: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To compare the mitochondrial function between PIGT+ and PIGT− SHSY5Y cells, O2 consumption of cells was measured using a flux analyzer. After culture in vitamin B2-depleted medium for 5 days, cells were cultured in medium containing a vitamin B2 derivative (FAD, RF, or no vitamin B2) for 24 h and their O2 consumption was then measured (Fig. 5). PIGT− cells showed significantly lower O2 consumption than PIGT+ cells when they were cultured in FAD-containing medium, whereas those cultured in RF-containing medium showed a similar level of O2 consumption to that in PIGT+ cells. These results suggest that the GPI-deficient cells are susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, non-mitochondrial O2 consumption, which is the residual O2 consumption after addition of rotenone/antimycin A, was also decreased in PIGT-cells, suggesting the contribution of some flavoenzyme oxidases. The present study showed that purified human TNSALP from bone hydrolyzed FMN and recombinant human CD73 hydrolyzed FAD. ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoesters of phosphoric acid (14Millán J.L. Alkaline phosphatases.Purinergic Signal. 2006; 2: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that ALP hydrolyzes monophosphate vitamin B2, FMN, but not dinucleotide-type vitamin B2, FAD. Inhibition study showed that guanosine 5′-monophosphate and nicotinamide mononucleotide inhibited ALP activity, but NAD and FAD did not, suggesting that ALP has high affinity for compounds with a phosphomonoester moiety. We also showed that adenosine and FMN were produced from FAD by CD73. Because AMP hydrolysis had a higher Vmax and lower Km than FAD hydrolysis by CD73, we speculate that adenosine was immediately produced from AMP after AMP and FMN production from FAD, with conversion of FAD to FMN being rate limiting. However, at the moment, we cannot completely eliminate the possibility of flavin-pyrophosphate as an intermediate. TNSALP from human bone was used in the present study. TNSALP hydrolyzes some phosphate compounds, such as inorganic pyrophosphate, PLP (vitamin B6), and thiamine pyrophosphate (vitamin B1). Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in TNSALP. Decreased conversion of pyrophosphate to phosphate caused dysosteogenesis (8Millán J.L. Whyte M.P. Alkaline phosphatase and hypophosphatasia.Calcif Tissue Int. 2016; 98: 398-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because cell surface hydrolysis of PLP to PL is important for vitamin B6 uptake into cells, decreased PLP hydrolysis activity causes vitamin B6 deficiency, leading to dysfunction of various vitamin B6-dependent enzymes such as glutamate decarboxylase which results in PN-dependent seizures (8Millán J.L. Whyte M.P. Alkaline phosphatase and hypophosphatasia.Calcif Tissue Int. 2016; 98: 398-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26Akiyama T. Kubota T. Ozono K. Michigami T. Kobayashi D.

Metab. 2018; 125: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In HPP, lowered levels of thiamine pyrophosphate in red blood cells were reported (7Luong K.V.Q. Nguyen L.T.H. Adult hypophosphatasia and a low level of red blood cell thiamine pyrophosphate.Ann. Nutr. Metab. 2005; 49: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Adenosine and γ-aminobutyric acid concentrations were lower in brain of Akp2 KO mice than in wild-type mice; this gene encodes TNSALP in mice (27Cruz T. Gleizes M. Balayssac S. Mornet E. Marsal G. Millán J.L. et al.Identification of altered brain metabolites associated with TNAP activity in a mouse model of hypophosphatasia using untargeted NMR-based metabolomics analysis.J. Neurochem. 2017; 140: 919-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present study showed that the phosphorylated form of vitamin B2, FMN, is a substrate of human TNSALP. Because hydrolysis by ALP of vitamin B1, B2, and B6 is required for their uptake, their uptake would be decreased in HPP, which will be a subject of future investigation. Analysis using GPI-deficient cells, which are defective in both CD73 and ALP cell surface expression, showed that both FAD and FMN uptake activities were lower than in GPI-rescued cells, leading to intracellular deficiency of vitamin B2. Thus, the GPI-deficient cells showed dysfunction of the vitamin B2-dependent mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, as well as of PNP oxidase, and enzyme in vitamin B6 metabolism. GPI-deficient cells showed significantly lower PLP and PL production and O2 consumption when they were incubated with FAD than PIGT+ cells, whereas those incubated with RF showed a similar level to that in PIGT+ cells (Figs. 4 and 5F and 5, A and B). In addition, a significant positive relationship was found between the concentration of intracellular FMN and the sum of PLP and PL production (Fig. 4G). These results again suggest that cell surface hydrolysis of FAD to RF by the CD73 and ALP contributed to vitamin B2-dependent functions (Fig. 5C). However, it might be still possible that some other GPI-APs contribute to these functions. IGD is caused by mutations in genes involved in the biosynthesis or modification of GPI-APs. Major symptoms of patients with IGD are intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures. Because both ALP and CD73 are GPI-APs, expression of these proteins is decreased in some patients with IGD. Here, we demonstrated that GPI-deficient cells showed decreased intracellular vitamin B2 levels when cultured with FAD, a major form of vitamin B2 in blood, which led to mitochondrial dysfunction. This is consistent with reports that some severe IGD cases show mitochondrial dysfunction (28Tarailo-Graovac M. Sinclair G. Stockler-Ipsiroglu S. van Allen M. Rozmus J.

Partnership with parents to promote healthy lifestyle changes may have a lifelong impact on weight-related outcomes in children. This study aims to determine the efficacy of an Interactive Malaysian Childhood Healthy Lifestyle (i-MaCHeL) intervention programme to change weight-related behaviour in preschool child-parent dyads.The i-MaCHeL programme is a single-blind, theory-driven intervention, two-group cluster randomised controlled trial that evaluates the efficacy of a 3-month health promotion intervention in preschool child-parent dyads. In recognition of the value of multiple theoretical approaches, the strong theoretical basis consists of Social Cognitive Theory, Health Belief Model, and Trans-Theoretical Model principles underpinning the development of the intervention programme. In total, 460 child-parent dyads from 12 preschools in Terengganu, Malaysia, will be recruited. The children in the intervention group will expose to the i-MaCHeL classroom activities, while the parents will access the i-MaCHeL Web-based educational programme and numerous parent-child home-based online activities. The children in the control group will continue with any existing health-related activities, while the parents will receive the link to the general health newsletters. BMI z-score, dietary intake, physical activity, screen time duration, health-related quality of life, parental self-efficacy, parental role modelling, and parental policies will be assessed at baseline, 3 months' post-baseline, and at 6 months' follow-up (9 months' post-baseline). General linear model repeated measure analysis will be used to determine differences between groups at the 3- and 9-month surveys with adjustment for potential covariates. Statistical analyses will follow intention-to-treat principles.We hypothesise that the combination of the classroom and interactive Web-based activities will have a strong potential to be effective strategies to sustain child-parent engagement and participation in the weight-related behaviour change programme.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04711525."
https://openalex.org/W4307699379,"Oticon Medical cochlear implants use a stimulation mode called Distributed All-Polar (DAP) that connects all non-stimulating available intracochlear electrodes and an extracochlear reference electrode. It results in a complex distribution of current that is yet undescribed. The present study aims at providing a first characterization of this current distribution. A Neuro Zti was modified to allow the measurement of current returning to each electrode during a DAP stimulation and was implanted in an ex-vivo human head. Maps of distributed current were then created for different stimulation conditions with different charge levels. Results show that, on average, about 20% of current returns to the extracochlear reference electrode, while the remaining 80% is distributed between intracochlear electrodes. The position of the stimulating electrode changed this ratio, and about 10% more current to the extracochlear return in case of the first 3 basal electrodes than for apical and mid position electrodes was observed. Increasing the charge level led to small but significant change in the ratio, and about 4% more current to the extracochlear return was measured when increasing the charge level from 11.7 to 70 nC. Further research is needed to show if DAP yields better speech understanding than other stimulation modes."
https://openalex.org/W4307699475,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is the causative agent of a variety of severe infections. Many K. pneumoniae strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and this situation creates a need for new antibacterial molecules. K. pneumoniae pathogenicity relies largely on its ability to escape phagocytosis and intracellular killing by phagocytic cells. Interfering with these escape mechanisms may allow to decrease bacterial virulence and to combat infections. In this study, we used Dictyostelium discoideum as a model phagocyte to screen a collection of 1,099 chemical compounds. Phg1A KO D. discoideum cells cannot feed upon K. pneumoniae bacteria, unless bacteria bear mutations decreasing their virulence. We identified 3 non-antibiotic compounds that restored growth of phg1A KO cells on K. pneumoniae, and we characterized the mode of action of one of them, 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (K2). K2-treated bacteria were more rapidly killed in D. discoideum phagosomes than non-treated bacteria. They were more sensitive to polymyxin and their outer membrane was more accessible to a hydrophobic fluorescent probe. These results suggest that K2 acts by rendering the membrane of K. pneumoniae accessible to antibacterial effectors. K2 was effective on three different K. pneumoniae strains, and acted at concentrations as low as 3 μM. K2 has previously been used to treat viral infections but its precise molecular mechanism of action in K. pneumoniae remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W4307699523,"Background Percutaneous pericardial catheter drainage (PCD) for pericardial effusion is generally known to be limited by the high risk associated with effusions that are less than 10 mm thick. The objective was to report cases who underwent percutaneous PCD for symptomatic uremic pericardial effusions, which were less than 10 mm thick after cardiologist declined to perform the PCDs because of the narrow safety margins. Materials and methods Thirteen consecutive cases (11 patients) (median age, 56 years, range, 31–83) with symptomatic uremic pericardial effusion (thickness &lt;10 mm) affecting the pericardial space anterior to the right ventricle underwent ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous PCD between September 2015 and April 2022. Information regarding the clinical criteria, echocardiographic features, PCD details, nature of effusion, and outcomes, including success and complications were retrospectively evaluated. Results Pigtail catheter (8.5-Fr) insertion was successful for all patients, with a median procedure time of 7 minutes (range 4~12) without procedure-related complications. The median amount of drainage on the day of PCD was 700 mL (range, 250–1100). The median duration of catheter indwelling was 5 days (range, 1~32). In one case, the catheter was removed after 1 day due to chest pain. For all patients, pericardial effusion evacuation was achieved with relief of associated symptoms, representing 100% clinical success. Conclusion Percutaneous PCD may be safely performed for patients with symptomatic uremic pericardial effusions and narrow safety margins of less than 10 mm."

However, this task is difficult when it comes to Electronic Health Records (EHR). In combating the COVID-19 pandemic for maternal health, we sought to develop and validate a clinical information extraction algorithm to detect the time of clinical events relative to gestational weeks.We used EHR from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), in which the EHR are normalized by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM).

We developed a rule-based algorithm and performed a multi-level evaluation to test content validity and clinical validity, and extreme length of gestation (<150 or >300).The algorithm identified 296,194 pregnancies (16,659 COVID-19, 174,744 without COVID-19) in 270,897 pregnant women. For inferring gestational age, 95% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high accuracy (Cohen's Kappa = 0.62); 100% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high granularity of temporal information (Cohen's Kappa = 1). For inferring delivery dates, the accuracy is 100% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). The accuracy of gestational age detection for the extreme length of gestation is 93.3% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). Mothers with COVID-19 showed higher prevalence in obesity or overweight (35.1% vs. 29.5%), diabetes (17.8% vs. 17.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.2% vs. 0.1%), respiratory distress syndrome or acute respiratory failure (1.8% vs. 0.2%).We explored the characteristics of pregnant women by different gestational weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection with our algorithm. TED-PC is the first to infer the exact gestational week linked with every clinical event from EHR and detect the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women.The algorithm shows excellent clinical validity in inferring gestational age and delivery dates, which supports multiple EHR cohorts on N3C studying the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy."

Although VC is considered radioresistant, concrete evidence for this is absent.We obtained data on VC treated with surgery or radiation from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Treatment selection bias was reduced by propensity score matching. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.Five-year OS rates in the radiation and surgery groups were 72.7% and 72.0%, respectively (P = 0.111); five-year DSS rates in the same were 86.7% and 88.4%, respectively (P = 0.234). HRs of radiation compared with surgery were 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-2.95) for OS and 1.95 (95% CI, 0.69-5.53) for DSS.Similar prognoses were observed in patients with VC treated with radiation and surgery. VC can be treated using radiation."
https://openalex.org/W4307715229,"This article presents the design of a wideband bandstop RF filter intending to improve selectivity and compactness. Conventional bandstop filter topology with finite unloaded quality factor produces degraded bandstop filter performance due to dissipation loss. In the proposed filter design, a novel dual path Capacitive Coupled Step Impedance Resonator (CCSIR) structure is used to obtain an infinite stopband attenuation. A uniform impedance resonator is used in Path 1, whereas Path 2 contains a resonator that is twice coupled to the transmission lines. The electrical length of both paths is chosen to be out of phase, resulting in a high rejection level at higher frequencies. It has been analyzed that the selectivity can be improved by increasing the order of the dual coupled step impedance resonator. The proposed design produces a wideband BSF centered at 5.25 GHz with a high rejection level of 104.3 dB and fractional bandwidth of 58.5%. The results have demonstrated that the resonant frequencies are regulated by varying the electrical length of CCSIR. Moreover, it has been realized that out of phase signal cancellation due to the dual path is involved in producing the finite frequency transmission poles, which further enhances the filter selectivity. However, the same electrical performance can only be achieved from coaxial cavities and waveguides due to the high-quality factor. The proposed topology is fabricated and measured on a high-frequency microstrip substrate having a low-quality factor with a compact output and better electrical performance compared to coaxial cavities or waveguides. Due to its high electrical performance and small size, the proposed BSF is appropriate for 4G and 5G (FR1) applications. The measurement shows good concurrence with the full-wave EM simulated results. The fabricated prototype of third order BSF has a compact size of (0.7 × 0.77)λg at 5.25 GHz."
https://openalex.org/W4307715231,"High nitrogen (N) input to soil can cause higher nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, that is, a higher N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio, through an inhibition of N2O reductase activity and/or a decrease in soil pH. We assumed that there were two mechanisms for the effects of N input on N2O emissions, immediate and long-term effect. The immediate effect (field applied fertilizer N) can be eliminated by decreasing the N input, but not the long-term effect (soil accumulated N caused by long-term fertilization). Therefore, it is important to separate these effects to mitigate N2O emissions. To this end, soil samples along a 0‒5.2 m profile were collected from a long-term N fertilization experiment field with two N application rates, that is, 600 kg N ha-1 year-1 (N600) and no fertilizer N input (N0). External N addition was conducted for each subsample in the laboratory incubation study to produce two additional treatments, which were denoted as N600+N and N0+N treatments. The results showed that the combined immediate and long-term effects led to an increase in the N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio by 6.8%. Approximately 32.6% and 67.4% of increase could be explained by the immediate and long-term effects of N input, respectively. Meanwhile, the long-term effects were significantly positively correlated to soil organic carbon (SOC). These results indicate that excessive N fertilizer input to the soil can lead to increased N2O emissions if the soil has a high SOC content. The long-term effect of N input on the N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio should be considered when predicting soil N2O emissions under global environmental change scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4307715306,"The life satisfaction of women is an essential component of their subjective well-being. It is an indicator of a woman’s life quality based on personal perception. Considering the importance of women’s subjective well-being, the United Nations (UN) has recognized this as one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To the best of our knowledge, no study has been done yet for Bangladeshi women aged 15-49 years using nationally represented data. This study is the first study, to our knowledge, that will identify the determinants of life satisfaction and investigate the association between these determinants and life satisfaction among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in Bangladesh. This study examined the overall life satisfaction and impact of some personal and sociodemographic characteristics on it among the women aged 15 to 49 years in Bangladesh using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019 data, a cross-sectional data. In our study, information regarding life satisfaction was available for a sample of 64,283 women after categorizing the variable overall life satisfaction and adjusting the missing values. The variable overall life satisfaction was categorized into three categories, namely low (0-3), moderate (4-6), and high (7-10), according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Results showed that 14.67% of women are low satisfied, 50.65% are moderately satisfied, and 34.68% are highly satisfied with their lives. A bivariate analysis was applied in this study to show the significant association between the determinants and life satisfaction. The multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to draw valid conclusions about the effects of the potential determinants on life satisfaction. The study revealed that satisfaction increases with age, education level, and wealth status. For the variable marital status, which has three categories: currently married, formerly married, and never married, current marriage was strongly associated with higher life satisfaction. In contrast, a former marriage and a never marriage were associated with lower life satisfaction. Migration status was also significantly associated with life satisfaction, where women who changed their location were more satisfied than those who never changed their current location. Bangladesh aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which promotes well-being, and the goal 5, to empower all women and girls, addressing the issues related to life satisfaction and applying appropriate intervention is a must."
https://openalex.org/W4307715351,"Background After the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety and depression have reached high levels, especially after the last wave, Omicron. Healthcare workers in contact with COVID-19 patients or those who come in contact with them may exhibit high levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, we aimed to assess anxiety and depression symptoms among ICU companions of COVID-19 patients. Methods From 30 November 2021 to 1 March 2022, sixth-year medical students at Aleppo University Hospital conducted interviews with the companions of COVID-19 patients who they brought their patient to the ICU centre as part of a cross-sectional quantitative study using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tools to gauge their level of anxiety and depression among companions of COVID-19 patients. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program. In addition, logistic regression models were used to study possible factors of anxiety and depression symptoms during COVID-19. Results The total number was 997 participants in contact with COVID-19 patients. The mean score of the depression assessment tool (PHQ-9) in our questionnaire was 9.5 with a range of 0 to 27. At the same time, the anxiety assessment tool (GAD-7) had a mean score of 9.1, ranging from 0 to 21. A binary logistic regression was used to predict the relationship between depression and anxiety and various factors. We found that the companions with medical specialties were substantially less likely to develop anxiety than other companions [AOR = 0.459; 95%CI (0.23–0.9)], in addition females were substantially higher likely to develop depression than males [AOR = 1.322; 95%CI (0.992–1.762)]. 45.4% of companions had moderate to severe anxiety, in additon 50.8% of companions had moderate to severe depression. Conclusion Our research reveals that moderate to severe anxiety and sadness are present in roughly half of the COVID19 patients’ companions. Females, people with children, and hard workers were more inclined to feel anxious than others, and those who are not in the medical field were more likely to suffer from depression than others, thus it is critical to assist these groups during the present outbreaks (Omicron and Monkeybox)."
https://openalex.org/W4307715516,"Background Limited literature is available on the dietary pattern and its consequences on health of women living in coastal slums of Karachi, Pakistan. Material and methods The study employed a mixed-method approach where concurrent quantitative and qualitative assessments were carried out. An analytical cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic, household, obstetrics characteristics, and dietary pattern of married women of reproductive age (MWRA). Blood samples were collected to identify the hemoglobin level to determine anemia. For the qualitative component, focus group discussions were carried out with women and in-depth interviews with shopkeepers to understand the availability of food items at household level and in local markets respectively. In addition, observational visits were carried out at different points in time to the local market to document the availability of iron-rich foods for the community. Results The overall prevalence of anemia in sample population was 68.0%. Women with no formal education (AOR: 2.93 95% CI: 1.90–4.52), who consumed gutka (AOR: 2.84 95% CI: 1.81–4.46), did not eat red meat (AOR: 1.68 95% CI: 1.06–2.65), and only had seafood (AOR: 4.56 95% CI: 1.38–15.02) were more likely to be anemic as compared to their counterparts. Qualitative data revealed that any kind of meat and fruits were beyond the reach of community people due to non-affordable cost. A high percentage of women used a locally produced recreational substance known as gutka which gives them a feeling of wellbeing and suppresses hunger. Conclusion In our study population, lack of access to diversity of food items, illiteracy, and use of gutka are the statistically significant factors which are associated with anemia in married women of this coastal slum area. The lack of demand for diversity in food is related to poverty and preference of spending money on gutka."

However, the impact of mechanical signals on macrophages and the underlying mechanisms by which mechanical force regulates bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement remain unclear. NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been reported to promote osteoclastic differentiation to regulate alveolar bone resorption. But the relationship between the compressive force and NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages remains unknown. In this study, immunohistochemical staining results showed elevated expression of NLRP3 and interleukin-1β, as well as an increased number of macrophages expressing NLRP3, on the compression side of the periodontal tissues, after force application for 7 days. Furthermore, the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of osteoclast-related genes in the periodontal tissue decreased in the Nlrp3-/- mice compared to the WT mice group after orthodontic movement. In vitro mechanical force activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibits autophagy. Intraperitoneal injection of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine in Nlrp3-/- mice promoted orthodontic tooth movement. This result indicates that the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be partially compensated for by autophagy inhibitors. Mechanistically, force-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via the cGAS/P2X7R axis. In conclusion, compressive force regulates orthodontic tooth movement via activating the NLRP3 inflammasome."

https://openalex.org/W4307658876,"Iron (Fe) sequestration is one of the most important strategies of the host to control the growth and survival of invading pathogens. Ferritin (Ft) plays a pivotal role in the sequestration mechanism of mammalian hosts by storing Fe. Recent evidence suggests that poly(rC)-binding proteins (PCBPs) act as chaperones for loading Fe into Ft. Incidentally, modulation of host PCBPs in respect to storing Fe in Ft during any infection remains unexplored. Among PCBPs, PCBP1 and PCBP2 are present in every cell type and involved in interacting with Ft for Fe loading. Leishmania donovani (LD) resides within macrophages during the mammalian stage of infection, causing life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis. Here, we reveal the ability of LD to cleave PCBP1 and PCBP2 in host monocytes/macrophages. LD cleaves PCBP1-FLAG into two fragments and PCBP2-FLAG into multiple fragments, thus affecting their interactions with Ft and resulting in decreased Fe loading into Ft. LD-derived culture supernatant or exosome-enriched fractions are also able to cleave PCBPs, suggesting involvement of a secreted protease of the parasite. Using an immune-depletion experiment and transgenic mutants, we confirmed the involvement of zinc-metalloprotease GP63 in cleaving PCBPs. We further revealed that by cleaving host PCBPs, Leishmania could inhibit Fe loading into Ft to accumulate available Fe for higher intracellular growth. This is the first report of a novel strategy adopted by a mammalian pathogen to interfere with Fe sequestration into Ft by cleaving chaperones for its survival advantage within the host."

Best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, Scheimpflug tomography, in-vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy, optical coherence tomography and complete hematological workup were assessed.We identified n = 19 patients with bilateral corneal opacities compatible with PPK. PPK was newly diagnosed in 13 (29%) of 45 patients with a primary hematological diagnosis and in n = 6 patients without previous hematological diagnosis. The most common form was a discreet stromal flake-like PPK (n = 14 of 19). The median level of M-protein (p = 0.59), IgA (p = 0.53), IgG (p = 0.79) and IgM (p = 0.59) did not differ significantly between the patients with and without PPK. The median level of the FLC κ in serum of patients with kappa-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia was 209 mg/l in patients with PPK compared to 38.1 mg/l in patients without PPK (p = 0.18). Median level of FLC lambda in serum of patients with lambda-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia was lower in patients with PPK compared to patients without PPK (p = 0.02).The PPK was mostly discreet, but its prevalence (29%) was higher than expected. Median level of the monoclonal paraprotein was not significantly higher in patients with PPK compared to patients without PPK.

https://openalex.org/W4307699384,"It is deemed that meat quality of kids’ is better than that of adults’ for Hainan black goat. Generally, meat quality is affected by many indicators, such as intramuscular fat (IMF) content, muscle fiber diameter and shear force. It is indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in meat quality of goats. However, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs and genes play their roles in meat quality of Hainan Black goats. Here, we firstly compared the meat quality between two-month-old kids ( kids ) and adult goats ( adults ). Then, the lncRNA-seq and RNA-seq data were integrated and analyzed to explore the potential functions of lncRNAs and genes. The results showed that adults’ IMF content and muscle fiber diameter were extremely significantly higher than that of kids ( P &lt;0.01). For the sequenced data, average 84,970,398, and 83,691,250 clean reads were obtained respectively for Kids and adults, among which ~96% were mapped to the reference genome of goats. Through analyzing, 18,242 goat annotated genes, 1,429 goat annotated lncRNAs and 2,967 novel lncRNAs were obtained. Analysis of differential expression genes ( DEGs ) and lncRNAs ( DELs ) showed that 328 DEGs and 98 DELs existed between kids and adults. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis revealed that a number of DEGs and DELs were mainly associated with IMF. Primarily, DGAT2 expressed higher in adults than that in kids and CPT1A expressed higher in kids than that in adults. Both of them were overlapped by DEGs and targets of DELs, suggesting the two DEGs and the DELs targeted by the two DEGs might be the potential regulators of goat IMF deposition. Taken together, our results provide basic support for further understanding the function and mechanism of lncRNAs and genes in meat quality of Hainan black goats."

Epidemiologic and clinical data routinely gathered through contact tracing were matched to SARS-CoV-2 genomes belonging to an outbreak of AY.25 identified through ongoing phylogenomic analyses. Continued phylogenetic analyses were conducted to further describe the AY.25 outbreak. Wastewater collected twice weekly from sites across campus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, and subsequently sequenced to identify variants. The AY.25 outbreak was defined by a single mutation (C18804T) and comprised 379 genomes from SARS-CoV-2 positive cases associated with the university and community. Several undergraduate student gatherings and congregate living settings on campus likely contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the university with secondary transmission into the community. The clade defining mutation was also found in wastewater samples collected from around student dormitories a week before the semester began, and 9 days before cases were identified. Genomic, epidemiologic, and wastewater surveillance provided evidence that an AY.25 clone was likely imported into the university setting just prior to the onset of the Fall 2021 semester, rapidly spread through a subset of the student population, and then subsequent spillover occurred in the surrounding community. The university and local public health department worked closely together to facilitate timely reporting of cases, identification of close contacts, and other necessary response and mitigation strategies.

Large CDR was defined as ≥ 0.6 in either eye. Cognitive function was measured by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE). We used the combined effects from 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to formulate the GRS for CDR. We used logistic regression to investigate associations between weighted GRS and large CDR, then a linear regression to assess the association between weighted GRS and 3MSE scores, and between weighted GRS, CDR, and 3MSE scores, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.Final analyses included 1,196 White women with mean age of 69.60 ± 3.62 years and 7.27% with large CDR. Mean GRS in women with and without large CDR was 1.51 ± 0.31 vs. 1.41 ± 0.36, respectively (p = 0.004). The odds of large CDR for a one unit increase in GRS was 2.30 (95% CI: (1.22, 4.36), p = 0.011). Adding the CDR GRS in the model with CDR and 3MSE, women with large CDR still had statistically significantly lower 3MSE scores than those without large CDR, yielding a predicted mean difference in 3MSE scores of 0.84 (p = 0.007).Independent of the CDR GRS, women with large CDR had a lower cognitive function."

Many studies have showed that climate and soil variables influence the change of soil δ15N. However, most of the existing studies focused on the overall impact of factor on soil δ15N, without distinguishing between the direct and indirect effect. Although scholars have studied the relationships among temperature, precipitation, soil N, soil pH, and soil δ15N rather than estimating all the causal relationships simultaneously. To answer the above-mentioned questions, a regional-scale soil collection was conducted across a temperate grassland in northern China. Meanwhile, a PLS-PATH analysis was utilized to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of various factors on soil δ15N and to explore the causal relationships among variables. The results showed that along the transect, mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) directly and significantly reduced soil δ15N, and indirectly affected soil δ15N through their effects on soil pH, soil clay, soil N and soil C/N. Soil C/N ratio has a significant direct impact on soil δ15N with a negative correlation. Soil clay, soil N content, and soil pH have a total positive effect on soil δ15N, but the total positive impact of soil pH is very weak because it has a negative indirect impact on soil δ15N by affecting soil clay, soil N and soil C/N ratio. The total influence is, in order, MAP > MAT > soil C/N > soil clay > soil N > soil pH (in absolute value). The above results will provide valuable information about ecosystem N cycle in temperate grassland of northern China."
https://openalex.org/W4307715237,"Background In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), severe pneumonia with hypoxemia is the leading cause of child deaths, even with the provision of WHO-recommended antibiotic therapy, oxygen therapy and other supportive care. Previous studies found positive outcomes from the use of bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) for treating these children compared to the standard oxygen therapy. Due to lack of data on the perceptions and experiences of hospital health care workers and caregivers of children on the feasibility and acceptability of bCPAP in treating children with severe pneumonia and hypoxemia in real-life settings, we examined these issues in tertiary and general hospitals in Ethiopia. Methods As part of a three-stages clinical trial, this qualitative study was conducted in two tertiary (stage I) and two general (stage II) hospitals from September 2019 to July 2020. During stages I and II, we have consecutively enrolled children with severe pneumonia and hypoxemia and put them on bCPAP to examine its feasibility and acceptability by clinicians and parents. A total of 89 children were enrolled (49 from two tertiary and 40 from two general hospitals). Then qualitative data were collected through 75 repeated in-depth interviews by social-science experts with purposively selected 30 hospital health workers and 15 parents of 12 children who received bCPAP oxygen therapy in the hospitals. Interview data were supplemented by 6 observations in the hospitals. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach. Results Identified structural and functional challenges for the introduction of bCPAP in treating childhood severe pneumonia and hypoxemia in the study hospitals include: inadequate number of pulse oximeters; unavailability of nasal prongs with age-specific size; inadequate and non-functioning oxygen flow meters, concentrator, and cylinders; disruption in power-supply; and inadequate number of staff. The opportunities in introducing bCPAP oxygen therapy included the availability of a dedicated corner for the study patients situated in front of nurse’s station, required medicines and satisfactory level of clinicians’ knowledge and skills for treating severe pneumonia patients. Additionally, the identified operational challenges were occasional lack of bubbling in the water-filled plastic bottle, lack of stand for holding the water-filled plastic bottle, and delayed shifting of oxygen source from an oxygen concentrator to a cylinder, particularly during electricity disruption. Participants (clinicians and parents) expressed their satisfaction as bCPAP oxygen therapy was found to be simple to handle, children had ease of breathing and recovered fast without major ill effects. Conclusion Our study identified some important structural, functional, and operational challenges that need to be addressed before implementation of bCPAP oxygen therapy especially in frontline general hospitals with limited resources. In spite of these observed challenges, the clinicians and caregivers were highly satisfied with the overall performance of bCPAP oxygen therapy."

The direct benefit of identifying variants in actionable genes may lead to risk reduction strategies such as increased surveillance, prophylactic surgery, as well as lifestyle modifications to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, patients with African ancestry are more likely to receive inconclusive genetic testing results due to an increased number of variants of unknown significance decreasing the utility and impact on disease management and prevention. This study examines whole exome sequencing results from germline DNA samples in African American women with a family history of cancer including 37 cases that were diagnosed with breast cancer and 51 family members. Self-identified ancestry was validated and compared to the 1000 genomes population. The analysis of sequencing results was limited to 85 genes from three clinically available common genetic screening platforms. This target region had a total of 993 variants of which 6 (<1%) were pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 736 (74.1%) were benign, and 170 (17.1%) were classified as a variant of unknown significance. There was an average of 3.4±1.8 variants with an unknown significance per individual and 85 of 88 individuals (96.6%) harbored at least one of these in the targeted genes. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were only found in 6 individuals for the BRCA1 (p.R1726fs, rs80357867), BRCA2 (p.K589fs, rs397507606 & p.L2805fs, rs397507402), RAD50 (p.E995fs, rs587780154), ATM (p.V2424G, rs28904921), or MUTYH (p.G396D, rs36053993) genes. Strategies to functionally validate the remaining variants of unknown significance, especially in understudied and hereditary cancer populations, are greatly needed to increase the clinical utility and utilization of clinical genetic screening platforms to reduce cancer incidence and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4307715340,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is an important cause for reduced daily physical activity (PA) and loss of quality of life, especially in women. In Suriname, a middle-income country in South America, the relationship between PA and CLBP is still unknown.To assess the level of PA in women with CLBP of different ethnicity, and to identify whether fear avoidance beliefs (FAB), disability, co-occurring musculoskeletal pain sites and various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were associated with self-reported PA.A cross-sectional community-based house-to-house survey was conducted between April 2016 and July 2017. The survey followed the Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Diseases methodology. Selection criteria were being female of Asian-Surinamese, African-Surinamese or of Mixed ethnicity and aged 18 or older, living in an urban area, and reporting CLBP. Data was collected on PA, FAB, disability, co-occurring musculoskeletal pain sites, CLBP intensity and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.Urban adult women with current CLBP (N = 210) were selected. Nearly 57% of the population met the WHO recommendation on PA, with work-related PA as the largest contributor to total self-reported PA. Most women showed low FAB scores (FABQ-Work ≤34 (96.2%) and FABQ-PA ≤14 (57.6%)) and low disability levels (Oswestry Disability Index ≤20 (62.4%)). An inverse association between total PA and FABQ-Work (OR = 0.132, CI: 0.023; 0.750) was found. In contrast, total PA had a significant, positive association with disability (OR = 2.154, CI: 1.044; 4.447) and workload (OR = 2.224, CI: 1.561; 3.167). All other variables showed no association with total PA.This was the first study in Suriname reporting that 43.3% of urban adult women with CLBP were physically inactive. Total self-reported PA is influenced by FABQ-Work, average to heavy workload and moderate to severe disability. In this study, PA-Work was the major contributor to total PA. Therefore, future longitudinal studies should evaluate different types and aspects of PA in relation to CLBP management."
https://openalex.org/W4307715346,"Most existing violence recognition methods have complex network structures and high cost of computation and cannot meet the requirements of large-scale deployment. The purpose of this paper is to reduce the complexity of the model to realize the application of violence recognition on mobile intelligent terminals. To solve this problem, we propose MobileNet-TSM, a lightweight network, which uses MobileNet-V2 as main structure. By incorporating temporal shift modules (TSM), which can exchange information between frames, the capability of extracting dynamic characteristics between consecutive frames is strengthened. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the validity of this method. Our proposed model has only 8.49MB parameters and 175.86MB estimated total size. Compared with the existing methods, this method greatly reduced the model size, at the cost of an accuracy gap of about 3%. The proposed model has achieved accuracy of 97.959%, 97.5% and 87.75% on three public datasets (Crowd Violence, Hockey Fights, and RWF-2000), respectively. Based on this, we also build a real-time violence recognition application on the Android terminal. The source code and trained models are available on https://github.com/1840210289/MobileNet-TSM.git ."
https://openalex.org/W4307715353,"Deep learning, in recent times, has made remarkable strides when it comes to impressive performance for many tasks, including medical image processing. One of the contributing factors to these advancements is the emergence of large medical image datasets. However, it is exceedingly expensive and time-consuming to construct a large and trustworthy medical dataset; hence, there has been multiple research leveraging medical reports to automatically extract labels for data. The majority of this labor, however, is performed in English. In this work, we propose a data collecting and annotation pipeline that extracts information from Vietnamese radiology reports to provide accurate labels for chest X-ray (CXR) images. This can benefit Vietnamese radiologists and clinicians by annotating data that closely match their endemic diagnosis categories which may vary from country to country. To assess the efficacy of the proposed labeling technique, we built a CXR dataset containing 9,752 studies and evaluated our pipeline using a subset of this dataset. With an F1-score of at least 0.9923, the evaluation demonstrates that our labeling tool performs precisely and consistently across all classes. After building the dataset, we train deep learning models that leverage knowledge transferred from large public CXR datasets. We employ a variety of loss functions to overcome the curse of imbalanced multi-label datasets and conduct experiments with various model architectures to select the one that delivers the best performance. Our best model (CheXpert-pretrained EfficientNet-B2) yields an F1-score of 0.6989 (95% CI 0.6740, 0.7240), AUC of 0.7912, sensitivity of 0.7064 and specificity of 0.8760 for the abnormal diagnosis in general. Finally, we demonstrate that our coarse classification (based on five specific locations of abnormalities) yields comparable results to fine classification (twelve pathologies) on the benchmark CheXpert dataset for general anomaly detection while delivering better performance in terms of the average performance of all classes."

https://openalex.org/W4307744416,"People differ in intelligence, cognitive ability, personality traits, motivation, and similar valued and, to a large degree, inherited characteristics that determine success and achievements. When does individual heterogeneity lead to a fair distribution of rewards and outcomes? Here, we develop this question theoretically and then test it experimentally for a set of structural conditions in a specific interaction situation. We first catalogue the functional relationship between individual endowments and outcomes to distinguish between fairness concepts such as meritocracy, equality of opportunity, equality of outcomes, and Rawl's theory of justice. We then use an online experiment to study which of these fairness patterns emerge when differently endowed individuals can share their resources with others, depending on whether information about others' endowments and outcomes is available. We find that while visible outcomes lessen inequality by decreasing the statistical dispersion of outcomes across the group, endowments need to be visible for better equality of opportunity for the most disadvantaged."
https://openalex.org/W4307744822,"In vitro protein display methods can access extensive libraries (e.g., 10 12 –10 14 ) and play an increasingly important role in protein engineering. However, the preparation of large libraries remains a laborious and time-consuming process. Here we report an efficient one-pot ligation &amp; elongation (L&amp;E) method for sizeable synthetic library preparation free of PCR amplification or any purification steps. As a proof of concept, we constructed an ankyrin repeat protein templated synthetic library with 10 11 variants in 150 μL volume. The entire process from the oligos to DNA template ready for transcription is linearly scalable and took merely 90 minutes. We believe this L&amp;E method can significantly simplify the preparation of synthetic libraries and accelerate in vitro protein display experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4307777477,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelia-derived malignancy with a distinctive geographic distribution. Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) is involved in cancer development and progression. Nevertheless, the role of CSE in the growth of NPC is unknown. In this study, we found that CSE levels in human NPC cells were higher than those in normal nasopharyngeal cells. CSE overexpression enhanced the proliferative, migrative, and invasive abilities of NPC cells and CSE downregulation exerted reverse effects. Overexpression of CSE decreased the expressions of cytochrome C, cleaved caspase (cas)-3, cleaved cas-9, and cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, whereas CSE knockdown exhibited reverse effects. CSE overexpression decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the expressions of phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p-p38, but promoted the expressions of p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p-AKT, and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas CSE knockdown showed oppose effects. In addition, CSE overexpression promoted NPC xenograft tumor growth and CSE knockdown decreased tumor growth by modulating proliferation, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Furthermore, DL-propargylglycine (an inhibitor of CSE) dose-dependently inhibited NPC cell growth via ROS-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways without significant toxicity. In conclusion, CSE could regulate the growth of NPC cells through ROS-mediated MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascades. CSE might be a novel tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of NPC. Novel donors/drugs that inhibit the expression/activity of CSE can be developed in the treatment of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W4307888974,"The endothelium, a crucial homeostatic organ, regulates vascular permeability and tone. Under physiological conditions, endothelial stimulation induces vasodilator endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) release and prevents adhesion molecule accessibility and leukocyte adhesion and migration into vessel walls. Endothelium dysfunction is a principal event in cardiovascular disorders, including atherosclerosis. Minimal attention is given to an important endothelial cell structure, the endothelial glycocalyx (GCX), a negatively charged heterogeneous polysaccharide that serves as a protective covering for endothelial cells and enables endothelial cells to transduce mechanical stimuli into various biological and chemical activities. Endothelial GCX shedding thus plays a role in endothelial dysfunction, for example by increasing vascular permeability and decreasing vessel tone. Consequently, there is increasing interest in developing therapies that focus on GCX repair to limit downstream endothelium dysfunction and prevent further downstream cardiovascular events. Here, we present diosmin (3′,5,7-trihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone-7-rhamnoglucoside), a flavone glycoside of diosmetin, which downregulates adhesive molecule expression, decreases inflammation and capillary permeability, and upregulates eNO expression. Due to these pleiotropic effects of diosmin on the vasculature, a possible unidentified mechanism of action is through GCX restoration. We hypothesize that diosmin positively affects GCX integrity along with GCX-related endothelial functions. Our hypothesis was tested in a partial ligation left carotid artery (LCA) mouse model, where the right carotid artery was the control for each mouse. Diosmin (50 mg/kg) was administered daily for 7 days, 72 h after ligation. Within the ligated mice LCAs, diosmin treatment elevated the activated eNO synthase level, inhibited inflammatory cell uptake, decreased vessel wall thickness, increased vessel diameter, and increased GCX coverage of the vessel wall. ELISA showed a decrease in hyaluronan concentration in plasma samples of diosmin-treated mice, signifying reduced GCX shedding. In summary, diosmin supported endothelial GCX integrity, to which we attribute diosmin's preservation of endothelial function as indicated by attenuated expression of inflammatory factors and restored vascular tone."
https://openalex.org/W4308188434,"Purpose To explore the impact of gender mismatch on corneal allograft rejection and rejection-related graft failure in patients with repeat penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Methods A retrospective cohort was conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Patients with repeat PK and follow-up period of at least 6 months were recruited. Demographic data, pre-operative ocular findings and donor information were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to gender mismatch between donor and recipient (male to female vs others). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association between risk factors and the outcomes of graft rejection and rejection-related graft failure were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Of 68 patients with repeat PK, 26 patients (38.2%) were gender mismatched. There was no difference in 3-year rejection-free survival and graft survival between patients with gender mismatch and others (p = 0.698 and p = 0.402, respectively). Younger recipients (&lt; 40 years) showed a significantly higher rejection rate compared to older recipients (hazard ratio; HR = 3.14, 95% confidence interval; CI 1.15 to 8.58), while patients with multiple PK (&gt; 2 times) were found to be significantly associated with higher rejection-related graft failure compared to patients with 2 times or less PK (HR = 2.72, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.21). After multivariate analysis, only younger recipients demonstrated a statistical significance on graft rejection (adjusted HR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 7.84). Conclusions Gender mismatch might not impact corneal graft rejection or rejection-related graft failure in patients with repeat PK. Younger age was found to be a strong factor associated with graft rejection. Gender matching might not be compulsory for repeat PK."
