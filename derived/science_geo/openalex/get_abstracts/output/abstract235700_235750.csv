https://openalex.org/W2092073971,"The 'Spanish' influenza pandemic of 1918-19 was the most devastating outbreak of infectious disease in recorded history. At least 20 million people died from their illness, which was characterized by an unusually severe and rapid clinical course. The complete sequencing of several genes of the 1918 influenza virus has made it possible to study the functions of the proteins encoded by these genes in viruses generated by reverse genetics, a technique that permits the generation of infectious viruses entirely from cloned complementary DNA. Thus, to identify properties of the 1918 pandemic influenza A strain that might be related to its extraordinary virulence, viruses were produced containing the viral haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 1918 strain. The HA of this strain supports the pathogenicity of a mouse-adapted virus in this animal. Here we demonstrate that the HA of the 1918 virus confers enhanced pathogenicity in mice to recent human viruses that are otherwise non-pathogenic in this host. Moreover, these highly virulent recombinant viruses expressing the 1918 viral HA could infect the entire lung and induce high levels of macrophage-derived chemokines and cytokines, which resulted in infiltration of inflammatory cells and severe haemorrhage, hallmarks of the illness produced during the original pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W1996654246,"Although hydrogen is the simplest of atoms, it does not form the simplest of solids or liquids. Quantum effects in these phases are considerable (a consequence of the light proton mass) and they have a demonstrable and often puzzling influence on many physical properties, including spatial order. To date, the structure of dense hydrogen remains experimentally elusive. Recent studies of the melting curve of hydrogen indicate that at high (but experimentally accessible) pressures, compressed hydrogen will adopt a liquid state, even at low temperatures. In reaching this phase, hydrogen is also projected to pass through an insulator-to-metal transition. This raises the possibility of new state of matter: a near ground-state liquid metal, and its ordered states in the quantum domain. Ordered quantum fluids are traditionally categorized as superconductors or superfluids; these respective systems feature dissipationless electrical currents or mass flow. Here we report an analysis based on topological arguments of the projected phase of liquid metallic hydrogen, finding that it may represent a new type of ordered quantum fluid. Specifically, we show that liquid metallic hydrogen cannot be categorized exclusively as a superconductor or superfluid. We predict that, in the presence of a magnetic field, liquid metallic hydrogen will exhibit several phase transitions to ordered states, ranging from superconductors to superfluids."
https://openalex.org/W1975007947,"The extinction of the many well-known large mammals (megafauna) of the Late Pleistocene epoch has usually been attributed to 'overkill' by human hunters, climatic/vegetational changes or to a combination of both. An accurate knowledge of the geography and chronology of these extinctions is crucial for testing these hypotheses. Previous assumptions that the megafauna of northern Eurasia had disappeared by the Pleistocene/Holocene transition were first challenged a decade ago by the discovery that the latest woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island, northeastern Siberia, were contemporaneous with ancient Egyptian civilization. Here we show that another spectacular megafaunal species, the giant deer or 'Irish elk', survived to around 6,900 radiocarbon yr bp (about 7,700 yr ago) in western Siberia-more than three millennia later than its previously accepted terminal date-and therefore, that the reasons for its ultimate demise are to be sought in Holocene not Pleistocene events. Before their extinction, both giant deer and woolly mammoth underwent dramatic shifts in distribution, driven largely by climatic/vegetational changes. Their differing responses reflect major differences in ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2041234310,"The persistent activation of signaling cascades results in dramatic consequences that include loss of cellular growth control and neoplastic transformation. We show here that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and its mediator Akt were constitutively activated in pancreatic cancer and that this might be due to the aberrant expression of their natural antagonist MMAC/PTEN. Indeed, our results show that MMAC/PTEN expression was either lost or significantly reduced in five of eight cell lines and in twelve of seventeen tumor specimens examined. That the poor expression of MMAC/PTEN in pancreatic cancer cells could be due to promoter methylation was indicated by methylation-specific PCR analysis. Our studies also indicated that PI 3-kinase targeted two important transcription factors in pancreatic cancer cells. The ability of constitutively activated NF-κB to induce gene expression and the stabilization of c-MYC protein by decreased phosphorylation of Thr58 were both dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. When pancreatic cancer cells were treated with a peptide antagonist of NF-κB nuclear translocation, or stably transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of MYC, their proliferation was markedly inhibited. Taken together, these data indicate that the aberrant expression of MMAC/PTEN contributes to the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and its transcription factor mediators in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089890567,"It is generally assumed that solid hydrogen will transform into a metallic alkali-like crystal at sufficiently high pressure. However, some theoretical models have also suggested that compressed hydrogen may form an unusual two-component (protons and electrons) metallic fluid at low temperature, or possibly even a zero-temperature liquid ground state. The existence of these new states of matter is conditional on the presence of a maximum in the melting temperature versus pressure curve (the 'melt line'). Previous measurements of the hydrogen melt line up to pressures of 44 GPa have led to controversial conclusions regarding the existence of this maximum. Here we report ab initio calculations that establish the melt line up to 200 GPa. We predict that subtle changes in the intermolecular interactions lead to a decline of the melt line above 90 GPa. The implication is that as solid molecular hydrogen is compressed, it transforms into a low-temperature quantum fluid before becoming a monatomic crystal. The emerging low-temperature phase diagram of hydrogen and its isotopes bears analogies with the familiar phases of 3He and 4He (the only known zero-temperature liquids), but the long-range Coulomb interactions and the large component mass ratio present in hydrogen would result in dramatically different properties."
https://openalex.org/W2091312754,"The tumor suppressor p53 is important in the decision to either arrest cell cycle progression or induce apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. p53 posttranslational modifications and association with other proteins have been implicated in the regulation of its stability and transactivation activity. Here we show that p53 is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Aurora-A at serine 215. Unlike most identified phosphorylation sites of p53 that positively associate with p53 function (Brooks, C. L., and Gu, W. (2003) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 15, 164–171), the phosphorylation of p53 by Aurora-A at Ser-215 abrogates p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity. Downstream target genes of p53, such as p21Cip/WAF1 and PTEN, were inhibited by Aurora-A in a Ser-215 phosphorylation-dependent manner (i.e. phosphomimic p53-S215D lost and non-phosphorylatable p53-S215A retained normal p53 function). As a result, Aurora-A overrides the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by cisplatin and γ-irradiation, respectively. However, the effect of Aurora-A on p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity was not affected by phosphorylation of Ser-315, a recently identified Aurora-A phosphorylation site of p53 (Katayama, H., Sasai, K., Kawai, H., Yuan, Z. M., Bondaruk, J., Suzuki, F., Fujii, S., Arlinghaus, R. B., Czerniak, B. A., and Sen, S. (2004) Nat. Genet. 36, 55–62). Our data indicate that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-215 by Aurora-A is a major mechanism to inactivate p53 and can provide a molecular insight for Aurora-A function.

Our data indicate that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-215 by Aurora-A is a major mechanism to inactivate p53 and can provide a molecular insight for Aurora-A function. Aurora is a subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. In vertebrates, they comprise Aurora-A, -B, and -C, with one or more highly conserved orthologues being found in the yeasts, flies, worms, and other invertebrates. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have a single Aurora gene, IPL1 (3Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes encode one member in each of the Aurora-A and -B classes (4Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The homologs of Aurora-A and -B have also been found in Xenopus (5Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence shows that Aurora kinases play a critical role in G2/M progression of the cell cycle. Their regulatory influence spans from G2 to cytokinesis, encompassing key cell cycle events such as centrosome duplication, chromosome bi-orientation and segregation, and cleavage-furrow positioning and ingression (4Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 6Higuchi T. Uhlmann F. Nature. 2003; 426: 780-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Aurora-A has attracted intense interest following the discovery that the chromosomal region (20q13.2) where it is located commonly undergoes amplification in human cancers. It has been shown that amplifications of the Aurora-A gene occur in as many as 12–30% of ovarian, breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers (7Sen S. Zhou H. White R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 8Goepfert T.M. Adigun Y.E. Zhong L. Gay J. Medina D. Brinkley W.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4115-4122PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Aurora-A in murine fibroblasts as well as mammary epithelia induces centrosome amplification, aneuploidy, and oncogenic phenotype (7Sen S. Zhou H. White R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 8Goepfert T.M. Adigun Y.E. Zhong L. Gay J. Medina D. Brinkley W.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4115-4122PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested that Aurora-A plays an important role in programmed cell death and chemoresistance (9Anand S. Penrhyn-Lowe S. Venkitaraman A.R. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular mechanism still remains elusive.A recent report shows that Aurora-A induces p53 degradation by phosphorylation of Ser-315 (1, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 2Katayama H. Sasai K. Kawai H. Yuan Z.M. Bondaruk J. Suzuki F. Fujii S. Arlinghaus R.B. Czerniak B.A. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that DNA binding and transactivation activity of p53 was abrogated by Aurora-A. Aurora-A phosphorylates p53 at Ser-215 in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition of p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity by Aurora-A depends on phosphorylation of Ser-215 but not Ser-315. Further, Aurora-A phosphorylation of Ser-215 of p53 is associated with Aurora-A-regulated cell cycle progression, cell survival, and transformation. These data indicate that p53 is a physiological substrate of Aurora-A and that Aurora-A exerts its function through phosphorylation of Ser-215 of p53. In addition, our study also identifies Ser-215 as a novel phosphorylation site of p53 that might be targeted by other serine/threonine kinases besides Aurora-A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Plasmids—Recombinant p53 protein was purchased from Calbiochem. Edman degradation reagents were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Expression plasmids of p53 and Aurora-A were created by ligation of the cDNA of p53 and Aurora-A into pDsRed2C1 (EcoRI/KpnI), pEGFPC3 (BglII/KpnI), and pGEX-4T1 (BamHI/EcoRI) vectors. Mutant constructs of p53 were prepared with a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pcDNA3-HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; RNAi, RNA interference; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.-p53 as a template.Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (10Yuan Z.Q. Feldman R.I. Sun M. Olashaw N.E. Coppola D. Sussman G.E. Shelley S.A. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29973-29982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assay was carried out with immunoprecipitated HA-Aurora-A in a reaction buffer (11Gritsko T.M. Coppola D. Paciga J.E. Yang L. Sun M. Shelley S.A. Fiorica J.V. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1420-1426PubMed Google Scholar) using recombinant or glutathione S-transferase-fused p53 as substrate. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and stopped in Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylation of p53 was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with p21 or PTEN promoter-driven luciferase reporter, pSV2-β-galactosidase, and plasmids indicated in the legends to Figs. 2 and 3. Following a 48-h culture, cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Transcriptional activity was measured by normalizing the luciferase activity to the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was repeated three times.Fig. 3Aurora-A inhibition of p53 transactivation and DNA binding activity depends on phosphorylation of Ser-215 but not Ser-315. A, Western blot analysis. H1299 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids, lysed, and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. B–E, reporter (B and E) and EMSA assays (C and D). H1299 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. After 24 h of transfection, cells were subjected to reporter and EMSA analyses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction was incubated with an anti-p53 antibody in the far left lane of C and D for determining the specificity of p53 binding to DNA.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Phosphoamino Acid Analysis, Phosphopeptide Mapping, and Edman Degradation—To prepare the phosphoamino acid and phosphopeptide of p53, Aurora-A-phosphorylated p53 was excised and eluted from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel by incubation in a buffer containing 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% SDS for 12 h. After chloroform precipitation and oxidation with performic acid, a portion of the sample was subjected to partial hydrolysis by incubation with 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The rest was digested with 10 ng of endoproteinase Asp-N, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, or trypsin/Glu-C (Sigma) for 6 h at 37 °C, followed by an additional 10-h incubation at 37 °C in the presence of a fresh 10 ng of the same proteinase.Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping were conducted as described previously (12Le Goff P.L. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the HTLE-7000 system. Briefly, the phosphoamino acids were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis on a thin layer of cellulose. The electrophoresis was carried out for 20 min at 1.5 kV in 88% formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water (1:3.1:35.9, pH 1.9) for the first dimension and for 16 min at 1.3 kV in pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water (1:10:189, pH 3.5) for the second dimension. Phosphoamino acid standards, which were mixed with each sample, were visualized by staining with 0.25% w/v ninhydrin in acetone.Phosphopeptides of p53 were resolved by electrophoresis for 30 min at 1.0 kV in formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water (1:3.1:35.9; pH 1.9). The second dimension was accomplished by chromatography in n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water (5:3.3:1:4). The phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography for 12 h at –80 °C and eluted from the thin layer plate with formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water (1:3.1:35.9, pH 1.9). The purified phosphopeptides were subjected to manual Edman degradation as described previously to identify the phosphorylation sites (13Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphopeptides were covalently coupled to Sequelon-AA discs and subjected to consecutive cycles of the Edman degradation. After each cycle, the disc was treated with trifluoroacetic acid to cleave and release the N-terminal amino acid, and the released 32P was determined by Cerenkov counting.EMSA—EMSA was performed as described previously (14Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Yu L. Wu Z. Gritsko T. Shelley S.A. Nicosia S.V. Nobori T. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide encoding the consensus p53 DNA binding site (5′-TAC AGA ACA TGT CTA AGC ATG CTG GGG-3′) at room temperature for 30 min. Competition for p53 binding activity was carried out in the presence of a 40-fold excess of the cold wild type oligonucleotide or mutant oligonucleotide (5′-TAC AGA AAA TTT CTA AGT CCT CTG GGG-3′), and supershift of p53-oligonucleotide complex was obtained by the addition of DO-1, a specific antibody for p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis through a 5% native polyacrylamide gel.Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, and Colony Formation—For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight, stained in 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed with flow cytometry. Apoptosis was examined by Annexin-V assay. Briefly, 106 cells were double labeled with Annexin-V-allophycocyanin and 7-amino-actinomycin D using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). The percentage of apoptosis (Annexin-V-positive cells) was determined by flow cytometry. Colony formation was measured as described previously (15Quartin R.S. Cole C.N. Pipas J.M. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1334-1341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with p53 and Aurora-A or their respective empty vectors. The colony formation was assessed after a 3-week culture.RESULTSAurora-A Primarily Phosphorylates p53 at Ser-215—We examined whether Aurora-A associates with tumor suppressor p53 because both Aurora-A and p53 localize to centrosome during mitosis, and the overexpression of Aurora-A and loss of p53 function result in similar phenotypes of centrosome amplification and aneuploidy (16Fukasawa K. Choi T. Kuriyama R. Rulong S. VandeVoude G.F. Science. 1996; 271: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 17Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation showed Aurora-A interaction with p53 (Fig. 1A). Further experiments revealed that Aurora-A phosphorylated p53 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1B). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that Aurora-A phosphorylated p53 on serine residue(s) (Fig. 1C). To map p53 residue(s) phosphorylated by Aurora-A, Aurora-A-phosphorylated recombinant p53 was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, and the cleaved phosphopeptides were subjected to two-dimensional gel analysis (Fig. 1D). Amino acid analysis by Edman degradation of the phosphopeptides demonstrated that the activity of radioisotope was released after the eighth cycle of the degradation in the higher radioactivity spot, whereas the lower density spot did not reveal radioactivity release after a 10-cycle degradation (Fig. 1D). Judging from the amino acid sequence of p53, the only endoproteinase Asp-N-digested peptide that contains serine or threonine at position 8 in its sequence is 208DRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGS227, where bold indicates phosphorylated serine residue. Thus, these results indicate that Ser-215 is a phosphorylation site of p53 for Aurora-A kinase. To confirm this result, Aurora-A-phosphorylated p53 was digested with endoproteinase trypsin (Fig. 1E) and trypsin/Glu-C (Fig. 1F). Edman degradation and amino acid analysis showed that the higher density spot was Ser-215 and the other was Ser-315 (Fig. 1, E and F). Further, the conversion of Ser-215 to alanine markedly decreased Aurora-A phosphorylation of p53 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, G and H). Therefore, Ser-215 of p53 is a major residue targeted by Aurora-A.Fig. 1Aurora-A primarily phosphorylates p53 at Ser-215. A, interaction of Aurora-A with p53.

Fig. 2A shows that p53 DNA binding activity was significantly inhibited by overexpression of Aurora-A in both A2780S (wild-type p53) and p53-transfected H1299 cells, whereas knockdown of endogenous Aurora-A by RNAi increased the DNA binding activity ∼3-fold. The effect of Aurora-A on p53 transactivation activity was evaluated with p21Cip/WAF1 and PTEN promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay in A2780S cells. Aurora-A inhibited p21 and PTEN promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the suppression of Aurora-A expression by RNAi enhanced the promoter activity of p21 and PTEN (Fig. 2B). These results were further supported by cotransfection of p53 and Aurora-A in p53-null H1299 cells (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, protein levels of p21 and PTEN were reduced by ectopic expression of Aurora-A and elevated by knockdown of endogenous Aurora-A (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that Aurora-A directly targets p53 and inhibits its DNA binding and transactivation activity.Aurora-A Inhibition of p53 Transactivation and DNA Binding Activity Depends on Phosphorylation of Ser-215 but Not Ser-315—We further determined whether phosphorylation of Ser-215 is required for Aurora-A abrogation of p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity. Aurora-A phosphomimic p53-S215D and nonphosphorylatable p53-S215A were created by converting Ser-215 to aspartic acid and alanine, respectively. Their functions were evaluated in p53-null H1299 cells. Fig. 3, A and B, shows that nonphosphorylatable p53-S215A induced the expression and promoter activity of p21 and PTEN, which are similar to those of wild-type p53. However, these effects of p53-S215A, unlike wild-type p53, were not inhibited by ectopic expression of Aurora-A. Further, phosphomimic p53-S215D completely lost the ability to induce p21 and PTEN expression and promoter activity. In addition, p53-S215A retained DNA binding activity, which was not inhibited by Aurora-A, whereas p53-S215D failed to bind to DNA (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we conclude that Aurora-A inactivation of p53 depends on phosphorylation of Ser-215.A recent report shows that Aurora-A phosphorylates p53 at Ser-315, which was also observed in our study (Fig. 1, E and F), leading to MDM2-mediated destabilization of p53 (2Katayama H. Sasai K. Kawai H. Yuan Z.M. Bondaruk J. Suzuki F. Fujii S. Arlinghaus R.B. Czerniak B.A. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, the its direct effects on p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity are unknown. To this end, we created phosphomimic p53-S315D, nonphosphorylatable p53-S315A, as well as S215A/S315A and S215D/S315D double mutants. EMSA and reporter assays revealed that both phosphomimic p53-S315D and nonphosphorylatable p53-S315A retained p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity and were negatively regulated by Aurora-A (Fig. 3, D and E). However, introducing S215D mutation caused p53-S315A and p53-S315D to completely lose DNA binding capability (Fig 3D). These data indicate that Aurora-A directly inactivates p53 through phosphorylation of Ser-215 but not Ser-315.Aurora-A Inhibition of p53 Tumor Suppressor Function Is Dependent on Phosphorylation of Ser-215—Because p53 is a tumor suppressor and a key regulator of cell survival and cell cycle progression, we further examined the effects of Aurora-A phosphorylation of Ser-215 and/or Ser-315 on p53 biological function. We and others have shown previously that A2780CP cells are resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and that reintroducing p53 restores the response of the cell to cisplatin (10Yuan Z.Q. Feldman R.I. Sun M. Olashaw N.E. Coppola D. Sussman G.E. Shelley S.A. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29973-29982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Leung B.M. Fraser M. Yan X. Dan H.C. Cheng J.Q. Tsang B.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7081-7088PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the effect of Aurora-A phosphorylation of p53 on cisplatin-induced programmed cell death in A2780CP cells. The cells were transfected with different forms of p53, treated with cisplatin, and analyzed with Annexin-V labeling and flow cytometry. Fig. 4A shows that ectopic expression of p53-S215A or wild-type p53 restored cisplatin sensitivity and induced apoptosis at ∼47%. However, coexpression of Aurora-A inhibited the apoptosis induced by wild-type p53 but not p53-S215A. A similar percentage of apoptosis was detected in the cells expressing p53-S315A and p53-S315D that were abrogated by Aurora-A. In contrast, p53-S215D lost the ability to sensitize A2780CP cells to cisplatin-induced programmed cell death (Fig. 4A). Similarly, wild-type p53, p53-S215A, p53-S315A, and p53-S315D but not p53-S215D inhibited colony formation in both H1299 and SaOS2, the cell lines examined. Aurora-A abrogated wild-type p53-, p53-S315A-, and p53-S315D-inhibited colony formation but had no effect on p53-S215A (Fig. 4B). In addition, flow cytometry analysis revealed that γ-irradiation arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase in H1299 cells expressing wild-type p53, p53-S315A, and p53-S315D, which were overridden by Aurora-A (Fig. 4, C and D). Expression of Aurora-A, however, failed to rescue the cell cycle arrest in cells transfected with p53-S215A. Further, G2/M arrest was not observed in cells expressing p53-S215D in response to γ-irradiation (Fig. 4D). It is noted that expression of p53-S215D still exhibited some effects on cell survival and cell cycle progression as compared with p53-null cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone (Fig. 4, A and D). Nevertheless, these data indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-215 but not Ser-315 of p53 by Aurora-A has a direct inhibitory effect on p53 function.Fig. 4Aurora-A inhibition of p53 biological function through phosphorylation of Ser-215.

Here we report a new basal tyrannosauroid from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of western Liaoning, China, which is small and gracile and has relatively long arms with three-fingered hands. The new taxon is the earliest known unquestionable tyrannosauroid found so far. It shows a mosaic of characters, including a derived cranial structure resembling that of derived tyrannosauroids and a primitive postcranial skeleton similar to basal coelurosaurians. One of the specimens also preserves a filamentous integumentary covering similar to that of other coelurosaurian theropods from western Liaoning. This provides the first direct fossil evidence that tyrannosauroids had protofeathers."

https://openalex.org/W2144800586,"Adipocyte hyperplasia is characteristic of some forms of human obesity, but the role of adipocyte number in obesity and how normal adipocyte number is established are unclear. Preadipocytes proliferate and then differentiate to become mitotically quiescent adipocytes. This involves exit from the cell cycle, a process regulated by cell cycle inhibitors such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p27 and p21. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes show marked changes in p27 and p21 during differentiation, suggesting CDKIs may regulate establishment of adipocyte number in vivo. To study the role of these CDKIs in adipogenesis, we analyzed adult p27 knockout (p27KO), p21 knockout (p21KO), p27/p21 double knockout (DBKO), and wild-type (WT) mice. Adult DBKO mice weighed 100% more and had fourfold increases in body fat percentage compared with WT. Fat pad weights were increased 80, 90, and 500% in p27KO, p21KO, and DBKO mice, respectively, compared with WT. Adipocyte numbers of p27KO, p21KO, and DBKO mice were 1.9-, 1.7-, and 6.1-fold, respectively, that of WT; adipocyte size was not increased. DBKO mice showed glucose intolerance, insulin insensitivity, hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia; gradations of these effects occurred in p27KO and p21KO mice. In conclusion, p27KO and p21KO mice are obese because of adipocyte hyperplasia, and DBKO mice have further increases in obesity and adipocyte hyperplasia, indicating that their functions in establishing adipocyte number are not redundant. p27 and p21 are major regulators of adipocyte number in vivo, and knockouts lacking one or both of these proteins provide models for producing adipocyte hyperplasia and understanding its metabolic consequences."

https://openalex.org/W2004945687,"Aberrantly methylated DNA fragments were searched for in human pancreatic cancers, using the genome scanning technique: methylation-sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA). MS-RDA isolated 111 DNA fragments derived from CpG islands (CGIs), and 35 of them were from CGIs in the 5' regions of known genes. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) of the CGIs in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines and two pancreatic ductal epithelial cell lines showed that 27 CGIs in the 5' regions were aberrantly methylated in at least one of the cancer cell lines. Quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR analysis showed that downstream genes of all the CGIs were either not expressed or only very weakly expressed in cancer cell lines with the aberrant methylation. In the pancreatic ductal epithelial cell lines, 18 genes were expressed at various levels, and nine genes were not expressed at all. Treatment of a cancer cell line with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, restored the expression of 13 genes, RASGRF2, ADAM23, NEF3, NKX2-8, HAND1, EGR4, PRG2, FBN2, CDH2, TLL1, NPTX1, NTSR1 and THBD, showing their silencing by methylation of their 5' CGIs. MSP of 24 primary pancreatic cancers showed that all these genes, except for THBD, were methylated in at least one cancer. Some of those were suggested to be potentially involved in pancreatic cancer development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2080042207,"Drosophila lethal giant larvae: (lgl), discs large (dlg) and scribble (scrib) are tumour suppressor genes acting in a common pathway, whose loss of function leads to disruption of cell polarity and tissue architecture, uncontrolled proliferation and growth of neoplastic lesions. Mammalian homologues of these genes are highly conserved and evidence is emerging concerning their role in cell proliferation control and tumorigenesis in humans. Here we investigate the functional conservation between Drosophila lethal giant larvae and its human homologue Hugl-1(Llgl1). We first show that Hugl-1 is lost in human solid malignancies, supporting its role as a tumour suppressor in humans. Hugl-1 expression in homozygous lgl Drosophila mutants is able to rescue larval lethality; imaginal tissues do not show any neoplastic features, with Dlg and Scrib exhibiting the correct localization; animals undergo a complete metamorphosis and hatch as viable adults. These data demonstrate that Hugl-1 can act as a tumour suppressor in Drosophila and thus is the functional homologue of lgl. Furthermore, our data suggest that the genetic pathway including the tumour suppressors lgl, dlg and scrib may be conserved in mammals, since human scrib and mammalian dlg can also rescue their respective Drosophila mutations. Our results highlight the usefulness of fruit fly as a model system for investigating in vivo the mechanisms linking loss of cell polarity and cell proliferation control in human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2018088372,"Secreted protein acidic, rich in cysteine (SPARC), is an extracellular matrix protein expressed in many advanced cancers, including malignant gliomas. We and others have previously shown that human glioma cell lines engineered to overexpress SPARC adopt an invasive phenotype. We now show that SPARC expression increases cell survival under stress initiated by serum withdrawal through a decrease in apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase/AKT is a potent pro-survival pathway that contributes to the malignancy of gliomas. Cells expressing SPARC display increased AKT activation with decreased caspase 3/7 activity. Exogenous SPARC rapidly induces AKT phosphorylation, an effect that is blocked by a neutralizing SPARC antibody. Furthermore, AKT activation is essential for the anti-apoptotic effects of SPARC as the decreased apoptosis and caspase activity associated with SPARC expression can be blocked with dominant-negative AKT or a specific AKT inhibitor. As tumor cells face stressful microenvironments particularly during the process of invasion, these results suggest that SPARC functions, in part, to promote tumor progression by enabling tumor cells to survive under stressful conditions.

Malignant gliomas remain essentially lethal cancers despite maximal therapy because of resistance to all conventional therapies (1Scott C.B. Scarantino C. Urtasun R. Movsas B. Jones C.U. Simpson J.R.

Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). The ability to resist apoptotic stimuli is prominent among these characteristics. Cancer cells face many noxious stimuli that may induce cell death, including nutrient restriction, hypoxia, acidosis, loss of cell attachment, and genomic instability. Gliomas commonly develop mechanisms through which they resist cell death either through disruption of apoptotic processes or activation of survival signals (3Bogler O. Weller M. Front.

Microenvironmental cues, including interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, control cellular survival and resistance to apoptosis.

SPARC was originally discovered as a component of bone (7Termine J.D. Kleinman H.K. Whitson S.W. Conn K.M. McGarvey M.L. Martin G.R.

SPARC thus represents a potentially important contributor to glioma malignancy. The mechanisms through which SPARC functions in cancer progression remain complex and depend on tumor cell type and the microenvironment. Mice with disrupted SPARC expression are less sensitive to the development of squamous cell carcinomas induced by ultraviolet radiation (18Aycock R.L. Bradshaw A.C. Sage E.H. Starcher B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 592-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but some tumor xenografts grow more aggressively in SPARC knockout mice with a lack of tumor capsule (19Brekken R.A.

Biochem. 1995; 57: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but we have previously shown that glioma cell lines expressing SPARC do not exhibit significant differences with control lines in either cellular proliferation or apoptosis in 10% serum cell culture conditions (15Rich J.N. Shi Q. Hjelmeland M. Cummings T.J. Kuan C.T. Bigner D.D. Counter C.M. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15951-15957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, cells grown in vivo experience much greater restriction of the growth factors found in serum as many growth factors are reversibly bound to the matrix. Glioma cells undergoing invasion may be faced with even more stressful conditions relative to adherent cells as they move along brain white matter tracts (13Giese A. Bjerkvig R. Berens M.E. Westphal M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 1624-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Recently, Rempel and co-workers (22Vadlamuri S.V. Media J. Sankey S.S. Nakeff A. Divine G. Rempel S.A. Neuro-oncol. 2003; 5: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have shown that a glioma cell line engineered to overexpress SPARC exhibits differential cell number and morphology relative to parental control cells in serum-restricted (0.1%) conditions. Although the proliferation of cells expressing SPARC varied from parental lines with different extracellular matrices, no matrix preferentially modified the effect of SPARC (22Vadlamuri S.V. Media J. Sankey S.S. Nakeff A. Divine G. Rempel S.A. Neuro-oncol. 2003; 5: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As SPARC may directly interact with growth factors or indirectly regulate growth factor receptor pathways (5Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), the cellular impact of SPARC may vary with the withdrawal of growth factors and other survival factors in serum. We have now shown that the expression of SPARC by gliomas induces cellular survival in serum-free conditions associated with AKT activation. Thus, SPARC-mediated cell survival may represent a novel mechanism by which PI3K-AKT activity may be induced by malignant gliomas. Furthermore, the ability of tumor cells to survive in stressful conditions may represent a critical aspect of glioma invasion as invading cells may face a loss of external survival signals from the microenvironment. Therefore, SPARC may represent an important therapeutic cancer target as it can modulate critical advanced tumor phenotypes, including invasion and resistance to apoptosis.

Cell numbers were determined after trypan blue staining of viable tumor cells in parallel plates. Annexin V Assays—Cells were plated in triplicate in 6-well plates at variable densities in medium containing 10% serum overnight. Cultures were then washed twice with DPBS and then fed with serum-free media. At various incubation times, media were collected and combined with adherent cells harvested by trypsinization. After centrifugation, cells were washed, resuspended, and stained for annexin V and propidium iodide per the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). Samples were analyzed on a BD Biosciences flow cytometer and analyzed with manufacturer's software. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Staining—Cells were plated in individual wells on slides in media containing 10% FBS overnight. Cells were washed twice with DPBS and allowed to grow in serum-free media. Cells were pulsed with BrdUrd for 4 h, fixed with methanol, and stained with diaminobenzidine. The ratio of cells incorporating BrdUrd was calculated using the number of brown cells relative to the total number of cells. Assays were performed in triplicate. Western Analysis—For each assay, a 100-mm plate was lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm NaF plus proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. An equal amount of protein was run on polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), hybridized, and detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). All antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phospho-specific antibodies for AKT (Ser-473), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ), and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), as well as total AKT antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Caspase3/CPP32 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Phospho-specific ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Osteonectin (SPARC) antibody was purchased from Hematologic Technologies. An anti-tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were plated into 100-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per plate, serum-starved overnight after attachment, and then fed with media containing inhibitors for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed once in DPBS, and resuspended in RNaseA (Sigma, 100 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (Sigma, 50 μg/ml). Samples were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Transfection—Cells were maintained in medium containing 10% FBS until they reached 50–60% confluence. Plasmid DNAs were incubated with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min and added to cells per the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were maintained for 24 h and then split for subsequent experiments. Caspase-3/7 Activity Assay—Apo-ONE Caspase-3/7 Activity Kits were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Assays were performed under the manufacturer's instructions in a 96-well black wall clear bottom tissue culture plate. 4000 cells/well were plated in the assay. Fluorescent intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm on SpectraMax Gemini plate scanner. Nonradioactive Cell Proliferation Assay—CellTiter96 cell proliferation assay kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Assays were performed, following the manufacturer's instructions, on a 96-well tissue culture plate. 4000 cells/well were plated in the assay. Plates were read for absorbance on VESAMax plate scanner at wavelengths 570 nm (measure) and 650 nm (background). Nonradioactive AKT Kinase Assay—Cells were plated in 100-mm plates and subjected to serum starvation. After 24 h of incubation with either PBS or human platelet SPARC (2 μg/ml), cell lysates were prepared. Equal protein was incubated with a glycogen synthase kinase 3-α/β (GSK3) fusion protein per the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling). The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and hybridized. Chemiluminescence was used to detect the phosphorylated GSK3α/β protein. Statistical Analysis—Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used in all analyses (27Kaplan E.L. Meier P. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1958; 53: 457-481Crossref Scopus (48517) Google Scholar). SPARC Expression Is Associated with Increased Cellular Survival in Serum-free Conditions—Glioma cells that express SPARC exhibit differences relative to parental cells in cellular morphology and growth on different substrates in low serum conditions (22Vadlamuri S.V. Media J. Sankey S.S. Nakeff A. Divine G. Rempel S.A. Neuro-oncol. 2003; 5: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have characterized previously the impact of SPARC expression in several glioma cell lines, and we found a consistent increase in invasion measures both in immunocompromised rodents and in Matrigel invasion assays but little impact of SPARC expression on cellular proliferation or apoptosis in standard culturing conditions (15Rich J.N. Shi Q. Hjelmeland M. Cummings T.J. Kuan C.T. Bigner D.D. Counter C.M. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15951-15957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We serendipitously found that glioma cell lines expressing SPARC survived better relative to control cell lines when left unfed for prolonged periods (data not shown). Therefore, we examined the response of glioma cultures expressing SPARC to withdrawal of serum relative to vector controls. In each cell line tested (the genetically defined human glioma cell line (THR) as well as cell lines derived from patient specimens (D54MG and U87MG)), we consistently observed greater numbers of cells in SPARC-expressing cell lines in serum-free conditions relative to vector control cell lines (Fig. 1). The increase in cell number associated with SPARC expression may be due to increased cellular proliferation or resistance to cell death. Pulsed incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was used to determine the percentage of cells undergoing DNA replication. All cell lines had very low proliferative indices upon serum starvation, but we found no relative difference between SPARC and vector control cell lines (data not shown). In contrast, flow cytometric measurement of cellular apoptosis by annexin V levels in serum-free conditions revealed a consistent decrease in apoptosis with SPARC expression across each glioma line tested (Fig. 2). Cell cycle analysis of glioma cell lines expressing SPARC or vector control was performed using propidium iodide labeled flow cytometric analysis. We confirmed the decrease in apoptotic index with SPARC expression in each cell line as measured by the sub-G0 fraction, but the remaining cell cycle fractions displayed no relative differences between one another (data not shown). In sum, these results suggest that glioma cells expressing SPARC are resistant to apoptosis induced upon withdrawal of growth factors contained in serum.Fig. 2Glioma cell lines expressing SPARC display resistance to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. 100,000 glioma cells infected with a control retroviral vector (VEC) or a vector encoding SPARC (SP) were plated into triplicate wells of 6-well tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS and serum-starved after 24 h growth. Cells were collected at specific time points and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide per the manufacturer's suggestions (Pharmingen), and annexin V positive/propidium iodide negative or positive cells were quantified by flow cytometric analysis. A–C, representative plots and average annexin V positive-PI negative percentages are displayed.

BrdUrd labeling showed no differences between VEC and SP cell sublines (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SPARC Expression Leads to Increased AKT Phosphorylation in Serum-free Conditions—The underlying mechanisms by which serum may increase cell survival continue to be elucidated. Serum treatment induces activation of several growth factor receptors, recruitment of intracellular signaling mediators to the internal surface of the cell membrane, and initiation of pathways regulating apoptosis. Prominently, PI3K and the downstream effector protein kinase B/AKT are activated in response to serum and decrease the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins (28Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Like many cancers, malignant gliomas display increased AKT activation through activity of growth factor receptors or loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (30Haas-Kogan D. Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1195-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Knobbe C.B. Reifenberger G.

The THR cell line expresses a wild type PTEN, whereas D54MG expresses a PTEN protein with deletion of exons 3–9, and U87MG does not express PTEN protein (data not shown). 2B. K. A. Rasheed, personal communication. AKT has been linked not only to apoptotic resistance but also to increased tumor cell invasion (33Kubiatowski T. Jang T. Lachyankar M.B. Salmonsen R. Nabi R.R. Quesenberry P.J. Litofsky N.S. Ross A.H. Recht L.D. J. Neurosurg. 2001; 95: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Kim D. Kim S. Koh H. Yoon S.O. Chung A.S. Cho K.S. Chung J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1953-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Thus, AKT appeared to be an excellent potential downstream target of SPARC as both SPARC and AKT mediate tumor invasion and resistance to apoptosis. Indeed, glioma cell lines expressing SPARC displayed increased phosphorylation of a key activating residue of AKT (Ser-473) relative to vector cells in the absence of serum (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the phosphorylation of the proproliferative extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1 and-2 (ERK1/2) did not differ between the control and SPARC cell lines (Fig. 3A), suggesting a specific relationship between SPARC and AKT. These findings provide further explanation for the selective impact of SPARC expression on resistance to apoptosis with a lack of proliferative advantage that we have demonstrated. SPARC Expression Associates with Decreased Executor Caspase Activity—Caspases are cysteine proteases that play critical roles as effectors of apoptotic cell death (35Salvesen G.S. Abrams J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As SPARC expression is associated with a decrease in apoptosis, we expected that SPARC expression would be associated with decreased caspase activity. Indeed, glioma cell lines under serum-starved conditions that constitutively overexpress SPARC displayed significantly lower levels of cleaved (active) caspase 3 and one of its common substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase on Western analysis (Fig. 3C). As further confirmation, glioma cell lines expressing SPARC in the absence of serum also exhibit decreased caspase activity of the executor caspases 3 and 7 using a fluorescent caspase 3/7 substrate assay (Fig. 3D). SPARC Treatment Acutely Induces AKT Phosphorylation— Although we have shown that glioma cell lines that constitutively express SPARC express increased AKT phosphorylation, we sought to define whether the impact of SPARC on AKT is a primary effect or is secondary to other cellular effects of long term SPARC expression. Therefore, we examined the effect of exogenous human SPARC purified from platelets on AKT phosphorylation of the parental glioma cell lines (THR, D54MG, and U87MG) from which our engineered cell lines were derived. SPARC induced a rapid phosphorylation of AKT in 2–10 min on Western analysis depending on which cell line was examined (Fig. 4A), suggesting that extracellular SPARC initiates the activity of signal transduction pathways that result in AKT activation. Corresponding to our findings with cell lines constitutively expressing SPARC, we found that exogenously administered SPARC had no impact on ERK phosphorylation (data not shown). AKT phosphorylation in response to exogenous SPARC was self-limited, returning to near base-line levels in 60–240 min (Fig. 4A and data not shown) in a manner reminiscent of that of ligand-receptor signaling. As SPARC can bind or influence several growth factor receptor pathways, we examined critical phosphorylating events in several mitogenic growth factor receptor pathways commonly active in malignant gliomas. We found that EGFR, IGF1R, and PDGFRβ were not phosphorylated on Western analysis in response to exogenous SPARC treatment rapidly enough or to a sufficient degree to explain the rapid induction of AKT phosphorylation (data not shown). Recent reports suggest that SPARC may activate key intracellular mediators of the transforming growth factor-β pathway, including SMAD3 (36Schiemann B.J. Neil J.R. Schiemann W.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3977-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but we found only a slow and modest induction of phosphorylation of SMAD2 and nuclear localization of SMAD3 in U87MG or D54MG in response to exogenous SPARC treatment (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that SPARC activates AKT by direct activation of these growth factor receptors that are frequently linked to glioma pathophysiology. SPARC induces AKT phosphorylation at low doses, suggesting the specificity of this effect (Fig. 4B). Exogenous SPARC treatment also induced an increase in AKT kinase activity as measured by a nonradioactive kinase assay measuring the phosphorylation state of an AKT substrate, GSK3α/β, after AKT immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4C). As SPARC prepared from different tissues are differentially glycosylated (37Kaufmann B. Muller S. Hanisch F.G. Hartmann U. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Zaucke F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with potential functional differences as a result, we validated that human SPARC prepared ei"

Both transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are important profibrotic growth factors, which interact in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. In this study, we demonstrate that CTGF alone has no influence on myofibroblast transformation and fibronectin secretion in kidney interstitial fibroblasts, whereas incubation of CTGF in combination with TGFbeta1 enhanced TGFbeta1 responses, including myofibroblast activation, de novo expression of alpha-SMA, and extracellular accumulation of fibronectin. CTGF induced tryrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP) in fibroblasts, and the LRP-antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP) inhibited CTGF-induced tryrosine phosphorylation of LRP. Inhibition of LRP signaling reduced CTGF-mediated synergistic induction of alpha-SMA protein. Furthermore, the potentiating action of CTGF was neither dependent on modulation of TGFbeta1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and its association with Smad4, nor did it result from nuclear accumulation of activated Smad2. When TGFbeta1-pretreated fibroblasts were incubated with CTGF, activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling was observed. Inhibition of ERK activation by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 was associated with a reduction of CTGF-promoted alpha-SMA protein expression. Our in vitro studies provide evidence that CTGF potentiates TGFbeta1-mediated myofibroblast differentiation and activates differentiated myofibroblasts."

Overexpression of PGC-1α will induce the expression of CPT-Iα in the liver suggesting that PGC-1α stimulates fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria in the liver (25Lin J. Tarr P.T. Yang R. Rhee J.

It has been reported that PGC-1α expression is rapidly increased following T3 administration of hypothyroid animals (26Weitzel J.M. Radtke C. Seitz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5148-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is elevated in situations in which hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and CPT-Iα activity are increased (27Louet J.F. Hayhurst G. Gonzalez F.J. Girard J. Decaux J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37991-38000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In these studies, we have addressed the question of whether PGC-1α is a coactivator in the T3 induction of the CPT-Iα gene. Our data demonstrate that PGC-1α is a coactivator for T3 in the liver and that PGC-1α is associated with the CPT-Iα gene in response to T3 administration. Transient Transfection of Luciferase Vectors—CPT-Iα-luciferase constructs (CPT-Iα-luc) were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells by the calcium phosphate method (10Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transfections included 2 μg of CPT-Iα-luciferase along with RSV-thyroid hormone receptor β (RSV-TRβ) and TK-Renilla vectors. Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no serum. Cells were treated with 100 nm T3 for 24 h. After T3 treatment, cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Both luciferase and Renilla activity were measured. Protein content in each lysate was determined by Bio-Rad Protein assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity was corrected for both protein content and Renilla activity to account for cell density and transfection efficiency, respectively. Primary rat hepatocytes were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as we have done previously (28Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Transfections included 1 μg of CPT-Iα-luciferase and 0.1 μg of TK-Renilla. Luciferase assays were performed exactly as described above. COS-7 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of Gal4-PGC-1α using Lipofectamine 2000. Construction of the CPT-Iα-luciferase vectors was described previously (10Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Gal4-PGC-1α expression vectors were created by generating fragments of the PGC-1α cDNA by PCR amplification. The forward primers contained a BamHI restriction site, and the reverse primers contained an MluI restriction site. The PCR products were cut with the appropriate enzymes and cloned into the pM-Gal4 expression vector (BD Biosciences). The forward primer for the 3′-truncated Gal4-PGC-1α (1–140, 1–210, 1–410, and 1–797 aa) was ggggatccggatggcttgggacatgtgcag.

The forward primer for the 5′-truncated PGC-1α-(200–797) was ggggatccagccacaaagacgtccctgctc. The LKKLL amino acid sequence in PGC-1α was changed to AKKAL using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The forward primer was gccgtctctagcaaagaaggccttactggcacc, and the reverse primer was ggtgccagtaaggccttctttgctagagacggc. The sequence of all vectors was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the University of Tennessee Molecular Resource Center. Real Time PCR—RNA was extracted from primary rat hepatocytes using RNA-Stat-60 (Tel-Test) as described previously (9Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 217-224Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mRNA abundance was measured by real time PCR. The RNA was initially treated with DNase I (2 units) at 37 °C for 40 min. DNase I was stopped by addition of DNase Inactivation Reagent. Equal amounts of DNA-free RNA were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. RNA was mixed with 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix and 1 μl of random hexamers (50 ng/μl). Each sample was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then placed on ice for at least 1 min. Next, 2 μl of 10× RT buffer, 4.5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor was added to each tube. After being incubated at 25 °C for 2 min, each tube was loaded with 1 μl of SuperScript II RT. The tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, at 42 °C for 1 h, and at 70 °C for 15 min. RNase H was added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The parameters for real time PCR are as follows: 95 °C for 2.5 min, 95 °C for 8.5 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C 30 s and 60 °C 1 min. A DNA dissociation curve was executed that consisted of 100 cycles of 10 s from 60 to 100 °C in 0.4 °C increments. The first derivative of this DNA dissociation curve was plotted to show peaks for each target amplified. The final concentration of primers in each well in the PCR plates was 0.1 μm. The sequences of the primers are provided in Table I. The oligonucleotide standards were diluted to 10–9, 10–8, 10–7, 10–6, and 10–5 μm and used as templates for each standard curve. A 1:500 dilution of each cDNA as template was used to measure 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and 1 μl of 1:10 or 1:20 dilution of each cDNA was used as a template to assess target genes. The 18 S rRNA normalized all results. The primer sequences of pM-Gal4 DNA binding domain used in real time PCR were the forward primer gctcaagtgctccaaagaaa and the reverse primer gtagcgacactcccagttgt.Table IThe following primers were used for real time PCR to quantitate mRNA abundancePGC-1α FPATGAATGCAGCGGTCTTAGCPGC-1α RPAACAATGGCAGGGTTTGTTCCPT-Iα +291FPCGGTTCAAGAATGGCATCATCCTP-Iα +366RPTCACACCCACCACCACGATCTP-Iβ +547FPCAAACATCACTGCCCAAGCTTCPT-Iβ +620RPGGCCGCACAGAATCCAAGT18 S RNA +452 FPCGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA18 S RNA +524 RPTTTTCGTCACTACCTCCCCG Open table in a new tab Western Analysis—Western analysis was performed on whole cell extracts prepared by lysis in PD buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 6 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and diluted protease inhibitor mixture; P8340, Sigma). The cells were sonicated five times at a setting of 5 in a 100-watt Microson sonicator (Misonix XL2000). The cell membranes were removed by centrifugation for 25 min at 4 °C. An equal amount of protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a 0.45-μm pure nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were immunoblotted with primary antibodies (anti-PGC-1α, sc-13067, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (170-6515, Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were identified using Super Signal West Femto Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce). The ChemiDoc™ XRS gel documentation system (Bio-Rad) with Quantity One software was used to quantify the immunoreactive proteins. Actin was used as the loading control for each lane. The primary antibody was monoclonal mouse anti-actin IgM, and goat anti-mouse IgM was the secondary antibody (CP01, Oncogene). Western analysis of the Gal4-PGC-1 fusion proteins was conducted with a 1:250 dilution of the mouse monoclonal antibody to Gal4 (DNA binding domain) (RK5C1) (sc-510, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (170-6156, Bio-Rad). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—The ChIP assays were performed as follows. Rat primary hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (28Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rat primary hepatocytes (3 × 106 in 60-mm dishes) were maintained for 12 h in priming media of RPMI 1640 and charcoal-stripped 10% fetal bovine serum (28Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 100 nm T3 for 24 h. Cross-linking was performed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 125 mm glycine to each plate for 5 min. Cross-linked hepatocytes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped from the plate and collected by centrifuging for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixtures (P8340, Sigma). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed once, and the nuclear pellet was collected by centrifugation again at 4000 rpm for 5 min. Then nuclear pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitor mixtures and incubated on ice for 10 min. The pellets were sonicated nine times for 30 s at 1-min intervals (with Branson sonifier 250-watt, 2-mm microtip setting 7), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing the DNA-protein complex was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors. The samples were precleared with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, 50% slurry (16-157, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was incubated with 5–10 μg of anti-PGC-1α (sc-13067, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetylated histone H3 (06-599, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-acetylated histone H4 (06-599, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the control. To collect the antibody-protein-DNA complex, 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry was added for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was washed one time with 1.0 ml of each of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl); high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl); LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1); followed by two 1-ml washes with 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer. Precipitates were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), and 0.3 m NaCl was added to reverse cross-links at 65 °C for overnight. DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water, 4 μl of Tris, pH 6.8, 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K. After incubation at 45 °C for 1 h, genomic DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick spin columns (28104, Qiagen). A total of 2–5 μl of purified sample was used in 25–35 cycles of PCR. Primers for regions of the target genes are listed in Table II. The PCR products were analyzed on 2% Nusieve 3:1 agarose (Cambrex, 50094) and visualized with MultiImage Light Cabinet with Quantity One software. The relative intensity of the bands was determined using Bio-Rad Quantity One software.Table IIThe following primers were used for the ChIP assay to demonstrate interactions of PGC-1α with the CPT-Iα geneRat CPT-Iα TRE primersFP:-3079/-3056GACAGGCAGGGTACATTTCACAGRP:-2802/-2825GAAGGCAGTGCTTTTCCCTACRat CPT-Iα intron I primersFP:+674/+693AGACTGCTCAAGGTCGCGCTRP:+907/+927GAGAGTCCTGAGCCTGATTGTRat CPT-Iα upstream promoter primersFP:-6473/-6450CTCTGGTGTCCTGTAACCTGTGGRP:-6076/-6099GAAGGCTGGAATTACACTGGTCAGRat PEPCK primersFP:-512/-493AACTCGGCTGTTGCAGACTTRP:-286/-267CATCAGCAACAGTCACGGTC Open table in a new tab Our first experiments examined the effect of thyroid hormone (T3) on the abundance of PGC-1α mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with T3 for 24 h and then RNA was isolated. The mRNA abundance was determined by real time PCR. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the PGC-1α mRNA abundance was increased 4.5 ± 0.4-fold by T3 in hepatocytes, and the CPT-Iα mRNA abundance was increased 3.3 ± 0.4-fold by T3. We also examined the effect of T3 on PGC-1α mRNA abundance in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Previously, we had found that CPT-Iα mRNA abundance was not increased in the heart of hyperthyroid rats (5Cook G.A. Edwards T.L. Jansen M.S. Bahouth S.W. Wilcox H. Park E.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The CPT-Iβ and CPT-Iα mRNA levels were not altered by T3 administration in ventricular myocytes. In addition, PGC-1α levels did not change in the ventricular myocytes (data not shown). These data indicate that T3 can increase PGC-1α mRNA abundance in the liver but not in the heart and suggest that T3 induces PGC-1α in a tissue-specific manner. Next, we tested whether PGC-1α protein abundance was increased in response to T3 administration in rat hepatocytes. By using Western analyses to assess PGC-1α levels, we found that the PGC-1α protein abundance was increased 2.3 ± 0.3-fold in response to T3 (Fig. 1B). These experiments indicate that the PGC-1α is a T3-responsive gene and raise the possibility that it is a coactivator in T3 action. Our next experiments examined the ability of PGC-1α to enhance the T3 induction of CPT-Iα. We conducted cotransfections of CPT-Iα-luc and pSV-PGC-1α in HepG2 hepatoma cells. By using transient transfections in HepG2 cells, we had previously found that the first intron was required for the full induction by T3 of the CPT-Iα gene (10Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by introducing CPT-Iα luciferase vectors with or without the first intron into transgenic mice (12Jackson-Hayes L. Song S. Lavrentyev E.N. Jansen M.S. Hillgartner F.B. Tian L. Wood P.A. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7964-7972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HepG2 hepatoma cells were transfected with –4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luc or –4495/+19 CPT-Iα-luc. The –4495/+1240 luciferase vector contains the first intron and a portion of exon 2, whereas the –4495/+19 luciferase vector does not (Fig. 2). Addition of T3 stimulated the –4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luc gene 8.2 ± 0.6-fold. In these experiments, overexpression of PGC-1α induced the CPTIα-luc vector 8.6 ± 0.9-fold. When T3 was added in the presence of PGC-1α, we obtained a 40.6 ± 6.2-fold induction. Without the intron, PGC-1α was only able to increase –4495/+19 CPTIα-luc 1.4 ± 0.2-fold, and the T3 induction was reduced by half. In the absence of the intron, T3 and PGC-1 stimulate the CPT-Iα-luc vector additively. These data indicate that PGC-1α stimulates CPT-Iα primarily through the first intron but, more importantly, that PGC-1α is a coactivator for the T3 induction of the CPT-Iα gene. The first intron is required for both the T3 and PGC-1α effects on CPT-Iα. We ligated two copies of an idealized TRE in front of the enhancerless SV40 promoter. PGC-1α induced this reporter vector modestly and enhanced the strong induction by T3. To test whether PGC-1α also enhanced the T3 response in hepatocytes, we conducted transfections in primary rat hepatocytes. In the absence of cotransfected TRβ, T3 induced the –4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luc vector 3.6 ± 0.3-fold (Fig. 3). Overexpression of PGC-1α only increased the reporter gene 1.9 ± 0.5-fold. PGC-1α may have a larger effect on basal expression of CPT-Iα-luc in HepG2 cells because HepG2 cells do not express PGC-1α. Most interestingly, when T3 was added in the presence of PGC-1α, the luciferase gene was synergistically induced 19 ± 4.5-fold. These results confirm our hypothesis that PGC-1α is a coactivator in the thyroid hormone regulation of CPT-Iα. Overexpression of TRβ slightly increased the T3 induction of CPT-Iα-luciferase to 4.4 ± 0.3, but the stimulation by T3 and PGC-1α was increased to 38.1 ± 10.1 (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that T3 and PGC-1α act synergistically to stimulate CPT-Iα gene expression in both HepG2 cells and rat hepatocytes. Our next experiments were designed to identify domains of PGC-1α that were required for the T3 stimulation of gene expression. Our initial experiments defined important domains for the stimulation of basal expression. We created a series of mammalian expre"

Here, we show that the synergism of TRAIL and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cross-sensitization between TRAIL and 5-FU for induction of apoptosis, entirely depend on Bax proficiency in human DU145 and HCT116 carcinoma cells. DU145 prostate carcinoma cells that have lost Bax protein expression due to mutation fail to release cytochrome c and to activate caspase-3 and -9 when exposed to TRAIL and 5-FU. In contrast, TRAIL sensitized for 5-FU-induced apoptosis and vice versa upon reconstitution of Bax expression. Isobolographic analyses of ED50 doses for 5-FU at increasing TRAIL concentrations showed a clear synergism of TRAIL and 5-FU in Bax-expressing cells. In contrast, the effect was merely additive in DU145 cells lacking Bax. Notably, both DU145 and HCT116 Bax-deficient cells still express Bak. This indicates that Bak is not sufficient to mediate cross-sensitization and synergism between 5-FU and TRAIL. Stable overexpression of Bak in DU145 sensitized for epirubicin-induced apoptosis but failed to confer synergy between TRAIL and 5-FU. Moreover, we show by the use of EGFP-tagged Bax and Bak that TRAIL and 5-FU synergistically trigger oligomerization and clustering of Bax but not Bak. These data clearly establish distinct roles for Bax and Bak in linking the TRAIL death receptor pathway to the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling cascade and delineate a higher degree of specificity in signaling for cell death by multidomain Bcl-2 homologs."

A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of fatty acid transport studies is hampered by the fact that, once inside cells, fatty acids are rapidly metabolized. Metabolism will decrease the intracellular concentration of the unesterified fatty acid, shifting the concentration gradient across the plasma membrane to promote entry of additional fatty acids into the cell. The design of most transport studies does not distinguish between transport mechanisms that can occur in a protein-free phospholipid bilayer and transport plus metabolism. Independent of studies on FATP and its potential role in fatty acid transport, Hashimoto and co-workers (10Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) used classical protein purification methods to isolate the first enzyme capable of activating very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; fatty acids containing more than 22 carbons). This enzyme with very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSVL) 3In 2004, the nomenclature for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases was officially revised (43Mashek D.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Coleman R.A. Berger J. Bernlohr D.A. Black P. DiRusso C.C. Farber S.A. Guo W. Hashimoto N. Khodiyar V. Kuypers F.A. Maltais L.J. Nebert D.W. Renieri A. Schaffer J.E. Stahl A. Watkins P.A. Vasiliou V. Yamamoto T.T. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1958-1961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The root designation “ACS” for acyl-CoA synthetase is followed by “L” for long-chain and a number. A similar convention for the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, designated ACSVLx, is used in this paper. Genes are designated Acsvl, and proteins are designated ACSVL. activity was purified to homogeneity from rat liver peroxisomes, a known source of ACSVL activity. Sequencing of peptide fragments obtained from proteolytic digestion of this protein led to cloning of full-length Acsvl1 cDNA (11Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo M. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Translation of the cDNA sequence revealed that the protein with the highest amino acid identity to ACSVL1 was not one of the five long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases but rather the protein now known as FATP1. ACSVL1 contains two highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs (12Watkins P.A. Pevsner J. Steinberg S.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 323-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Motif 1 is an AMP-binding domain common to all known acyl-CoA synthetases and related enzymes whose reaction mechanism involves formation of an adenylated intermediate (14Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.H. Liang P.H. Dunawaymariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The second motif overlaps the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase “signature motif” described by Black and co-workers (15Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); this motif is thought to be critical for binding of the fatty acid substrate. We and others identified five proteins that are highly homologous to ACSVL1 in the regions containing motifs 1 and 2 (9Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12Watkins P.A. Pevsner J. Steinberg S.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent.

The six members of the ACSVL family are identical to the six members of the FATP family (Table I). A fundamental unanswered question is whether these proteins are acyl-CoA synthetases, fatty acid transporters, or bifunctional proteins with both activities. Several laboratories have now demonstrated that at least four ACSVL/FATP proteins have acyl-CoA synthetase activity (18Herrmann T. Buchkremer F. Gosch I. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. Stremmel W. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We now report that a fifth member of the murine protein family, ACSVL3 or FATP3, is also an acyl-CoA synthetase capable of activating both long- and very long-chain fatty acid substrates. We further report that endogenous ACSVL3 does not exhibit fatty acid transport activity. In addition, the expression pattern of this protein suggests that it may play an important role in brain development.Table IACSVL/FATP nomenclatureACS nomenclatureFATP nomenclatureApproved gene symbolOther aliasesACSVL1FATP2Slc27a2VLCS, VLACSACSVL2FATP6Slc27a6VLCS-H1ACSVL3FATP3Slc27a3ACSBFATP5Slc27a5BACS, VLCS-H2, VLACSRFATP1Slc27a1FATP4Slc27a4 Open table in a new tab Materials and General Methods—[1-14C]Palmitic acid (C16:0) and [1-14C]lignoceric acid (C24:0) were obtained from Moravek, Inc.

COS-7 cells and Neuro2a cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. MA-10 cells (23Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Mario Ascoli (University of Iowa) and were maintained in Waymouth's medium containing 15% horse serum. DNA sequencing was performed either at MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) or at the Johns Hopkins University Department of Biological Chemistry Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility using the fluorescent dideoxy terminator method of cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 377 automated DNA sequencer, following ABI protocols. General conditions for PCR were as reported (19Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Confocal microscopy was performed at the Microscope Facility, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. Subcellular fractionation of MA-10 cells was performed as previously described (25Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z. Li Y. Steinberg S.J. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47070-47078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Mouse Acsvl3 cDNA—The expressed sequence tag (EST) division of GenBank™ (26Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) was queried using the murine cDNA sequences for two members of the Acsvl family, GenBank™ accession numbers AJ223958 and AJ223959, as probes. Several EST clones representing homologous but distinct cDNAs, including Acsvl3, were identified. The contig formed when Acsvl3 ESTs were aligned and joined was incomplete. To obtain additional 5′ and 3′ cDNA sequence, RACE protocols were carried out. For 3′-RACE, oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAGCCAGTGCCGGGGTACCTCTCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CATCTTCACCTCTGGCACTACTGGCCTGC-3′ were used as nested primers in combination with adaptor primers (AP-1 and AP-2; Clontech) and a murine brain RACE library as template. A combination of 5′-RACE and genome primer walking were used to obtain cDNA sequence containing the putative start codon and 5′-untranslated region. For genome walking, a murine genomic DNA library (Clontech) and nested gene-specific primers 5′-GTCCTGCTGGTGGACTCCACACAGATG-3′ and 5′-AGCACGAGCGCACTCGCACCGCAGGCT-3′ were used in combination with AP-1 and AP-2. For 5′-RACE, nested primers 5′-CCAGCGCAGCTGAGGCCAGACGTCTA-3′ and 5′-GAGGGCCGCCATGGTGCCCTTTTCCTC-3′, along with AP-1 and AP-2, were used with a murine embryonal RACE library (Clontech) as template. For expression studies, the Acsvl3 cDNA open reading frame was amplified from a murine liver cDNA library by PCR using forward primer 5′-CTAGAGGAAAAGGGCACCATGGCGGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGCCCCTCCCTCAAGTGGAAGGATT-3′ and was T/A cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The Acsvl3 cDNA sequence has been deposited in the EMBL nucleotide sequence data base (accession number AJ577573). A partial amino acid sequence of ACSVL3 was previously published (3Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 9Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Genomic sequence information was partially derived by genomic primer walking as well as by in silico analysis of the mouse genome probed with the Acsvl3 cDNA sequence using either the BLAST algorithm, available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/MmBlast.html, or the BLAT algorithm, available on the World Wide Web at genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat. The official gene symbol for Acsvl3 is Slc27a3 (solute carrier family 27, member 3). Antibody Production and Affinity Purification—To produce polyclonal antiserum to ACSVL3, a glutathione S-transferase/ACSVL3 fusion protein was produced. An EST (GenBank™ accession number AA458592) encoding the carboxyl-terminal portion of human ACSVL3 was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium and digested with EcoRI and NotI. The resulting 683-bp fragment, which encodes the C-terminal 175 amino acids of the human ortholog of ACSVL3, was cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX5X1 (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting construct was transfected into Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3, and protein expression was induced for 5 h at 37 °C following the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and the fusion protein solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunization and bleeding of rabbits was done by a commercial firm (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). For affinity purification of the antibody, the fusion protein was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. The fusion protein in sample buffer was loaded into a single large well and electrophoresed for 5 min, after which a second aliquot of protein was loaded. This process was repeated three more times before allowing electrophoresis to proceed to completion. After transfer to nitrocellulose, proteins were identified by staining with Ponceau-S, and a membrane strip containing the five protein bands was excised and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Crude antiserum was diluted 5-fold with PBS and incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, bound antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The eluate was immediately neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the buffer was exchanged back to PBS using a Centricon 30 (Millipore Corp.). Affinity-purified antibody was stored at -80 °C in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The specificity of the purified antibody for ACSVL3 was determined by Western blot analysis of COS-1 cells overexpressing each of the six ACSVL/FATP family members and two acyl-CoA synthetases belonging to two other families, ACSL6 and BG1. Only mouse or human ACSVL3 was detected by the purified antibody (Fig. 1). Northern Analysis—For tissue expression of Acsvl3, total RNA was prepared using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from freshly harvested tissues from adult (∼3-month-old) mice. Twenty micrograms of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel at 4 V/cm for 2.5 h and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA probe for detection of Acsvl3 mRNA was prepared by excision of a 1196-bp fragment corresponding to bp 405–1601 using Eco47III and BspeI. For control, a 528-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was prepared by PCR amplification using 5′-ACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGTGTAGCCCAGGATGC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and mouse brain cDNA as template. Conditions for probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were as previously described (20Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For developmental analysis of Acsvl3 expression, a Northern blot was prepared from 1–2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA as previously described (24Fraisl P. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For this blot, the probe consisted of 1315 nucleotides corresponding to bp 807–2121 of Acsvl3 cDNA. As a control for loading and transfer, the blot was probed with a mouse cDNA of the ubiquitously expressed protein cyclophilin. RT-PCR Analysis—Approximately 2 μg of total cellular RNA (extracted as described above) was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences RT-PCR system with forward primer 5′-AATGCCCAGGGGCACTGCATGACCACAT-3′ (within exon 6; see Table II) and reverse primer 5′-ATTCGAAGGTCTCCAGACAGGAGGGCA-3′ (within exon 10). The primer combination was selected such that a 634-bp Acsvl3-specific product can be amplified from cDNA but not from genomic DNA, potentially contaminating the RNA extracts. RT-PCR was performed under conditions not allowing quantitative analysis. As a positive control, RT-PCR of a 680-bp fragment of the ubiquitously expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA using forward primer 5′-ACTGGCGTCTTCACCACCAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ was performed on the same cDNA preparations.Table IIIntron/exon structure of the mouse Acsvl3 geneExon/intronExonIntronNucleotide position in cDNAaThe A of the initiation codon (ATG) is designated +1Splice acceptorExon boundarySplice donorbpbpbp1756272-137 to +619...

(Germantown, NY) and housed in facilities of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Animals were housed under controlled conditions, between 22 and 27 °C, on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national and international laws and policies (47U. S. National Research Council NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. U.S. National Research Council, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar). Antibodies, Indirect Immunofluorescence, Direct Immunofluorescence, and Immunohistochemistry—Polyclonal antiserum to the peroxisomal protein PMP70 was a gift from Dr. S. Gould. Monoclonal antibody to the endoplasmic reticulum marker, protein-disulfide isomerase, and polyclonal antibody to the mitochondrial marker, Mn-superoxide dismutase, were from Stressgen, and polyclonal antibody to a plasma membrane marker, E-cadherin, was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibody to BG1 was affinity-purified as previously described (25Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z. Li Y. Steinberg S.J. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47070-47078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 1.0% Triton X-100 prior to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies as described previously (27Watkins P.A. Gould S.J. Smith M.A. Braiterman L.T. Wei H-M. Kok F. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 292-301PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were incubated following the manufacturer's instructions with MitoTracker red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) before fixation. Because affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to ACSVL3 and BG1 were both raised in rabbits, double-labeling studies done by sequential application of antibodies resulted in an unacceptable level of nonspecific binding of fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies. Therefore, these antibodies were also directly labeled using Zenon™ Rabbit IgG Labeling reagents (Molecular Probes). Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 488 reagents were used to fluorescently label ACSVL3 and BG1 antibodies, respectively, following the manufacturer's protocol. For direct immunofluorescence, cells were incubated concurrently with both antibodies, washed extensively with PBS, fixed again with 4% formaldehyde, washed, and mounted. Control experiments containing labeling reagents prepared without either ACSVL3 or BG1 antibody resulted in no nonspecific labeling when used in conjunction with the opposite directly labeled antibody. For immunohistochemistry, tissues from 3-month-old mice were harvested, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Tissue sections were cut using a cryostat and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described previously (28Mihalik S.J. Steinberg S.J. Pei Z. Park J. Kim D.G. Heinzer A.K. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Cuebas D.A. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24771-24779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Brain sections were 20 μm thick; sections of adrenal gland, testis, and ovary were 5–8 μm thick. After fixation, sections were incubated for 30 min with 0.6% H2O2 in methanol followed by 20 min with 5% normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated sequentially with Avidin D and biotin, 15 min each (Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit; Vector Laboratories). Incubation with primary rabbit antibody (affinity-purified anti-hACSVL3 antibody; 1:100) was for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Peroxidase-based detection was done using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). After counterstaining with hematoxylin-Harris stain for 30 s, sections were dehydrated and mounted with DPX mounting solution (Fluka Biochemika). RNA Interference—Four pairs of cDNA oligonucleotides containing complementary sense and antisense Acsvl3 sequences were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and used to synthesize small interfering RNA 21-mers (siRNA) using the Silencer kit (Ambion) as previously described (25Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z. Li Y. Steinberg S.J. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47070-47078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Targeted sequences of siRNA constructs 1–4 corresponded to bp 55–75, 695–715, 1243–1263, and 1855–1875, respectively, of the Acsvl3 coding region. MA-10 cells were transfected with the individual siRNA constructs or a mixture of all four, essentially as described (25Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z. Li Y. Steinberg S.J. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47070-47078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that cells were incubated with siRNA for only 12 h prior to the addition of the usual culture medium. Acyl-CoA Synthetase and Fatty Acid Uptake Assays—Acyl-CoA synthetase assays utilizing radiolabeled palmitic acid (C16:0) and lignoceric acid (C24:0) were performed as previously described (29Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Mihalik S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fatty acid uptake assays were similar to those described by Trotter et al. (31Trotter P.J. Ho S.Y. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 336-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling solution was prepared by adding unlabeled plus [9,10-3H]palmitic acid in ethanol to a solution of 100 μm fatty acid-poor bovine serum albumin in PBS such that the final fatty acid concentration was 100 μm (5 μCi/ml) and the final ethanol concentration was 0.5%. MA-10 cells in 60-mm culture dishes were grown to confluence in Waymouth's medium containing 15% horse serum. Two hours before the assay, the medium was replaced with warm medium without serum. All subsequent procedures were carried out in a 37 °C room. After discarding the medium, cells were washed three times with warm PBS prior to the addition of 1 ml of warm labeling solution. Cells were incubated for the indicated time, at which point the labeling medium was aspirated and simultaneously replaced with ice-cold PBS. Dishes were placed on ice; cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 0.5 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris (Cl-), pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Bovine serum albumin, often used by other investigators to remove fatty acid nonspecifically bound to the cell surface, was intentionally absent from the cold PBS used to quench uptake and wash cells following uptake, since it has been demonstrated that fatty acid-poor albumin can extract fatty acids already transported into cells by promoting reversal of the flip-flop of unionized fatty acids across the plasma membrane (32Kamp F. Guo W. Souto R. Pilch P.F. Corkey B.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7988-7995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After removal of an aliquot of cell suspension for protein determination, radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cloning of Full-length Mouse Acsvl3 cDNA and Initial Characterization—Early evidence for the existence of ACSVL3 came from homology probing of the expressed sequence tag data base using the amino acid sequence of ACSVL1 as a probe. The highly conserved region now referred to as Motif 2 (12Watkins P.A. Pevsner J. Steinberg S.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent.

https://openalex.org/W2015615504,"DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are critical lesions for the mammalian cell since they affect both DNA strands and block transcription and replication. The repair of ICLs in the mammalian cell involves components of different repair pathways such as nucleotide-excision repair and the double-strand break/homologous recombination repair pathways. However, the mechanistic details of mammalian ICL repair have not been fully delineated. We describe here the complete coding sequence and the genomic organization of hSNM1B, one of at least three human homologs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PSO2 gene. Depletion of hSNM1B by RNA interference rendered cells hypersensitive to ICL-inducing agents. This requirement for hSNM1B in the cellular response to ICL has been hypothesized before but never experimentally verified. In addition, siRNA knockdown of hSNM1B rendered cells sensitive to ionizing radiation, suggesting the possibility of hSNM1B involvement in homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks arising as intermediates of ICL repair. Monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key step in the FANC/BRCA pathway, is not affected in hSNM1B-depleted HeLa cells, indicating that hSNM1B is probably not a part of the Fanconi anemia core complex. Nonetheless, similarities in the phenotype of hSNM1B-depleted cells and cultured cells from patients suffering from Fanconi anemia make hSNM1B a candidate for one of the as yet unidentified Fanconi anemia genes not involved in monoubiquitination of FANCD2."
https://openalex.org/W2035001706,"Chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular of complex I, has been strongly implicated in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the mechanisms of chronic complex I disruption-induced neurodegeneration, we induced differentiation of immortalized midbrain dopaminergic (MN9D) and non-dopaminergic (MN9X) neuronal cells, to maintain them in culture without significant cell proliferation and compared their survivals following chronic exposure to nanomolar rotenone, an irreversible complex I inhibitor. Rotenone killed more dopaminergic MN9D cells than non-dopaminergic MN9X cells. Oxidative stress played an important role in rotenone-induced neurodegeneration of MN9X cells, but not MN9D cells: rotenone oxidatively modified proteins more in MN9X cells than in MN9D cells and antioxidants decreased rotenone toxicity only in MN9X cells. MN9X cells were also more sensitive to exogenous oxidants than MN9D cells. In contrast, disruption of bioenergetics played a more important role in MN9D cells: rotenone decreased mitochondrial membrane protential and ATP levels in MN9D cells more than in MN9X cells. Supplementation of cellular energy with a ketone body, d-β-hydroxybutyrate, decreased rotenone toxicity in MN9D cells, but not in MN9X cells. MN9D cells were also more susceptible to disruption of oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis than MN9X cells. These findings indicate that, during chronic rotenone exposure, MN9D cells die primarily through mitochondrial energy disruption, whereas MN9X cells die primarily via oxidative stress. Thus, intrinsic properties of individual cell types play important roles in determining the predominant mechanism of complex I inhibition-induced neurodegeneration. Chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular of complex I, has been strongly implicated in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the mechanisms of chronic complex I disruption-induced neurodegeneration, we induced differentiation of immortalized midbrain dopaminergic (MN9D) and non-dopaminergic (MN9X) neuronal cells, to maintain them in culture without significant cell proliferation and compared their survivals following chronic exposure to nanomolar rotenone, an irreversible complex I inhibitor. Rotenone killed more dopaminergic MN9D cells than non-dopaminergic MN9X cells. Oxidative stress played an important role in rotenone-induced neurodegeneration of MN9X cells, but not MN9D cells: rotenone oxidatively modified proteins more in MN9X cells than in MN9D cells and antioxidants decreased rotenone toxicity only in MN9X cells. MN9X cells were also more sensitive to exogenous oxidants than MN9D cells. In contrast, disruption of bioenergetics played a more important role in MN9D cells: rotenone decreased mitochondrial membrane protential and ATP levels in MN9D cells more than in MN9X cells. Supplementation of cellular energy with a ketone body, d-β-hydroxybutyrate, decreased rotenone toxicity in MN9D cells, but not in MN9X cells. MN9D cells were also more susceptible to disruption of oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis than MN9X cells. These findings indicate that, during chronic rotenone exposure, MN9D cells die primarily through mitochondrial energy disruption, whereas MN9X cells die primarily via oxidative stress. Thus, intrinsic properties of individual cell types play important roles in determining the predominant mechanism of complex I inhibition-induced neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis underlying the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methylester; ANOVA, analysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methylester; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is not fully defined, but multiple lines of evidence implicate mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, defects in complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the substantia nigra and evidence of oxidative stress have been noted in the brains of PD patients (1Schapira A.H. Cooper J.M.

J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). PD is also associated with exposure to pesticides (3Menegon A. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Mellick G.D. Le Couteur D.G.

Rapid onset of Parkinsonism in young adults following injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (5Langston J.W. Ballard P. Tetrud J.W. Irwin I. Science. 1983; 219: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar) occurs through its active metabolite, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I (6Heikkila R.E. Manzino L. Cabbat F.S. Duvoisin R.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1985; 58: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), potentially by depleting energy stores and inducing oxidative stress (7Hasegawa E.

Epstein C.J. Cadet J.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Complex I is specifically and irreversibly inhibited by the neurotoxin rotenone, a hydrophobic pesticide epidemiologically linked to PD. Continuous, systemic, in vivo infusion of 2–3 mg/kg/day rotenone in rats over weeks produces relatively selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, with formation of ubiquitin- and α-synuclein-positive inclusions (9Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar, 10Sherer T.B. Kim J.H. Betarbet R. Greenamyre J.T. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This low dose paradigm results in about 75% inhibition of complex I activity, and corresponds to a brain concentration of 20–30 nm (9Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar, 10Sherer T.B. Kim J.H. Betarbet R. Greenamyre J.T. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). However, although these studies establish the principle that complex I dysfunction leads to degeneration in dopaminergic neurons, consistent levels of functional deficits related to complex I dysfunction have been difficult to reproduce (11Hoglinger G.U. Feger J. Prigent A. Michel P.P. Parain K. Champy P. Ruberg M. Oertel W.H. Hirsch E.C. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this in vivo model has not lent itself easily to the study of the mechanism of rotenone toxicity (12Perier C. Bove J. Vila M. Przedborski S. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 345-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, the use of primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons to study mechanisms of rotenone-induced neurodegeneration has been limited: short term, nanomolar rotenone administration in primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons does not produce selective dopaminergic damage (13Nakamura K. Bindokas V.P. Marks J.D. Wright D.A. Frim D.M. Miller R.J. Kang U.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, primary cultures contain a mixture of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons and therefore do not lend themselves to molecular and biochemical analyses. The use of existing cell lines to study the effects of chronic rotenone exposure (14Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7006-7015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also has shortcomings. Most cell lines do not exhibit robust dopaminergic phenotypes. In addition, the high rate of proliferation that characterize these cell lines confound the assessment of cellular susceptibility to rotenone, because proliferating cells may replace those that have succumbed to rotenone, and chronic exposure may lead to the selection of cells that become resistant to rotenone toxicity. To study the cellular mechanisms of rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, we therefore developed a novel cellular model derived from immortalized midbrain MN9D cells (15Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a dopaminergic neuronal cell line that has been extensively characterized as a model of dopaminergic neurons (16Castro D.S. Hermanson E. Joseph B. Wallen A. Aarnisalo P. Heller A. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43277-43284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Perez R.G. Waymire J.C.

Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Using sodium butyrate (NaBu) (20Kruh J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1982; 42: 65-82PubMed Google Scholar) to differentiate MN9D cells and cells from a related, immortalized, non-dopaminergic midbrain neuronal cell line (MN9X cells), we have produced dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cell cultures that can be maintained in vitro for weeks without proliferation. Using these cells, we compared cell degeneration induced by chronic, nanomolar rotenone treatment in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells. Because chronic rotenone exposure can induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have used this unique model to examine the roles of oxidative stress and bioenergetic disruption in the selective susceptibility of dopaminergic cells to rotenone neurodegeneration, processes that occur in the setting of chronic low-grade complex I inhibition. We find that this chronic low-grade complex I inhibition leads to cell degeneration by distinct mechanisms in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells. Production of Undifferentiated MN9 Cells—MN9 cells were generated by somatic fusion of dissociated neurons from the ventral midbrain of E14 C57BL/6J mice with the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase-deficient N18G2 neuroblastoma cell line after exposure to 50% polyethylene glycol and selection against HRPT-deficient cells by Choi et al. (15Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) at the University of Chicago and provided to us. Clones expressing dopamine were designated as MN9D and those with no dopamine were designated as MN9X. These cell lines have been extensively characterized previously (17Perez R.G. Waymire J.C. Lin E. Liu J.J. Guo F. Zigmond M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3090-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Differentiation of MN9 Cells—MN9 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY). We differentiated MN9 cells with 1 mm NaBu for 5–6 days. NaBu induces cell cycle arrest and morphological neural differentiation by inhibiting histone deacetylase (20Kruh J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1982; 42: 65-82PubMed Google Scholar). Morphological changes were observed within 2 days after the addition of NaBu by phase-contrast microscopy. Fresh media containing experimental compounds were fed every 2–3 days. High glucose (25 mm) media were used except as noted. Assessment of Cell Viability—For survival studies, 10,000 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate to achieve about 50% confluence. Cell survival was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), which contains a tetrazolium salt (WST-8) that produces a water-soluble formazan dye by NADH dehydrogenases in living cells. To measure cell viability, 10 μlof WST-8 assay solution was added to 100 μl of phenol red-free medium per well and incubated for 4 h. The optical density (OD) of the solution was read by a microplate reader, using a test wavelength at 450 nm and a reference wavelength at 650 nm. Cell Counting Kit-8 OD was directly proportional to the number of viable cells (n = 28, r = 1.000, p < 0.001). This assay was also validated with cell counts performed with trypan blue staining of cells after rotenone treatment for 7 days (n = 53, r = 0.878, p < 0.001). Measurement of Dopamine and Tetrahydrobiopterin Levels—For dopamine measurement, cells were pelleted and homogenized by sonication in 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm EDTA. The conditioned media were also treated with 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and supernatants were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (22Bencsics C. Wachtel S.R. Milstien S. Hatakeyama K. Becker J.B. Kang U.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4449-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our detection limit was around 0.3 × 10–5 pmol/cell of dopamine. For tetrahydrobiopterin measurement, cells were homogenized in 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 1 mg/ml dithioerythritol and 0.1 mg/ml diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (as antioxidants), protein pellets were removed by centrifugation and portions of the supernatants injected onto a C18 reversed phase column for electrochemical detection following high performance liquid chromatography separation (23Howells D.W. Hyland K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 167: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin was eluted isocratically and quantitated against external standards. Immunohistochemistry—Approximately 200,000 differentiated cells were plated on each 12-mm glass coverslip in 24-well plates. Cells were washed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1 m PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h, then incubated at room temperature overnight in primary antibody, followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase antiserum were obtained from Pel-Freeze (Rogers, AR) and used at 1:1,000 dilution. Anti-neurofilament and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies were obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals (Baltimore, MD). Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody was from Stressgen (San Diego, CA). Coverslips were washed and then mounted with Promega Antifade Kit. Stained cells were viewed with epifluorescence illumination, fluorophore-appropriate excitation and emission filters and a ×40, 1.4 NA objective. Images were obtained with a cooled CCD camera and Metamorph Imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). ATP Measurements—The intracellular ATP content of differentiated cells were measured by luciferin/luciferase bioluminescence, using a Monolight 3010C Lumenometer. For ATP measurements, cells were grown in 100-mm culture plates, and harvested after 3 days of feeding with control medium or medium supplemented with rotenone. Scraped cells were washed once with 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 300 μl of cell lysis buffer (0.5 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100). Resuspended cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was immediately frozen and stored at –80 °C until analysis. A reaction mixture containing 50 μl of reaction buffer (6 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.8), 50 μl of sample or standard (10–4, 10–5, 10–6, and 10–7m), and 15 μl of firelight LB (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD) was added to glass cuvettes immediately before measuring ATP levels. Mitochondrial Respiration—Oxygen consumption rates for MN9D and MN9X cells were determined by mounting coverslips containing adherent cells in a stainless steel apparatus (Penn Century, Philadelphia, PA). A spacer ring separated the two coverslips, forming a flow-through chamber that was flushed with a buffered salt solution containing Pd-meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl)porphine probe in 0.5% albumin. When filled with this solution, the dissolved oxygen tension decreased at a rate proportional to the respiratory rate of the cells. The PO2 in the solution was measured every 3 s using a phosphorescence quenching method (24Lo L.W. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The slope obtained from least-squares linear regressions of PO2 against time was used as a relative indicator of cellular respiration. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a fluorescent, cationic membrane potential indicator, was used to assess changes in ΔΨm. Cells were incubated for 1 h in culture medium containing 100 nm TMRM. In preliminary experiments, we ascertained that, at this concentration, intramitochondrial TMRM was not quenched at baseline mitochondrial potentials. Cells were illuminated by epifluorescence, using light from a 75 watt xenon source, the intensity of which was decreased to 0.0003% by neutral density filters. This low illumination level enabled time-lapse studies to be performed for up to 1 h at 35 °C without light-induced dissipation of ΔΨm. Cells were observed with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) and imaged with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) connected to a computer work station running Metafluor imaging software. Excitation light was narrowly filtered (560 ± 15 nm, Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT), and light emitted at 605 ± 25 nm was measured. Images were formed using a ×40, 1.3 NA oil-immersion objective. An image of a drop of dye-free perfusate was used as a background. Non-uniform illumination (shading) in the imaging system was corrected by dividing each image by fluorescent image of a homogenous, uranium oxide slide, and the resultant image was scaled. Measurements were made every 20 s before, during, and after perfusion of rotenone. At the end of each experiment, we dissipated the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane with carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone to assess the proportion of ΔΨm-independent TMRM fluorescence accumulation within mitochondria. Time-dependent changes in ΔΨm were normalized both to baseline fluorescence intensity (100%) and to the fluorescence intensity remaining following carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (0%). To quantify TMRM fluorescence, mitochondria-rich regions were identified on TMRM images, and mean regional fluorescence was calculated for each cell in the image. Fluorescence intensity measurements were plotted on a region by region basis as a function of time. Detection of Protein Carbonyls—Protein carbonyls were assayed with the Oxyblot protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) at room temperature. Briefly, 15 μg of protein was mixed with an equal volume of 12% SDS and 2 volumes of 1× 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine solution. Control reactions used 1× derivatization control solution instead of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine solution. The reaction proceeded for 15 min and was stopped by the addition of 1.5 volumes of neutralization solution. The samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using semi-dry transfer. The membrane was washed twice for 5 min in PBS, blocked with PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, and incubated for 1 h in 1:150 rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone antibody (Intergen). The membrane was washed three times for 15 min in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300) for 1 h. After three washes in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, the blot was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antioxidant Enzyme Assays—Superoxide dismutase activity was assayed with superoxide dismutase assay kit, WST (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). 2-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium is reduced by superoxide and produces a water-soluble formazan dye that can be detected with spectrophotometry. The inhibitory effect of superoxide dismutase on this reduction was measured to calculate superoxide dismutase activities. Catalase activity was measured with Amplex Red Catalase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes). After incubating the samples with 40 μm H2O2 for 30 min, the remaining H2O2 was measured to determine the catalase activity. Amplex Red and horseradish peroxidase react with H2O2 to produce resorufin, a fluorescent compound detectable with spectrophotometry. Glutathione peroxidase activity was measured with Bioxytech GPx-340 assay kit (OxisResearch, Portland, OR). tert-Butyl hydroperoxide was first reduced by glutathione peroxidase and recycled by glutathione reductase coupled with NADPH oxidation. The rate of decrease in NADPH is measured with spectrophotometry to estimate glutathione peroxidase activity. Protein Levels—Protein assays were carried out using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Absorbance at A595 nm was measured using a 96-well plate reader (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using Sigma Stat software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Standard errors were determined for each group, and two- or three-way randomized ANOVA (depending on the experiments) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test was used to determine statistical differences between groups. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used. Cellular Model of Dopaminergic Neuronal Degeneration—To determine the effects of chronic, low-grade Complex I inhibition on cell degeneration in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells, we induced cell cycle arrest and morphologic neuronal differentiation in immortalized midbrain MN9 neuronal cells using NaBu (20Kruh J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1982; 42: 65-82PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to NaBu treatment, proliferating MN9 cells had small, roundish somata with occasional short neurites. After treatment with NaBu (1 mm) for several days, MN9 cells stopped dividing and adopted a mature neuronal morphology, characterized by long, well developed neurites (Fig. 1A). Stable cell numbers were maintained for about 7–10 days after differentiation. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, rotenone studies were performed after 5–6 days of differentiation. To characterize differentiated MN9D and MN9X cells, we stained cells for neuronal and non-neuronal markers. Both MN9D and MN9X cells stained strongly for neuronal markers NF and glutamic acid decarboxylase (Fig. 1A). Neither cell type expressed immunoreactivity for GFAP, a non-neuronal marker (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that differentiated MN9D and MN9X cells are both neuronal. Of these neuronal cells, MN9D cells exhibited tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and MN9X did not (Fig. 1, A and B). In MN9D cells, NaBu-induced morphological and immunohistochemical differentiation was accompanied by an enhanced dopaminergic phenotype. Specifically, the total cellular dopamine level in MN9D increased by about 8-fold, from 1.57 (±0.24) × 10–5 pmol/cell (S.E., n = 3) to 12.7 (±0.9) × 10–5 pmol/cell (S.E., n = 3). In contrast, NaBu-treated MN9X cells contained no dopamine. These data demonstrate that NaBu treatment of MN9D and MN9X cells produces differentiated, non-proliferating neuronal cells of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic phenotype, respectively. Differentiated MN9D Cells Provide an in Vitro Model of Selective Vulnerability of Dopaminergic Neurons to Rotenone Toxicity—Selective rotenone toxicity to dopaminergic neurons has been noted in vivo following chronic, low dose paradigms (9Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar), but not in acute, high dose paradigms (26Ferrante R.J. Schulz J.B. Kowall N.W. Beal M.F. Brain Res. 1998; 753: 157-162Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the effects of micromolar (high dose) and nanomolar (low dose) concentrations of rotenone toxicity in MN9 cells. High dose rotenone (5–80 μm for 60 h) induced a marked, dose-dependent death in all MN9 cells, without significant differences between dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic phenotypes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, low dose rotenone (5–80 nm for 7 days) produced dose-dependent toxicity against MN9 cells (p < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA) with greater toxicity seen in MN9D cells than in MN9X (p < 0.05; Fig. 2B). Longer durations of rotenone treatment, up to 3 weeks, exaggerated the differential toxicity of MN9D versus MN9X (data not shown). To confirm that this differential susceptibility to low dose rotenone of dopaminergic MN9D cells was not the result of a nonspecific difference in vulnerability of the cells to a toxic stimulus, we induced apoptosis in both cell types, using staurosporine (5–500 nm) for 3 days, and compared survival as a function of dose. No significant differences in survival between MN9D and MN9X cells were detected (Fig. 2C). Thus, administration of nanomolar concentrations of rotenone for 1 week recapitulates in vitro the phenomenon of differential susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to chronic low-grade mitochondrial complex I inhibition. Oxidative Stress Does Not Contribute to Rotenone Toxicity in Dopaminergic Cells—Because complex I inhibition increases mitochondrial oxidant production, one mechanism by which rotenone could cause differential toxicity in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells is through differential, intrinsic susceptibility to oxidative stress. Accordingly, we assessed the susceptibility of MN9D and MN9X cells to 24 h exposure to the oxidants H2O2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH). Both H2O2 and tBOOH killed MN9X and MN9D cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, A and B). However, H2O2 and tBOOH killed more non-dopaminergic MN9X cells than dopaminergic MN9D cells. This differential toxicity was observed at 80 μm H2O2 and 50–100 μm tBOOH (Fig. 3, A and B; p < 0.001 for the interaction between tBOOH treatment and cell type by three-way ANOVA). In fact, tBOOH (100 μm) resulted in 13.1 ± 22.9% survival of MN9X cells, whereas 81.7 ± 7.7% of MN9D cells survived. These data indicate that MN9D cells have decreased susceptibility to oxidant stress compared with MN9X. To assess the role of oxidant stress in killing MN9D and MN9X cells during low dose rotenone treatment, we first asked whether antioxidant treatment differentially improves survival of MN9D and MN9X cells during low dose rotenone. MN9D and MN9X cells were treated with rotenone (5–80 nm) for 1 week in the presence and absence of Euk-134 (5 μm), a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic (27Pong K. Doctrow S.R. Baudry M. Brain Res. 2000; 881: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Euk-134 did not protect MN9D cells against rotenone toxicity (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Euk-134 significantly improved survival of non-dopaminergic MN9X cells after 1 week in the presence of rotenone to the extent that it completely prevented low dose rotenone-induced death (p < 0.05, Fig. 4B). To exclude the possibility that the lack of antioxidant-induced protection in MN9D cells was because of the greater degree of rotenone toxicity in MN9D compared with MN9X in this dose range, we compared the effects of Euk-134 treatment on MN9 toxicity following 40 nm rotenone treatment in MN9X cells with 5 nm rotenone treatment in MN9D cells, doses that induce similar degrees of death in each cell type. In this comparison, we observed no protective effect of Euk-134 in MN9D cells, confirming that MN9X survival following low dose rotenone is differentially improved by antioxidants. Combined, these data indicate that rotenone induces toxic oxidative stress only in MN9X cells, and that this non-dopaminergic cell type exhibits increased vulnerability to oxidative stress compared with MN9D cells. Having found less susceptibility of MN9D cells to exogenous oxidant stress and rotenone-induced endogenous oxidative stress compared with MN9X cells, we next assessed whether rotenone treatment amplifies vulnerability to exogenous oxidants. MN9D and MN9X cells were treated with rotenone (40 nm) for only 3 days, a treatment that does not significantly increase cell death. For the last 24 h of this treatment, we added tBOOH in a range of doses. Rotenone treatment markedly worsened survival of MN9X cells following tBOOH (90 ± 5% tBOOH (25 μm) alone versus 67 ± 3% tBOOH (25 μm) plus rotenone; 45 ± 10% tBOOH (50 μm) alone versus 22 ± 20% tBOOH (50 μm) plus rotenone; p < 0.001 by three-way ANOVA) (Fig. 3C). In contrast, roten"
https://openalex.org/W1969768367,"To explore the mechanism of estrogen-induced growth of normal endometrium, the transactivation system of the cyclin D1 gene was analysed using cultured normal endometrial glandular cells. Estradiol (E2) treatment of cultured normal endometrial glandular cells induced upregulation of c-Jun, and then cyclin D1 proteins, followed by serial expressions of cyclins E, A and B1 proteins. Increase in the mRNA expression of cyclin D1 preceded the protein expression of cyclin D1 under E2 treatment. A luciferase assay using deletion constructs of the cyclin D1 promoter indicated that E2-induced increase in transcriptional activity was observed in reporters containing AP-1-binding site sequence, and that in the absence of E2, cotransfection of c-Jun also showed increase of transcriptional activity in the same reporters with AP-1 sequence. A gel shift assay using nuclear extract from E2-treated endometrial glandular cells and AP-1 sequences of the cyclin D1 promoter indicated specific binding between c-Jun protein and the promoter. Transfection of c-jun antisense oligonucleotides to the glandular cells resulted in the suppression of the E2-induced upregulation of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. These findings suggest that E2-induced proliferation of normal endometrial glandular cells is initiated by transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 via binding of c-Jun to the AP-1 sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2047600396,"Since chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of most cancer cells, it is essential to identify genes whose alteration results into this genetic instability. Using a yeast CIN indicator strain, we show that inactivation of the YMR131c/RRB1 gene, which is involved in early ribosome assembly and whose expression is induced when the spindle checkpoint is activated, alters chromosome segregation and blocks mitosis at the metaphase/anaphase transition. We demonstrate that RRB1 interacts with YPH1 (yeast pescadillo homologue 1) and other members of the Yph1 complex, RPL3, ERB1 and ORC6, involved in ribosome biogenesis and DNA replication. Transient depletion of the human homologues GRWD, Pescadillo, Rpl3, Bop1 and Orc6L resulted in an increase of abnormal mitoses with appearance of binucleate or hyperploid cells, of cells with multipolar spindles and of aberrant metaphase plates. If deregulation of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, commonly observed in malignant tumors, could contribute to cancer through an aberrant protein synthesis, our study demonstrates that alteration of proteins linking ribosome biogenesis and DNA replication may directly cause CIN."
https://openalex.org/W2001527927,"The juvenile form of ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene. CLN3 encodes a multimembrane-spanning protein of unknown function, which is mainly localized in lysosomes in non-neuronal cells and in endosomes in neuronal cells. For this study we constructed chimeric proteins of three CLN3 cytoplasmic domains fused to the lumenal and transmembrane domains of the reporter proteins LAMP-1 and lysosomal acid phosphatase to identify lysosomal targeting motifs and to determine the intracellular transport and subcellular localization of the chimera in transfected cell lines. We report that a novel type of dileucine-based sorting motif, EEEX8LI, present in the second cytoplasmic domain of CLN3, is sufficient for proper targeting to lysosomes. The first cytoplasmic domain of CLN3 and the mutation of the dileucine motif resulted in a partial missorting of chimeric proteins to the plasma membrane. At equilibrium, 4-13% of the different chimera are present at the cell surface. Analysis of lysosome-specific proteolytic processing revealed that lysosomal acid phosphatase chimera containing the second cytoplasmic domain of CLN3 showed the highest rate of lysosomal delivery, whereas the C terminus of CLN3 was found to be less efficient in lysosomal targeting. However, none of these cytosolic CLN3 domains was able to interact with AP-1, AP-3, or GGA3 adaptor complexes. These data revealed that lysosomal sorting motifs located in an intramolecular cytoplasmic domain of a multimembrane-spanning protein have different structural requirements for adaptor binding than sorting signals found in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of single- or dual-spanning lysosomal membrane proteins.

The sorting motifs are used as recognition sites for cytosolic heterotetrameric adaptor complexes mediating the incorporation of the respective cargo proteins in clathrin-coated vesicles. Four adaptor complexes AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4 have been described and are thought to function in the transport of cargo proteins into the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways (24Robinson M.S.

The targeting of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LAMP-3, and LIMP-2 from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles is mediated by the AP-3 adaptor complex (25Le Borgne R. Alconada A.

Furthermore, trafficking of LAP to lysosomes follows an indirect route that includes recycling between early endosomes and the plasma membrane before delivery to lysosomes (37Braun M. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the tyrosine motif in the cytoplasmic domain of LAP determines the specificity of adaptor binding required for the transport in the recycling loop (19Peters C. Braun M.

The subcellular localization of the chimera was determined by double immunofluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation. Furthermore, the proteolytic processing of newly synthesized LAP-CLN3 chimera occurring in lysosomes has been proven to document the transport to lysosomes. Finally, pull-down assays were carried out to analyze the ability of cytoplasmic domains of CLN3 to interact with adaptor molecules. We found a novel type of dileucine-based sorting signal in the context of preceding acidic glutamate residues in the second cytoplasmic domain of CLN3 essential and sufficient for the transport to the lysosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES[35S]Methionine, the prestained Rainbow marker, ultrapure dNTPs, the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1, and the Escherichia coli strain BL21 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

Secondary antibodies coupled to fluorochromes were applied using the following dilutions: anti-mouse Cy3 (1:2000), anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100).Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded on 35-mm plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/plate and transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)-LAMP-1-CLN3 chimeric constructs and 10 μl of Effectene. Forty eight hours after the start of transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 10 min at 21,000 × g, the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. BHK cells (4.8 × 105 cells per plate) were transfected with 2 μg of wild type LAP and LAP chimera in vector pcDNA6V5 using 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty four hours after the start of transfection, cells were either pulse-labeled with 35[S]methionine or processed for cell surface biotinylation. For stable transfections, 4.8 × 105 CHO cells (ATCC) were transfected with 4 μg of each linearized pcDNA6-V5-LAMP-1-CLN3-chimeric constructs and 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM medium. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and diluted 1:10 on 60-mm plates with DMEM containing 10% FCS and 6 μg/ml blasticidin. Ten days after transfection, single colonies were picked, and expression of LAMP-1-CLN3 chimera was tested by immunofluorescence microscopy. At least two different cell clones of two independent transfections were tested in each experiment.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—CHO cells stably expressing LAMP-1 and LAMP-1-CLN3-CD constructs were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well chambers and cultivated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, antibiotics, and 6 μg/ml blasticidin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were washed with 10 mm PBS, 5 mm glucose, fixed with methanol for 5 min on ice, washed three times with PBS, and blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Subsequently cells were incubated with primary antibodies against LAMP-1, LAMP-2, PDI, and GM130 diluted in PBS/BSA as indicated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS/BSA, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to the fluorochromes Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate for 1 h at room temperature as indicated. After washing with PBS, the cells were mounted in Fluoromount (DAKO) and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with an Olympus dp50 digital camera.Cell Surface Biotinylation—BHK cells expressing wild type LAP and LAP-CLN3-CD chimera were washed four times with PBS and incubated with the non-membrane-permeable NHS-LC biotin (1.3 mg/ml PBS) for 45 min at 4 °C to specifically biotinylate proteins localized at the cell surface. After washing, the cells were scraped in PBS, sedimented by centrifugation, and lysed in 250 μl of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors at 4 °C. The cell extract was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant removed. Equal amounts of total protein (300 μg) were mixed with streptavidinagarose (50% v/v) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rotation. Subsequently, the beads were washed five times with 500 μl of PBS containing 0.1% SDS. After solubilization, the precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose, followed by LAP Western blotting. To quantify the amount of LAP localized at the cell surface, 6.5% of the total cell lysate was analyzed in parallel. Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometric scanning (Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet 4c IT) using the AIDA 2.11-software (Raytest, Deisenhofen, Germany).Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For pulse-chase experiments, 35-mm dishes of BHK cells expressing wild type and LAP-CLN3-CD chimera were starved for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM and labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine (0.1 mCi). After a chase of 17 h in complete medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml methionine, cells were harvested, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using LAP-specific antiserum LS-4 (39Obermüller S.

To study the importance of the isolated CLN3-CDs, we constructed chimera between the lumenal and the transmembrane domain of rat LAMP-1 and the CLN3-CDs (Fig. 1). LAMP-1 is a major component of the lysosomal membrane and carries a tyrosine-based sorting signal critical for lysosomal sorting in its C-terminal domain (45Granger B.L. Green S.A. Gabel C.A.

To investigate expression, stability, and correct glycosylation of the chimeric constructs, we transiently transfected HeLa cells. When wild type rat LAMP-1 cDNA was transfected, a 100-kDa immunoreactive band was detected in Western blot analyses which was absent in nontransfected cells (Fig. 2). Although the nonglycosylated LAMP-1 has a molecular mass of 45 kDa (45"
https://openalex.org/W1965222236,"Intracellular calcium concentrations regulate diverse cellular events including cytoskeletal dynamics, gene transcription, and synaptic plasticity. The calcium signal is transduced in part by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) cascade that is comprised of CaMK kinase (CaMKK) and its primary downstream substrates, CaMKI and CaMKIV. The CaMK cascade also participates in cross-talk with other signaling pathways: CaMKK/CaMKI can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can directly phosphorylate two inhibitory sites (Thr108 and Ser458) in CaMKK. Here we report an additional PKA-dependent regulation of CaMKK through its interaction with protein 14-3-3. CaMKK and 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitated from co-transfected heterologous cells as well as from rat brain homogenate, and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified phospho-Ser74 in CaMKK as the primary 14-3-3 binding site. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons and acute hippocampal slices this interaction was robustly stimulated by activation of PKA through forskolin treatment and was blocked by inhibition of PKA. Interaction of 14-3-3 with CaMKK had two regulatory consequences in vitro. It directly inhibited CaMKK activity, and it also blocked dephosphorylation of Thr108, an inhibitory PKA phosphorylation site. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with CaMKK and stimulated with forskolin, co-transfection with 14-3-3 prevented dephosphorylation of Thr108 to the same extent as did inhibition of protein phosphatases with okadaic acid. We conclude that binding of 14-3-3 to CaMKK stabilizes its inhibition by PKA-mediated phosphorylation, which may have important consequences in the regulation of CaMKI, CaMKIV, protein kinase B, and ERK signaling pathways.

Both CaMKI and CaMKIV have “activation loop” phosphorylation sites that, in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca2+, are phosphorylated by CaMKK, resulting in 10–20-fold increases in their activities (3Haribabu B.

Synapse. 1995; 20: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and recent studies implicate roles for it in regulation of mRNA translation (6Qin H. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Goldstein E.G.

CaMKIV has limited tissue distribution and is largely localized to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription through phosphorylation of transcription factors such as CREB (9Enslen H. Sun P.

Goodman R.H. Neuron. 2002; 34: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). CaMKK can also slowly phosphorylate and activate PKB/Akt, and this appears to mediate in part the antiapoptotic effects of modest intracellular Ca2+ elevations (12Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Thus, the CaMK cascade is integrally involved in major cellular functions.As is true for most signal transduction systems, there is cross-talk between the CaMK cascade and other signaling pathways. For example, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can phosphorylate multiple sites in CaMKK (13Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), two of which are inhibitory (14Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10086-10093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser458, which is just C-terminal of the CaM-binding domain, partially suppresses activation of CaMKK by Ca2+/CaM. Alternatively binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKK blocks phosphorylation of Ser458 (16Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), so the regulation of CaMKK through this mechanism depends on the temporal sequence of signaling events. The CaMK cascade is also involved in Ca2+-dependent activation of ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Depolarization of neuroblastoma NG108 cells produces strong and prolonged ERK activation that is blocked by the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 (17Schmitt J.M. Wayman G.A. Nozaki N. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24064-24072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative constructs of nuclear localized CaMKIV or PKB/Akt had no effect on ERK activation, but dominant-negative CaMKI obviated Ca2+-dependent ERK activation. Furthermore depolarization stimulated neurite outgrowth, and this was also suppressed by inhibition of either CaMKK (STO-609) or ERK (U0126) (17Schmitt J.M. Wayman G.A. Nozaki N. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24064-24072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Because CaMKK contains additional phosphorylation sites of unknown function (13Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we performed a data base search (scansite.mit.edu), which revealed several predicted regulatory motifs including one for interaction with protein 14-3-3. The 14-3-3 family of acidic proteins contains seven isoforms that exist as dimers that bind to Ser/Thr-phosphorylated proteins and modulate their physiological properties (18Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E.

Given the diverse roles of CaMKK in Ca2+ signaling, it was important to determine whether its functionality is regulated by 14-3-3. Here we report that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser74 in CaMKK promotes its interaction with 14-3-3, resulting in direct inhibition of CaMKK activity as well as suppression of Thr108 dephosphorylation, thereby maintaining CaMKK in an inhibited state.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Monoclonal pan-14-3-3 antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene) for generation of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CaMKK mutants (S74A, T108G, S458A, S475A, and T108G/S458A/S475A). Mammalian Myc-tagged 14-3-3 isoforms were a gift of Dr. Alaistair Aitken (National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). For bacterial expression, the 14-3-3 isoforms were subcloned using PCR into pGEX-4T3 (GST fusion protein) and pRSET-A (His6 fusion proteins). Mammalian expression vector for CaMKKα was generated by amplifying the coding region of rat CaMKKα isoform by PCR from pME18SCaMKKα wild type by using the following primers: rCamKK U EcoRI (5′-ggaattcggagcgcagtccagccg-3′) and rCamKK D Asp718I (5′-ccggtacctcaggatgcagcctcatcttc-3′). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI-Asp718I, purified by gel electrophoresis, and subcloned into the ClaI-Asp718I site of expression plasmid pCAGGS (31Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J.

Nozaki N. Shigeri Y. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5193-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For pull-down assays, 1–4 μg of GST fusion protein was loaded on glutathione-Sepharose. When indicated, GST-CaMKKα was phosphorylated in vitro with PKA (1 μg/ml) and ATP for 20 min at 32 °C. The PKA phosphorylation reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μm PKA inhibitor peptide (PKI) and washing with 4-fold excess volume of lysis buffer. For pull-down experiments, rat brain cytosol (with addition of 0.5% Triton X-100) was added to the immobilized GST-CaMKK and incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 2–4 h. To remove unbound proteins, the beads were washed two to three times with lysis buffer followed by SDS-PAGE. Bound 14-3-3 was detected by immunoblotting with pan-14-3-3 antibodies.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and COS7 cells were cultured as described previously (14Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H.

For transfection experiments, ∼4 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 6-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of total plasmid DNA/well using FuGENE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). 24 to 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed once in ACSF (HEPES-based) and incubated with the indicated pharmacological inhibitors for 30–60 min. Stimulations were done as described under “Results.” Cells were instantly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until further processing or lysed immediately for immunoprecipitations.Acute Hippocampal Slice Preparation—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (6–8 weeks old) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and sacrificed by decapitation. The brains were removed within 1 min of decapitation and immediately submerged in ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) sucrose-ACSF for hippocampal dissection: 110 mm sucrose, 60 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 28 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH3PO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 0.6 mm sodium ascorbate, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Hippocampal slices (400 μm, transverse) were prepared in ice-cold sucrose-ACSF using a Vibratome and transferred as cut to warm, oxygenated ACSF (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 21.4 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH3PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, pH 7.4 at 32 °C) for recovery (30 min at 37 °C and then the chamber was equilibrated for 1.5–2 h at 22 °C). Slices from the dorsal and ventral thirds of the hippocampus were discarded. Following recovery, slices were transferred to ACSF at 32 °C and equilibrated for 1 h, pretreated with H89, 11-arginine PKI peptide, or 11-arginine control peptide and then treated with or without 25 μm forskolin for 5 min. Slices were kept submerged at all times. Poststimulation the slices were immediately lysed by homogenization in 1% Triton X-100 in a glass Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min), and cleared lysates were used for immunoprecipitation as described.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, rat forebrain, acute hippocampal slices, hippocampal cultures, or transfected heterologous cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, pH7.4, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm NaPPi, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin A), and 1 μm microcystin. Insoluble material was cleared by ultracentrifugation (hippocampal slices and rat forebrain: 50,000 rpm for 30 min) or centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min in a table top, refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge (cultured cells). 4–10 μg of indicated antibody was added to about 500–700 μg of cleared lysate and incubated either for 1 h or overnight on ice. Immobilized protein A (Repligen Inc.) or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and lysates were further incubated for 1–2 h while tilting at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice with a 4-fold excess volume of lysis buffer and once with 10 mm HEPES alone. Samples were then extracted, and proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Initial immunoblotting (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) was done with blocking, primary, and secondary antibodies diluted in 5% milk followed by horseradish peroxidase-based signal detection with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film (Biomax MR and ML from Eastman Kodak Co.). Subsequent (Figs. 5, 6, 7) immunoblotting was performed in accordance with the Odyssey near infrared imaging platform system (LI-COR), and data were captured using the Odyssey scanner. For quantification of data, the x-ray film-based Western blot data were scanned and densitized using Kodak imaging software, and the data gathered using the Odyssey system were densitized with the same system software. All the data were further processed and normalized using Microsoft Excel, and statistical analyses were performed using Prism software.Fig. 2CaMKK association with 14-3-3 requires PKA phosphorylation of Ser74.

https://openalex.org/W1980954113,"During DNA replication, DNA becomes more vulnerable to certain DNA damages. DNA repair genes involved in repair of the damages may be induced by growth stimulation. However, regulation of DNA repair genes by growth stimulation has not been analysed in detail. In this report, we analysed the regulation of expression of mammalian MSH2, MSH3 and MLH1 genes involved in mismatch repair, and Rad51 and Rad50 genes involved in homologous recombination repair, in relation to cell growth. Unexpectedly, we found a clear difference in regulation of these repair gene expression by growth stimulation even in the same repair system. The expression of MSH2, MLH1 and Rad51 genes was clearly growth regulated, whereas MSH3 and Rad50 genes were constitutively expressed, suggesting differential requirement of the repair gene products for cell proliferation. MSH3 gene is located in a bidirectionally divergent manner with DHFR gene that is regulated by growth stimulation, indicating that bidirectionally divergent promoters are not necessarily coordinately regulated. Promoter analysis showed that the growth-regulated expression of MLH1 and Rad51 genes was mainly mediated by E2F that plays crucial roles in regulation of DNA replication, suggesting close relation between some of the repair genes and DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1965680797,"Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) is a member of the germinal center family of kinases that are homologous to the yeast sterile 20 (Ste20) kinases and regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell morphology, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and survival. Here, we present the cloning and functional characterization of a novel human Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase β (hMINKβ) that encodes a polypeptide of 1312 amino acids. hMINKβ is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues with at least five alternatively spliced isoforms. Similar to Nck interacting kinase (NIK) and Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), hMINKβ moderately activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and associates with Nck via the intermediate domain in the yeast two-hybrid system and in a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. Interestingly, overexpression of the kinase domain deleted and kinase-inactive mutants of hMINKβ in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells enhanced cell spreading, actin stress fiber formation, and adhesion to extracellular matrix, as well as decreased cell motility and cell invasion. Furthermore, these mutants also promoted cell-cell adhesion in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells, evidenced with cell growth in clusters and increased membrane localization of β-catenin, a multifunctional protein involved in E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Finally, hMINKβ protein was found to colocalize with the Golgi apparatus, implicating that hMINKβ might exert its functions, at least in part, through the modulation of intracellular protein transport. Taken together, these results suggest that hMINKβ plays an important role in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell adhesion, and cell motility.

The Ste20 kinase family consists of more than 30 serine/threonine kinases whose catalytic domains are homologous to yeast Ste20 kinase and can be divided into two distinct classes: p21-activated protein kinases and germinal center kinases (GCKs) 1The abbreviations used are: GCK, germinal center kinase; MINK, Misshapen/Nck interacting kinase-related kinase; NIK, Nck interacting kinase; TNIK, Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase; HPK1, hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1; HGK, HPK/GCK-like kinase; Ste20, sterile 20 kinase; CNH, C-terminal citron homology; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; Msn, Misshapen; SH3, Src homology domain 3; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. (1Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The first class of kinases contains a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal binding site for Rac1 and Cdc42. The second class of kinases has an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. Like their yeast counterparts, most of mammalian Ste20 kinases activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways that control diverse cellular processes including gene transcription, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell growth, and apoptosis (2Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The GCK family kinases can be further subdivided into eight subfamilies using a phylogenetic-based classification scheme (2Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The GCK-IV subfamily (also named the MSN subfamily) includes NIK, TNIK, MINK, HPK/GCK-like kinase (HGK), and Nck-interacting kinase (NIK)-related kinase/NIK-like embryo-specific kinase as well as Drosophila melanogaster Misshapen (Msn) and Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog Mig-15 (2Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). These kinases share high sequence similarity in their N-terminal kinase domains and C-terminal citron homology (CNH) domains, whereas the intermediate domains are less conserved. The CNH domain, originally described in citron Rho-interacting kinase (3Di Cunto F. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Topley G. Turco E. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29706-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was also found in GCK-I kinases (2Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), vacuolar protein sorting factors including human Vam6 and yeast Vam6p/Vps39, as well as yeast Rho GDP-exchange factor Rom1p (4Caplan S. Hartnell L.M. Aguilar R.C. Naslavsky N. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 154: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This domain has been shown to play a role in protein-protein interactions and activation of the JNK pathway. For example, the CNH domain of NIK interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrin receptor and MEKK1 (5Poinat P. De Arcangelis A. Sookhareea S. Zhu X. Hedgecock E.M. Labouesse M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, the association with MEKK1 is required to activate the JNK pathway. MAP4K4, a member of GCK-IV subfamily kinases, interacted with small GTP-binding protein Rap2 through its CNH domain (7Machida N. Umikawa M. Takei K. Sakima N. Myagmar B.E. Taira K. Uezato H. Ogawa Y. Kariya K.I. J Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15711-15714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The intermediate domains of GCK-IV kinases contain multiple proline-rich motifs (PXXP), which are putative SH3 domain binding sites. These sequences in NIK and TNIK kinases are required for efficient interaction with Nck, an adaptor protein consisting of one SH2 and three SH3 domains (6Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol.

Nck is known to interact with a large number of proteins including phosphorylated receptor-tyrosine kinases and proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, DNA synthesis, and gene expression (9Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The SH3 domains of Nck mediate interactions with a variety of binding partners, whereas the SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins such as activated receptor-tyrosine kinases (9Li W.

Some of these kinases directly phosphorylate MAP3Ks and are classified as MAP4Ks (6Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that GCKs play a role coupling cell surface receptors to the JNK pathway. For example, NIK links Eph receptors to the activation of JNK (11Becker E. Huynh-Do U. Holland S. Pawson T. Daniel T.O. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Msn acts downstream of the Fizzled receptor (Wnt receptor) and regulates the dorsal closure through the JNK pathway (18Su Y.C. Maurel-Zaffran C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A germinal center kinase-related kinase, termed GCKR, binds to the tumor necrosis factor receptor complex via Traf2, leading to JNK activation (19Shi C.S. Leonardi A. Kyriakis J. Siebenlist U. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3279-3285PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse MINK was previously cloned from a mouse brain cDNA library (17Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kobayashi T. Yamashita-Suzuki K. Fukagaya Y. Kajikawa E. Kimura W.K. Nakashima T.M. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kusumi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of mouse MINK suggested that it may be involved in the regulation of brain development. Little is known about the regulatory mechanism and physiological role of MINK in mammalian cells. Here we report the isolation and functional characterization of a human ortholog of mouse MINK, designated as hMINKβ. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues with several alternatively spliced forms. Our studies have found that hMINKβ was able to activate the JNK pathway and physically interacted with the adaptor protein Nck. Overexpression of hMINKβ mutants with defects in the kinase domain altered cell morphology, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies reveal that hMINKβ co-localizes with the Golgi apparatus. Thus, hMINKβ appears to function in cellular and developmental processes through modulation of cytoskeleton reorganization, cell adhesion, and cell migration, possibly in part via the control of intracellular protein transport. Cell Lines and Reagents—Phoenix A cells (a derivative of 293T cells with integrated viral packaging genes) (20Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Coico R. Curr.

Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and human breast carcinoma cells MCF7 were maintained in minimal essential medium and RPMI 1640, respectively. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a recombinant hMINKβ fragment (from amino acid 581 to 780) (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cloning of Full-length hMINKβ, Northern Blot Analysis, and RT-PCR—A partial cDNA clone TR5 identified from a Jurkat cDNA library by an anti-apoptotic screen, shares high sequence homology with mouse Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase MINK-1 (GenBank™ accession number AB035697), corresponding to 2804–3187 bp. The 5′ and 3′ end cDNAs of human MINK were isolated using the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) except that cDNA libraries were used as templates. The full-length cDNA, designated as hMINKβ, was cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA library. Northern blots were performed on human multitissue Northern blots according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech). A random-primed labeled DNA fragment (DraI and SfiI double digested fragment, 1.2 kb) corresponding to the intermediate domain of hMINKβ was used as a hybridization probe. Two oligonucleotides covering all alternatively spliced junctions (CCCAGACTCCTCCTATGCAGAGG and CTCGTCCAGAGTCCGCTCTTTCAGC) were used to perform RT-PCR using 1 μg of total RNA from various human tissues obtained from Clontech as a template. The PCR products were then resolved on 1% agarose gel and photographed. Amplified DNA fragments were either directly sequenced or sequenced after cloning into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructs—Full-length human hMINKβ was cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal FLAG tag and pBabeMN-IGFP retroviral vector (21Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J.

A kinase mutant of hMINKβ-KD was generated by substitution of the highly conserved lysine 54 with arginine using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Various deletion mutants of hMINKβ were constructed with PCR amplification and cloned into pcDNA3 vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag and/or pBabeMN-IGFP retroviral vector. GST-Nck and GST-Nck-(1–270) constructs were generated by PCR amplification of Nck and cloned into pGEX-6P vector. GST-Nck fusion proteins were expressed and purified from BL21 Escherichia coli. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Myc-JNK2 was described previously (8Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Nck and hMINKβ were cloned into the pAS2K and pACT vectors, respectively. Nck and/or hMINKβ were transformed into yeast strain Y190. The yeast cells were grown in nutrient-depleted medium (Leu-, His-, Trp-) plus 3-aminotriazole and tested for β-galactosidase activity 10 days post-transformation (22Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infection, Western Blot Analysis, and GST Pull-down— Production and infection of retroviruses into HT1080 and MCF7 cells were carried out as described (23Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L.

The cells expressing high levels of proteins (top 20%) were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on GFP signals. To detect the protein expression in those infected cells, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). The cell lysates were then subject to SDS-PAGE following by Western blotting with anti-hMINKβ, anti-FLAG (Sigma), or anti-β-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. To confirm equal loading, the filters were re-probed with anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). For GST pull-down experiments, Phoenix A cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the full-length or truncated hMINKβ proteins by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Equal amounts of the cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of purified GST-Nck or GST-Nck-(1–270) plus 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer. hMINKβ proteins bound to GST-Nck fusions were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For in vitro JNK kinase assays, Myc-JNK2 was co-transfected with vector or various hMINKβ plasmids into Phoenix A cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 40 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 10 mm β-glycerophospate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase reaction for Myc-JNK2 were performed as described previously (7Machida N. Umikawa M. Takei K. Sakima N. Myagmar B.E. Taira K. Uezato H. Ogawa Y. Kariya K.I. J Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15711-15714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the hMINKβ kinase reaction, hMINKβ proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) and subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction in the presence of [γ-32p]ATP and 5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Upstate Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates 18 h before the staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using anti-hMINKβ, anti-golgin-97 (Molecular Probes), and/or anti-β-catenin antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by anti-mouse rhodamine and/or anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies. 4′,6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Chemicon International, Inc.) was used to stain nuclei. For actin staining, cells after fixation and permeabilization were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μm for 20 min, mounted in an anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and photographed using a fluorescent microscope. Invasion, Wound Healing, and Cell Adhesion Assays—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells expressing GFP, wild-type, or kinase-inactive hMINKβ were grown in serum-free medium for 24 h. Invasion assays were performed in BioCoat Invasion chambers pre-coated with Matrigel according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). After 20 h incubation, the noninvading cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane with cotton swabs. The cells migrated to the underside of the membrane were stained with Cell Stain (Chemicon International, Inc.) and counted under microscopy. For wound healing experiments, HT1080 cells expressing GFP, hMINKβ, and hMINKβ-KD were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to confluence. The confluent monolayers were wounded using a disposable pipette tip and washed once with minimal essential medium (25Kulkarni S.V. Gish G. Van Der Geer P. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Photographs were taken at the indicated times after wounding using a phase-contrast microscope. For the cell adhesion assay, HT1080 cells expressing GFP and various hMINKβ proteins were detached with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and re-suspended in minimal essential medium. The cell suspensions were added into laminin-coated 24-well plates (Greiner bio-one) and collagen I- or fibronectin-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences). At the indicated times, the media were aspirated and the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The remaining adhesive cells were quantified with a CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes). Identification and Cloning of hMINKβ—In an effort to discover novel human germinal center kinases, we identified a cDNA clone TR5 with about 89% sequence homology to mouse MINK1 cDNA. The TR5 clone was initially isolated from a Jurkat cDNA library by a functional screen designed to isolate genes that confer resistance to Taxol-induced cell death. This clone carries an antisense fragment of the human MINK homolog corresponding to nucleotides 2804 to 3187 of mouse MINK1 (17Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kobayashi T. Yamashita-Suzuki K. Fukagaya Y. Kajikawa E. Kimura W.K. Nakashima T.M. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kusumi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Using TR5 as a probe, we cloned a 3951-bp cDNA, encoding a polypeptide of 1312 amino acids. This human MINK cDNA represents a novel spliced isoform of the human MINK gene and displays more than 98% sequence identity in the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal CNH domain with its mouse homolog. The intermediate domain shares at least 80% sequence similarity with mouse MINK1 with short deletions and/or insertions from alternative splicing. Northern blot analysis with a probe covering the least homologous region among all GCK family members revealed that this cDNA is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues tested with relative high levels in brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and testis (Fig. 1A). This cDNA clone was named human MINKβ (hMINKβ, see full description below). In the process of cloning the full-length human MINK, we found that like other GCKs, hMINK also exists as multiple spliced versions. Because the probe used for Northern blots cannot distinguish the expression pattern of these variations, we conducted RT-PCR experiments using primers covering the alternative spliced junctions. The amplified PCR products were separated on agarose gel and individual bands were isolated and sequenced (Fig. 1B). Five alternative spliced isoforms of hMINK were obtained (Fig. 1C). Comparing with human genomic sequences, all exon/intron boundaries matched the consensus splicing sequences. The longest alternative spliced form designated as hMINKα encodes a polypeptide of 1332 amino acids. hMINKβ corresponding to the cDNA that we isolated encodes a protein of 1312 amino acids missing a 20-amino acid region between amino acids 581 and 600 compared with hMINKα. The third and fourth isoforms equivalent to human MINK2 (1303 amino acids) and MINK1 (1295 amino acids) were named hMINKγ and hMINKδ, respectively. hMINKγ has a 37-amino acid deletion from amino acid 696 to 732 plus an 8-amino acid insertion between amino acids 800 and 801. hMINKδ only contains the 37-amino acid deletion described in hMINKγ. The fifth spliced form (hMINKϵ) lacks both regions described above and encodes a polypeptide of 1275 amino acids. It is interesting to note that the tissue distribution patterns of each spliced isoform are very different. hMINKα is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues tested at relative higher levels. hMINKγ is predominantly expressed in brain, whereas hMINKδ is most abundant in skeletal muscle. hMINKβ and hMINKϵ are expressed as minor forms in almost every tissue. Kinase Activity and JNK Activation—To evaluate the kinase activity of hMINKβ, FLAG-tagged hMINKβ and hMINKβ-KD with a point mutation in the catalytic domain (K54R) were expressed in Phoenix-A cells, and the proteins were then immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, hMINKβ strongly phosphorylated MBP and hMINKβ autophosphorylation was also shown. In contrast, hMINKβ-KD failed to phosphorylate MBP and itself (Fig. 2A), indicating that this mutant is devoid of catalytic activity. Equal expression of hMINKβ proteins were shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2A. To determine whether hMINKβ activates the JNK pathway, Myc-tagged JNK2 along with various constructs of hMINKβ were cotransfected into Phoenix-A cells, and JNK2 proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. MEKK1, a well established MAP3K for JNK activation (6Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Surprisingly, both wild-type and the kinase-inactive mutant of hMINKβ enhanced GST-c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK2 as compared with the control, whereas the kinase domain (amino acids 1–547) alone failed to do so (Fig. 2B). Comparable expressing levels of Myc-JNK2 in each transfection were confirmed by immunoblotting the cell lysates with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that hMINKβ can activate the JNK pathway by a mechanism independent of its kinase activity. hMINKβ was unable to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in similar cotransfection assays (data not shown), suggesting that hMINKβ specifically activates the JNK pathway. Interaction with Nck—Because hMINKβ, like NIK and TNIK, also contains multiple proline-rich motifs (PXXP) in its intermediate domain, we asked whether hMINKβ interacts with the Nck adaptor protein. To address this question, we first performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, hMINKβ interacts with Nck in the yeast two-hybrid system, manifesting with both cell growth in selective media and β-galactosidase expression. Control cells expressing either Nck or hMINKβ failed to grow (Fig. 3A). To confirm the interaction and further delineate the domains of hMINKβ required for this interaction, we transfected Phoenix-A cells with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or deletion mutants of hMINKβ as shown in Fig. 3B, and conducted GST pull-down assays. The full-length hMINKβ and a truncated mutant (296–959) containing the intermediate domain specifically bound to GST-Nck and GST-Nck-(1–270) with three SH3 domains (Fig. 3C), but not to the GST control (data not shown); whereas the mutant encoding the kinase domain (1–547), failed to interact with both GST-Nck and GST-Nck-(1–270) (Fig. 3C). Whether the CNH domain (960–1312) is involved in the association with Nck currently cannot be concluded because of its low levels of expression. The levels of hMINKβ proteins in cell lysates are shown in Fig. 3C. Together, these data indicate that hMINKβ associates with the SH3 domains of Nck mainly through its intermediate domain. This interaction was also confirmed with endogenous proteins (data not shown). Role of hMINKβ in Cytoskeleton Organization and Cell-Extracellular Matrix Adhesion—We have observed that overexpression of hMINKβ in Phoenix-A cells induced cell rounding and detachment, suggesting that hMINKβ might affect cytoskeleton organization (data not shown). To delineate the functional domains of hMINKβ that might be involved in the regulation of cell morphology, we generated a number of retroviral constructs expressing wild-type and mutant hMINKβ proteins as indicated in Fig. 4A. The viruses were introduced into human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells and the high expressing cells were enriched via fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on GFP signals. The expression levels of hMINKβ proteins in those cells were revealed by Western blot analysis with an antibody specifically raised against the intermediate domain of hMINKβ or anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B). The endogenous hMINKβ protein was shown as two bands in GFP-infected cells. Both wild-type and the kinase-deficient mutant of hMINKβ were expressed at higher levels relative to the endogenous protein, whereas the truncated mutants tended to be less stable and expressed at lower levels than the full-length protein. Actin filament rearrangement plays a major role in cellular morphological changes. The actin cytoskeleton in those infected cells was examined by TRITC-phalloidin staining.

However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the IKKα gene itself. The present study revealed that the transcriptional induction of the IKKα gene is positively regulated by binding ETS-1, the protein product of the ETS-1 proto-oncogene. Furthermore, ETS-1 mediated activation of IKKα is negatively regulated by p53 binding to ETS-1. By analyzing the genomic DNA sequence, we identified the putative IKKα promoter sequence in the 5′-flanking untranslated region of the IKKα gene. Transfection of EU-4, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, with plasmids containing the IKKα 5′-untranslated region sequence upstream of the luciferase reporter showed that this region possessed major promoter activity. Induction or enforced overexpression of p53 represses IKKα mRNA and protein expression as well as IKKα promoter activity. Deletion and mutation analyses as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that ETS-1 binds to the core IKKα promoter and strongly induces its activity. Although p53 does not directly bind to the IKKα promoter, it physically interacts with ETS-1 and specifically inhibits ETS-1-induced IKKα promoter activity. These results suggest that the proximal 5′-flanking region of the IKKα gene contains a functional promoter reciprocally regulated by p53 and ETS-1. Furthermore, loss of p53-mediated control over ETS-1-dependent transactivation of IKKα may represent a novel pathway for the constitutive activation of NF-kB-mediated gene expression and therapy resistance in cancer.

Unlike IKKβ, which is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, IKKα can shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (9Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol.

In the nucleus, IKKα is recruited to the promoter region of the NFkB-regulated genes, and activates their expression by interacting with cAMP-response element-binding protein as well as by phosphorylating histone H3, which is critical for the activation of NF-kB-directed gene expression (10Yamamoto Y.

Similarly, constitutively activated NF-kB (i.e. activation of NF-kB in cells without stimulation) has been associated with increased cell proliferation and survival in cancer cells, and may be linked to drug resistance in these cells (16Giri D.K.

Although the mechanisms by which NF-kB regulates resistance to apoptosis are not completely understood, it is believed that activated NF-kB in the nucleus protects cells against apoptosis through directly activating transcription of NF-kB-dependent genes.

A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Repression of the latter genes by p53 involves interactions of p53 with other transcriptional factors such as TBP, the TATA box-binding protein (41Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher F.J. II I LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8313-8323Google Scholar), Sp-1 (42Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol.

Both NF-kB activation and loss of wild-type (wt) p53 function are involved in progressive development of many cancers and resistance to chemotherapy; thus these two events may be associated. Previous studies have shown that WT p53 and the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-kB mutually repress each others ability to activate transcription through competitive binding to the cAMP-response element-binding protein (45Wadgaonkar R. Phelps K.M. Haque Z. Williams A.J. Silverman E.S. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1879-1882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 46Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that WT p53 can directly repress p65 promoter activity (47Gu L. Findley H.W. Zhou M. Blood. 2002; 99: 3367-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate an additional mechanism for the interaction of p53 and NF-kB. Our studies showed that p53 represses the expression of IKKα, and p53-repression of IKKα occurs at the transcriptional level. Because IKKα is important in regulating a novel NF-kB activation pathway, loss of p53 function by point mutation or overexpression of MDM2 may contribute to uncontrolled transactivation of IKKα in cancer cells resulting in increased survival and resistance to apoptosis because of enhanced NF-kB activation. Cell Lines—Three cell lines, EU-1, EU-4, and EU-8, established from children with B-cell precursor ALL were used in this study. The EU-1 line expresses WT p53, whereas EU-4 and EU-8 lack p53 expression (48Zhou M. Yeager A.M. Smith S.D. Findley H.W. Blood. 1995; 85: 1608-1614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines were grown in standard culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Identification and Construction of Full-length IKKα Promoter Plasmid—To date, there have been no studies of the IKKα gene promoter reported. We have searched the 5′-flanking untranslated DNA sequence of the IKKα gene by navigating the Human Genome web site (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genomes/index.html). A 1010-bp fragment from –940 to +70 in this region was generated by PCR using primers 5′-ATGAACTACTGTGCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCATGGGGCGGGAGG-3′, and cloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3 basic (Promega) at XhoI and HindIII sites to produce the pLuc-1010 construct. Generation of IKKα Promoter Deletion and Mutation Constructs—In addition to the full-length IKKα promoter plasmid, various 5′–3′ or 3′–5′ deletion constructs and site-directed mutants were made. For construction of the putative IKKα promoter, deletion constructs pLuc-508, pLuc-168, pLuc-120, pLuc-110, pLuc-100, pLuc-70, and pLuc-890 and PCR primer pairs were determined from the corresponding sites in the sequence of the 1010-bp fragment, and then used to make different constructs. Mutant pLuc-168mm construct was made using mutated nested primers at the Cys and Gly residues within the 10-bp motif, and mutant pLuc-1010m was made using mutated primers at the ETS-1 binding motif with a GGAA to TTAA substitution. Mutated promoter fragments were made by site-directed mutagenesis using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). Constructs including different deleted or mutated fragments were then ligated to the pGL3 basic vector. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the sequences of the PCR products were correct as compared with the sequence of the 5′-flanking UTR of the IKKα gene obtained from the Human Genome. Generation of ETS-1 and p53 Expression Plasmids—The ETS-1 expression plasmid was generated by inserting a cDNA fragment synthesized by RT-PCR into the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) at the NheI and HindIII sites. RT-PCR was performed using total RNA extracted from EU-1 cells and primer pairs 5′-GCGCGCTAGCAACTTGCTACCATCCCGT-3′ and 5′-GCGCAAGCTTTGCCAT-CACTCGTCGGCA-3′ that were designed from the ets-1 gene. We also constructed a pSUPERETS-1 siRNA plasmid by inserting a 19-nucleotide ETS-1 sequence into expression plasmid pSUPER, provided by Dr. Agami (Netherlands Cancer Institute), which directs the synthesis of siRNA-like transcripts. A forward primer: 5′-GATCCCCGATATGGAATGTGCAGATGTTCAAGAGACATCTGCACATTCCATATCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and a reverse primer: 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGATATGGAATGTGCAGATGTCTCTTGAACATCTGCACATTCCATATCGGG-3′ that contains a 19-nucleotide ETS-1 sequence selected from the coding region 100 bp from the start site were synthesized by the Emory University Microchemical Facility. The two 64-nucleotide primers were annealed in the buffer (100 mm potassium, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 2 mm Mg acetate) and phosphorylated in buffer containing T4 PNK. The annealed and phosphorylated oligos were then ligated into pSUPER vector digested with BglII and HindIII. The new construct was then transfected into Escherichia coli for propagation. The plasmid-containing insert was determined by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII. Positive clones have inserts of ∼360 bp as compared with empty vector (300 bp insert). Expression plasmids for WT p53 and four mutant p53 (p53–143, p53–175, p53–248, p53–273) as well as MDM2 were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). The p53–143 has mutant and WT conformations at 37.5 and 32.5 °C, respectively (49Zhang W. Guo X.Y. Hu G.Y. Liu W.B. Shay J.W. Deisseroth A.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Both transient and stable gene transfections were performed to analyze p53 induction and its effects on IKKα expression. For stable gene transfection, EU-4 cells in exponential growth were transfected with p53–143 or an empty control vector by electroporation at 290 V, 950 microfarads using a Gene Pulser II System (Bio-Rad). The cells were seeded 48 h post-transfection into culture dishes for the selection of G418-resistant colonies. Colonies were grown in methylcellulose medium containing G-418 for 2–3 weeks, and clones are picked and grown in RPMI medium with or without G-418 for the duration of the experiments. For gene reporter assay, cells were transiently co-transfected by electroporation with the IKKα promoter-luciferase constructs as described above and different forms of p53 (WT and mutants), MDM2, ETS-1, and ETS-1 siRNA expression plasmids. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells in exponential growth were mixed with the corresponding IKKα promoter-luciferase constructs plus different doses of p53, MDM2, ETS-1, and ETS-1 siRNA plasmids and electroporated as described above. Transfected cells were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At 48 h post-transfection, cell extracts were prepared with 1× lysis buffer, and then 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and analyzed on a Microplate Luminometer (Turner Designs). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. Western Blot Assay—Cells were lysed in a buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min at 4 °C. After clarification, equal amounts of protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. After blocking with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 500 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the filter was incubated with specific antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After stripping, the filter was reprobed with an anti-actin antibody (Calbiochem) as a control for equal protein loading and protein integrity. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed to analyze the effect of p53 on IKKα mRNA expression. Total RNA was prepared from EU-4/p53–143 cells and control cells shifted to 32.5 °C for different times with the Ultraspec Reagent (Biotecx). RT-PCR was conducted using an Access RT-PCR Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The oligonucleotide primers used to analyze IKKα transcripts were: forward, 5′-CAGTATCTGGCCCCAGAGCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGCCCACACTTTACGCAGC-3′. β-Actin was used as an internal control. The PCR products were visualized with ethidium bromide staining under UV light after electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel. CHIP Assay—The CHIP assay as described previously (47Gu L. Findley H.W. Zhou M. Blood. 2002; 99: 3367-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was performed to analyze the DNA binding activity of p53 and ETS-1 protein to IKKα promoter. EU-4 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of IKKα promoter construct pLuc-508 and 10 μg of either p53 or ETS-1 expression plasmids by electroporation as described above. After 48 h, formaldehyde was added at 1% to the culture media and cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with mild shaking to cross-link ETS-1 and p53 protein to the IKKα promoter. Then, cells (1 × 106) were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After a brief sonication, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors as above. Anti-p53 and anti-ETS-1 or control antibodies were added at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by protein A/G plus-agarose. Precipitants were sequentially washed with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), once, respectively, followed by two washes with 1× TE. After the final wash, 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) was added, and the precipitants were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with rotation. Then 5 m NaCl was added to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. After precipitation with ethanol, the pellets were resuspended and treated with proteinase K. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and subjected to PCR amplification using forward and reverse primers (5′-GTGGTTCCGTTCAGCCCT-3′ and 5′-TGCTCGCGCGTCTTTG-3′) to the pLuc-508 fragment. The resulting product was 188 bp and contained the last two putative p53 consensus sequences as well as the ETS-1-binding motif in the IKKα promoter. The PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. EMSA—Sequence-specific DNA binding activity of ETS-1 to IKKα promoter was assayed by EMSA. Nuclear protein extraction was prepared using a kit (NE-PER™ from Pierce). Nuclear protein (5 μg) from EU-1 and EU-4 cells was incubated for 15 min in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm MgCl) plus 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) carrier, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe 5′-GTTACCGGAAGTGACGCATT-3′ spanning the –50/–31 IKKα promoter that contains the ETS-1 consensus (CCGGAAGT). A mutated probe of 5′-GTTACCTTAAGTGACGCATT-3′ with changes of the ETS-1 core consensus from GGAA to TTAA (underlined) served as control. Anti-ETS-1 and rabbit IgG antibodies as additional controls were used to supershift the specific complexes of interest by pretreating the extract for 1 h at 4 °C with antibodies. The samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and developed with an intensifying screen at –70 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation—EU-1 or EU-4 cells transiently transfected with p53 were lysed in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. After centrifugation, 30 μg of the clarified cell lysate was incubated with 15 μl of protein G plus/protein A-agarose and 1 μg of p53, MDM2, or ETS-1 antibodies, respectively. After 24 h incubation, the agarose was centrifuged, washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated protein was further analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Identification of the Proximal 5′-Flanking Region of the IKKα Gene—By navigating the Human Genome, we found the nucleotide sequence of the proximal 5′-flanking UTR of the IKKα gene. The DNA sequence 5′ to the start site that represents a known transcription start site of the IKKα coding sequence is shown in Fig. 1. The DNA sequence of the 5′-flanking UTR of the IKKα gene contains three potential p53 response consensus sites located between nucleotides –345 to –322, –98 to –78, and –29 to +1. These putative p53 response elements are associated with a canonical p53 consensus sequence that consists of two copies of a decamer motif 5′-RRRCWWGYYY-3′ separated by 0 to 13 bp of random nucleotides, in the motif, R = G or A, W = T or A, Y = C or T (34Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Moreover, an ETS-1-binding site (–46 to –39) was found in the most likely core promoter region of the IKKα gene. Repression of IKKα Promoter Activity by WT p53—To determine the promoter activity of the sequence located 5′ to the IKKα gene, a fragment of DNA spanning nucleotides –940 to +70 was placed 5′ to the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3 basic. The level of luciferase activity was examined upon transient transfection into EU-4 cells. Substantial levels of luciferase activity were detected if the transfected reporter construct contained the –940 to +70 sequence in the sense but not in the antisense orientation (data not shown). To investigate whether the IKKα promoter is regulated by p53, the IKKα promoter-luciferase construct and plasmids containing WT p53 and various forms of mutant p53 were co-transfected into EU-4 cells, respectively. From the data presented in Fig. 2A, it can be seen that WT p53 produced a 70–80% decrease in IKKα promoter activity (relative to the control plasmid CMV-neo), whereas p53 mutations in codon 143, 175, 248, and 273 increased (2.5–4.5-fold) the IKKα promoter activity. Repression of IKKα promoter activity by WT p53 was dose-dependent, and this inhibitory effect was reversed by co-transfection with MDM2 (Fig. 2B). Titrations of transfected p53 and MDM2 in cellular extracts were determined by Western blot assay (Fig. 2B, inset). Inhibition of IKKα Expression by WT p53—To further evaluate whether p53 regulates IKKα expression, the p53-null ALL cell line EU-4 was utilized for either stable transfection with a temperature-sensitive p53 allele encoding alanine at codon 143 or transient transfection with a p21 promoter-luciferase construct. The p53 protein in p53–143 transfected EU-4 (EU-4/p53–143) cells selected from a single clone exists in a mutant conformation at 37.5 °C, and temperature shift to 32.5 °C induces a WT conformation of p53. As shown in Fig. 3A, the promoter activity of the p53 target gene p21 was induced in a time-dependent manner in EU-4/p53–143 cells cultured at 32.5 °C. Moreover, Western blot assay showed that expression of endogenous p21 and MDM2, also p53 targets, was increased in EU-4/p53–143 cells at 32.5 °C (Fig. 3B), indicating that a functional WT p53 was induced in EU-4 transfected with p53–143 mutant at 32.5 °C. Under the same experimental conditions, however, expression of IKKα was down-regulated in EU-4/p53–143 cells, whereas the levels of IKKβ, IKKγ, and the housekeeping gene actin remained unchanged (Fig. 3C). To further characterize whether IKKα mRNA is repressed by p53, we performed RT-PCR analysis in EU-4/p53–143 cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, the expression of IKKα mRNA was rapidly and strongly decreased in EU-4/p53–143 cells cultured at 32.5 °C. The expression of IKKα mRNA remained unchanged in EU-4 cells transfected with a control plasmid (CMV-neo) at 32.5 °C. IKKα Promoter Activity Is Induced Primarily by ETS-1—To determine the core promoter region of the IKKα gene, we generated a series of deleted constructs of the IKKα promoter and performed transfection and luciferase activity assays. Our results demonstrated that the core promoter regi"

A number of reported experiments indicate that dissociation of the TTR tetramer occurs prior to fibril formation, and therefore, studies aiming at the discovery of compounds that stabilize the protein quaternary structure, thereby acting as amyloid inhibitors, are being performed. The ability of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to act as a competitive inhibitor for the thyroid hormone binding to TTR indicated a possible stabilizing effect of DES upon binding. Here we report the crystallographic study of DES binding to TTR. The structural data reveal two different binding modes, both located in the thyroxine binding channel. In both cases, DES binds deeply in the channel and establishes interactions with the equivalent molecule present in the adjacent binding site. The most remarkable features of DES interaction with TTR are its hydrophobic interactions within the protein halogen binding pockets, where its ethyl groups are snugly fitted, and the hydrogen bonds established at the center of the tetramer with Ser-117. Experiments concerning amyloid formation in vitro suggest that DES is effectively an amyloid inhibitor in acid-mediated fibrillogenesis and may be used for the design of more powerful drugs. The present study gave us further insight in the molecular mechanism by which DES competes with thyroid hormone binding to TTR and highlights key interactions between DES and TTR that oppose amyloid formation.

Amyloidoses are protein-misfolding diseases characterized by the conversion of a soluble protein into insoluble fibrils with a β-sheet secondary structure that deposit extracellularly. Transthyretin (TTR) 1The abbreviations used are: TTR, transthyretin; T4, thyroxine; DES, diethylstilbestrol; BM-I, binding mode I; BM-II, binding mode II; ThT, thioflavin T; r.m.s., root mean square; WT, wild type. is associated with two such diseases; the non-mutated form is found in amyloid deposits of patients suffering from senile systemic amyloidosis, whereas a large number of variants are linked to the neurodegenerative disease familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (1Saraiva M.J.M. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is a 54-kDa protein that transports in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, thyroxine (T4), and the retinol-binding protein-retinol complex in plasma (2Nilsson S.F. Rask L. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8554-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Additionally, TTR is also known to bind the products of thyroxine metabolism as well as a variety of pharmacological agents such as penicillin, salicylate, cardioactive agents, and steroids (4Cavalieri R.R. Pitt-Rivers R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 33: 55-80PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structure for TTR was determined by C. Blake et al. (5Blake C.C. Geisow M.J. Oatley S.J. Rerat B. Rerat C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) revealing a tetramer, with molecular 222 symmetry, composed of identical subunits assembled around a central channel where two T4 binding sites are located (5Blake C.C. Geisow M.J. Oatley S.J. Rerat B. Rerat C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Each monomer has a β-sandwich structure formed by two β-sheets, composed of strands DAGH and CBEF. A small helical fragment connects strands E and F. Although strands DAGH mold the channel surface, the other strands CBEF define the external surface of monomer in the tetrameric structure. Two monomers linked by hydrogen bonds between strands FF′ and HH′ form one dimer. The tetramer assembly involves two dimers linked by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between loop AB from one dimer and strand H from the other dimer. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between TTR and retinol-binding protein has been determined, showing that retinol-binding protein binds at the surface and does not interfere with T4 binding (3Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The protein T4 binding site was also fully described (6Paz P.D.L. Burridge J.M. Oatley S.J. Blake C.C.F. Beddel C.R. The Design of Drugs to Macromolecular Targets. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). There are two equivalent T4 binding domains, each of them comprising three symmetry-related sets of pockets in which the hormone halogen atoms accommodate: an innermost P3 pocket, a hydrophobic central P2 pocket, and the outermost P1 pocket that is positioned in the channel entry near the charged Lys-15 and Glu-54 residues. All pockets present a core for hydrophobic interactions, whereas extra hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are made available by conformational changes of the TTR side chains. Although both binding sites are sterically identical, the binding affinity is 2 orders of magnitude higher for the binding of the first T4 molecule (Ka1 = 108m-1/Ka2 = 106m-1), and therefore, a negative cooperativity mechanism has been proposed (7Cheng S.Y.

The single mutations associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy point to a destabilization of TTR, accelerating the dissociation of the folded tetramer into monomeric amyloidogenic intermediates (9Damas A.M.

In vitro studies have shown that binding of the natural ligand T4 to the TTR central hydrophobic channel stabilizes the tetramer and consequently reduces amyloid fibril formation (12Miroy G.J. Lai Z.

In the past few years, considerable effort has been directed to the discovery of small molecules that could prevent TTR dissociation by binding in the protein central channel (13Klabunde T.

Actually, stabilization of the native tetrameric fold, upon high affinity binding of a small compound, is considered to be a potential therapeutic strategy to senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy variants (15Hammarstrom P.

Investig. 2004; 84: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen that was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor for thyroid hormone binding to TTR (17Ishihara A. Sawatsubashi S. Yamauchi K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 199: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This result suggested to us that it might act as an amyloid inhibitor. It contains two hydrophobic phenyl groups with hydroxyl substituents that are connected by an ethylene group, a molecular structure that is similar to the structure of resveratrol, a compound that has been described as an inhibitor of fibrilogenesis (13Klabunde T. Petrassi H.M. Oza V.B. Raman P. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To obtain structural information about TTR·DES binding mode and find out essential features of the ligand that are responsible for the affinity of the compound to TTR, the structure of TTR·DES complex was determined by x-ray crystallography. In addition, the ability of DES to inhibit fibril formation, in vitro, was assayed. Protein Complex Preparation and Crystallization—Recombinant TTR-WT was expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated and purified as reported previously (18Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brouwer A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DES (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO at 50 mg/ml. The protein sample was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), concentrated to 21 mg/ml, and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of DES. The TTR·DES solution was mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution (2.4 m ammonium sulfate, 7% glycerol, and 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.4) and equilibrated against the latter solution by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Both orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals were obtained at 14 °C, after three months. Crystals were sequentially transferred to solutions similar to the reservoir solution but with increasing concentrations of the cryoprotectant glycerol (10-25%) and subsequently flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data sets were collected from two crystals using synchrotron radiation at beamline ID14-EH3 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. Diffraction data were measured at 100 K using a MARCCD detector. Determination of the crystal orientation and integration of the reflections was performed with MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierri J.C. Crystallographic Computing 5: From Chemistry to Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992Google Scholar). The data were scaled and reduced using the programs SCALA and TRUNCATE (20Collaborative Computational Project No 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Two different crystal forms were observed for the TTR·DES complex, an orthorhombic form (TTR·DES1) and a monoclinic form (TTR·DES2), which diffracted to 1.8- and 1.85-å; resolution, respectively. The TTR·DES1 crystal belongs to space group P21212 with lattice parameters a = 42.3 å, b = 85.4 å, c = 63.4 å, and two monomers in the asymmetric unit. TTR·DES2 complex crystallized in space group C2 with four monomers in the asymmetric unit and unit cell dimensions a = 74.3 å, b = 97.0 å, c = 81.7 å, and β = 107.9°. The Matthews coefficient is 2.1 å3 Da-1 for TTR·DES1, indicating a solvent content of ∼42%, whereas in the case of TTR·DES2, the Matthews coefficient is 2.6 å3 Da-1, corresponding to a solvent content of nearly 52%. Structure Solution—The program AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) was used for computing the molecular replacement solutions for both TTR·DES complexes, using the atomic coordinates of human TTR T119M variant (Protein Data Bank accession number 1F86), refined at 1.1-å resolution (22Sebastiao M.P. Lamzin V. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Calculations including data from 15- to 3.5-å resolution yielded correct solutions for both the rotation and the translation functions. After rigid body fitting, the correlation coefficient for the rendered solution of TTR·DES1 was 70.5, whereas for TTR·DES2, it was 63.1, and the corresponding R-factors were 0.34 and 0.36, respectively. Model Building and Crystallographic Refinement—To reduce systematic errors during refinement, the molecular replacement solutions were improved by a preliminary step of rigid body refinement, which was performed with CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). This program was then used for simulated annealing and subsequent positional and individual temperature factor refinement of the models. The refinement cycles included 95% of the data, whereas a random sample of 5% of the reflections was used for Rfree calculation. After each cycle of automated refinement, the model was inspected and manually adjusted to the computed σA-weighted (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc)-type electron density maps using the graphic program Turbo-FRODO (24Roussel A. Cambilleau C. TurboFRODO in Silicon Graphics Geometry. Sillicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar) on an SGI graphic work station. Water molecules were added manually at the positions of positive peaks (>3 σ) on the difference Fourier maps, when good hydrogen bond geometry was available. Several cycles of crystallographic refinement iterated with manual model building were performed until the protein models were completely fitted to the Fourier maps. The difference electron density maps clearly showed, on both binding pockets of the TTR tetramer, positive electron density. The atomic coordinates of the DES molecule taken from the HIC-UP data base (25Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) were used to build a model of the ligand into the density. At that point, refinement of the TTR·DES complexes proceeded using ARP/WARP v.6.0 (26Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which makes use of the CCP4 program REFMAC5 (27Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). After the last round of refinement, the ligand and its symmetry-related positions were in good agreement with difference electron density maps. All residues of both complexes were in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, as calculated with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Hutchinson E. Thorton J. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure was further validated with the program WHAT_CHECK (29Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The overall statistics for data collection and refinement are given in Table I below. The coordinates for the TTR·DES1 and TTR·DES2 crystallographic models as well as the correspondent structure factors have been deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1TT6 and 1TZ8, respectively.Table ISummary of crystallographic analysis and refinement statistics for both DES·TTR complexesWT-DES1WT-DES2Crystallographic analysisResolution range (Å)42.69–1.856.77–1.85Space groupP21212C2Unit cell dimensions (Å) (°)a = 42.3, b = 85.4, c = 63.4 α = β = γ = 90a = 74.3, b = 97.0, c = 81.7 α = γ = 90, β = 107.9Number of observations (unique)2197946580Multiplicity (overall)4.63.0RmergeaRmerge = ΣΣhΣiIhi – 〈Ih〉/Σh Σi 〈Ih〉, where Ihi is the observed intensity of the ith measurement of reflection (h), including symmetry related ones, and 〈Ih〉 is the mean intensity of the i observations of reflection h over all measurements of Ihi (overall/outer shell)6.2/35.06.4/26.7Completeness (%) (overall/outer shell)99.9/99.699.4/98.9I/σ(I) (overall/outer shell)9.3/2.19.8/2.5Structure refinementR-factorbR-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ – |Fc∥/Σ |Fo| where |Fo| and |Fc| are observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively/RfreecRfree is the cross-validation R-factor computed for a randomly chosen subset of 5% of the total number of reflections, which were not used during refinement(%)18.7/21.819.5/22.1Number of unique reflections (working/test set)21724/112046540/2314Water molecules145322Additional small moleculesGlycerol/sulfateGlycerol/Me2SO acetate/carbonateResidues with alternate conformation (A, B, C, E, and F refer to different monomers in the asymmetric unit)S115A,S117A, S85B,S115B, S117BC10A, S115A, S117A, S115C, S117C, S23E, I107E, S115E, S115FTotal number of atoms19093849Number of protein atoms17123437Average overall B-factor (Å2)18.41627.134Average protein B-factor (Å2)16.88125.778Average main-chain B-factor (Å2)16.25925.134Average side-chain B-factor (Å2)17.60326.520Average water B-factor (Å2)32.61539.174Average ligand B-factor (Å2)26.79433.588r.m.s. bonded Bs (Å2)1.2891.418r.m.s. deviations from ideal valuesBonds (Å)0.0080.011Angles (°)1.2891.418Ramachandran plot statisticsMost favored region (%)91.591.8Additionally allowed region (%)8.57.7Generously allowed region (%)00.5a Rmerge = ΣΣhΣiIhi – 〈Ih〉/Σh Σi 〈Ih〉, where Ihi is the observed intensity of the ith measurement of reflection (h), including symmetry related ones, and 〈Ih〉 is the mean intensity of the i observations of reflection h over all measurements of Ihib R-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ – |Fc∥/Σ |Fo| where |Fo| and |Fc| are observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectivelyc Rfree is the cross-validation R-factor computed for a randomly chosen subset of 5% of the total number of reflections, which were not used during refinement Open table in a new tab Fibril Formation and Quantitative Thioflavin (ThT) Fluorescence Assay—Fibrils were produced by acidification and incubation during 72 h at 37 °C of solutions containing TTR at the average physiologic concentration (3.6 μm). This assay is based on previously described protocols (30Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 31Hammarstrom P. Schneider F. Kelly J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 2459-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, series of solutions (247.5 μl) containing 7.2 μm TTR in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl were prepared. Then, 2.5 μl of concentrated stocks (0.72 and 1.44 mm) of inhibitor (DES or resveratrol) dissolved in Me2SO were added to the TTR solution to achieve the final desired concentrations of inhibitor. Me2SO (2.5 μl) was added to TTR to determine the amount of fibril formation without the inhibitors. The samples were preincubated during 30 min (37 °C) and then were diluted 1:1 with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.2) containing 100 mm KCl, to yield solutions with 3.6 μm TTR at pH 4.4 and different concentrations of inhibitor (0, 3.6, and 7.2 μm). Triplicates were set for each concentration of DES. After incubation at 37 °C for a further 72 h, the suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was carefully resuspended in 250 μl of a solution containing 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 10 μm ThT. Fluorescence measurements were recorded in a SPECTRAmax microplate spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. The suspensions were excited at 440 nm, and the emission intensity at 482 nm, which is characteristic of ThT bound to amyloid fibrils (32Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), was recorded to measure the amount of fibrillar aggregates present in solution. To control the effect of the inhibitors over the ThT fluorescence experiments, 1.25 μl of the inhibitor solution (1.44 mm) were added to the suspensions previously incubated without inhibitor. The suspensions were mixed and then excited at 440 nm, being the emission intensity recorded at 482 nm. Refinement of the Crystal Structures—Two different crystal forms for the TTR·DES complex were found on the same crystallization drop. The orthorhombic crystal form TTR·DES1 diffracted to 1.8 å, whereas diffraction data could be collected to 1.85 å for the monoclinic crystal, here referred to as TTR·DES2. Both structures were refined to the crystallographic R-factors of 18.7 and 19.5% and Rfree of 21.8 and 22.1% for TTR·DES1 and TTR·DES2, respectively. The final models display good stereochemistry, and the r.m.s. deviation values for all Cα bond lengths and angle-bonded distances are presented in Table I. The main-chain dihedral angles for all residues in both complexes are on the allowed positions of the Ramachandran plot, which was calculated with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Hutchinson E. Thorton J. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to the ligand, glycerol molecules were found in the electron density maps, in close proximity to the binding site. The hydroxyl groups from glycerol are hydrogen-bonded to several amino acid side chains, namely Ser-112, Ser-115, Ser-117, and to the main chain carbonyl group of Leu-110. A total of 145 and 322 water molecules were positioned, within proper hydrogen-bonding distances, for TTR·DES1 and TTR·DES2, respectively. An excess of DES was used during the preparation of the complex, and therefore, full ligand saturation was considered in all binding sites. In both structure complexes, two symmetry-related ligand positions arise in each binding site due to the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis that bisects the binding channel. However, in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic form, one of the binding sites has no 2-fold symmetry, and the initial orientation of DES was much clearer in the electron density maps. Accordingly, the binding of DES, in which the 2-fold symmetry axis was present, was described with a 50% statistical disorder, and therefore, half-occupancy was assigned to those molecules, whereas full occupancy was assigned for the molecule in the other binding site. The final models for both complexes included not only ligand molecules but also molecules that were added in the buffers used for complex preparations or crystallization (Table I). The nine N-terminal residues were not defined in the electron density maps and are thus omitted in the final models of both TTR variants. Similarly, the three terminal residues 125-127 are missing for both models, with the exception of Pro-125 in monomer C of TTR·DES2. In addition, atoms from the side chains of a few residues, which were disordered in the final electron density map, were thus excluded from the final model. Alternative conformations were modeled for some residues of both complexes and were refined with the ARP/WARP procedure constraining the sum of both conformations to the occupancy of 1.0 (Table I). The TTR·DES1 Complex—The TTR·DES1 complex crystallized in the orthorombic space group P21212, as is true of most of the reported structures of human TTR and TTR complexes (5Blake C.C. Geisow M.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2416-2424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are two monomers per asymmetric unit, designated by A and B, which form a dimer that associates with another dimer related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, forming a tetramer with 2-fold symmetry along the axis of the protein-binding channel. Therefore, each binding site consists of a pair of symmetry-related monomers, A/A′ or B/B′ (prime specifies a symmetry-related monomer or residue), and the observed electron density for the DES molecule is an average of the two symmetry-related positions (Fig. 2A). The protein-drug observed interactions were the same for both binding sites. DES is located in the T4 binding channel. However, it is positioned nearly 4 å deeper, toward the center of the tetramer, as compared with T4 (35Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As already mentioned, in the binding of T4 to the protein, three sets of halogen pockets were reported as establishing important and close contacts between TTR and the hormone. Our molecular model shows that the DES distal phenyl group establishes hydrophobic contacts with the surrounding residues Leu-110, Leu-110′, and Ser-117, Ser-117′ (Fig. 2A). The ligand also induces a conformational shift of the side chain of Ser-117, which has double conformation (Fig. 3A), one of the conformations being responsible for favorable interactions between the protein and the inhibitor. In fact, DES p-hydroxyl group establishes hydrogen bonds to the Oγ atoms of both Ser-117 residues, bridging the two dimers and contributing to an overall stabilization of the native tetrameric fold. The second conformation of Ser-117 may also contribute to stabilize the tetramer since it forms intersubunit hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyls of the Ser-117 from adjacent monomers in the same dimer. This extra intersubunit interaction was also observed in the TTR T119M variant (22Sebastiao M.P. Lamzin V. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which is known to have a protective effect over the amyloidogenic V30M TTR mutation, probably due to a more stable native state (31Hammarstrom P. Schneider F. Kelly J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 2459-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 36Alves I.L. Altland K. Almeida M.R. Winter P. Saraiva M.J. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although DES does not strongly interact with Thr-119, an amino acid, the side chain of which is in the binding channel, the water molecule hydrogen-bonded to Thr-119 in the TTR crystal structures is displaced upon DES binding. As a result, Thr-119 undergoes a conformational change that makes its hydroxyl group accessible to a new hydrogen bond with an ordered water molecule that connects the two symmetry-related dimers through the interaction with the main-chain carbonyl group of Asp-18′ (Fig. 3C). Additional non-polar contacts are observed for the ethyl groups of DES, which fit tightly in the central binding pockets P2 and P2′, between the side chains of Ala-108, Leu-17, Leu-110, and Thr-119. Near the channel entrance, the proximal aromatic ring is oriented between the side chains of Leu-17, Ala-108, and Lys-15, taking advantage of hydrophobic and van der Waals contacts with these residues and mediating interactions between adjacent subunits. In addition, the p-hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the ϵ-ammonium groups of Lys-15, contributing to DES binding affinity to TTR and probably averting the repulsion that may occur between the two positively charged Lys-15 residues from the adjacent dimers (37Hammarstrom P. Jiang X. Deechongkit S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11453-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2061811233,"The functional relevance of putative Ca2+ binding motifs previously identified with Ca2+ overlay binding analysis within the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor isoform (RyR1) was examined using mutational analysis. EF hands between amino acid positions 4081 and 4092 (EF1) and 4116 and 4127 (EF2) were scrambled singly or in combination within the full-length rabbit RyR1 cDNA. These cDNAs were expressed in 1B5 RyR-deficient myotubes and channel function assessed using Ca2+-imaging techniques, [3H]ryanodine binding measurements, and single channel experiments. In intact myotubes, these mutations did not affect functional responses to either depolarization or RyR agonists (caffeine, 4-chloro-m-cresol) compared with wtRyR1. However, in [3H]ryanodine binding measurements, both Ca2+ activation and inhibition of the EF1 mutant was significantly altered compared with wtRyR1. No high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding was observed in membranes expressing the EF2 mutation, although in single channel measurements, the EF2-disrupted channel could be activated by micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. In addition, micromolar levels of ryanodine placed these channels into the classical half-conductance state, thus indicating that occupancy of high affinity ryanodine binding sites is not required for ryanodine-induced subconductance states in RyR1.

However, in [3H]ryanodine binding experiments, the Ca2+-dependent activation and inactivation of mutated RyRs containing EF3, EF4, or EF5 was unaffected when compared with wtRyR1. Calcium plays a critical role in skeletal muscle contraction. During excitation-contraction coupling, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; RyR1, ryanodine receptor isoform 1; 4-CmC, 4-chloro-m-cresol; HSV, Herpes simplex virus; ANOVA, analysis of variance; wt, wild type. through activation of the intracellular calcium release channel known as the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Upon release, calcium binds to troponin C in the myosin head assembly to trigger muscle contraction. However, calcium also regulates the contractile process by modulating activity of key proteins involved in EC coupling including the RyR itself. In fact, calcium has biphasic effects on RyR activity. At micromolar levels, calcium stimulates the channel in a process known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) whereas at millimolar levels, calcium inhibits RyR activity. This biphasic action is thought to occur through the binding of calcium to two classes of regulatory sites on the RyR, a stimulatory high affinity site and an inhibitory low affinity site (1Meissner G. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: d2072-d2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several potential calcium regulatory sites have been identified within the primary sequence of the RyR. A potential “calcium sensor” (i.e. a region of the RyR required for calcium activation of the channel) was identified at position 3885 of the RyR3 isoform. Mutation of this highly conserved glutamate to alanine resulted in a channel with drastically altered calcium-sensing properties in single channel studies (2Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A subsequent report mutating the analogous residue in RyR2 yielded similar findings (3Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the functional effects of the analogous mutation in RyR1 (E4032A) could be reversed using high concentrations of ryanodine (4Fessenden J.D. Chen L. Wang Y. Paolini C. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2865-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Whether this residue is involved in translating calcium binding to channel activation is still open to debate. In addition, two EF hand calcium binding protein motifs (5Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) have been identified within the RyR primary sequence using sequence comparisons between rabbit skeletal muscle (RyR1), cardiac (RyR2), and the analogous skeletal muscle RyR isoform from lobster (6Xiong H. Feng X. Gao L. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Seok J.H. Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lobster isoform contains an EF hand motif that, when expressed as a peptide fragment, strongly bound 45Ca2+ in overlay and equilibrium binding studies. However much weaker 45Ca2+ binding was observed when the corresponding EF hand motif peptides from mammalian RyR1 and RyR2 were tested. Similarly, peptide fragments derived from the RyR homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans containing these EF hand motif bound 45Ca2+ in overlay experiments (7Hamada T. Sakube Y. Ahnn J. Kim do H. Kagawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, three highly negatively charged EF hand-like sequences in the C-terminal portion of the RyR were predicted after the initial cloning of RyR1 (8Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Masuto H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). RyR peptides containing these sequences bound 45Ca2+ in gel overlay assays (9Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23318-23326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an antibody raised against positions 4478–4512 of RyR1 (a region containing the third putative calcium binding sequence) abolished calcium sensing in single channel studies of the RyR (10Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13414-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggested that at least one of the putative sites in this region was the high affinity calcium binding site on RyR1 that mediates calcium activation of the channel. To determine the functional significance of these predicted calcium binding sequences on RyR1 function, we have used mutational analysis to disrupt these regions in the rabbit RyR1 cDNA and then expressed these mutated RyRs in a dyspedic skeletal muscle cell line (1B5). We then examined the caffeine sensitivity of these mutated RyRs in intact cells as well as the ability of Ca2+ to regulate these proteins using [3H]ryanodine binding techniques and single channel analysis. Cloning—The complementary DNA encoding the rabbit skeletal muscle RyR isoform (RyR1) has previously been cloned into pHSVpr-PUC thus enabling the generation of HSV amplicons required for transduction of 1B5 myotubes (11Wang Y. Fraefel C. Protasi F. Moore R.A. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. DiFrancesco A. Breakefield X. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C619-C626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putative EF hand regions were mutated to the sequences described in Fig. 1 using primer extension-driven site-directed mutagenesis. The primers used to create these EF hand mutations are indicated below. (Note: mutated sequence is indicated in lowercase letters.) EF1 (positions 12235–12276 of rabbit wtRyR1 cDNA sequence): forward 5′-GGCCTTCCAGgactacggcgacaaaccctctaagcttATCTCCAAAAAGGAC-3′, reverse 5′GTCCTTTTTGGAGATaagcttagagggtttgtcgccGTAGTCCTGGAAGGCC-3′.

EF5 (13458–13497): forward 5′-CCCGgGCCCcAGCCTcAGCCTcAGAAAGCCG-3′, reverse 5′-CcCGGGCTgCGGTTgTGGAACCAGCTCCTCC-3′. PCR products generated using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) were cloned into TOPO-TA vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and confirmed using bi-directional DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—1B5 myotubes were prepared as described previously (12Moore R.A. Nguyen H. Galceran J. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A. Chen S.R.W. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2509-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After 5 days, differentiated myotubes were transduced with the RyR constructs using equivalent amounts of HSV virions (11Wang Y. Fraefel C. Protasi F. Moore R.A. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. DiFrancesco A. Breakefield X. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C619-C626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contained the cDNAs encoding the RyRs. Myotubes were then incubated for 2 days to allow full expression of the RyRs before testing. Calcium Imaging—Changes in intracellular Ca2+ in 1B5 myotubes were measured using the Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-4 as described (14Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 1B5 myotubes were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C, and changes in intracellular Ca2+ were monitored at ×40 magnification (UPlanApo/340, Olympus; Melville, NY) using a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope (Nikon; Melville, NY). Fluo-4 was excited at 495 nm using a DeltaRam lightsource (Photon Technology, Inc.; Monmouth Junction, NJ) and emitted fluorescence from the 1B5 myotubes was measured using an XR/Mega-12 ICCD camera (Stanford Photonics Inc.; Palo Alto, CA). Resultant images were acquired at the rate of 12 images per second and record traces representing changes in fluorescence of individual cells were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Myotubes were challenged with either successive additions of 80 mm KCl, 40 mm caffeine, and 0.5 mm 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC), or a graded series of caffeine concentrations dissolved in imaging solution. Quantification of Ca2+Transients and Determination of Caffeine EC50—Calcium transients were quantified as described previously (14Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In caffeine dose response experiments, EC50 values for activation by caffeine were obtained for each RyR-expressing myotube by fitting a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope using Prism V. 3.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). The EC50 values reported for each construct were then obtained by averaging the EC50 values of all individual myotubes expressing a particular RyR. EC50 values for each mutated RyR were then compared with wtRyR1 EC50 values obtained from myotubes imaged on the same experimental day. Comparison of EC50 values between wild-type and mutant RyRs was made using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Dunnett's post-test. A significant difference was inferred at p < 0.05. Binding Assay Sample Preparation and Immunoblotting—Crude membrane preparations used for [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel studies were prepared and characterized using Western blot techniques as described previously (13Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A. Chen S.R.W. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2509-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that each mutant construct was of identical size to wtRyR1 (data not shown). [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assays—[3H]Ryanodine (specific activity 56 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Specific binding of [3H]ryanodine to SR preparations was performed as described previously (14Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ability of crude SR preparations containing wild type or mutant RyR1 channels to bind 5 nm [3H]ryanodine was determined in 0.5-ml assays by incubating 35 μg of SR vesicles/assay in buffer consisting of 250 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.1 (KOH), 100 μm EGTA, and variable amounts of CaCl2. Final free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the WebMaxChelator program. Binding reactions conducted at 37 °C for 3 h were terminated by rapid filtration onto GF/B glass fiber filters and then rinsed with 3 × 2 ml of ice cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The amount of [3H]ryanodine bound to each filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. EC50 values were determined by fitting the data points obtained with 0–100 μm [Ca2+]f to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope. IC50 values were determined by fitting data points obtained with 0.1–30 mm [Ca2+]f to a one-site competition model with variable slope. Both analyses were performed using Prism V. 3.0 software. Individual EC50 and IC50 values from separate dose response experiments were averaged together and compared using 2-way ANOVA. Single Channel Measurements—Single channel behavior was measured by fusing membrane vesicles isolated from 1B5 myotubes containing the EF2 mutation into artificial planar lipid bilayers (5:2 phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine, 50 mg/ml in decane). The membrane preparation was introduced to the cis chamber as described previously (15Feng W. Liu G. Xia R. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 821-831PubMed Google Scholar). This chamber contained 0.7 ml of 500 mm CsCl, varied CaCl2 (10 nm to 10 μm) and 20 mm HEPES (pH7.4), whereas the trans side contained 50 mm CsCl, and 20 mm HEPES (pH7.4). Single channel activity of EF2 was measured at a holding potential of +40 mV (applied cis relative to the trans, i.e. ground side) using a patch clamp amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp, Hamden, CT). The data were filtered at 1 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz with a DigiData1320A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The data were analyzed using pClamp 9 (Axon Instruments) without additional filtering. Five putative calcium binding sequences have been proposed in the wtRyR1 primary sequence between amino acid positions 4000 and 4500 (Fig. 1A). EF hands 1 and 2, identified during the cloning of the lobster RyR1 cDNA (6Xiong H. Feng X. Gao L. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Seok J.H. Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) are each comprised of a classical helix-loop-helix motif that contains potential calcium-chelating amino acid residues located at the X, Y, Z, –X, and –Z positions of the calcium binding loop (Fig. 1B). To determine the potential functional significance of these putative EF hands, we scrambled these sequences, maintaining the overall amino acid composition but disrupting the spatial arrangement of the amino acids within the calcium binding loop. In particular, we ensured that the negatively charged amino acids at the –z position were not present in each of the scrambled Ca2+ binding loops since most EF hands contain either a glutamic or aspartic acid residue at this position. We also created a double mutant, EF1–2 that contained both scrambled sequences. To determine the functional consequences of each mutation, we expressed these RyRs in 1B5 myotubes and examined calcium transients elicited by 80 mm KCl (to test for depolarization-induced calcium release (i.e. EC coupling)), 40 mm caffeine, and 0.5 mm 4-CmC. These latter two agonists are of especial interest since these compounds activate the RyR by increasing the apparent affinity of calcium for its activator site (16Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar, 17Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 1B5 myotubes expressing wtRyR1 (Fig. 2A) responded to all three test substances as has been described previously (13Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A. Chen S.R.W. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2509-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RyR1 containing the disruption of EF1 (Fig. 2B), EF2 (Fig. 2C), or both (EF1–2; Fig. 2D) also responded to all three agonists. The percentage of myotubes expressing the EF mutants that responded to these stimuli was similar to wtRyR1 (Fig. 2E). Wild-type RyR1 (Fig. 3A), EF1 (Fig. 3B), EF2 (Fig. 3C), and EF1–2 (Fig. 3D) all had similar thresholds for activation by caffeine (∼3 mm). The wtRyR1 EC50 value for activation by caffeine (2.83 mm) was not significantly different from the EC50 values for caffeine activation of the EF hand mutants (ranging from 2.37 mm for EF2 to 3.42 mm for EF1 (Fig. 3E)). To more directly test if scrambling these putative EF hands altered Ca2+ regulation of RyR1, we examined the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to membrane vesicles isolated from 1B5 myotubes expressing either wtRyR1, EF1, EF2, or EF1–2 (Fig. 4). Although [3H]ryanodine binding to wtRyR1 and EF1 could be stimulated by either 1 μm Ca2+, 20 mm caffeine, or 0.5 mm 4-CmC, no specific high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to EF2 or EF1–2 was detected (Fig. 4A) despite similar expression levels of the wild-type and mutated RyRs as determined in Western blot measurements (Fig. 4A, inset). For the EF1 construct, both Ca2+-dependent activation (Fig. 4B) and inhibition (Fig. 4C) were significantly altered compared with wtRyR1. The EC50 for Ca2+ activation of EF1 was decreased to 1.02 μm compared with wtRyR1 (2.8 μm) whereas the IC50 for calcium inhibition of EF1 was increased to 1.63 mm compared with wtRyR1 (0.85 mm) as summarized in Fig. 4D. To determine if the lack of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to membranes expressing EF2 and EF1–2 was due to loss of activity of these channels during isolation, we measured the activity of single EF2 channels from the same membrane preparations used for [3H]ryanodine binding measurements (Fig. 5). The open probability of single EF2 channels increased with defined cis Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 10 μm (Fig. 5, A–C). In addition, EF2 channel gating could be locked into a half conductance state by 10 μm ryanodine and fully inhibited by 10 μm ruthenium red (Fig. 5B). Finally, Ca2+-stimulated EF2 activity could be further enhanced by the addition of 2 mm caffeine (Fig. 5D). These findings indicate that the EF2 protein retains Ca2+ channel activity after isolation. We also examined three additional potential calcium binding domains located in the C terminus of wtRyR1. These three sequences contain multiple negatively charged residues alternating between either proline or glycine residues (Fig. 1, C–E). We hypothesized that the structural basis of the potential interaction between these sequences and a calcium ion would reside in the negative charge of the glutamic or aspartic acid side chains. To disrupt this interaction, we replaced these negatively charged amino acids with their neutral counterparts (i.e. Glu-Gln or Asp-Asn substitution). We created separate mutated RyR1 constructs containing either mutations in a single motif (EF3, EF4, or EF5) or all three mutated sequences in a single construct (EF3–5). As above, we first tested these mutated RyRs for their response to KCl, caffeine, and 4-CmC (Fig. 6). Similar to wtRyR1 (Fig. 6A), the mutated EF3 (Fig. 6B), EF4 (Fig. 6C), EF5 (Fig. 6D), and EF3–5 RyRs (Fig. 6E) all responded to these test substances. The relative proportion of myotubes responding to these agonists was unchanged compared with myotubes expressing wtRyR1 (Fig. 6F). Next, we examined the caffeine sensitivity of each mutated construct (Fig. 7). All 4 mutated constructs had similar thresholds for activation by caffeine (Fig. 7, B–E) compared with wtRyR1 (Fig. 7A). The EC50 values for activation by caffeine for these mutated RyRs ranged from 3.35 mm for EF3–5 to 6.99 mm for EF3 (Fig. 7F). Of these constructs, only the EC50 for EF3 was significantly different (increased) compared with wtRyR1. However, Ca2+ had the expected biphasic effect on the level of [3H]ryanodine binding to EF3, EF4, and EF5 which were almost identical compared with wtRyR1 (Fig. 8). The EC50 for Ca2+ activation ranged from 1.8 for EF5 to 2.4 μm for EF3 and EF4 (Fig. 8A). None of these EC50 values were significantly changed compared with the EC50 for wtRyR1 (2.8 μm). Similarly, the IC50 values for calcium inactivation of these mutated constructs (which ranged from 1.16–1.27 mm) were also not significantly different from wtRyR1 (Fig. 8B). Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium regulatory sequences in RyR1 reside within the C terminus of the protein. 1) A deletion mutant lacking the first 3660 amino acids of the RyR can still be activated by calcium (18Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 2) Studies using RyR1-RyR2 chimeras suggest the presence of calcium inactivation sites at the C terminus of the protein (19Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 3) C-terminal RyR peptides bind calcium in 45Ca2+ overlay studies (9Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23318-23326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4) Analysis of the peptide sequence of the C terminus suggests the presence of calcium binding motifs either as large stretches of highly negatively charged sequences (8Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Masuto H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) or as EF hand Ca2+ binding motifs (6Xiong H. Feng X. Gao L. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Seok J.H. Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used mutational analysis to determine the role of five putative C-terminal Ca2+ binding motifs in calcium regulation of RyR1. EF Hand Ca2+Binding Sites—Originally discovered in the crystal structure of parvalbumin (21Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3313-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EF hands have since been identified in over 200 different proteins that are regulated by Ca2+ (22Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Often found in pairs, EF hands are comprised of a central calcium binding loop flanked by two α-helices. Within the calcium binding loop, oxygen atoms in side chains of amino acids at the X, Y, Z, –X, and –Z positions (Fig. 1) coordinate the calcium ion with an additional coordination site provided by a peptide backbone carbonyl group. The –Z position is the most conserved position of the EF hand, containing either an aspartic or glutamic acid residue whose side chain chelates the calcium ion. In the cDNA of the RyR homologue from lobster, a tandem set of EF hand motifs have been identified (6Xiong H. Feng X. Gao L. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Seok J.H. Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The analogous regions from rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 (EF1 and EF2 in this study) and cardiac RyR2 weakly bind 45Ca2+ (Kd∼1–5 mm) in equilibrium binding studies, thus suggesting that these EF hands may play a role in calcium inactivation of mammalian RyRs. We disrupted the EF1 and EF2 regions in the RyR1 cDNA by scrambling the amino acid sequence of the calcium binding loop. These mutations would be expected to disrupt the spatial geometry of the calcium binding loops while maintaining the overall amino acid composition. In intact myotubes, disruption of these EF hands did not affect any of the parameters of RyR1 function that we examined; namely, depolarization-induced calcium release and sensitivity to caffeine or 4-CmC. Since caffeine is hypothesized to activate the RyR by increasing the affinity of calcium for its activator site (16Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar), we would predict that Ca2+-dependent regulation of these mutants should be unaffected compared with wtRyR1 However, for membranes expressing the EF1 mutant RyR, both Ca2+-dependent activation and inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding were altered. We detected a 2-fold increase in the IC50 for EF1, compared with wtRyR1, which supports the hypothesis that this sequence may play a role in calcium (or Mg2+) inhibition of the channel. In addition, the EC50 for Ca2+ activation of the EF1 mutant was decreased by 2-fold compared with wtRyR1. These results support the hypothesis that the EF1 sequence is involved in Ca2+ regulation of RyR1. However, its physiologic role is probably minimal since the caffeine sensitivity of this mutant in intact myotubes was unaffected compared with wtRyR1. Most likely, other areas in the RyR1 primary sequence are also involved in Ca2+ sensing. In contrast, RyRs containing the EF2 and EF1-EF2 mutations had no detectable high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding. We attribute this effect to the disruption of the EF2 region of RyR1 since this mutation is the common element in both of these constructs. This lack of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding was not caused by poor channel expression since similar levels of the different EF mutant RyR constructs were detected using Western blot techniques. In addition, this lack of binding activity was not caused by nonspecific misfolding of the protein or subunit dissociation since EF2 channels were active both in intact cell studies and in broken cell preparations used for single channel measurements. In addition, the calcium activation site of these channels does not appear to be disrupted since increasing Ca2+ levels from nanomolar to micromolar levels activates single EF2 RyRs in lipid bilayers. Thus, the most plausible explanation for the lack of [3H]ryanodine binding to the EF2 and EF1–2 constructs is that mutation of the EF2 sequence disrupts the high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding site. This phenomenon has also been observed in studies of RyR1-RyR2 chimeric proteins (23Nakai J. Gao L. Xu L. Xin C. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Of 6 RyR1-RyR2 chimeras previously shown to be functional in intact myotubes (24Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), 3 did not have detectable levels of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding. However, one of these chimeras (R4) was active in lipid bilayer experiments and could be locked into a half conductance state by 10 μm ryanodine (23Nakai J. Gao L. Xu L. Xin C. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This phenotype is remarkably similar to the functional characteristics of the EF2-mutated RyRs examined in this study. One possible explanation for the lack of [3H]ryanodine binding to EF2-disrupted RyRs is that the EF2 sequence represents the high affinity ryanodine binding site. However, this notion seems unlikely since the native EF2 sequence is present in RyR1-RyR2 chimeras that lack high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding (23Nakai J. Gao L. Xu L. Xin C. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Also, previous biochemical studies have localized the high affinity ryanodine binding site to amino acid residues 4475–5037 in the C terminus of RyR1 (25Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K.J. Needleman D.H. Cantu 3rd, C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This site has been further localized to the putative Ca2+ pore-forming segment between residues 4820–4829 of the cardiac RyR isoform (26Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of how EF2 disruption impairs high affinity ryanodine binding remains to be determined although a more detailed mutational analysis of the EF2 region may provide additional insights into this phenomenon. However, it is clear from these and previous data on RyR1/RyR2 chimeras that the high affinity binding site is not required for ryanodine to place the channel into the classical half conductance state observed in single channel measurements. Negatively Charged Putative Ca2+Binding Regions—The earliest proposed calcium binding sequences in the RyR1 primary sequence were three highly negatively charged regions identified after the initial cloning of RyR1 cDNA (8Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Masuto H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, the functional significance of these sequences was tested using 45Ca2+ overlay experiments performed on trpE-RyR1 fusion proteins (9Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23318-23326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium could bind to a large fragment containing amino acids 4014–4765 of RyR1 as well as smaller peptides each containing one of these three sequences (EF3, -4, and -5 in the present study). Remarkably, affinity-purified antibodies raised against the EF5 sequence could selectively inhibit calcium or caffeine activation of single RyR1 channels in lipid bilayers while not affecting activation by adenine nucleotides or sensitivity to ryanodine inhibition (10Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13414-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies strongly implicated EF5 as a calcium activator site of the RyR. However, our results do not support this hypothesis. Mutation of EF3, EF4, and EF5 singly or together as a triple mutant does not impair RyR1 activation in intact cells, and caffeine sensitivity of these mutants is largely unchanged compared with wtRyR1. Although removing the negatively charged amino acids from the EF3 region alone did result in a slight but significant increase in the EC50 for caffeine activation compared with wtRyR1, the functional significance of this observed change is questionable because the EC50 for caffeine activation of EF3–5 is not significantly different from wtRyR1. These findings lend strong support to the conclusion that these regions do not play a significant role in calcium regulation of RyR1 and question the validity of Ca2+ overlay studies for identifying Ca2+ regulatory regions in the RyR. Other Potential Calcium Regulatory Sites—Several approaches have been utilized to identify calcium regulatory sites on the RyR. One of the most promising findings was the identification of a “calcium sensor” using site-directed mutagenesis (2Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This regulatory site is comprised of a single highly conserved glutamic acid (position 4032 in RyR1) within a putative transmembrane loop of the RyR. Mutation of this residue to alanine in RyR3 dramatically increased the EC50 for calcium activation of the RyR in single channel studies thus suggesting that the calcium activator site had been perturbed by the mutation. However, no direct tests of calcium binding to this region have been reported. Moreover, the observation that high concentrations of ryanodine can overcome the functional defects incurred by the mutation introduced into either RyR1 (4Fessenden J.D. Chen L. Wang Y. Paolini C. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2865-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or RyR2 (27Masumiya H. Li P. Zhang L. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39727-39735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggests that this conserved residue may not comprise the actual calcium binding site although the possibility still exists that it is intimately involved in the pathway linking calcium binding to channel activation. In a separate approach using RyR1/RyR2 chimeric proteins, divergent region 1 (D1), between amino acid positions 4254 and 4631 of wtRyR1, was implicated as a potential calcium regulatory sequence. Overlapping chimeras containing the RyR2 D1 region substituted into RyR1 exhibited decreased calcium inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding compared with RyR1 to levels similar to RyR2, thus suggesting that calcium inactivation sites are located in the D1 region (19Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substitution of the N-terminal portion of the RyR2 D1 sequence into RyR1 also partially decreased the IC50 for calcium inactivation, thus suggesting that the N-terminal portion of D1 contained calcium inactivation site(s) (20Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies are promising although they do not provide any insights as to the location of the calcium activation sites on the RyR. Determination of calcium binding sequences in RyR1 is and will continue to be a difficult task. Most techniques used to study calcium modulation of RyR activity (calcium imaging of intact cells, single channel measurements in lipid bilayers, [3H]ryanodine binding) rely on RyR activity as an end point. If mutation of a particular RyR sequence interferes with calcium activation or inhibition of the RyR, then this sequence may be involved in calcium binding to the RyR or it may simply be important in conducting the calcium binding signal to channel gating. Functional assays cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. An additional complicating feature in identifying calcium binding sequences in all RyRs is the highly acidic nature of the protein. The pI for wtRyR1 is ∼5.0, and the pI in the 4000–4500 amino acid region examined in this study is 4.2. Thus, all 45Ca2+ binding studies have been and will be complicated by this property of the RyR because many potential calcium binding fragments identified with this technique might be due purely to electrostatic interactions that have questionable relevance to channel regulation in vivo. The identification of physiological calcium modulatory sites on the RyR may best be achieved through a multidisciplinary approach combining biophysical and molecular biological techniques. For example, the trivalent cation, terbium can bind to both classes of calcium modulatory sites on RyR1. The intrinsic fluorescence of terbium increases when it is bound to the calcium inhibitory site (28Hadad N. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24864-24869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method may be particularly useful as these studies can be done on the full-length RyR rather than smaller fragments of the channel. In addition, calcium-induced changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence have been used to identify calcium regulatory sites (29Tu H. Nosyreva E. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Mizushima A. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 290-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, a potential strategy to map calcium binding sites on the RyR would be to use these biophysical methods in conjunction with mutational analysis of potential calcium binding sequences to determine which possible interactions are physiologically relevant. The utility of this approach has already been demonstrated in identifying calcium regulatory sites on the IP3 receptor (29Tu H. Nosyreva E. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Mizushima A. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I.

https://openalex.org/W2027847223,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment for cancer and several noncancerous proliferating cell diseases that depends on the uptake of a photosensitizing compound followed by selective irradiation with visible light. In the presence of oxygen, irradiation leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A large production of ROS induces the death of cancer cells by apoptosis or necrosis. A small ROS production can activate various cellular pathways. Here, we show that PDT by pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester (PPME) induces the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in HMEC-1 cells. NF-κB is active since it binds to the NF-κB sites of both ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) promoters and induces the transcription of several NF-κB target genes such as those of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1. In contrast, expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at the protein level was not observed, although we measured an IL-6 secretion. Using specific chemical inhibitors, we showed that the lack of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression is the consequence of their degradation by lysosomal proteases. The proteasome and calpain pathways were not involved. All these observations were consistent with the fact that no adhesion of granulocytes was observed in these conditions."

The mechanism of UCN-01-induced apoptosis is largely unknown. We analysed the mechanism of cytotoxicity of UCN-01 in four established colon carcinoma cell lines. The cell lines SW48 and LS513 responded to UCN-01 treatment by undergoing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner while the cell lines HT-29 and WiDr were completely resistant. Apoptosis in LS513 and SW48 cell lines was concomitant with the suppression of Bcl-x(L) on mRNA and protein level. In contrast, in the apoptosis-resistant cell lines, Bcl-x(L) expression was not affected by UCN-01. Stable overexpression of the Bcl-x(L) protein abrogated UCN-01-triggered apoptosis, but only partially restored growth, indicating that both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis exert the anticancer effect in a coordinated manner. The inhibition of Akt phosphorylation did not correlate with the apoptotic phenotype. UCN-01 inhibited the activating STAT3 phosphorylations on Ser727 and, notably, on Tyr705, but STAT3 did not contribute to Bcl-x(L) expression in colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, we show for the first time that UCN-01 induces apoptosis by suppression of Bcl-x(L) expression. The inhibition of this pathway is a new aspect of cytotoxic and modulatory potential of UCN-01."
https://openalex.org/W2123812852,"Sialylated glycoconjugates mediate several key lymphocyte functions. We previously reported that hyposialylation occurred in latently HIV-1-infected CEM T cells, despite the fully preserved catalytic activity of several sialyltransferases. We show now that these cells are affected by a down-regulation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), which leads to a dramatic decrease in the synthesis of CMP-sialic acid, the donor substrate of all sialyltransferases. The GNE gene promoter was found to be located in a CpG island with several regulatory motifs CREB, SP1, and AP-2. De novo hypermethylation of this promoter was observed in HIV-1-infected CEM cells. This phenomenon might explain some immunological disorders that persist in infected individuals despite long-term therapeutically controlled viral replication. Indeed, an overall decrease in sialic acid engraftment can affect glycoproteins, notably those in which the sialylation status is crucial to ensure homing, recirculation, and survival of lymphocytes."

Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to identify the domains in C-18 responsible for its CCR5 binding and antiviral functions. To do so we focused on amino acid differences with Plasmodium falciparum cyclophilin, which, although 53% identical with C-18, has minimal binding activity for CCR5, and we generated 22 mutants with substitutions in the regions of non-homology located on the putative surface of the molecule.

Although several other chemokine receptors (CCR2, 3, and 8, BOB, and others) can promote infection in vitro by specific HIV-1 variants (8Zhang Y.J. Dragic T. Cao Y. Kostrikis L. Kwon D.S.

HIV-1 isolates that interact with CCR5 (R5 type) initiate most infections, and individuals with a genetic deletion (Δ32) in the CCR5 open frame appear to be highly protected from HIV disease (10Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A. Landau N.R.

Nature. 1996; 382: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that agents that block R5 type HIV-CCR5 interaction may be particularly effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, a series of chemokine-based CCR5 antagonists have been developed and tested with partial success in clinical trials (12Cooley L.A. Lewin S.R. J. Clin. Virol. 2003; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A number of pathogens have evolved molecules that can function as mimics of chemokines or chemokine receptors (13Holst P.J. Rosenkilde M.M. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have recently found that the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii possesses a protein (C-18) that binds to the CC chemokine receptor CCR5, triggers CCR5-dependent chemotaxis, and induces the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) by murine dendritic cells. In subsequent studies, C-18 was shown to inhibit both syncytia formation and infectivity of R5 but not X4 HIV viruses for human T cells (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H. Reis E. Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Golding H. Aliberti J. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Andersen J. Valenzuela J. Landau N.R. Sher A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3280-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed C-18 to be an isoform of T. gondii cyclophilin (17High K.P. Joiner K.A. Handschumacher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9105-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cyclophilins from mammalian species and the closely related apicomplexan protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum failed to bind significantly to CCR5, induce IL-12, or possess antiviral activity, the T. gondii protein appears to have acquired β-chemokine-like functions as a consequence of molecular mimicry (16Golding H. Aliberti J. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Andersen J. Valenzuela J. Landau N.R. Sher A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3280-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The structural basis of this mimicry is presently unclear, because C-18 has no sequence homology with the host CCR5 ligands MIP-1α/CCL3, MIP-1β/CCL4, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)/CCL5, or MCP-2/CCL8. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, and their enzyme activity is inhibited by the drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Interestingly, CsA was found to block the antiviral and IL-12 inducing functions of C-18, suggesting that either the isomerase activity of the molecule or a structural motif conformationally altered by CsA ligation is required for C-18-chemokine receptor interaction. C-18 has several properties that make it attractive as a candidate HIV co-receptor antagonist. Unlike other chemokine-based antagonists, C-18 blocks HIV interaction with T cells and macrophages with comparable efficiency (16Golding H. Aliberti J. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Andersen J. Valenzuela J. Landau N.R. Sher A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3280-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein does not appear to induce significant CCR5 internalization, a potential disadvantage of a number of existing antagonists. Finally, recent experiments indicate that C-18 also binds to rhesus CCR5 and blocks fusion with the simian immunodeficiency viral envelope, thus allowing pre-clinical evaluation of its antiviral activity in an in vivo primate model. 2H. Golding, unpublished observations. Nevertheless, because of its modest activity in both HIV fusion and infectivity assays and probable immunogenicity, it is likely that the protein would need to be structurally optimized before use as a clinical agent. To do so, an understanding of the requirements for the interaction of C-18 with CCR5 is necessary. We have approached this problem in the present study by site-directed mutagenesis of the C-18 protein. Our findings identify a region in the C-18 molecule involved in both CCR5 binding and viral inhibition and formally establish that its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity is not required for either biological function. At the same time, our data shed light on the molecular basis of host chemokine mimicry by this protozoan protein. Reagents and Experimental Animals—CsA, α-chymotrypsin (type I-S from bovine pancreases), and N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide were purchased from Sigma. Paired antibodies against IL-12 were obtained from BD Pharmingen for measurement of this cytokine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C57BL/6 (wild-type) and CCR5-deficient mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). TLR4-deficient mice were generously provided by Drs. S. Akira (Osaka University, Japan) and D. Golenbock (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). All animals were maintained at the an American Association of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited NIAID, National Institutes of Health animal facility, and 8–12-week-old female mice were employed in all experiments. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Candidate CCR5 Binding Determinants in C-18 —The structure of C-18 was modeled based on the crystal structure of P. falciparum cyclophilin with cyclosporin A bound (18Peterson M.R. Hall D.R. Berriman M. Nunes J.A. Leonard G.A. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (PCyp19). Substitution of PCyp19 amino acid coordinates with a set representing the C-18 sequence were made using alignments generated with the automated Swiss-Model server. The initial model was energyminimized by 200 cycles of steepest descents followed by 200 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization using Discover. The quality of model geometry was checked using a Ramachandran plot. Coordinates for CsA were derived from the PCyp19 model and added to the C-18 model after superposition of the C-18 and PCyp19 polypeptide chains using Insight II. The goal of the modeling was not to predict specific binding interactions but rather to identify potential solvent-exposed amino acid side chains for site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Only putatively exposed amino acids that are not conserved between the T. gondii and P. falciparum cyclophilins C-18 and PCyp19, respectively, were selected for the mutagenesis screen. The generation of the C-18 expression construct in pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, NY) has been described previously (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H.

Site-directed mutagenesis of C-18 within this vector was performed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used to generate the indicated C-18 mutants: Y10A, 5′-CAGAAAGGCGGCTATGGATATCGAC-3′; GEH17-19AAA (17GEH19 → 17AAA19), 5′-CGACATCGACGCAGCAGCTGCCGGGCGC-3′; E29A, 5′-CTTGGAGCTCCGTGCTGACATCGCTCC-3′; FDK43-45AAA (43FDK45 → 43AAA45), 5′-CTTCATTGGCCTTGCTGCTGCTTACAAGGGCAGCG-3′; D57A, 5′-GTATCATCCCCGCTTTCATGATCCAG-3′; FE65-66AA (65FE66 → 65AA66), 5′-CCAGGGAGGAGATGCTGCTAACCACAACGGCAC-3′; H68A, 5′-GATTTCGAGAACGCTAACGGCACTG-3′; H74A, 5′-CACTGGAGGAGCTAGCATCTACGGC-3′; R80A, 5′-CTACGGCCGAGCTTTTGACGACGAAAAC-3′; D82A, 5′-CGGCCGAAGATTTGCTGACGAAAACTTTG-3′; DL87-88AA (87DL88 → 87AA88), 5′-GACGAAAACTTTGCTGCTAAGCACGAGCGAG-3′; R92A, 5′-GATTTGAAGCACGAGGCTGGCGTCATCTC-3′; KTE115-117AAA (115KTE117 → 115AAA117), 5′-CATCACCACCGTGGCTGCTGCTTGGCTCGACGCC-3′; R122A, 5′-GGCTCGACGCCGCTCACGTTGTTTTCG-3′; IT129-130AA (129IT130 → 129AA130), 5′-GTTTTCGGGAAGGCTGCAACTGAGTCGTG-3′; SWP133-135AAA (133SWP135 → 133AAA135), 5′-GATCACAACTGAGGCTGCTGCTACCGTCCAGGC-3′; Q138A, 5′-GTGGCCTACCGTCGCTGCTATTGAGGCTCTC-3′; L143A, 5′-CTATTGAGGCTGCTGGCGGCAGCGGCGGC-3′; S146A, 5′-GAGGCTCTCGGCGGCGCTGGCGGCCGCCCGTC-3′; RP149-150YV (149RP150 → 149YV150), 5′-GGCAGCGGCGGCTACGTGTCTAAGGTCGCGAAAATC-3′; S151A, 5′-GCGGCCGCCCGGCTAAGGTCGCG-3′; and K155A, 5′-GCTAAGGTCGCGGCTATCACGGACATTGG-3′. The constructs in pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) were sequenced using vector-based external primers to confirm the introduction of the mutations. Expression and Purification of Recombinant C-18 Wild-type and Mutant Proteins—Plasmids encoding C-18 or its mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys (Invitrogen). Purified inclusion bodies obtained from bacteria induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) for 4 h were next solubilized in 6 m guanidine-HCl. The solution was then added dropwise to a refolding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl), followed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Finally, the dialyzed samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the recombinant protein was purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a HiPrep 16/10 Q XL column (Amersham Biosciences) using 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 m NaCl for elution. CCR5 Binding Assay—Both competitive and direct binding assays were used to quantitate the interaction of the C-18 proteins to cell-bound CCR5. Recombinant C-18 and its mutants were trace-labeled with 125I by Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (San Carlos, CA). CEM (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA; number CCL-119, CCR5-) cells and CEM.NKR.CCR5 (19Trkola A. Matthews J. Gordon C. Ketas T. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8966-8974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a human CCR5 transfectant of the same parental line) were incubated in triplicate in 96-well plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland) at 105 per well with 125I-labeled C-18 alone or in the presence of human MIP-1β (BIOSOURCE), C-18 mutant proteins, or CsA for 90 min at 4 °C (indirect binding assay). To assess the direct binding of the C-18 mutants, CCR5+ and CCR5-cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled D82A, RP149-150YV, and K155A mutants. Cells were then washed, and the bound fraction was measured radioactively as described earlier (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H. Reis E. Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). After subtraction of the nonspecific binding to CCR5-cells, the molar amount of CCR5-bound C-18 per well was calculated. Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses and Fusion Inhibition Assay—Recombinant vaccinia viruses vCB28 (JR-FL envelope), vCB43 (Ba-L envelope), and vCB39 (ADA envelope) were kindly provided by Christopher Broder (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD) (20Broder C.C. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9004-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Syncytium formation was measured at different times after coculture (1:1 ratio, 1 × 105 cells each, in triplicate) of target cells (expressing CD4 and co-receptors) and effectors (CD4-12E1 cells) (21Hillman K. Shapira-Nahor O. Gruber M.F. Hooley J. Manischewitz J. Seeman R. Vujcic L. Geyer S.J. Golding H. J.

Serially diluted inhibitors were added to the target cells for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator (three wells per group). Effector cells were added, and syncytium formation was followed for 3-4 h. Linear regression curves were generated and used to calculate the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50). Viral Infectivity Assay—The R5 viruses Ba-L and JR-CSF were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (McKesson BioServices, Rockville, MD). Viral stocks were produced and titered in phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For viral neutralization, serially diluted C-18 and the C-18 mutants were added to PM1 target cells in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well, five replicates per group). After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, a virus was added (50% tissue culture infectious dose per well). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, unbound virus and inhibitors were washed away, and the plates were cultured for 2 weeks. Supernatants were removed every second day, and the cultures were supplemented with fresh medium. Viral production was determined by measuring p24 in culture supernatants using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). p24 production was measured every second day for 2 weeks, and the ID50 values were based on results obtained near peak virus production (usually between days 5-7). Viral neutralization is expressed as an ID50 value.

We selected four of these (Arg53, Phe58, Trp118, and His123) in the predicted CsA-binding pocket of C-18 for the inactivation of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by site-directed mutagenesis as described above using the following primers for the indicated mutations: R53A, 5′-GTTTTCCACGCTATCATCCCCGAC-3′; F58A, 5′-CATCCCCGACGCCATGATCCAGG-3′; W118A, 5′-CGTGAAGACAGAGGCGCTCGACGC-3′; and H123Q, 5′-CGACGCCAGACAAGTTGTTTTC-3′. The prolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of the recombinant proteins was evaluated by a photometric assay based on the isomerization of the N-succinyl-AAPF p-nitroanilide (24Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P.

Reis E. Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In brief, isomerization of the substrate N-succinyl-AAPF p-nitroanilide (dissolved in Me2SO, 10 mm stock) by C-18 or its mutants (8 nm each) was determined by hydrolysis of the trans-prolyl product with chymotrypsin at 5 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 100 mm NaCl followed by the measurement of p-nitroaniline absorbance at 390 nm. Enzymatic activity was assayed at a substrate concentration of 100 μm. Absorbance changes over the course of hydrolysis were fit to a single exponential function using Sigma Plot, and values for the observed first-order rate constant (Ko) were compared for wild-type and mutant proteins. Measurement of IL-12 Inducing Activity of C-18 Proteins—Splenic dendritic cells (DCs) were partially purified from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice as described previously (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H. Reis E. Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For measurement of IL-12 production, DCs were resuspended in cell culture medium at 106 cells/ml and distributed in 96-well plates. Recombinant C-18 and mutant proteins were then added at 10 μg/ml, and the cultures were stimulated overnight. IL-12 p40 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H. Reis E. Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To rule out the effects of lipopolysaccharide contamination, splenic DCs from CCR5-/- deficient mice, which cannot be activated by C-18, and TLR4 knock-out mice, which are fully responsive to C-18 but non-responsive to lipopolysaccharide, were used as controls. Selection of Sites for Mutagenesis Based on Structural Comparison of C-18 with P. falciparum Cyclophilin—We have shown previously that T. gondii but not P. falciparum or human cyclophilins display CCR5 binding and HIV-1 antiviral activity (16Golding H. Aliberti J. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Andersen J. Valenzuela J. Landau N.R. Sher A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3280-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This observation provided a strategy for the identification of the unique structural elements in C-18 that determine its chemokine-like activity. We first developed a model of the entire C-18 molecule based on homology with the known crystal structure PfCyp19 together with its CsA ligand (Fig. 1A) (18Peterson M.R. Hall D.R. Berriman M. Nunes J.A. Leonard G.A. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We next identified those amino acids located on the putative molecular surface of C-18 that represent non-conservative substitutions of the corresponding amino acids in PfCyp19 (Fig. 1, A and B). Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed, substituting in each case an Ala for the C-18 residue or the consecutive residues targeted. An exception was mutant RP149-150 in which a double substitution was made to Tyr-Val, the corresponding amino acids present in PfCyp19 (Fig. 1B). All of the mutant proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli, although mutant Arg92 could not be refolded in soluble form (data not shown) and, thus, was eliminated from further analysis. Specific Mutations in C-18 Reduce its CCR5 Binding Activity—Competition of I125-labeled C-18 interaction with CCR5-transfected cells was used to screen the mutants for altered chemokine receptor binding. This assay revealed significantly reduced competition by three of the 21 mutants tested, namely 17GEH19 → 17AAA19 (designated GEH17-19AAA throughout), D82A, and 149RP150 → 149YV150 (designated RP149-150YV throughout) (Fig. 2). To confirm the validity of the competition assay, direct binding assays were performed using representative mutants. As shown in Fig. 3, iodinated D82A and RP149-150YV each showed greatly reduced binding to CCR5-transfected cells in comparison to iodinated C-18 or K155A, a control mutant showing no loss in activity in the initial screen. Interestingly, two (GEH17-19AAA and RP149-150YV) of the three loss-in-function mutations identified in Fig. 2 are situated on adjacent loops in the C-18 model, with RP149-150YV bordering the CsA binding pocket (Fig. 1), implicating this region of the protein in CCR5 interaction. Indeed, as observed previously in other assays of C-18 function (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H. Reis E. Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Golding H. Aliberti J. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Andersen J. Valenzuela J. Landau N.R. Sher A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3280-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the addition of CsA dramatically inhibited the binding of labeled C-18 to the indicator cells (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Affinity of C-18 versus C-18 mutants for CCR5 as determined by direct binding.125I-labeled C-18, K155A, RP149-150YV, and D82A mutant proteins were incubated with CCR5+ and CCR5-cells for 90 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and the bound fraction measured radioactively. In one reaction, 125I-labeled C-18 was preincubated with 1 μm CsA for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of the CCR5 expressing cells. The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C-18 Mutants with Decreased CCR5 Binding Also Display Reduced Antiviral Activity—The same mutant proteins that were assessed for CCR5 interaction were also screened for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 envelope-dependent cell fusion in an assay employing CD4/CCR5-expressing PM1 target cells. Using 12E1 effector cells expressing the HIV-1 R5 envelope (JR-FL), wild-type C-18 blocked fusion with ID50 values ranging between 3 and 10 μg/ml in five experiments. The same three mutants described above as showing impaired CCR5 binding showed decreased viral fusion inhibition with very significant increases in the ID50 values (Fig. 4, A and B). The reduced antiviral activity of proteins GEH17-19AAA, D82A, and RP149-150YV was confirmed in a separate set of fusion assays employing a different R5 viral envelope (Ba-L). The findings in the fusion assays were reproduced in virus infectivity assays in which the ability of the proteins to block entry into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was compared (Fig. 5). Again, mutants GEH17-19AAA and RP149-150YV showed reduced activity. However, in this assay system we were unsuccessful in generating an ID50 value for D82A even when using excessively high concentrations of the mutant protein.Fig. 5Mutations in C-18 that abrogate CCR5 binding also result in reduced inhibition of HIV infectivity. C-18 and the mutant proteins GEH17-19AAA and RP149-150YV were added to PM1 target cells and, after 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, the virus was added. After an additional 24 h, the unbound virus and inhibitors were washed away, and the plates were incubated for 2 weeks. Viral production was then assessed by measuring p24 in culture supernatants. ID50 values were based on results obtained near peak virus production (between days 5 and 7). The experiment shown is representative of two performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Peptidyl-prolyl Isomerase Enzymatic Activity of C-18 Is Not Required for CCR5 Binding or Antiviral Activity—As noted previously, the C-18 ligand CsA inhibits both the antiviral (16Golding H. Aliberti J. King L.R. Manischewitz J. Andersen J. Valenzuela J. Landau N.R. Sher A. Blood. 2003; 102: 3280-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and CCR5 binding (Fig. 3) activities of the protein. Because CsA is a potent antagonist of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilins, it was possible that this enzymatic function is required for the biological properties of T. gondii C-18. To test this hypothesis we generated four additional mutant proteins within the highly conserved substrate-binding pocket of C-18. These mutations had previously been shown to abrogate enzyme activity in human cyclophilin (23Zydowsky L.D. Etzkorn F.A. Chang H.Y. Ferguson S.B. Stolz L.A. Ho S.I. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and this loss in activity was confirmed in the C-18 mutants (Fig. 6 A and supplemental Table I). Importantly, none of the four mutant proteins lost CCR5 binding (Fig. 6B) or antiviral activity as measured in the fusion and infectivity assays (Fig. 6, C and D). These data formally demonstrate that the CCR5-dependent biological functions of C-18 do not depend on its enzymatic activity. In the same series of experiments we showed that the original series of C-18 mutant proteins studied above (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) retain their enzymatic activity (Fig. 6A and supplemental Table I). The latter data argue that these recombinant molecules were properly folded following expression and purification. An exception however was mutant D82A, which, although displaying loss in fusion inhibition and CCR5 binding, also lacked enzymatic activity (data not shown) and, as described above, was unexpectedly totally lacking in activity in the inhibition of HIV infectivity assay. Based on this combined evidence we concluded that the loss in biological function observed with this mutant protein is likely to be the result of improper folding.
