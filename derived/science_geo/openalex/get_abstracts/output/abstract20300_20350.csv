https://openalex.org/W1996028579,"Osteoclasts, the cells that resorb bone, develop from hematopoietic precursors of the bone marrow under the control of factors produced in their microenvironment. The cytokine interleukin-6 can promote hematopoiesis and osteoclastogenesis. Interleukin-6 production by bone and marrow stromal cells is suppressed by 17 beta-estradiol in vitro. In mice, estrogen loss (ovariectomy) increased the number of colony-forming units for granulocytes and macrophages, enhanced osteoclast development in ex vivo cultures of marrow, and increased the number of osteoclasts in trabecular bone. These changes were prevented by 17 beta-estradiol or an antibody to interleukin-6. Thus, estrogen loss results in an interleukin-6-mediated stimulation of osteoclastogenesis, which suggests a mechanism for the increased bone resorption in postmenopausal osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W1986758681,"A new SH2-containing sequence, SHC, was isolated by screening cDNA libraries with SH2 representative DNA probes. The SHC cDNA is predicted to encode overlapping proteins of 46.8 and 51.7 kd that contain a single C-terminal SH2 domain, and an adjacent glycine/proline-rich motif with regions of homology with the alpha 1 chain of collagen, but no identifiable catalytic domain. Anti-SHC antibodies recognized three proteins of 46, 52, and 66 kd in a wide range of mammalian cell lines. These SHC proteins complexed with and were phosphorylated by activated epidermal growth factor receptor. The physical association of SHC proteins with activated receptors was recreated in vitro by using a bacterially expressed SHC SH2 domain. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts that constitutively overexpressed SHC acquired a transformed phenotype in culture and formed tumors in nude mice. These results suggest that the SHC gene products couple activated growth factor receptors to a signaling pathway that regulates the proliferation of mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2081560586,"Dead cells are observed in many developing animal tissues, but the causes of these normal cell deaths are mostly unknown. We show that about 50% of oligodendrocytes normally die in the developing rat optic nerve, apparently as a result of a competition for limiting amounts of survival signals. Both platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factors are survival factors for newly formed oligodendrocytes and their precursors in culture. Increasing platelet-derived growth factor in the developing optic nerve decreases normal oligodendrocyte death by up to 90% and doubles the number of oligodendrocytes in 4 days. These results suggest that a requirement for survival signals is more general than previously thought and that some normal cell deaths in nonneural tissues may also reflect competition for survival factors."
https://openalex.org/W2007358741,"Treatment of bean or soybean cells with fungal elicitor or glutathione causes a rapid insolubilization of preexisting (hydroxy)proline-rich structural proteins in the cell wall. This insolubilization, which involves H2O2-mediated oxidative cross-linking, is initiated within 2 min and is complete within 10 min under optimal conditions, and hence, precedes the expression of transcription-dependent defenses. Cross-linking is also under developmental control during hypocotyl growth and in tissues subject to mechanical stress such as the stem-petiole junction. Stimulus-dependent oxidative cross-linking of wall structural proteins is a novel site of cellular regulation with potentially important functions in cell maturation and toughening of cell walls in the initial stages of plant defense."
https://openalex.org/W2048101669,"A proteinaceous elicitor of the plant defense reaction known as the hypersensitive response was isolated from Erwinia amylovora, the bacterium that causes fire blight of pear, apple, and other rosaceous plants. The elicitor, named harpin, is an acidic, heat-stable, cell-envelope-associated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 44 kilodaltons. Harpin caused tobacco leaf lamina to collapse and caused an increase in the pH of bathing solutions of suspension-cultured tobacco cells. The gene encoding harpin (hrpN) was located in the 40-kilobase hrp gene cluster of E. amylovora, sequenced, and mutated with Tn5tac1. The hrpN mutants were not pathogenic to pear, did not elicit the hypersensitive response, and did not produce harpin."
https://openalex.org/W2002680288,"The messenger RNAs of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) have an RNA hairpin structure, TAR, at their 5' ends that contains a six-nucleotide loop and a three-nucleotide bulge. The conformations of TAR RNA and of TAR with an arginine analog specifically bound at the binding site for the viral protein, Tat, were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Upon arginine binding, the bulge changes conformation, and essential nucleotides for binding, U23 and A27.U38, form a base-triple interaction that stabilizes arginine hydrogen bonding to G26 and phosphates. Specificity in the arginine-TAR interaction appears to be derived largely from the structure of the RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2004313732,"The cdc25 protein is a highly specific tyrosine phosphatase that triggers mitosis by dephosphorylating the cdc2 protein kinase. Using Xenopus extracts, we have found that the cdc25 protein is active at a low level throughout interphase. Near the onset of mitosis, the cdc25 protein undergoes a marked elevation in phosphatase activity that coincides with an extensive phosphorylation of the protein in its N-terminal region. In vitro dephosphorylation of this hyperphosphorylated form of cdc25 reduces its phosphatase activity back to the interphase level. Moreover, treatment of interphase Xenopus extracts with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor that accelerates the entry into mitosis, elicits both the premature hyperphosphorylation of cdc25 and the stimulation of its cdc2-specific tyrosine phosphatase activity. These experiments demonstrate the existence of a cdc25 regulatory system consisting of both a stimulatory kinase that phosphorylates a putative regulatory domain of the cdc25 protein and an inhibitory serine/threonine phosphatase that counteracts this kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2025701628,"Aldose reductase, which catalyzes the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl compounds, is implicated in the development of diabetic and galactosemic complications involving the lens, retina, nerves, and kidney. A 1.65 angstrom refined structure of a recombinant human placenta aldose reductase reveals that the enzyme contains a parallel beta 8/alpha 8-barrel motif and establishes a new motif for NADP-binding oxidoreductases. The substrate-binding site is located in a large, deep elliptical pocket at the COOH-terminal end of the beta barrel with a bound NADPH in an extended conformation. The highly hydrophobic nature of the active site pocket greatly favors aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar monosaccharides. The structure should allow for the rational design of specific inhibitors that might provide molecular understanding of the catalytic mechanism, as well as possible therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2093160969,"Medium-chain fatty acids (FAs), found in storage lipids of certain plants, are an important renewable resource. Seeds of undomesticated California bay accumulate laurate (12:0), and a 12:0-acyl-carrier protein thioesterase (BTE) has been purified from this tissue. Sequencing of BTE enabled the cloning of a complementary DNA coding for a plastid-targeted preprotein. Expression of the complementary DNA in the seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in BTE activity, and medium chains accumulated at the expense of long-chain (greater than or equal to 16) FAs. Laurate became the most abundant FA species and was deposited in the storage triacylglycerols. These results demonstrate a mechanism for medium-chain FA synthesis in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2153542488,"Nopp140 is a nucleolar phosphoprotein of 140 kd that we originally identified and purified as a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-binding protein. Molecular characterization revealed a 10-fold repeated motif of highly conserved acidic serine clusters that contain an abundance of phosphorylation consensus sites for casein kinase II (CK II). Indeed, Nopp140 is one of the most phosphorylated proteins in the cell, and NLS binding was dependent on phosphorylation. Nopp140 was shown to shuttle between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm. Shuttling is likely to proceed on tracks that were revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. These tracks extend from the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus across the nucleoplasm to some nuclear pore complexes. We suggest that Nopp140 functions as a chaperone for import into and/or export from the nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W1519576356,"Stimulation of rat pancreatic acinar cells with low concentrations of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked secretagogues induces [Ca2+]i oscillations, without measurable changes in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Therefore, we tested U73122 a new phospholipase C inhibitor to determine if PI turnover is necessary for the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations. In acini prelabeled with [3H]inositol, PI hydrolysis on stimulation with either cholecystokinin or carbachol was inhibited dose-dependently by U73122, with a maximal effect seen at 10 microM; the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, measured using a radioreceptor assay, was also similarly inhibited. By contrast secretin- or vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated production of cAMP was unaffected by 10 microM U73122. These studies indicate that U73122 is a relatively specific inhibitor of G-protein-mediated phospholipase C activation in pancreatic acini. In fura-2-loaded acini, U73122 inhibited the increases in [Ca2+]i stimulated by these high concentrations of secretagogues which can be demonstrated to elicit PI turnover. The [Ca2+]i signal generated by directly stimulating G-proteins with sodium fluoride was also inhibited by U73122; however, the [Ca2+]i rise induced by thapsigargin was unaffected. These data indicate that the mechanism of inhibition was distal to the occupation of cell surface receptors but did not involve an interference of Ca2+ metabolism in general. When [Ca2+]i oscillations were elicited by low concentrations of cholecystokinin or carbachol, U73122 rapidly inhibited the oscillating [Ca2+]i signal. In contrast, oscillations induced by an analogue of cholecystokinin, JMV-180, which does not stimulate changes in PI metabolism at any concentration, were unaffected. This indicates that cholecystokinin- and carbachol-induced oscillations are probably initiated by small, localized changes in PI metabolism, which are not readily detectable. However, the inability of U73122 to inhibit JMV-180-induced oscillations indicates that PI metabolism may not necessarily be a prerequisite for the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1972205221,"Music, like other forms of expression, requires specific skills for its production, and the organization and representation of these skills in the human brain are not well understood. With the use of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the functional neuroanatomy of musical sight-reading and keyboard performance was studied in ten professional pianists. Reading musical notations and translating these notations into movement patterns on a keyboard resulted in activation of cortical areas distinct from, but adjacent to, those underlying similar verbal operations. These findings help explain why brain damage in musicians may or may not affect both verbal and musical functions depending on the size and location of the damaged area."
https://openalex.org/W1970466976,"During C. elegans embryogenesis an 8-cell stage blastomere, called MS, undergoes a reproducible cleavage pattern, producing pharyngeal cells, body wall muscles, and cell deaths. We show here that maternal-effect mutations in the pie-1 and mex-1 genes cause additional 8-cell stage blastomeres to adopt a fate very similar to that of the wild-type MS blastomere. In pie-1 mutants one additional posterior blastomere adopts an MS-like fate, and in mex-1 mutants four additional anterior blastomeres adopt an MS-like fate. We propose that maternally provided pie-1(+) and mex-1(+) gene products may function in the early embryo to localize or regulate factors that determine the fate of the MS blastomere."
https://openalex.org/W1569390933,"We used an in vitro assay system based on HeLa cell core transcription components to examine transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II on either naked DNA or chromatin templates as a function of the three known elongation factors, IIS, TFIIF, and TFIIX. We demonstrate for the first time that mammalian RNA polymerase II can achieve physiological elongation rates on naked DNA templates in vitro. The addition of TFIIF alone gave this rate, although IIS was required to minimize the block to elongation at intrinsic termination sites. However, IIS and TFIIF provided only a slight increase in the very poor elongation efficiency of RNA polymerase II on chromatin templates. The addition of TFIIX to reactions containing IIS and TFIIF reduced the elongation rate on naked DNA templates but slightly increased the elongation efficiency on chromatin. The ability of elongation factors either separately or in combination to stimulate transcription on naked DNA and chromatin templates was also examined."
https://openalex.org/W2055050002,Statistical approaches help in the determination of significant configurations in protein and nucleic acid sequence data. Three recent statistical methods are discussed: (i) score-based sequence analysis that provides a means for characterizing anomalies in local sequence text and for evaluating sequence comparisons; (ii) quantile distributions of amino acid usage that reveal general compositional biases in proteins and evolutionary relations; and (iii) r-scan statistics that can be applied to the analysis of spacings of sequence markers.
https://openalex.org/W1518373731,"Using a cDNA probe for rat renal 24-hydroxylase, expression of its mRNA was compared in the rat kidney and intestine. Vitamin D-deficient rats received a single injection of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA was first detected in the kidney at 3-h post-injection and increased thereafter. Similarly, 24-hydroxylase mRNA was expressed in the intestine after 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 injection. However, the dose level of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 required to induce the intestinal 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression was only 1/100 the amount required to induce renal 24-hydroxylase mRNA. Induction of intestinal 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was far more rapid than that of renal 24-hydroxylase mRNA. Thyroparathyroidectomy shortened the time required to induce expression of renal, but not intestinal, 24-hydroxylase mRNA. Administration of either parathyroid hormone or cAMP to vitamin D-deficient rats greatly reduced the expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA in the kidney but not in the intestine. When rats were fed a vitamin D-repleted diet containing 0.7% (adequate) or 0.03% (low) calcium for 2 weeks, intestinal expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA could be induced only in the low calcium group. In contrast, renal mRNA expression was preferentially stimulated in the adequate calcium group. These results clearly demonstrate that the expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA is down-regulated by parathyroid hormone in the kidney but not in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1492894785,"Multiple heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) subunits have evolved to couple a large variety of receptors to intracellular effectors. G protein beta gamma subunits are essential for efficient coupling of alpha subunits to receptors, and they are also important for modulation of effectors. Several different beta and gamma subunits exist, but it is not known whether all possible combinations of beta and gamma can form functional dimers. To answer this question, we have compared the ability of in vitro translated beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 to form dimers with either gamma 1 or gamma 2. Dimerization was monitored by gel filtration, resistance to tryptic digestion, and chemical cross-linking. The results indicate that beta 1 binds both gamma subunits, beta 2 binds only gamma 2, and beta 3 will bind neither gamma 1 or gamma 2. Hence, the occurrence of beta gamma dimers may be partially regulated by the ability of the subunits to associate. Specificity of dimerization might allow cells to co-express multiple beta and gamma subunits while maintaining efficient and specific signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2066187079,"After observations that Macaca nemestrina were exceptionally susceptible to simian immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HIV-2), studies of HIV-1 replication were initiated. Several strains of HIV-1, including a recent patient isolate, replicated in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in CD4-positive M. nemestrina lymphocytes in a CD4-dependent fashion. Eight animals were subsequently inoculated with either cell-associated or cell-free suspensions of HIV-1. All animals had HIV-1 isolated by cocultivation, had HIV-1 DNA in their PBMCs as shown by polymerase chain reaction, and experienced sustained seroconversion to a broad spectrum of HIV-1 proteins. Macaca nemestrina is an animal model of HIV-1 infections that provides opportunities for evaluating the pathogenesis of acute HIV-1 replication and candidate vaccines and therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1511771038,"Since many lines of evidence suggest that expression of the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) gene may be regulated post-transcriptionally, we examined the effect of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of this gene on TGF-beta 1 expression. For this purpose, fragments of the 840-nucleotide highly GC-rich TGF-beta 1 5'-UTR were inserted into the 5'-UTR of the structural gene for human growth hormone driven by the simian virus 40 early promoter. A portion of the 5'-UTR of TGF-beta 1 mRNA spanning the sequences from +11 to +147 was shown to inhibit growth hormone expression by as much as 22-fold. This effect was cell-specific; growth hormone production was inhibited in PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma and A-549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, while no effect was seen in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, which show efficient translation of endogenous TGF-beta 1 mRNA. Computer analysis showed that this region of the 5'-UTR contained a stable secondary stem-loop structure spanning sequences +49 to +76. This stem-loop region alone is sufficient to inhibit expression of the growth hormone gene, suggesting that it plays an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of TGF-beta 1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1555714214,"The regulation of the cytoplasmic and vacuolar pH values (pHc and pHv) in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells was analyzed using 31P and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Suspension-cultured cells were compressed in the NMR tube and perfused with the help of an original arrangement enabling a tight control of the pH (external pH, pHe) of the carefully oxygenated circulating nutrient medium. Intracellular pH values were measured from the chemical shifts of: CH2-linked carboxyl groups of citric acid below pH 5.7; orthophosphate between pH 5.7 and 8.0; 13C-enriched bicarbonate over pH 8.0. pHc and pHv were independent of pHe over the range 4.5-7.5. In contrast intracellular pH values decreased rapidly below pHe 4.5 and increased progressively at pHe over 7.5. There was an acceleration in the rate of O2 consumption accompanied with a decrease in cytoplasmic ATP concentration as pHe decreased. When the rate of O2 consumption was approaching the uncoupled O2 uptake rate, a loss of pHc control was observed. It is concluded that as pHe decreased, the plasma membrane ATPase consumed more and more ATP to reject the invading H+ ions in order to maintain pHc at a constant value. Below pHe 4.5 the efficiency of the H+ pump to react to back leakage of H+ ions became insufficient, leading to an acidification of pHc and to an alkalinization of pHe. On the other hand, over pHe 7.5 a passive influx of OH- ions was observed, and pHc increased proportionally to the increase of pHe. Simultaneously appreciable amounts of organic acids (malate and citrate) were synthesized by cells during the course of the alkalinization of the cytoplasmic compartment. The synthesis of organic acids which partially counteract the alkalinization of the cytoplasmic compartment may result from a marked activation of the cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase induced by an increase in cytoplasmic bicarbonate concentration. The fluctuations of pHv followed a similar course to that of pHc. It is concluded that the vacuole, which represents a potentially large H+ ions reservoir, can counteract H+ (or OH-) ion invasion observed at acidic (or alkaline) pHe contributing to the homeostasis of pHc."
https://openalex.org/W1485888391,"We have used antisense RNA technology to inhibit endogenous parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) production in the established human keratinocyte cell line, HPK1A, in order to assess the role of PTHRP as a potential modulator of cell growth. Rat PTHRP cDNA was cloned into the replication defective retroviral vector pYN in an antisense orientation and a stable cell line (HPK1A-AS) was generated after infection by amphotropic virus and selection by the neomycin derivative, G418. Expression of the transfected antisense sequence was confirmed with an RNA sense probe for PTHRP. The effect of the retrovirally mediated gene transfer on the endogenous PTHRP transcript was examined with an RNA antisense probe which demonstrated an absence of the endogenous transcript in HPK1A-AS cells. A 1.6-kilobase transcript was, however, present in equivalent quantities in both uninfected HPK1A and pYN-infected (HPK1A-pYN) cells. Immunocytochemistry and assessment of PTHRP secretion into the medium using an NH2-terminal radioimmunoassay and a UMR 106 adenylate cyclase bioassay confirmed the absence of PTHRP in HPK1A-AS cells. Examination of the inhibition of PTHRP production on cell growth demonstrated a reduction in doubling time and an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cell cycle analysis showed an increase in the proportion of the cell population in the S phase (relative to G0/G1) in HPK1A-AS cells compared to HPK1A or HPK1A-pYN cells. These data, therefore, indicate that endogenous PTHRP acts as an effective inhibitor of cell growth in this keratinocyte model and that this action occurs, at least in part, by diminishing entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the antisense RNA method is a potent one to evaluate the cellular actions of PTHRP."
https://openalex.org/W2066221480,"We have used an intra-Golgi transport assay to identify GTP-binding proteins involved in regulation of protein traffic. Two soluble proteins of 20 kd were purified by their ability to mediate GTPγS-dependent inhibition of transport. These GTP-dependent Golgi binding factors, or GGBFs, exhibit a 3-fold difference in activity and are differentiated by their hydrophobicity, isoelectric points, and apparent size. Removal of 80% of GGBFs from cytosol abolishes GTPγS sensitivity but does not affect inhibition by aluminum fluoride. We demonstrate that GGBFs are members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family. Recombinant ARF1 exhibits GGBF activity and myristoylation is required. The distinct biochemical properties of GGBFs indicate that members of the ARF family may have related but distinct functions in intracellular transport."

https://openalex.org/W1636701701,"Abstract The carboxyl-terminal sequence of the lac repressor protein contains heptad repeats of leucines at positions 342, 349, and 356 that are required for tetramer assembly, as substitution of these leucine residues yields solely dimeric species (Chakerian, A. E., Tesmer, V. M., Manly, S. P., Brackett, J. K., Lynch, M. J., Hoh, J. T., and Matthews, K. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1371-1374; Alberti, S., Oehler, S., von Wilcken-Bergmann, B., Kramer, H., and Muller-Hill, B. (1991) New Biol. 3, 57-62). To further investigate this region, which may form a leucine zipper motif, a family of lac repressor carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants eliminating the last 4, 5, 11, 18, and 32 amino acids (aa) has been constructed. The -4 aa mutant, in which all of the leucines in the presumed leucine zipper are intact, is tetrameric and displays operator and inducer binding properties similar to wild-type repressor. The -5 aa, -11 aa, -18 aa, and -32 aa deletion mutants, depleted of 1, 2, or all 3 of the leucines in the heptad repeats, are all dimeric, as demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. Circular dichroism spectra and protease digestion studies indicate similar secondary/tertiary structures for the mutant and wild-type proteins. Differences in reaction with a monoclonal antibody specific for a subunit interface are observed for the dimeric versus tetrameric proteins, indicative of exposure of the target epitope as a consequence of deletion. Inducer binding properties of the deletion mutants are similar to wild-type tetrameric repressor at neutral pH. Only small differences in affinity and cooperativity from wild-type are evident at elevated pH; thus, the cooperative unit within the tetramer appears to be the dimer. Apparent operator binding affinity for the dimeric proteins is diminished, although minimal change in operator dissociation rate constants was observed. The diminution in apparent operator affinity may therefore derive from either 1) dissociation of the dimeric mutants to monomer generating a linked equilibrium or 2) alterations in intrinsic operator affinity of the dimers; the former explanation is favored. This detailed characterization of the purified mutant proteins confirms that the carboxyl-terminal region is involved in the dimer-dimer interface and demonstrates that cooperativity for inducer binding is contained within the dimer unit of the tetramer structure."
https://openalex.org/W1517788279,"The Bordetella pertussis calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (CyaA) is a 1706-residue-long toxin, endowed with hemolytic activity. We have constructed B. pertussis mutant strains producing modified CyaAs devoid of adenylate cyclase activity. Our results show that such modified CyaAs display hemolytic activity identical to the wild-type toxin, thus demonstrating that the hemolytic activity is independent of the adenylate cyclase activity. Furthermore, B. pertussis and Escherichia coli strains producing CyaA lacking the catalytic domain (residues 1-373) were constructed. The truncated protein exhibits hemolytic activity comparable to the wild-type toxin, thus establishing that the carboxyl-terminal 1332 residues alone are endowed with hemolytic activity. Together, these findings show that adenylate cyclase and hemolytic activities are located in two distinct regions of the molecule (respectively, approximately amino acids 1-400 and 401-1706) and that the two regions of CyaA are functionally independent."
https://openalex.org/W1528230090,"Recently, we demonstrated that adipose tissue plays an important role in retinol storage and retinol-binding protein (RBP) synthesis. Our data suggested that RBP expression in adipose tissue is dependent on the state of adipocyte differentiation. To examine this possibility, we explored the differentiation-dependent expression of RBP using BFC-1 beta preadipocytes, which can be stimulated to undergo adipose differentiation. Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated (preadipocytes) and differentiated (adipocytes) BFC-1 beta cells and analyzed by Northern blotting. RBP mRNA was not detected in the preadipocytes, but considerable RBP mRNA was present in differentiated BFC-1 beta cells. In BFC-1 beta cells, induced to differentiate with insulin and thyroid hormone, RBP mRNA was first detected after 4 days, reached a maximum level by day 10, and remained at this maximum level for at least 2 more days. Cellular retinol-binding protein was expressed at low levels in the BFC-1 beta preadipocytes and the level of expression increased for 6 days after induction to differentiate and slowly declined on later days. Neither the maximum level of RBP expression nor the day on which this level was reached was influenced by the level of retinol provided in the BFC-1 beta culture medium. BFC-1 beta cells secreted newly synthesized RBP into the culture medium at a rate of 43 +/- 14 ng RBP/24 h/10(6) adipocytes. When the BFC-1 beta adipocytes were provided 1.0 microM retinol in the medium, they accumulated the retinol and synthesized retinyl esters. These studies with BFC-1 beta cells confirm that RBP synthesis and secretion and retinol accumulation are intrinsic properties of differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, they suggest that RBP and cellular retinol-binding protein gene expression are regulated as part of a package of genes which are modulated during adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1605261416,"The Alzheimer's amyloid beta protein is derived from a family of membrane glycoproteins termed amyloid precursor proteins (APP). Here we show that APP exists as the core protein of a chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan, ranging in apparent molecular size from 140 to 250 kDa, secreted by glial cell line C6. After partial purification on ion-exchange and gel chromatography, the secreted APP proteoglycan was recognized on Western blots by several antibodies specific to different regions of APP. Chondroitinase AC or ABC treatment of our samples completely eliminated the high molecular weight proteoglycan with a concomitant increase in the APP protein. This digested product reacted with an anti-stub antibody which recognizes 4-sulfated disaccharide. Sequencing of the N terminus of the core protein of this CS proteoglycan yielded 18 residues identical to the N terminus sequence of the mature APP. Quantitative analysis showed that, in this cell line, about 90% of the secreted nexin II form of APP occurs in the proteoglycan form, suggesting that the CS chains have a role in the biological function of this protein. The close proximity of two consensus CS attachment sites to both the N terminus of the amyloid beta protein and the secretase cleavage site, suggests that the CS chains may affect the proteolysis of APP and production of the amyloid beta protein."
https://openalex.org/W1972101413,"Selection of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in the thymus probably involves TCR-mediated signals transduced in developing thymocytes after interaction with thymic stromal cells bearing self ligands. TCR-transduced signals should have identifiable consequences that would distinguish thymocytes whose TCRs have been engaged by self ligands from those whose TCRs have not. Among thymocytes expressing a transgenic TCR of defined specificity, a large number had elevated intracellular calcium concentrations but only when resident in a negatively selecting thymus in which their self ligand was expressed. Thus, developing thymocytes are stimulated by endogenous ligands in vivo to mobilize intracellular calcium, and increased intracellular calcium concentrations may reflect the consequences of intrathymic signaling associated with thymic negative selection."
https://openalex.org/W1493558477,"Abstract The enzyme responsible for the metalloproteinase activity which cleaves the Glu143-Leu144 bond of (pro)urokinase has been isolated from the conditioned medium of cultured normal human kidney cells. Using S-Sepharose and Cibacron Blue-agarose chromatography, then C-4 reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, a protein of about 20,000 Da was isolated. Through an identical amino-terminal sequence, the protein was shown to be the matrix metalloproteinase previously referred to in the literature as (putative metalloproteinase). When aprotinin was added during the course of the purification, the major species isolated was the zymogen form (28,000 Da) of pump-1. Pump-1 has been shown to efficiently cleave the susceptible bond of both pro-urokinase (single-chain) and active (two-chain) urokinase and thereby produce the corresponding low molecular weight forms. The amino-terminal sequences of the A and B chains of low molecular weight urokinase prepared by action of pump-1 on recombinant high molecular weight urokinase are identical to those of the low molecular weight urokinase isolated from human kidney cell culture. Since the reaction of urokinase with this metalloproteinase results in separation of its serine proteinase region from the domain which mediates binding to the urokinase receptor, it may be of importance in the regulation of the functional activity of the plasminogen activator in cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1484773158,"A1 hnRNP protein, which rapidly renatures complementary strands of nucleic acids in vitro, affects both the equilibrium and kinetic properties of the reaction (single-stranded DNA in equilibrium with double-stranded DNA). A1 lowers the melting transition of duplex DNA. However, at temperatures above this new Tm, both single- and double-stranded DNAs are present at equilibrium and are rapidly interconverting. Although the ratio of single and double strands under these conditions is a function of both the A1 protein and complementary DNA strand concentrations, it is not strongly affected by further increases in temperature. These surprising results demonstrate that A1 does not act as a simple catalyst in promoting renaturation and indicate how A1 and other proteins could act to speed the turnover of intermediate complexes in important biological processes."

https://openalex.org/W1972677631,The Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences points out that malaria a major disease in developing countries is expected to become even worse in the future due in part to the plasmodia becoming more and more resistant to chloroquine and the vectors becoming more and more resistant to insecticides. Further the Hardy-Weinberg equation uses heterozygous gene frequency mutations in the beta chain of hemoglobin A resulting in hemoglobin S in Africa or in the erythrocyte membrane protein band 3 in Southeast Asia to predict that mortality from malaria is likely to increase. A researcher from the US National Institutes of Health believes the best research tools to control malaria are those that focus on Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles mosquitoes rather than just short term benefits of insecticides. The 1st priority should be continued research on an effective vaccine against the asexual erythrocytic plasmodia has much potential since it is this stage that causes disease. Even if it is only able to induce partial immunity the parasite load will be reduced thus reducing mortality. Further a vaccine that would interfere with transmission at the sporozoite or sexual stages used in combination with other forms of control could eliminate malaria in areas of moderate transmission. Another route would be focusing research efforts on those factors that either destroy or block plasmodia in the mosquito or to introduce genes for these factors into the mosquito population. Moreover identifying biochemical pathways unique to plasmodia and development of poisons specific to them presents a promising possibility. For example research can focus on understanding the structure and function of the polymerase and efflux mechanism where plasmodia transform hemoglobin into a nonpoisonous compound. Industry should join with basic scientist to limit and/or prevent malaria.
https://openalex.org/W1542203124,"Chloroplastic envelope membranes isolated from pea (Pisum sativum) leaves are rich in carotenoids, containing approximately 2 micrograms of carotenoid mg-1 protein. We report here that envelopes can be surfactant-solubilized while maintaining association of carotenoids with protein components of the membrane. Treatment of isolated chloroplastic envelope membranes with 0.5% Deriphat 160 (N-lauryl-beta-imminodipropionate) causes general solubilization but preserves an envelope sub-membrane fragment which is fractionated by centrifugation in a sucrose gradient and by chromatography on a column of DEAE-Sephacel. The isolated submembrane complex contained five major proteins with M(r) values equivalent to 75,000, 36,000, 34,000 17,500, and 14,500. Spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses revealed that the complex contains violaxanthin and at least one other carotenoid. Carotenoid content of the fractionated complex was estimated as 4.8 micrograms mg-1 protein. Immunoblot analysis reveals that the constituent proteins of this complex are derived from the chloroplastic outer envelope membrane. These data suggest that at least some of the carotenoids of the chloroplastic envelope may be organized by apoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2056708779,"Activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is required for signal transduction during T cell activation, although the pathway used during thymic selection is unknown. An in vitro system was established in which T cell receptor transgenic thymocytes underwent clonal deletion in response to peptide antigen. The effects of two PTK-specific inhibitors, herbimycin A and genistein, on the clonal deletion of immature thymocytes and the activation of mature thymocytes were examined. Clonal deletion occurred while T cell activation was inhibited and when no p56lck activity was evident. Thus, p56lck is not required for the antigen-stimulated step of clonal deletion of immature thymocytes, and negative selection proceeds via a distinct pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1522811907,"The reactivity to freeze-thawed mitochondria or submitochondrial particles of a whole antiserum raised against the uncoupling protein has been investigated. Incubation with freeze-thawed brown adipose tissue mitochondria trapped antibodies reactive toward accessible parts of the uncoupling protein. One-third to one-half of antibodies against uncoupling protein which were present in the serum remained free. These antibodies were highly reactive with the vesicles obtained by sonication of mitochondria, in which the matricial side of the inner membrane was made accessible. To define epitopes recognized by the antiserum, different fusion proteins made up of MalE protein and uncoupling protein fragments were used. Immunoaffinity chromatography, using an immobilized purified fusion protein containing amino acids 253 to 290 of uncoupling protein, selected antibodies specifically directed against this part of the protein. A more precise localization of the main epitope recognized by these antibodies is proposed. These purified antibodies reacted with the protein only in submitochondrial particles, indicating a matricial orientation of this epitope. This result, associated with other data concerning uncoupling protein or related mitochondrial carriers such as the ADP/ATP translocator and the phosphate carrier, allowed us to determine the orientation of the sixth alpha-helix of the uncoupling protein."
https://openalex.org/W1532689878,"U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) is an abundant small RNA involved in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA of eukaryotic cells. U3 snoRNA has been previously characterized from several sources, including human, rat, mouse, frog, fruit fly, dinoflagellates, slime mold, and yeast; in all these organisms, U3 snoRNA contains trimethylguanosine cap structure. In all instances where investigated, the trimethylguanosine-capped snRNAs including U3 snoRNA, are synthesized by RNA polymerase II. However, in higher plants, the U3 snoRNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase III and contains a cap structure different from trimethylguanosine (Kiss, T., and Solymosy, F. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 1941-1949; Marshallsay, C., Kiss, T., and Filipowicz, W. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 3451-3458; Kiss, T., Marshallsay, C., and Filipowicz, W. (1991) Cell 65, 517-526). In this study, we present evidence that cowpea and, most likely, tomato plant U3 snoRNA contains a methyl-pppA cap structure. These data show that the same U3 snoRNA contains different cap structures in different species and suggest that the kind of cap structure that an uridylic acid-rich small nuclear RNA contains is dependent on the RNA polymerase responsible for its synthesis. In vitro synthesized plant U3 snoRNA, with pppA or pppG as its 5' end, was converted to methyl-pppA/G cap structure in vitro when incubated with extracts prepared from wheat germ or HeLa cells. These data show that the capping machinery is conserved in organisms as evolutionarily distant as plants and mammals. Nucleotides 1-45 of tomato U3 snoRNA, which are capable of forming a stem-loop structure, are sufficient to direct the methyl cap formation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1602519020,"Plasmic degradation products of human fibrin, fragments DD, D, and E, bind to fibrin. It has been inferred from this observation that the binding occurs by attraction of complementary sites located in the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the fibrin molecule. The interaction between fragments D1 and E1 has been investigated in this work since it represents the first step in the process of fibrin clot formation. Fragment D1, that was initially as active as fragment DD, lost most of its anticoagulant activity after purification by cation-exchange chromatography. The lability of fragment D1 function explained the previous unsuccessful attempts to form a complex between fragments D1 and E1. The loss of fragment D1 anticoagulant activity was not associated with the cleavage of the gamma 63-85 chain segment, since fragments D1A and D1 identically inhibited the fibrin monomer polymerization rate. In order to demonstrate the formation of a complex between fragments D1 and E1, three lines of experiments were advanced. First, the anticoagulant activity of fragment D1 was neutralized by fragment E1 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that the association between these fragments involved polymerization sites. Second, two products, D1.E1 and D1.E1.D1, were stabilized in a reaction with bifunctional cross-linking reagents, proving the formation of D.E complexes in aqueous solution. Third, immobilized fragment D1 bound fragments E1 and E2, but not fragment E3, showing that fragments E1 and E2 attached via a polymerization site to the complementary one in fragment D1, since this association was disrupted by fibrin polymerization inhibitory peptide GPRP. These results provided direct evidence for specific binding between the structural D and E domains of fibrin mediated through complementary polymerization sites. Thus, the initial formation of fibrin clot fibers appears to be driven by specific association of these sites."
https://openalex.org/W1606768081,"Levels of expression of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain gene differ significantly in normal and transformed cells. We have identified an S1 nuclease-sensitive site in a GC box located at -55 to -72 in the PDGF A-chain promoter region. We now demonstrate that a 24-base, G-rich complementary oligonucleotide anneals specifically to the C-rich strand of the GC box and protects the GC box from nicking by S1 nuclease whereas the C-rich complementary oligonucleotide and its double-stranded counterpart do not. In transient transfection assays, expression of the PDGF A-chain gene is sharply reduced by deletions within the GC box or if the 24-base G-rich complementary oligonucleotide is preincubated with the promoter construct prior to transfection. The data suggest that the GC box of the PDGF A-chain gene may promote a non-B-form DNA structure, which is recognized by S1 nuclease and which anneals to a short complementary G-rich oligonucleotide. The data also suggest that this non-B-form DNA is important for efficient transcription of PDGF A-chain gene."
https://openalex.org/W1519351228,"The interaction of pertussis toxin (PT) with cells and model membranes was investigated by examining PT-induced intoxication of Chinese hamster ovary cells and by studying the binding of PT and its subunits to phospholipid vesicles. Since certain bacterial toxins require an acidic environment for efficient interaction with membranes and subsequent entry into the cell, the requirement for an acidic environment for PT action was examined. PT, unlike bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, did not require an acidic environment for efficient intoxication of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Potential modes by which PT might interact with biological membranes were studied by examining the binding of PT to a model membrane system. PT was found to be capable of interacting with phospholipid vesicles, however, efficient binding of the toxin to the vesicles occurred only in the presence of both ATP and reducing agent. The A subunit portion of the toxin bound preferentially to the vesicles while little binding of the B oligomer portion of PT to the model membranes was observed. Isolated A subunit, in the absence of the B oligomer, also bound to the vesicles with optimal binding occurring in the presence of reducing agent. After cleavage of the A subunit by trypsin, probably at Arg-181, Arg-182, and/or Arg-193, large fragments which lacked the C-terminal portion of the A subunit of PT no longer associated with the lipid vesicles. These results suggest that the A subunit of PT can interact directly with a lipid matrix and, if freed from the constraints imposed by the B oligomer, may be capable of interacting with cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1571647698,"The effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) are cell-specific, ranging from its immunosuppressive action on cells of the immune system to a variety of nonimmunologic toxic side effects. The predominant undesirable side effects of CsA occur in the kidney. Although many toxic renal effects of CsA have been described, the molecular basis of the nephrotoxicity is unknown. Elucidation of the molecular basis for the renal action of CsA may shed light on the function of cyclophilin in nonimmune cell types. The present study demonstrates that CsA selectively reduces the gluconeogenic capacity of rat proximal tubules via a decrease in activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase (transphosphorylating), E.C. 4.1.1.32; PEPCK). The decrease in renal PEPCK activity occurs within 3 days and reflects a corresponding reduction in renal PEPCK mRNA abundance. This, in turn, is due to a selective inhibition of renal PEPCK gene transcription. Expression of several other renal genes is unaffected by CsA, as is expression of the PEPCK gene in liver. Thus, the effects of CsA are organ-specific and do not represent a general cytotoxic effect on proximal tubule cells. These results suggest that selective inhibition of the activity of a transcription factor(s) required for expression of specific genes in renal tubules may play a role in CsA-induced nephrotoxicity."
