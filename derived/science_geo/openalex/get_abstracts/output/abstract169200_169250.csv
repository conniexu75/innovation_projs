https://openalex.org/W2110240734,"Long-term modification of synaptic efficacy can depend on the timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In model studies, such spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) introduces the desirable features of competition among synapses and regulation of postsynaptic firing characteristics. STDP strengthens synapses that receive correlated input, which can lead to the formation of stimulus-selective columns and the development, refinement, and maintenance of selectivity maps in network models. The temporal asymmetry of STDP suppresses strong destabilizing self-excitatory loops and allows a group of neurons that become selective early in development to direct other neurons to become similarly selective. STDP, acting alone without further hypothetical global constraints or additional forms of plasticity, can also reproduce the remapping seen in adult cortex following afferent lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2064132534,"We characterized beta-synuclein, the non-amyloidogenic homolog of alpha-synuclein, as an inhibitor of aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a molecule implicated in Parkinson's disease. For this, doubly transgenic mice expressing human (h) alpha- and beta-synuclein were generated. In doubly transgenic mice, beta-synuclein ameliorated motor deficits, neurodegenerative alterations, and neuronal alpha-synuclein accumulation seen in halpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Similarly, cell lines transfected with beta-synuclein were resistant to alpha-synuclein accumulation. halpha-synuclein was coimmunoprecipitated with hbeta-synuclein in the brains of doubly transgenic mice and in the double-transfected cell lines. Our results raise the possibility that beta-synuclein might be a natural negative regulator of alpha-synuclein aggregation and that a similar class of endogenous factors might regulate the aggregation state of other molecules involved in neurodegeneration. Such an anti-amyloidogenic property of beta-synuclein might also provide a novel strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2100056505,"Synapses driven by action potentials are thought to release transmitter in an all-or-none fashion; either one synaptic vesicle undergoes exocytosis, or there is no release. We have estimated the glutamate concentration transient at climbing fiber synapses on Purkinje cells by measuring the inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) produced by a low-affinity competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors, gamma-DGG. The results, together with simulations using a kinetic model of the AMPA receptor, suggest that the peak glutamate concentration at this synapse is dependent on release probability but is not affected by pooling of transmitter released from neighboring synapses. We propose that the mechanism responsible for the elevated glutamate concentration at this synapse is the simultaneous release of multiple vesicles per site."
https://openalex.org/W2041045861,"We mapped ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in normal human subjects using high-field (4 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a segmented echo planar imaging technique and an in-plane resolution of 0.47 x 0.47 mm(2). The differential responses to left or right eye stimulation could be reliably resolved in anatomically well-defined sections of V1. The orientation and width ( approximately 1 mm) of mapped ODC stripes conformed to those previously revealed in postmortem brains stained with cytochrome oxidase. In addition, we showed that mapped ODC patterns could be largely reproduced in different experiments conducted within the same experimental session or over different sessions. Our results demonstrate that high-field fMRI can be used for studying the functions of human brains at columnar spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1614519645,"In response to growth factor stimulation, many mammalian cells transiently generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to the elevation of tyrosine-phosphorylated and glutathionylated proteins. While investigating EGF-induced glutathionylation in A431 cells, paradoxically we found deglutathionylation of a major 42-kDa protein identified as actin. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the glutathionylation site is Cys-374. Deglutathionylation of the G-actin leads to about a 6-fold increase in the rate of polymerization.In vivo studies revealed a 12% increase in F-actin content 15 min after EGF treatment, and F-actin was found in the cell periphery suggesting that in response to growth factor, actin polymerizationin vivo is regulated by a reversible glutathionylation mechanism. Deglutathionylation is most likely catalyzed by glutaredoxin (thioltranferase), because Cd(II), an inhibitor of glutaredoxin, inhibits intracellular actin deglutathionylation at 2 μm, comparable with its IC50 in vitro. Moreover, mass spectral analysis showed efficient transfer of GSH from immobilized S-glutathionylated actin to glutaredoxin.

In response to growth factor, ROS, such as O2− or H2O2, effectively inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) by converting the active site cysteines to sulfenic acids. The sulfenic derivatives are readily S-glutathionylated by GSH, which is abundant in mammalian cells (6Cooper A.J.L. Rosenberg R.N. Prusiner S.B. DiMauro S. Barchi R.L. Kunk L.M.

PTP inhibition leads to elevation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, thereby promoting signal transduction cascades. Reactivation of glutathionylated PTP is most likely catalyzed by glutaredoxin, characterized as the primary enzyme for protein-SSG deglutathionylation in cells (7Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A.

As the intracellular redox equilibrium shifts toward oxidation and protein phosphorylation in response to extracellular stimuli, cytoskeletal changes also occur. Actin, an abundant and ubiquitous cellular protein, plays a major role in mediating the infrastructure and dynamics of the cytoplasmic matrix (9Kabsch W. Vandekerckhove J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Actins, A Complete Data Resource.in: 4th Edition. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-23Google Scholar). Actin polymerization is a dynamic process implicated in growth factor-mediated cytoskeletal changes (11Rijken P.J. Hage W.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 491-499PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report both in vitro and in vivo data that indicate EGF-induced deglutathionylation of the penultimate cysteine residue of actin facilitates its polymerization and cytoskeletal changes. The human epidermal A431 cell line was from ATCC; bovine muscle actin, EGF, DTNB, NADPH, GSSG reductase, carboxymethyl-BSA, CM-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, GSSG, and GSH were from Sigma; rabbit muscle actin was a generous gift from Dr. Xiong Liu; monoclonal anti-GSH antibody was obtained from Virogen; pYFP-actin vector was from CLONTECH; DCF-Ac and Phalloidin-Oregon Green 488 were from Molecular Probes; precast SDS gels and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Invitrogen; Fugene6 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; H2O2 was from Fisher; CdCl2 and 2-vinyl pyridine were from Aldrich. [14C]Iodoacetamide was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Recombinant human glutaredoxin was expressed in Escherichia coli (12Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and purified as described (13Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Typical specific activity of pure enzyme is 100 units/mg in the standard assay with cysteinyl-glutathione disulfide and GSH as substrates (12Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A431 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum to 90% confluency. After washing and incubating with PBS (30–60 min at 37 °C), the cells were incubated with H2O2 or EGF (at the indicated concentrations) at room temperature for 30 or 10 min, respectively. Cells were lysed with 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer without reducing agents and subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) and Western blot analysis using anti-GSH antibody. A431 cells were grown as described to 70% confluency. Then they were starved in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (containing 2 mmMg2+ and phenol red) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by addition of DCF-Ac (3 μm). After 45 min, excess DCF-Ac was washed out, and the cells were incubated in Hanks’ solution with or without EGF (0.17 μm). After 15 min at room temperature, fluorescent images were obtained as described (2Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). A431 cells were grown to 90% confluency. After starvation in PBS for 2 h, cells were exposed to EGF (5 μm) or H2O2 (10 mm) or PBS (control) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by lysis in 50 μl of buffer A (125 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100. Measurement of the [GSSG]/[Total GSH] ratio was adapted from Griffith (14Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4000) Google Scholar). To determine cysteine pKa values, pH-dependent radiolabel incorporation into rabbit muscle actin from [14C] iodoacetamide was carried out analogous to previous studies (15Srinirasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Buffers (10 mm) (MES (pH 5–7), HEPPSO (pH 7–9), CAPS (pH 9–10)) were adjusted to 0.5 m ionic strength and contained carboxymethyl-BSA (as coprecipitant) in the absence (control) or presence of 6 μm actin and 18 μm[14C]IAM. The reaction proceeded for 10 min, and then the proteins were precipitated, washed, and the radioactivity was determined. Bovine muscle actin (10 μm) in buffer A (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2) was incubated in the absence or presence of 200 μm GSSG at room temperature for 5 min. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 100 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 and monitored by light scattering (550 nm). A431 cells were grown to 80% confluency. After starvation for 8 h in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, the cells were equilibrated in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated for 20 min more in the absence (control) or presence of EGF (2 μm). Medium was removed and the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with phalloidin-Oregon Green 488. After extensive washing with PBS, 1 ml of 2% SDS was added to each well to dissolve cell contents (37 °C, 10 h), and absorbance at 280 nm and fluorescence (496 nm excitation and 520 nm emission) were measured. F-actin content was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence intensity toA 280 nm. A431 cells grown on a glass plate (70% confluency) were transfected with a yellow fluorescent protein fused to a β-actin (pYFP-actin) vector using Fugene6. Upon expression of the fused protein (3∼4 days later), cells were subjected to starvation in PBS for 12 h prior to EGF treatment (2 μm). Fluorescent images of a single cell were recorded before and after 3, 5, and 10 min incubations with EGF (see the legend for Fig. 4). A431 cells were grown to 90% confluency. After cells were incubated with PBS alone or with CdCl2 (2 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C, 1 μm EGF (or no EGF for controls) was added and incubated for 20 min more. Medium was removed, and the extent of actin glutathionylation was monitored using anti-GSH as described above. Rabbit muscle actin (∼ 100 μg) was immobilized onto ∼200-μl dry volume of DNaseI-coupled resin and glutathionylated with 1 mm GSSG in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After thorough washing with PBS, the resin was suspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.2 nmol (2.3 μg) of glutaredoxin and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to LC-MS analysis with a Finnigan LCQ (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer. Monoclonal anti-GSH antibody was used to investigate growth factor-mediated protein glutathionylation in vivo. Fig.1 A shows that H2O2 treatment induced glutathionylation of a 42-kDa protein in a concentration-dependent manner in human epidermal carcinoma A431 cells. With 10 mmH2O2 (lane 9), the extent of glutathionylation of the 42-kDa protein was enhanced about 10-fold relative to that observed without H2O2. Equal amounts of loaded protein were verified by Coomassie Blue staining of an equivalent SDS gel (data not shown). In contrast, treatment of the same cell line with increasing concentrations of EGF surprisingly resulted in a progressive decrease in the extent of glutathionylation of the same protein band (Fig. 1 B). At 0.5 μmEGF (lane 5), the glutathionylated 42-kDa protein was diminished to approximately one-third of the basal level. When EGF was raised to 2 μm or higher, glutathionylation was no longer observable (lanes 7 and 8). The unexpected decrease in glutathionylation of the 42-kDa protein prompted us to examine ROS generation in A431 cells in response to EGF. Using the membrane-permeable fluorescent ROS indicator DCF-Ac, we found that 0.17 μm EGF induced a rapid ROS production as indicated by enhancement of fluorescence intensity (data not shown). This is in agreement with Bae et al. (2Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Because the [GSSG]/[Total GSH] redox ratio affects the state of glutathionylated proteins, we also examined the effect of EGF-induced ROS production on the redox state of GSH (Fig.2). For control cells, the redox ratio was 3.4 ± 0.1%. When cells were treated with 1 μmEGF or 10 mm H2O2 for 30 min, the [GSSG]/[Total GSH] ratio increased to 6.2 ± 1% or 17 ± 2%, respectively. These results indicate that EGF did shift the cellular redox equilibrium toward more oxidative, so the observed deglutathionylation of the 42-kDa protein most likely is due to an active compensatory process that is required for cellular response. This unexpected dichotomy was also observed with HeLa cells. To identify the 42-kDa protein, we used HeLa cells to obtain a larger quantity of the protein. The protein was purified to homogeneity using consecutive FPLC chromatographic separations, which included CM-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and phenyl-Sepharose, followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The purified protein was subjected to trypsin digestion and peptide sequence analysis (Michigan State University Core Facility) and was thereby identified as the cytoplasmic actin. Glutathionylation of actin, among other proteins, has been observed in other cells under varying conditions of oxidative stress,e.g. gastric mucosal cells treated with H2O2 or diamide (16Rokutan K. Johnson Jr., R.B. Kawai K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G247-G254PubMed Google Scholar) and PMA-stimulated neutrophils (17Chai Y.-C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In these cases, increasedS-glutathionylation of actin was observed. However, the site(s) of adduction of the GS moiety was not identified, and its physiological implications were not investigated. Purified actin contains six cysteine residues. To investigate the relationship between actin structure/conformation and the physiological consequences of its S-glutathionylation, the stoichiometry and site(s) of glutathionylation were determined in vitro using rabbit muscle actin as the protein source because of its high purity and sequence homology. When the actin was incubated with 1 mm GSSG for 30 min, the modified actin showed a molecular mass increase of 305 Da relative to untreated actin, based on LC-MS analysis, indicating incorporation of one GSH per actin. The modified actin was then subjected to CNBr cleavage followed by mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides. The 305-Da GSH moiety was found to be associated with a peptide (WITKQEYDEAGPSIVHRKCF) encompassing the C-terminal penultimate cysteine. This result identified the penultimate cysteine (Cys-374) as the most likely glutathionylation site in vivo, consistent with findings that this cysteine appears to be the most reactive; it was preferentially labeled at physiological pH by thiol-modifying reagents (10Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Actins, A Complete Data Resource.in: 4th Edition. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-23Google Scholar, 18Elzinga M. Collins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5897-5905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3654-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). With 7-dimethylamino-4-methyl-(N-maleimidyl)-coumarin as the thiol reagent, Cys-257 of G-actin was found to be modified (20Liu D.F. Wang D. Stracher A. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This suggests that the relative reactivity of the cysteines in actin may not be determined by unusually low pKa values, but by their accessibility. Accordingly, we investigated the pH dependence of the reaction of actin with [14C]IAM. The data (not shown) revealed a single inflection point corresponding to a normal pKa of 8.4, and only one carboxamido moiety was incorporated per actin molecule when iodoacetamide was maintained at a 3-fold molar excess relative to actin. However, when actin was treated with a 12-fold molar excess of IAM at pH 11, nearly six carboxamido moieties were incorporated, corresponding to the six cysteine residues per actin monomer. Several reports have addressed the relationship between the states of thiol groups on actin and its state of polymerization (16Rokutan K. Johnson Jr., R.B. Kawai K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G247-G254PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chai Y.-C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Hinshaw D.B. Burger J.M. Beals T.F. Armstrong B.C. Hyslop P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Stournaras C. Anticancer Res. 1990; 10: 1651-1659PubMed Google Scholar); however, no clear understanding of the effect of oxidative modification can be derived from those studies. Therefore, we studied the relative rates of polymerization of the glutathionylated and non-glutathionylated forms of bovine muscle G-actin induced by 2 mm Mg2+ and 100 mm KCl. Monitored by light scattering, the steady-state rate for non-glutathionylated actin polymerization was at least 5.6-fold faster than that of the glutathionylated actin (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with the finding that a small cleft exists in the actin molecule in the vicinity of Cys-374, and the size of this cleft is reduced upon polymerization (23Sasaki Y. Tsunomori F. Yamashita T. Horie K. Ushiki H Ishikawa R. Kohama K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 236-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the GSH moiety at the penultimate cysteine is expected to hinder the rate of actin polymerization. Furthermore, in vitro modifications of the highly conserved C terminus of actin including cysteineS-glutathionylation and C terminus truncation of the last two residues led to destabilization of filamentous actin (24Drewes G. Faulstich H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Drewes G. Faulstich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological effect of EGF-mediated actin deglutathionylation on F-actin formation was investigated both in batch and at the single cell level. When A431 cells, with or without 1 μm EGF, were incubated for 20 min and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the filamentous actin indicator, phalloidin Oregon Green 488, the results revealed that the F-actin increased by 12 ± 7% with EGF treatment. Our findings could provide a rationale for the report of Rijken et al. (11Rijken P.J. Hage W.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 491-499PubMed Google Scholar) that likewise showed EGF treatment of cells induces actin polymerization. For single cell experiments A431 cells were transfected with actin fused with yellow fluorescent protein, and actin polymerization was monitored by confocal fluoromicroscopy. The data show that actin was evenly distributed in the cytosol prior to EGF treatment (Fig.4 A); however, after a 10-min treatment with 1 μm EGF, the light intensity increased with the majority of the light emanating from the cell periphery (Fig.4 B). This local fluorescent enhancement was observed 3 min after EGF treatment. Membrane ruffling was transiently observed and started to disappear at around 5 min. Together, these results indicate that EGF causes an increase in F-actin and its translocation toward the periphery of the cell. The fact that EGF treatment causes deglutathionylation of actin in both A431 and HeLa cells suggests that this deglutathionylation reaction is well regulated and correlated with cell signaling processes. Glutaredoxin is most likely the enzyme for this reaction, based on its specificity and relative efficiency for protein-SSG deglutathionylation (7Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel-Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar, 8Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Supporting data for this notion are derived from both in vitro and in vivo studies. Rabbit muscle actin was immobilized on DNase I-coupled resin and treated with 1 mm GSSG in PBS to form glutathionylated actin at the penultimate cysteine. The resin was washed and resuspended in PBS buffer. This immobilized glutathionylated actin was then incubated with pure recombinant human glutaredoxin. The supernatants from both control and glutathionylated actin-treated samples were subjected to LC-ESI-MS analysis. Fig.5 A shows that the control glutaredoxin displays the expected molecular mass of 11,648 Da, whereas the glutaredoxin exposed to the immobilized glutathionylated actin displayed an increase in mass of 305 Da (Fig. 5 B), consistent with transfer of a glutathione moiety from the immobilized actin to the glutaredoxin. To address the in vivo role of glutaredoxin, we investigated the effects of Cd2+, a known glutaredoxin inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit intracellular deglutathionylation (8Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Here, A431 cells were preincubated with 2 μm CdCl2, the IC50 range observed in vitro, for 1 h prior to treatment with EGF. Western blot analysis (Fig.6) revealed that Cd2+ itself had little effect on actin glutathionylation prior to EGF treatment (lanes 1 and 3). However, Cd2+inhibited EGF-induced actin deglutathionylation (lanes 2 and 4). Together, these results indicate that glutaredoxin is responsible for the deglutathionylation of actin in response to growth factor stimulation in A431 cells. Because conventional actins serve to provide a framework for cellular structure and mobility, constant movement and morphological changes of cells are achieved by a rapid rearrangement of actin filaments (11Rijken P.J. Hage W.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 491-499PubMed Google Scholar,26Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holms K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). To achieve these multiple cellular functions, actin polymerization, translocation, polarity, and rate of assembly are rigorously regulated by a large number of actin-binding proteins as well as by covalent modifications that may also target the actin-binding proteins (10Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Actins, A Complete Data Resource.in: 4th Edition. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-23Google Scholar). Actin phosphorylation (27Van Delft S. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation (28Aktories K. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have been reported, and these events are linked to the state of polymerization, although details of the covalent modifications in the signal transduction pathways have not been fully investigated. Previously, it was reported that the EGF receptor is associated specifically with actin filaments in A431 cells (29Enhenegouwen P.M.P.V. Denhartigh J.C. Romen P. Verkleu A.J. Boonstra J. Exp.

Our findings directly link this growth factor-mediated signaling pathway to deglutathionylation of actin at its penultimate cysteine residue, catalyzed by glutaredoxin, which leads to enhancement of the rate of actin polymerization and translocalization of the polymerized actin to the cell periphery. These results also highlight the importance of reversible glutathionylation of protein as a physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism. It is remarkable that the same EGF stimulus results in opposite changes in the intracellular state of glutathionylation of PTP1B (5Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Keng Y.-F. Zhang Z.-Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B.

https://openalex.org/W2024426605,"We examined the intracellular transport of sterol in living cells using a naturally fluorescent cholesterol analog, dehydroergosterol (DHE), which has been shown to mimic many of the properties of cholesterol. By using DHE loaded on methyl-β-cyclodextrin, we followed this cholesterol analog in pulse-chase studies. At steady state, DHE co-localizes extensively with transferrin (Tf), a marker for the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), and redistributes with Tf in cells with altered ERC morphology. Expression of a dominant-negative mutation of an ERC-associated protein, mRme-1 (G429R), results in the slowing of both DHE and Tf receptor return to the cell surface. [<sup>3</sup>H]Cholesterol is found in the same fraction as<sup>125</sup>I-Tf on sucrose density gradients, and this fraction can be specifically shifted to a higher density based on the presence of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Tf in the same organelle. Whereas vesicular transport of Tf and efflux of DHE from the ERC are entirely blocked in energy-depleted cells, delivery of DHE to the ERC from the plasma membrane is only slightly affected. Biochemical studies performed using [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol show that the energy dependence of cholesterol transport to and from the ERC is similar to DHE transport. We propose that a large portion of intracellular cholesterol is localized in the ERC, and this pool might be important in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1983064145,"We investigated the role of Ras in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated signal transduction and the promotion of angiogenic changes primary endothelial cells. We find that VEGF potently induces Ras activation and that this step is essential for the stimulation by VEGF of several cellular changes associated with angiogenesis, including proliferation, migration, and branching morphogenesis in three-dimensional culture. Inhibition of Ras signaling induced subtle changes in the actin architecture but had no effect on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or p38 signaling pathways. In contrast, activation of ERK was largely dependent on Ras. Although inhibiting ERK activity completely suppressed cell proliferation and partially blocked in vitrodifferentiation, neither ERK nor PI3K activity was required for VEGF-induced migration. These data provide the first direct demonstration that inhibition of Ras signal transduction is anti-angiogenic. Interestingly, VEGF signal transduction bifurcates both upstream and downstream of Ras, with different Ras-dependent signals controlling endothelial cell proliferation and migration, essential components of the angiogenic response.

In addition, angiogenesis is a critical component of several human diseases, including cancer, diabetic microvascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7464) Google Scholar,2Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7215) Google Scholar). Although a number of soluble factors have been described as angiogenic, e.g. platelet derived growth factor (PDGF1), basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF), and hepatocyte growth factor, most of these factors and their cognate receptors have a wide tissue distribution and modulate many cell types (3Mustonen T. Alitalo K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In contrast, the receptors for VEGF (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2) are largely restricted to endothelial cells (4Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 5Peters K.G. De Vries C. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This has given rise to the idea that VEGF may be a criticalcomponent of the angiogenic response (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7464) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7215) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by several lines of investigation: 1) VEGF is essential for vascular development as evidenced by mice deficient in VEGF, which die at 8.5–9 days gestation with abnormalities in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (6Ferrara N. Carver-Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W. Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar, 7Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G.

Nature. 1996; 380: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (3454) Google Scholar); 2) mice lacking either VEGFR-1 (8Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C.

Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar) also demonstrate abnormal vascular development and early gestational lethality (days 8.5–9); 3) striking co-localization of VEGF and VEGFRs can be demonstrated by in situ hybridization, at areas of vascular development in the developing embryo (4Millauer B.

Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) VEGF expression is also markedly induced by decreases in oxygen tension (11Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar), thereby providing a tissue with the means to compensate for hypoxic stress by stimulating new vessel growth. Furthermore, inhibitors of VEGF's action markedly blunt angiogenesis (12Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 13Fong T.A. Shawver L.K. Sun L. Tang C. App H. Powell T.J. Kim Y.H. Schreck R. Wang X. Risau W. Ullrich A. Hirth K.P. McMahon G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the biological importance of VEGF, the molecular signaling mechanisms responsible for its effects remain largely unclarified. There are two high affinity VEGF receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) (14de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) and VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR) (15Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). These receptors are 45% identical to each other and most homologous to the PDGF-receptor family. The VEGF receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and ligand binding to these receptors induces dimerization and phosphorylation of the receptors (16Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), ultimately resulting in the recruitment of Src homology (SH)-2 domain containing proteins. Several SH2-domain proteins are reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to VEGF. These include p120GAP (GTPase Activating Protein) (17Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cγ, and the SH-2/SH-3 adapter protein Nck (18Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) has also been described (19Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar, 20Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Doanes A.M. Hegland D.D. Sethi R. Kovesdi I. Bruder J.T. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The activation of ERK and PI3K, reorganization of actin, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120GAP are cellular changes often associated with the activation of Ras signal transduction. These changes occur in response to a number of mitogenic growth factors (22van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Although the suggestion has recently been made that inhibition of Ras might be an effective anti-angiogenic therapy (23Kerbel R.S. Viloria-Petit A. Klement G. Rak J. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1248-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a direct role for Ras in VEGF-mediated signal transduction remains ambiguous (20Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Doanes A.M. Hegland D.D. Sethi R. Kovesdi I. Bruder J.T. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The role of Ras in regulating the angiogenic phenotype induced by VEGF is unknown. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Ras signal transduction may be critical in regulating endothelial cell function. Notably, the VEGF receptors are of the same family as the PDGF, colony-stimulating factor, and stem cell factor receptors, which all require Ras to transmit mitogenic signals, as do many growth factors (22van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of an activated Ras allele to an SV-40 large T-antigen immortalized endothelial line resulted in an angiogenic switch and the formation of endotheliomas (25Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In another study, microinjection of an activated Ras protein resulted in altered endothelial cell motility, and microinjection of blocking antibodies to the Ras protein blocked endothelial cell migration in response to bFGF (26Fox P.L. Sa G. Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3519-3526PubMed Google Scholar). In genetic experiments, mice that are deficient in p120GAP (a protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling) showed abnormal endothelial cell organization and failed to form a vascular network (27Henkemeyer M. Rossi D.J. Holmyard D.P. Puri M.C. Mbamalu G. Harpal K. Shih T.S. Jacks T. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 377: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, mice deficient in B-Raf, a downstream kinase normally activated by Ras GTPases, showed marked endothelial cell apoptosis (28Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Beck T.W. Hahn H. Bernal R. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At this point, it is unclear whether any of the effects observed in mice are the direct result of disruption of endothelial pathways, perturbations to the surrounding stroma, or a combination of both. When taken collectively, however, these experiments suggest that Ras has the potential to modulate mitogenesis, endothelial cell motility, cell survival, as well as the organization and differentiation into a vessel. These actions are all critical to angiogenesis, and all are effects that are induced by VEGF. However, to date, a direct evaluation of the role of Ras-mediated signal transduction and its relationship to the control of the angiogenic phenotype by VEGF has not been undertaken. This study investigates the role of Ras and several downstream signal transduction pathways in regulating proliferation, migration, and in vitro differentiation following VEGF stimulation of primary endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from pooled donors were purchased from VEC Technologies (Troy, NY) and cultured in M199 media supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 μg/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Biomedical Products). In some cases, we have also done experiments with HUVECs from another vendor (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as well as from fresh isolations performed as previously described (29Elgjo R.F. Henriksen T. Evensen S.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1975; 162: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similar results were found with all cell sources. Cells were cultured on tissue culture dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Bovine lung microvessel endothelial cells (BLMVECS) were purchased from VEC Technologies (Troy, NY) and cultured in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. In some experiments reduced (2.5%) or serum-free MCDB-131 supplemented with l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin was used as indicated. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes or 12-well plates. They were serum-deprived and stimulated with vehicle or VEGF (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) as indicated. Whole cell lysates were collected using Laemmli sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar), followed by boiling the samples for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and run at 150 V for ∼1 h. The proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose paper at 300 mA for 1.5 h, followed by Western blot analysis. Blots were blocked with either 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, or 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies, anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20:HRPO, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HA (BAbCO, Richmond, CA), anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-Akt,B. O. anti-p38, and anti-Akt (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were used at a dilution of 1:1000; anti-pan Ras antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) was used at 1:250. All antibodies were added for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the appropriate secondary antibodies (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were added at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, blots were developed with Super Signal enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and visualized on Kodak-AR film, following automated development. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes, and two plates per assay point. They were serum-deprived overnight and stimulated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 min where indicated. Cells were lysed in medium salt buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, and Complete anti-protease mixture) (Roche Biochemical, Indianapolis, IN), 600 μl per pair of plates. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The extracts were incubated with 3 μg of GST-RBD (amino acids 53–132 of human Raf-1) (31Pumiglia K.M. LeVine H. Haske T. Habib T. Jove R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14251-14254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed in medium salt buffer, followed by several washes in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blotted with anti-pan Ras antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Science) as described above. A hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the N terminus of RasN17 by PCR with custom primers encoding the amino acids YPYDVPDYA (primer sequences available upon request). The RasN17 cDNA was a generous gift of Larry Feig (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston MA). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCR-script (Stratagene), and the sequence was confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing at the Albany Medical College sequencing facility (Albany, NY), using primers to the T7 and M13 sites in pCR-script. The AdEasy system was used to generate recombinant adenoviruses coding for the HA-tagged dominant negative RasN17, essentially as previously described (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). HA-RasN17 was excised from pCR-script by digestion withBamHI and NotI and ligated into the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector digested with BglII and NotI. To generate Ad.HA-RasN17, the plasmid, HA-RasN17/Adtrack-CMV, was linearized with the restriction endonuclease PmeI. The linear plasmid was cotransformed intoEscherichia coli BJ5183 cells with the pAdEasy-1 plasmid containing an E1- and E3-deleted Ad5 genome. Clones undergoing homologous recombination were selected using resistance to kanamycin and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Once the presence of the inserted gene was established, the recombinant plasmid was linearized with PacI and transfected into a viral packaging cell line, HEK-293 (ATCC), using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD). Foci producing recombinant viruses were amplified by serial passage, and purified high titer viruses were generated using cesium chloride density centrifugation. Viral titers were estimated by absorbance at 260 nm using the established value of 1 × 1012 viral particles, equal to an absorbance of 1.0, and the estimate that the ratio of infectious particles:non-infectious particles was 20:1. Infection efficiency was monitored under a microscope by visualizing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker that is co-expressed in the AdTrack-AdEasy recombinants (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). Typical experiments used an estimated multiplicity of infection of ∼50 after preliminary experiments in both HUVEC and BLMVEC cultures demonstrated that this level of infection with Ad.GFP resulted in visible expression of GFP in nearly 100% of the cells without any overt consequences to cell morphology or survival for up to 2 weeks following infection (not shown). HUVECs were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown to near confluence. Cells were serum-deprived overnight for 16 h, followed by stimulation as described. Cells were infected with Ad.GFP or Ad.HA-RasN17 during the incubation in serum-free media. Following stimulation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of MIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 1 mmpara-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and Complete anti-protease mixture). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with 1 μg each of polyclonal antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-093 and SC-154, respectively). Precipitated ERK activity was assessed essentially as we have previously described (33Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) using myelin basic protein as a substrate (Invitrogen). The extent of phosphorylation was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Equivalent precipitation of ERK was routinely evaluated using anti-ERK polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Richmond CA). HUVECs were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells per 24 wells and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were infected with Ad.GFP or Ad.HA-RasN17 for 16 h in reduced serum MCDB-131 and stimulated with or without 25 ng/ml VEGF for an additional 16 h. Alternatively, non-infected HUVECs were serum-starved overnight and pretreated with or without 10 μm PD98059 or 1 μm U0126 for 15 min prior to VEGF stimulation. Cells were pulsed with 10 μm5′-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 3 h, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with an anti-BrdUrd antibody followed by a Texas Red anti-mouse secondary antibody to visualize the BrdUrd incorporation. Cells were counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye to label the cell nuclei. A fluorescence microscope equipped with a Spot-2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling heights, MI) was used to collect three random 10× fields, and the percentage of positive cells per 10× field was calculated using ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Results were normalized to control and are reported as the average -fold increase in BrdUrd-labeled cells. Transwell tissue culture inserts (Costar, Corning, NY) containing 8-μm pores were coated with 10 μg/ml collagen for 2 h at 37 °C. HUVECs infected with adenovirus or uninfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h, trypsinized, and seeded in serum-free M199 media at 1 × 105 cells per insert onto the top surface in serum-free media. The lower chamber contained VEGF at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Non-migratory cells adhered to the top surface were removed with cotton swabs. Cells adhered on the bottom surface were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and stained with Hoechst dye at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 20 min. Cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope, and three random 10× fields were collected using a digital camera. The average cell number per field was computed following automated counting of the digitized images in ImagePro Plus. HUVECs infected with adenovirus or uninfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h and trypsinized, and cells were seeded at 5 × 104 per well of 12-well dishes pre-coated with 10 μg/ml collagen. Cells were stimulated with or without 50 ng/ml VEGF for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Non-adhered cells were detached by rocking the 12-well plates on a rotator for 60 s. Cells that remained adhered were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye followed by analysis using fluorescence microscopy, as described above. HUVECS infected with Ad.GFP and Ad.HA-RasN17 were trypsinized, and 5.6 × 104 cells were seeded onto 12-mm circle glass coverslips that were precoated with 10 μg/ml collagen. Cells were maintained in serum-free media overnight. Fresh media was administered to the cells 2 h prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 15 min. The cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in cold 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to reduce nonspecific background staining. Labeling of filamentous actin was attained by staining with 0.5 units/ml of Texas Red-X Phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. For visualization, the coverslips containing cells were mounted onto glass slides in Vectashield mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using a digital fluorescence microscope. Collagen gels were prepared using a neutral solution of 1 mg/ml collagen in 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 50 ng/ml VEGF supplemented. The gels were allowed to polymerize in a 24-well plate for 1 h at 37 °C. Uninfected or infected (Ad.GFP or Ad.HA-RasN17) BLMVECS were seeded at 1.5 × 104 per well and were grown in MCDB-131 supplemented with 2.5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 48 h in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. In some experiments, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μm PD98059 or 1 μmU0126. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. After washing, cells were photographed with a Spot-2 digital camera, and the cumulative tube length was measured using ImagePro Plus, essentially as previously described (34Lee M.J. Thangada S.

The stimulation of Ras and subsequent activation of its downstream effector molecules is critical in the biological response of many receptor tyrosine kinases. Compelling circumstantial evidence also suggests a potential role for Ras in regulating angiogenesis. Therefore, our initial experiments were directed at determining if Ras became activated following stimulation with VEGF in primary human endothelial cells. Two previous reports came to opposite conclusions regarding the stimulation of Ras by VEGF (20Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Doanes A.M. Hegland D.D. Sethi R. Kovesdi I. Bruder J.T. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To maximize sensitivity in our experiments we chose to use the Ras binding domain pull-down method, (35Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 36de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) rather than the less sensitive immunoprecipitation method employed in the earlier studies (20Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Doanes A.M. Hegland D.D. Sethi R. Kovesdi I. Bruder J.T. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a positive control for assay specificity, we transfected 293 cells with expression constructs coding for either a constitutively activated Ras (RasV12) or one incapable of binding GTP (RasN17). The clarified lysates were tested for Ras binding to GST-RBD. As shown in Fig.1A, the binding showed excellent selectivity between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ras, even when highly overexpressed. We next sought to determine if Ras activation was detectable following stimulation with VEGF. Acute stimulation of serum-deprived HUVECs with VEGF resulted in a robust activation of Ras after 5 min of stimulation, as evidenced by binding to GST-RBD. A similar degree of stimulation was found with bFGF (Fig.1B). To study the role of Ras in VEGF signal transduction and the VEGF-induced angiogenic phenotype, we wished to genetically manipulate Ras activation. To do this we chose to make a recombinant adenovirus coding for the dominant negative Ras mutant, RasN17. An epitope-tagged HA-RasN17 was cloned into the Adtrack shuttle vector that contains two CMV promoters, one driving expression of HA-RasN17, and the second driving GFP expression. This shuttle vector was used to generate a recombinant adenovirus using the AdEasy system originally described by He et al. (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). Using this recombinant virus, we observed high efficiency infection (essentially 100%) of HUVECs and BLMVECs as assessed by comparing GFP-expressing cells to the total number of cells, visualized by staining with Hoechst dye to label the nuclei (data not shown). The expression of the dominant negative allele of Ras was confirmed routinely by Western blot analysis using an antibody to the HA epitope (Fig. 2A, see also Fig.7A). In addition, using the same technique, we demonstrated that expression of Ad.RasN17 in primary endothelial cells did not interfere with VEGF receptor phosphorylation. Cells expressing RasN17 demonstrated a similar elevation in phosphotyrosine levels when stimulated with VEGF when compared to cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 2B). Thus, the observed changes in responses following Ad.RasN17 infection were not due to a diminished responsiveness of the VEGF receptors to their ligand.Figure 7Ad.RasN17 infection inhibits VEGF-induced ERK activation.A, HUVECs were infected with adenoviruses coding for Ad.GFP or HA-RasN17 under serum-free conditions followed by stimulation with VEGF or FGF for 5 min; control cells were unstimulated. Whole cell lysates were collected in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and run on a SDS-PAGE gel. Western blots of the cell lysates were done with antibodies to phosphorylated ERK, ERK, and HA antibodies. B, an in vitro kinase assay was performed under identical conditions. Anti-ERK immunoprecipitates were analyzed for kinase activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate. Following autoradiography reactions were quantified. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the best-characterized angiogenic responses to VEG"
https://openalex.org/W2097496187,"The relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes plays a critical role in activity-induced synaptic modification. Here we examined whether plasticity of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex depends on stimulus timing. Repetitive pairing of visual stimuli at two orientations induced a shift in orientation tuning of cat cortical neurons, with the direction of the shift depending on the temporal order of the pair. Induction of a significant shift required that the interval between the pair fall within ±40 ms, reminiscent of the temporal window for spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. Mirroring the plasticity found in cat visual cortex, similar conditioning also induced a shift in perceived orientation by human subjects, further suggesting functional relevance of this phenomenon. Thus, relative timing of visual stimuli can play a critical role in dynamic modulation of adult cortical function, perhaps through spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2068224188,"Plexins are receptors implicated in mediating signaling by semaphorins, a family of axonal chemorepellents. The role of specific plexins in mediating semaphorin function in vivo has not, however, yet been examined in vertebrates. Here, we show that plexin-A3 is the most ubiquitously expressed plexin family member within regions of the developing mammalian nervous system known to contain semaphorin-responsive neurons. Using a chimeric receptor construct, we provide evidence that plexin-A3 can transduce a repulsive signal in growth cones in vitro. Analysis of plexin-A3 knockout mice shows that plexin-A3 contributes to Sema3F and Sema3A signaling and that plexin-A3 regulates the development of hippocampal axonal projections in vivo."

Degradation of p27Kip1 at the G0-G1transition of the cell cycle has now been shown to proceed normally inSkp2−/− lymphocytes, whereas p27Kip1 proteolysis during S-G2phases is impaired in these Skp2-deficient cells. Degradation of p27Kip1 at the G0-G1transition was blocked by lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that it is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The first cell cycle of stimulated Skp2−/−lymphocytes appeared normal, but the second cycle was markedly inhibited, presumably as a result of p27Kip1accumulation during S-G2 phases of the first cell cycle. Polyubiquitination of p27Kip1 in the nucleus is dependent on Skp2 and phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on threonine 187. However, polyubiquitination activity was also detected in the cytoplasm ofSkp2−/− cells, even with a threonine 187 → alanine mutant of p27Kip1 as substrate. These results suggest that a polyubiquitination activity in the cytoplasm contributes to the early phase of p27Kip1degradation in a Skp2-independent manner, thereby promoting cell cycle progression from G0 to G1.

Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar,2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar). The interaction of CKIs with cyclin-CDK complexes is triggered by a variety of antimitogenic signals and results in inhibition of the catalytic activity of the complexes and consequent restraint of cell cycle progression (3Sherr J.C. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5131) Google Scholar, 4Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A key question with regard to regulation of the cell cycle concerns the mechanism by which cells undergo the transition from the resting state (G0) to proliferation. The CKI p27Kip1 plays a pivotal role in the control of cell proliferation. Transition from G0 phase to S phase of the cell cycle is promoted by complexes of G1 cyclins with CDKs, and p27Kip1 inhibits the activity of these complexes directly by binding to them (5Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In normal cells, the amount of p27Kip1 is high during G0 phase, but it rapidly decreases on reentry into G1-S phases triggered by specific mitogenic factors (6Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M.

Moreover, we and others have demonstrated that mice homozygous for deletion of the p27Kip1 gene are larger than normal mice, and that they exhibit multiple organ hyperplasia as well as a predisposition to both spontaneous and radiation- or chemical-induced tumors (11Nakayama K.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in the degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins, including those that participate in the cell cycle, cellular signaling in response to stress and to extracellular signals, morphogenesis, the secretory pathway, DNA repair, and organelle biogenesis (15Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The concentration of p27Kip1 is thought to be regulated predominantly by this proteolytic pathway (16Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M.

The proteolysis of p27Kip1 may also be regulated by such a mechanism, given that degradation of the protein is promoted by its phosphorylation on Thr187 by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex (23Sheaff R.J.

Recent data have also suggested that Skp2, an F-box protein that is thought to function as the receptor component of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, binds to p27Kip1 in conjunction with Cks1 only when Thr187 of p27Kip1 is phosphorylated; such binding then results in the ubiquitination and degradation of p27Kip1 (26Carrano A.C.

These biochemical observations are supported by genetic evidence that p27Kip1accumulates to high levels in the cells of mice that lack either Skp2 or Cks1 (29Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B.

We now show that, although the degradation of p27Kip1 during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle is markedly impaired in Skp2−/−cells, the degradation of this protein at the G0-G1 transition occurs normally in these cells. Our data suggest the existence of a second pathway of p27Kip1 degradation that is also mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This second pathway may be critical for regulation of cell cycle progression from the resting state to proliferation, and may be important in mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Single-cell suspensions of lymphocytes were prepared from the lymph nodes of 4-month-oldSkp2+/+ or Skp2−/− mice and were cultured (1.0 × 107 cells in 5 ml) for the indicated times in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (Sigma), and 300 nm ionomycin (Sigma). In some experiments, 10 μm lactacystin (Kyowa Medics), 10 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to the culture medium. The cells were subsequently harvested and lysed in 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and antipain, pepstatin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, each at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 ×g. After determination of its protein concentration with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), the resulting supernatant (30 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The separated proteins were transferred to a Hybond P membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies (1 μg/ml) to p27Kip1(Transduction Laboratories), to cyclin D2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), to cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), to Skp2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or to glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were detected with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and either SuperSignal West Pico or SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Single-cell suspensions of lymphocytes were cultured as described above. Cells were exposed to 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) for 30 min before harvesting, and were then subjected to fixation overnight in 70% ethanol at −20 °C followed by denaturation for 30 min at room temperature in 2 m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After neutralization with borax buffer (pH 8.5), the cells were subjected to dual-color staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to BrdUrd (Becton Dickinson) and propidium iodide (5 μg/ml). The cells were then analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Total RNA (1 μg) extracted from lymph node cells (2.0 × 107) with the use of Isogen (Wako) was subjected to RT with ReverTra Dash (Toyobo) in a final volume of 20 μl. The resulting cDNA (1 μl) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a final volume of 50 μl of PCR reaction mix. The respective sequences of sense and antisense primers specific for the target genes were as follows: c-Myc, 5′-AGT GCA TTG ATC CCT CAG TGG TCT TTC CCT A-3′ and 5′-CAG CTC GTT CCT CCT CTG ACG TTC CAA GAC GTT-3′; c-Fos, 5′-GAG CTG ACA GAT ACA CTC CAA GCG-3′ and 5′-CAG TCT GCT GCA TAG AAG GAA CCG-3′; and c-Jun, 5′-GCA TGA GGA ACC GCA TTG CCG CCT CCA AGT-3′ and 5′-CGC AAA GTC TGC CGG CCA ATA GGC CGC T-3′. The sense and antisense primers targeted to the gene for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), used as an internal standard, were 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′, respectively. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of mouse p27Kip1 and the T187A mutant of p27Kip1 (each of which was tagged at its COOH terminus with the hexahistidine (His6) epitope) as well as a GST fusion protein of mouse Cks1 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain XL1-blue (Stratagene); the bacteria were cultured in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by sonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 × g. Glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were added to the resulting supernatant, and the mixture was rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with PBS, and the GST fusion proteins attached to the beads were subjected to digestion for 4 h at 4 °C with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Only the processed recombinant proteins (not the GST moiety nor the GST fusion proteins) were released from the beads, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). Human Ubc5a tagged at its NH2 and COOH termini with the His6 and Flag epitopes, respectively; human Ubc3 tagged at its NH2 terminus with the His6 epitope;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Uba1 tagged at its NH2and COOH termini with the Myc and His6 epitopes, respectively; and a GST fusion protein of mouse ubiquitin were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen); the bacteria were cultured in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were purified with the use of ProBond resin (Invitrogen) or glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B. After dialysis against a solution containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 60 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol, the proteins were stored at −80 °C. Baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells with the use of BacPAK6 virus DNA and the pBacPAK9-GST vector (CLONTECH) containing either the cDNA for a GST fusion protein of human cyclin E tagged at its NH2 terminus with the Myc epitope or the cDNA for human CDK2 tagged at its NH2 terminus with the hemagglutinin epitope. The GST-cyclin E-CDK2 recombinant protein complex was purified (according to the protocol described above for purification of GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria) from a lysate of Sf9 cells coinfected with the two viruses. Only the purified recombinant proteins were detected by electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from 13.5-day-postcoitumSkp2+/+ or Skp2−/−embryos and cultured as described previously (11Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K.I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). In all experiments of this study, we used nonsenescent MEFs (no more than passage 2). In some experiments, the cell cycle of MEFs was synchronized either at G0-G1 by serum deprivation for 96 h in medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, or at S-G2 by arrest at the G1-S boundary induced by incubation with aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) for 14 h, followed by culture for 3 h in aphidicolin-free medium. The cells (1.0 × 108) were washed with PBS and then suspended in 500 μl of buffer A (40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (antipain, pepstatin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, each at 10 μg/ml)) containing 60 mm NaCl. For preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, the cell suspension was frozen, thawed, and then subjected to centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl, rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The new supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A containing 60 mm NaCl, centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g to remove debris, and then mixed with 800 μl of DE52 resin (Whatman) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 60 mm NaCl. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the slurry was transferred to a 2-cm-diameter column and washed with buffer A. Proteins were eluted from the column in a stepwise manner with buffer A containing 150 and 300 mmKCl, and 160-μl fractions were collected. The cytoplasmic supernatant resulting from the centrifugation of the MEF lysate at 2000 × g was subjected to further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The new supernatant was mixed with 800 μl of DE52 that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 60 mm NaCl, and then subjected to column chromatography as described above. For preparation of whole-cell extracts, MEFs were suspended in buffer A containing 300 mm KCl, frozen and thawed, rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A containing 60 mm NaCl, centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g to remove debris, and then mixed with 800 μl of DE52 that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 60 mm NaCl. Column chromatography was then performed as described above. DE52 column fractions (3 μl) were mixed with 50 ng of Uba1, 100 ng of Ubc5a or Ubc3, 3 μg of GST-ubiquitin, and 50 ng of wild-type p27Kip1 or the T187A mutant in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 60 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.5 mm ATP. In some experiments, 100 ng of GST-cyclin E-CDK2 complex or 100 ng of Cks1 were added to the reaction mixture. After incubation for 30 min at 26 °C, the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to p27Kip1. Analysis of Skp2−/− mice revealed that phenotypic characteristics such as cellular accumulation of p27Kip1 were less evident in lymphocytes than in liver, kidney, and lung (Ref. 31Nakayama K.

With the use of immunoblot analysis, we examined the mitogen-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1 in mature lymphocytes, almost all of which reside in the G0 phase of the cell cycle in the absence of stimulation (6Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Mitogenic stimulation with the combination of PDBu and ionomycin resulted in the almost complete disappearance of p27Kip1 from wild-type lymphocytes within 12 h (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, Skp2−/− lymphocytes exhibited similar kinetics of p27Kip1 down-regulation, suggesting that the decrease in the abundance of p27Kip1 in the early phase (up to 12 h) of mitogenic stimulation occurs independently of Skp2-mediated proteolysis. However, the abundance of p27Kip1increased again to substantial levels by 36–48 h in theSkp2−/− cells, whereas the amount of this protein remained low in wild-type lymphocytes (Fig. 1B). The abundance of cyclin D, cyclin E, and Skp2 was also examined in wild-type lymphocytes in the early (Fig. 1C) and late (Fig.1D) phases of mitogenic stimulation. Consistent with previous results (32Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cyclin D1 was not detected in the lymphocytes (data not shown). Cyclin D2 was detected as early as 3 h after stimulation, whereas the amount of cyclin E (which is expressed in late G1 phase and degraded in S phase) increased 18–24 h after stimulation. The expression of Skp2 was first evident 18–24 h after stimulation and was maximal at 30–36 h. The cell cycle profile did not differ substantially betweenSkp2+/+ and Skp2−/−cells for up to 48 h after stimulation (Fig. 1E). In both instances, cells began to enter S phase 18–24 h after stimulation and to enter G2 phase at 36 h. Given that neither Skp2 nor cyclin E was expressed in the early phase (G0-G1) of p27Kip1degradation, and that the down-regulation of p27Kip1 occurred inSkp2−/− cells, this process appears to require neither Skp2 nor cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of p27Kip1. In contrast, Skp2 is indispensable for the late phase (S-G2) of p27Kip1degradation. We next examined whether the early phase of p27Kip1degradation induced by mitogenic stimulation is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We incubated wild-type lymphocytes in the presence of lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, during mitogenic stimulation. The down-regulation of p27Kip1 was markedly inhibited by lactacystin (Fig. 2A). Short-term inhibition of the proteasome by incubation of cells with the quick-acting compound MG132 for the last 2 h before cell harvest yielded similar results. MG132 thus markedly inhibited the further degradation of p27Kip1 after its addition to the culture (Fig. 2B). To exclude the possibility that proteasome inhibition affects transduction of the mitogenic signal, we also examined the expression of the immediate-early genes c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3). The levels and kinetics of expression of these genes were not substantially affected by treatment of the wild-type cells with lactacystin, indicating that mitogenic signaling was intact in lymphocytes exposed to this agent. These data suggest that the early phase of degradation of p27Kip1 at the G0-G1transition is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Figure 3Effect of lactacystin on the expression of immediate-early genes induced by mitogenic stimulation in wild-type lymphocytes. Cells were stimulated with 10 nm PDBu and 300 nm ionomycin in the absence or presence of 10 μm lactacystin for the indicated times, after which total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis with primers specific for c-myc, c-fos, or c-jun as well as with G3PDH-specific primers as a control. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously demonstrated that the growth ofSkp2−/− lymphocytes was slightly reduced 4 days and substantially reduced 6 days after mitogenic stimulation compared with the growth of wild-type lymphocytes (31Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). We thus examined the cell cycle progression of Skp2−/−lymphocytes in greater detail (Fig. 4). Although the cell cycle profile of Skp2−/−lymphocytes was similar to that of wild-type cells for up to 2 days after stimulation, the proportion of cells in S phase after 3 days was markedly lower for Skp2−/− lymphocytes (15%) than for the wild-type cells (40%). These results suggest that, although the G1-S transition of the first cell cycle occurs normally in Skp2−/− cells (as a result of the degradation of p27Kip1 during the G0-G1 transition), the subsequent accumulation of p27Kip1 during S-G2 phases of the first cycle (caused by the absence of Skp2) results in G1arrest during the second cell cycle. The putative machinery responsible for p27Kip1 degradation at the G0-G1 transition of the first cell cycle thus does not appear to function at the G1-S transition of subsequent cycles (see Fig. 8).Figure 8Model for cell cycle regulation through p27Kip1 degradation by two distinct mechanisms. The degradation of p27Kip1 in the nucleus during successive phases (G1-S-G2-M) of the cell cycle appears to be regulated by the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase, which targets p27Kip1 phosphorylated on Thr187(T187-P). In contrast, p27Kip1appears to be ubiquitinated in the cytoplasm at the G0-G1 transition by an as-yet-unidentified ubiquitin ligase that functions independently both of Skp2 and of phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We fractionated total extracts ofSkp2+/+ and Skp2−/−MEFs by DE52 ion-exchange column chromatography with stepwise elution with KCl. We then examined the in vitro ubiquitination of p27Kip1 in the presence of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5a, a GST fusion protein of ubiquitin, and each column fraction (Fig. 5A). TheSkp2+/+ cell extract yielded a pronounced peak of polyubiquitination activity encompassing fractions 6 and 7, whereas the corresponding activity peak derived fromSkp2−/− cells spanned fractions 6–9. To determine whether ubiquitination of p27Kip1 was dependent on phosphorylation of Thr187 at the COOH terminus of the protein, we subjected a p27Kip1 mutant in which Thr187 was replaced by Ala (T187A) to the in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 5B). A large peak of polyubiquitination activity was detected mostly in fractions 5–8 and a smaller peak of activity was apparent in fractions 14 and 15 derived from both Skp2+/+ andSkp2−/− cells. These data suggest that a mediator of p27Kip1 polyubiquitination is present in the Skp2−/− cells, and that the polyubiquitination activity conferred by this factor is independent of phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187. We previously showed that Skp2 is predominantly localized to the nucleus (33Miura M. Hatakeyama S. Hattori K. Nakayama K.I. Genomics. 1999; 62: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We thus also subjected nuclear extracts prepared fromSkp2+/+ and Skp2−/−MEFs to ion-exchange chromatography. Skp2 was detected mostly in fractions 5 and 6 of the column eluate (Fig.6A). Fraction 5 of the nuclear extracts of Skp2+/+ andSkp2−/− cells was then included in thein vitro ubiquitination assay with wild-type p27Kip1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc3 or Ubc5a, and GST-ubiquitin (Fig.6B). With the fraction from Skp2+/+cells, polyubiquitination of p27Kip1 was evident in the additional presence of cyclin E and CDK2 and was further enhanced by Cks1. In contrast, polyubiquitinated species of p27Kip1 were not detected with fraction 5 fromSkp2−/− cells. To confirm that the polyubiquitination of p27Kip1 mediated by Skp2 is dependent on phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187, we subjected the T187A mutant of p27Kip1 to the in vitroubiquitination reaction in the presence of fraction 5 of the nuclear extracts of Skp2+/+ andSkp2−/− cells (Fig. 6C). In contrast to wild-type p27Kip1 (which underwent polyubiquitination in the presence of fraction 5 from wild-type cells), theT187A mutant did not undergo polyubiquitination in the presence of fraction 5 from either Skp2+/+ orSkp2−/− cells. These data suggest that polyubiquitination activity in the nucleus requires Skp2, and that phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex is necessary for Skp2-mediated polyubiquitination. Given that p27Kip1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Jab1-mediated nuclear export (35Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we next examined whether molecular machinery for polyubiquitination of p27Kip1 is present in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from Skp2+/+ andSkp2−/− cells and were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography. The resulting fractions 5 were then included in the in vitro ubiquitination assay with wild-type p27Kip1 or the T187A mutant as the substrate. Similar extents of polyubiquitination were apparent with the fractions derived from Skp2+/+ andSkp2−/− cells as well as with wild-type p27Kip1 and the T187A mutant (Fig.6D). Thus, this cytoplasmic polyubiquitination activity is independent both of Skp2 and of phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187. The putative ubiquitin ligase responsible for this Skp2-independent polyubiquitination appears to be located predominantly in the cytoplasm, given that the corresponding fraction derived from nuclear extracts did not contain such an activity. Together, our results suggest the existence of two pathways of p27Kip1ubiquitination: a Skp2- and Thr187phosphorylation-dependent pathway in the nucleus, and a Skp2- and Thr187 phosphorylation-independent pathway in the cytoplasm. Finally, we examined the cell cycle dependence of the polyubiquitination activities in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from Skp2+/+and Skp2−/− MEFs synchronized at G0 phase (Fig. 7A) or at S-G2 phases (Fig. 7B), and were subjected to the in vitro ubiquitination assay. The polyubiquitination activity in the nuclear extract of Skp2+/+ cells was greater at S-G2 than at G0. In contrast, the activity in the cytoplasmic extracts of both Skp2+/+ and Skp2−/− cells at G0 was similar to that at S-G2. Thus, the Skp2- and Thr187phosphorylation-dependent pathway of p27Kip1 polyubiquitination in the nucleus is active when cells enter successive rounds of the cell cycle. In contrast, the cytoplasmic polyubiquitination pathway is active at both G0 and S-G2 phases. Given that signal-dependent nuclear export of p27Kip1 occurs at the G0-G1transition, 2N. Ishida and K.-I. Nakayama, manuscript in preparation. exported p27Kip1 may be polyubiquitinated by the constantly active ubiquitination machinery in the cytoplasm. The amount of p27Kip1 is relatively high in quiescent (G0) cells, decreases on entry of cells into the cell cycle, and is controlled predominantly by the rate of p27Kip1 degradation (16Pagano M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). This CKI undergoes ubiquitination and is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner (5Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187 is mediated by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex and has been shown to be required for ubiquitination of p27Kip1 (23Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 24Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that Skp2 specifically interacts with the extreme COOH terminus of p27Kip1 only when Thr187 is phosphorylated by cyclin E-CDK2 (26Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 27Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This association of Skp2 with p27Kip1 results in recruitment of the latter to the SCF core complex, thereby promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This ubiquitination process was recently shown to be markedly enhanced by Cks1 associated with Skp2 (29Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 30Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P.L. Ryan A. Krek W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In parallel with Skp2-mediated ubiquitination, p27Kip1 is exported from the nucleus and degraded. This export step appears to be dependent on Jab1, a component of the 450-kDa COP9 (signalosome) complex (35Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Our unpublished data indicate, however, that the Jab1-mediated export of p27Kip1 from the nucleus at the G0-G1 transition occurs in a Skp2-independent manner.2 Furthermore, given that Skp2 is localized predominantly to the nucleus, the ubiquitination of p27Kip1 at this stage of the cell cycle is likely mediated by a ubiquitin ligase (other than SCFSkp2) that is located in the cytoplasm. We therefore propose that p27Kip1 is degraded by at least two distinct mechanisms, one of which is dependent on Skp2 and one of which is not (Fig. 8). The Skp2-independent mechanism operates in the cytoplasm and degrades p27Kip1at the G0-G1 transition. Jab1-mediated nuclear export of p27Kip1 may transfer this protein to the degradation machinery in the cytoplasm. The Skp2-dependent mechanism, mediated by the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase, serves to degrade p27Kip1 that is phosphorylated on Thr187 in the nucleus during S-G2 phases in successive rounds of the cell cycle. In addition to Thr187, phosphorylation of other residues of p27Kip1 may be important in the control of its stability. We recently showed that phosphorylation of Ser10accounted for ∼70% of the total phosphorylation of p27Kip1, and that the extent of phosphorylation at this site was ∼75-fold greater than that at Thr187(36Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The extent of Ser10 phosphorylation is markedly increased in cells in G0 phase of the cell cycle compared with that apparent in cells in S or M phase. The stability of p27Kip1 phosphorylated on Ser10 is also substantially greater than that of the unphosphorylated form of the protein. These observations suggest that Ser10 is the major site of phosphorylation of p27Kip1, and that phosphorylation at this site (like that at Thr187) contributes to the regulation of p27Kip1stability (36Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The increased stability of the Ser10-phosphorylated form of p27Kip1suggests that dephosphorylation of this residue might play an important role in progression of the cell cycle from G0 to G1. It is possible that phosphorylation of Ser10 may be a determinant of the nuclear export of p27Kip1 or of the ubiquitination of this protein in the cytoplasm. The most obvious cellular phenotype of Skp2−/−mice is the presence of markedly enlarged, polyploid nuclei and multiple centrosomes (31Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). However, there is substantial tissue variability in the penetrance of this phenotype. It is most prominent in liver, kidney, lung, and testis, whereas hematopoietic cells and neurons appear normal. Although the reason for such tissue differences has been unclear, they might result from variability in dependence on the two distinct mechanisms of p27Kip1degradation. Purification of the activity responsible for the ubiquitination of p27Kip1 in the cytoplasm and molecular identification of the corresponding putative ubiquitin ligase should provide insight into these issues. Mutations in the p27Kip1 gene appear to be rare in human cancers. However, a reduced abundance of p27Kip1 in a subset of colon and breast cancers correlates well with poor prognosis (37Catzavelos C.

Med. 1997; 3: 593Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the loss of p27Kip1 alleles in mice increases the sensitivity of these animals to cancer-inducing agents (14Fero M.L. Randel E. Gurley K.E. Roberts J.M. Kemp C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Identification of components of the protein degradation machinery that determine the turnover rate of p27Kip1 may thus provide insight into the altered expression of this protein in tumor cells as well as into whether such altered expression is a cause or a consequence of cell transformation. Indeed, Skp2 is overexpressed in many human cancer cell lines (41Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), suggesting that p27Kip1 degradation mediated by Skp2 may be related to carcinogenesis. It is thus possible that the putative ubiquitin ligase responsible for the Skp2-independent pathway of p27Kip1 degradation is also deregulated in cancer cells. We thank M. Matsumoto and N.

The enzyme TAFIa attenuates clot lysis by removing lysine residues from a fibrin clot. Screening of nine human cDNA libraries indicated a common variation in TAFI at position 325 (Ile-325 or Thr-325). This is in addition to the variation at amino acid position 147 (Ala-147 or Thr-147) characterized previously. Thus, four variants of TAFI having either Ala or Thr at position 147 and either Thr or Ile at position 325 were stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified to homogeneity. The kinetics of activation of TAFI by thrombin/thrombomodulin were identical for all four variants; however, Ile at position 325 extended the half-life of TAFIa from 8 to 15 min at 37 °C, regardless of the residue at position 147. In clot lysis assays with thrombomodulin and the TAFI variants, or with pre-activated TAFI variants, the Ile-325 variants exhibited an antifibrinolytic effect that was 60% greater than the Thr-325 variants. Similarly, in the absence of thrombomodulin, the Ile-325 variants exhibited an antifibrinolytic effect that was 30–50% greater than the Thr-325 variants. In contrast, the variation at position 147 had little if any effect on the antifibrinolytic potential of TAFIa. The increased antifibrinolytic potential of the Ile-325-containing TAFI variants reflects the fact that these variants have an increased ability to mediate the release of lysine from partially degraded fibrin and suppress plasminogen activation. These findings imply that individuals homozygous for the Ile-325 variant of TAFI would likely have a longer lived and more potent TAFIa enzyme than those homozygous for the Thr-325 variant.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Google Scholar) and procarboxypeptidase U (3Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Google Scholar). It can be activated by thrombin (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar), plasmin (4Mao S.-S. Cooper C.M. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Google Scholar) to the carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme, TAFIa. When exposed to a fibrin clot, TAFIa catalyzes the removal of carboxyl-terminal lysines, thereby diminishing the cofactor activity for plasminogen activation (6Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Google Scholar). Less efficient plasminogen activation on the fibrin clot corresponds to prolongation of fibrinolysis, and in this way TAFIa can serve as a potent antifibrinolytic enzyme. Studies performed using an in vitro human plasma model have found that clot lysis times can be attenuated up to 3-fold in the presence of TAFIa as compared with clots lysed in the absence of TAFIa (5Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Google Scholar). Activation of TAFI is catalyzed only slowly by thrombin alone; however, in the presence of thrombin/thrombomodulin, the efficiency of activation is increased 1000-fold. Despite the large thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation, in vitro clot lysis assays done in the absence of thrombomodulin still exhibit prolonged clot lysis times as compared with similar assays performed with TAFI-depleted plasma, indicating that thrombin alone is still potentially significant with respect to TAFI activation. To form the active enzyme, TAFI is cleaved after Arg-92 to form the 37-kDa enzyme and the activation peptide. Even though TAFIa is a powerful antifibrinolytic enzyme, there are no known inhibitors of TAFIa in human plasma. Instead, TAFIa is highly unstable, with reported half-lives at 37 °C of 8–9 (7Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar, 8Boffa M.B. Bell R.

Whereas TAFIa can also be cleaved by thrombin at Arg-302, this cleavage is subsequent to the spontaneous structural changes corresponding to inactivation of the enzyme (8Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Google Scholar, 10Marx P.F. Kackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12410-12415Google Scholar) and is therefore probably not relevant to the regulation of the enzyme. The antifibrinolytic potential of TAFIa has been found to be concentration-dependent. In vitro human plasma models have measured a half-maximal antifibrinolytic effect at roughly 1 nm of the enzyme. Even though plasma TAFI concentrations have been reported as ranging between 75 and 250 nm(11Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Google Scholar, 12Strömqvist M. Scatteman K. Leurs J. Verkerk R. Andersson J.-O. Johansson T. Scharpé S. Hendriks D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 12-17Google Scholar, 13Mosnier, L. O., von den Borne, P. A., Meijers, J. C. M., Bouma, B. N. (1998) 80, 829–835Google Scholar), a maximum antifibrinolytic effect is reached at about 20 nm TAFIa. Therefore, only a small fraction of the potential plasma TAFI pool needs to be activated to mediate a pronounced antifibrinolytic effect. Whereas the maximum antifibrinolytic effect cannot be altered by increased concentrations of TAFIa, it can be substantially altered by less thermally stable variants of human TAFI (8Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Google Scholar). Previously, we generated variants of TAFI with Arg to Gln substitutions at positions 302, 320, and 330 (8Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Google Scholar). Each of these variants was found to be less thermally stable than the wild type, highlighting the importance of this region for the stability of the active enzyme. Moreover, these TAFI variants exhibited a decreased ability to attenuate lysis of a fibrin clot. Because less stable variants had less antifibrinolytic potential, thermal stability was shown to correspond to the antifibrinolytic potential of TAFIa. At concentrations of TAFIa above 20 nm, the determinant of its antifibrinolytic effect seems to depend on the half-life of the TAFIa rather than the concentration of the enzyme. In this study we have identified a naturally occurring variation in human TAFI at position 325 (Thr-325 or Ile-325). It is particularly interesting that this variation lies within the region of TAFI shown to influence thermal stability (8Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Google Scholar). Previous work has also identified a variation at position 147 (Ala-147 or Thr-147), but the functional properties of the two variants were indistinguishable (14Zhao L. Morser J. Bajzar L. Nesheim M. Nagashima M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 949-955Google Scholar). Our collaborators (15Brouwers G.-J. Vos H.L. Leebeek W.G.L. Bulk S. Schneider M. Boffa M. Koschinsky M. Tilburg N.H. Nesheim M.E. Bertina R.M. Garcia E.B.G. Blood. 2001; 98: 1992-1993Google Scholar) have recently determined the prevalence of the Ile-325 allele in a population of 152 individuals and found that Ile/Thr-325 is a common polymorphism in human TAFI. Here, we report that the Ile/Thr variation at position 325 corresponds to TAFI variants with substantial differences in their thermal stabilities and antifibrinolytic potentials. We have also introduced anisylazoformyllysine (AAFK) as a substrate for measuring TAFIa activity. Previously, AAFK has been shown to be cleaved by pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (16Mock W.L. Xu D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 9: 187-192Google Scholar), and we found that it is similarly hydrolyzed by TAFIa. The synthetic carboxypeptidase substrate anisylazoformyllysine (AAFK) (16Mock W.L.

Baby hamster kidney cells and the pNUT mammalian expression vector were a gift from Dr. Ross MacGillivray (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Thrombin was prepared from human plasma-derived prothrombin as described previously (17Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Google Scholar). Fibrinogen was prepared from fresh frozen human plasma as described previously (17Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Google Scholar). Recombinant tPA (Activase) was generously provided by Dr. Gordon Vehar (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin) was a generous gift of Dr. John Morser (Berlex Biosciences, Inc., Richmond, CA). For immunoadsorption chromatography, a monoclonal antibody raised against purified TAFI (monoclonal antibody 16) (11Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Google Scholar) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Synthetic 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine (PCPS) vesicles were prepared as described previously (18Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Google Scholar). Human liver biopsy specimens were obtained with institutional approval from 9 individuals undergoing liver resection. All samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. RNA was isolated from the liver tissue using previously published methods (19MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Pryzybyla A.W. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Google Scholar, 20Cathala G. Savouret J.-F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA (New York). 1983; 2: 329-335Google Scholar), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexanucleotide primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse-transcriptase according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Approximately 1 μg of the resultant cDNA from the libraries was subjected to PCR using Platinum Pfx polymerase according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). The primer pair used corresponded to primers 5 (5′-GCATACATCAGCATGCATTC-3′) and 6 (5′-CAATGATTTGGTCTTGCTGG-3′) described by Boffa et al. (7Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar) and resulted in the amplification of a 425-bp product. The cycling conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 52 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C, followed by a final 5 min at 68 °C. The PCRs were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then with chloroform and then were precipitated with ethanol. Approximately 0.2–1 μg of the precipitated PCR product was subjected to digestion with SpeI (New England Biolabs) (5 units) for 2 h at 37 °C, and the digestion products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. TAFI expression plasmids containing cDNA clones corresponding to the four TAFI variants were assembled in the mammalian expression vector pNUT using methods analogous to those described previously (7Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar). Briefly, a cDNA fragment encoding the Ala variant at position 147 (11Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Google Scholar) was amplified from a human liver first strand cDNA library using primers 3 (5′-CTTGCTGGCAGACGTGGAAG-3′) and 4 (5′GCTGGGAGTATGAATGCATG-3′) (7Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the Ile variant at position 325 was amplified from a human liver first strand cDNA library using primers 5 and 6 (see above). The PCR products were individually cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. The clones were identical in sequence to the TAFI cDNA reported by Eaton et al.(21Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar) with the exception of the respective single nucleotide substitutions at the codons corresponding to amino acid positions 147 and 325. The variant fragments were inserted into the wild-type TAFI cDNA in the context of the TAFI-SK plasmid (7Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar) using theBglII and SphI and the SphI andXhoI restriction sites, respectively. The resultant three variant full-length TAFI cDNA sequences were then excised by digestion with XbaI and XhoI. The ends were made blunt using a Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and were inserted into pNUT that had been digested withSmaI. The nomenclature for the four TAFI variants is as follows: TAFI-TT, TAFI (Thr-147/Thr-325) (corresponds to the original cDNA isolated by Eaton et al. (21Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar)); TAFI-AT, TAF1 (Ala-147/Thr-325); TAFI-TI, TAFI (Thr-147/Ile-325); TAFI-AI, TAF1 (Ala-147/Ile-325). Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with the respective expression plasmids, using calcium-phosphate precipitation (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Stably expressing lines were selected by culturing cells in the presence of 400 μm methotrexate. For recombinant TAFI expression, stably expressing lines were cultured in triple flasks (500 cm2; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in Opti-MEM containing 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone and 40 μmZnCl2. Conditioned medium was harvested at 48-h intervals and replaced with fresh medium. Harvested medium was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, supplemented with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (to 5 mm), reduced glutathione (to 0.5 mm), and dEGRck (to 2 μm) and stored at −20 °C. To isolate the TAFI variants, typically 1.5 liters of conditioned, supplemented medium was thawed at room temperature, passed through a 0.22-μm filter, and passed over a 3.0-ml monoclonal antibody 16-Sepharose 4B column (6 mg of antibody/ml) at 4 °C. The column was washed extensively with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, at pH 7.4 (HBS/Tween 0.01%). TAFI was eluted with 1.0-ml fractions of 0.2 m glycine, pH 3, into 1-ml aliquots of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated 10-fold in the Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter device at 4 °C. Concentrated TAFI was diluted 10-fold with HBS/Tween 0.01% and re-concentrated as before. This process was repeated 5 times before the TAFI was removed and passed through a 0.22-μm filter. Purified TAFI was quantified by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm (ε1%,280 = 26.4;Mr = 60,000) (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. For routine activation of TAFI to TAFIa, TAFI (1 μm) was incubated with thrombin (25 nm), Solulin (100 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) in HBS/Tween 0.01% at 24 °C for 10 min. Where appropriate, the thrombin was quenched with PPAck (1 μm) before the mixture was placed on ice. AAFK was dissolved in HBS/Tween 0.01%, protected from light, and stored at 4 °C until use. The concentration of AAFK was quantified by absorbance at 349 nm (ε = 18,400 m−1cm−1) (16Mock W.L. Xu D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 9: 187-192Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of TAFIa hydrolysis of AAFK, TAFIa was formed as described, diluted, and placed on ice. TAFIa (25 nm) was then incubated with AAFK at various concentrations (0–4000 μm) at 24 °C in a microtiter plate that had been presoaked in HBS with 1% Tween 80 (HBS/Tween 1%) and thoroughly rinsed with deionized distilled water. The absorbance of the mixtures at 350, 375, and 400 nm were monitored over time using a Spectramax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Wavelengths longer than 350 nm were required for higher concentrations of AAFK to compensate for absorbances that exceed the measurable absorbance range of the instrument. Initial rates were determined using the first 20% of the total potential change in absorbance that would have occurred with complete substrate hydrolysis and were converted to moles of AAFK hydrolysis/s/mol of TAFIa (s−1). Thekcat and Km values for each variant were determined by nonlinear regression of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Sigmaplot 4 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL). TAFI at various concentrations (0–2.0 μm) was incubated with Solulin at various concentrations (0–50 nm) in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm) and thrombin (0.5 nm). Reactant mixtures (40 μl) were incubated at 24 °C for 10 min in a microtiter plate that had been presoaked with HBS/Tween 1% and thoroughly rinsed with deionized distilled water. Reactions were then quenched with AAFK (120 μm) and PPAck (1 μm) to a final volume of 200 μl. The reactions were monitored at 350 nm, and the initial rate of hydrolysis was determined from the initial slope of the absorbance versus time relationship. To quantify the TAFIa formed, standard curves with TAFIa and TAFI for each variant were measured with AAFK (120 μm) and PPAck (1 μm). The TAFI zymogen shows modest activity toward the AAFK substrate (2% compared with TAFIa). Thus, the following analysis was used:K1 is the slope determined from the rate of hydrolysis of AAFK versus the concentration of TAFI, andK2 is the slope determined from the rate of hydrolysis of AAFK versus the concentration of TAFIa. The initial rate of hydrolysis (r = dA/dt) is shown in Equation 1, r=K1·[TAFI]+K2·[TAFIa]Equation 1 Because the total concentration of TAFI, [TAFI]o = [TAFI] + [TAFIa], this relation can be re-arranged as shown in Equation 2, [TAFIa]=(r−K1·[TAFI]0)/(K2−K1)Equation 2 Calculated [TAFIa] was corrected for dilution and converted to ν (TAFIa formed per s per thrombin (s−1)). The complete data set was fit globally to the model (Equation 2) described previously (5Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Google Scholar), where [TM] is the concentration of Solulin, andKd represents the interaction between thrombin and thrombomodulin as shown in Equation 3, v=(kcat·[TAFI]o·[TM]+Kd))/(Km+[TAFI]o)Equation 3 The calculated kcat,Km, and Kd values are reported with the S.E. of the regression calculated by the regression algorithm (Nonlin module of SYSTAT 9, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). To make TAFI-deficient plasma, 150 ml of fresh-frozen, citrated human plasma was thawed and passed over a 1-ml monoclonal antibody 16-Sepharose 4B column at room temperature. The plasma was passed over the column 3 times, and between each pass the column was washed copiously with HBS/Tween 0.01%; bound TAFI was eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 3, and the column was re-equilibrated with HBS/Tween 0.01%. To be certain the plasma was TAFI-deficient, a clot lysis assay (see below) was performed in the absence of TAFI and either in the absence or presence of Solulin (10 nm). There was no difference between the clot lysis times, and the plasma was considered to be TAFI-deficient. All clot lysis assays were performed as described previously (8Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Google Scholar) in a final volume of 120 μl in a plastic microtiter plate presoaked with HBS/Tween 1% and thoroughly rinsed with deionized distilled water. In each reaction, TAFI-deficient plasma was diluted 1:3 in HBS/Tween. Reactions were initiated by the addition of thrombin (5 nm), CaCl2 (10 mm), and tPA (0.3 nm). In lysis assays containing TAFIa, the zymogen was activated for 10 min as described previously and placed on ice, with all dilutions made on ice. In some lysis assays, TAFI zymogen was added in the presence of Solulin (10 nm), whereas other lysis assays were performed in the presence of TAFI zymogen, in the absence of Solulin, and the presence of PCPS (20 μm). Clot lysis was monitored by the change in turbidity of each reaction at 400 nm in a Spectramax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices), and the time to 50% lysis was determined graphically as the midpoint between maximum turbidity of a clot and the minimum absorbance when a clot was completely lysed. All reactions were performed at 37 °C, and the microtiter plates were covered to minimize evaporation. To determine whether the prolongation in clot lysis time caused by the variation at position 325 in TAFI reflects differences in plasminogen activation, we compared the ability of TAFIa-TT and TAFIa-TI in terms of their ability to suppress plasminogen activation. Plasminogen activation was monitored by measuring fluorescence changes of Glu-plasminogen with fluorescein-labeled cysteine in place of the active site serine (23Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar). Fluorescent measurements were made using a Spectramax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 490 and 535 nm, respectively, with a 530 nm cut-off filter in the emission path. Fluorescein-plasminogen (f-plasminogen, 0.22 μm) and fibrinogen (3.33 μm) were incubated with various concentrations of activated TAFI-TT or TAFI-TI (0–11.1 nm) in the absence or presence of 11.1 nmnative Glu-plasminogen in 90 μl of HBS/Tween. The temperature was set to 25 °C. Fluorescence intensities were monitored for 10 min at 1-min intervals to obtain a starting value, after which clotting and plasminogen activation were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 nm thrombin and 3 nm t-PA, respectively. Decreases in fluorescence were monitored for 6 h and converted to plasminogen concentrations. Rate constants for plasminogen activation were calculated from the plasminogen concentrations at successive 1-min intervals as described by Wang et al. (6Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Google Scholar) using Equation4, k=ln([Pg]1/[Pg]2)/(t2−t1)Equation 4 where [Pg]1 and [Pg]2 are the concentrations of plasminogen at time 1 (t1) and time 2 (t2), respectively. To determine whether activated TAFI-TT and TAFI-TI differ with respect to their ability to release lysine from partially degraded fibrin, free lysine was measured during plasminogen activation in the presence of one of these TAFI variants. Plasminogen activation was initiated and monitored, as described above, in the presence of 0.5 nmactivated TAFI-TT or TAFI-TI, and the samples were thermostated to 25 °C. At intervals, clots were solubilized, and reactions were quenched with acetic acid (0.1 m final). Solutions were deproteinated with 0.2 m perchloric acid (final concentration) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants were neutralized with potassium hydroxide, and the insoluble potassium perchlorate was removed by placing the samples on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation. The concentration of free lysine was determined enzymatically using methods described by Wang et al. (6Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of deproteinated clot supernatant was incubated with 80 μl of 25 μm NADH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2.5 mm α-ketoglutaric acid (Sigma) in 0.05 mHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 units of saccharopine dehydrogenase (Sigma). Oxidation of NADH was monitored using a Spectramax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 340 and 450 nm, respectively, with a 435 nm cut-off filter in the emission beam. The concentration of free lysine in clot supernatants was determined by comparing decreases in NADH fluorescence after 4 h with those obtained in experiments using known concentrations ofl-lysine (Sigma). DNA sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products obtained from a number of different human liver cDNA libraries revealed a single nucleotide difference from the cDNA sequence published by Eaton et al. (21Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar). This was a C to T mutation at position 1057 of the TAFI cDNA (numbering is as per Boffa et al. (24Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Google Scholar)) and would result in the conversion of a Thr codon (ACU) to an Ile codon (AUU) at amino acid position 325. Because the mutation also resulted in the destruction of aSpeI restriction site (ACTAGT to ATTAGT), we amplified a fragment of the TAFI cDNA from liver cDNA libraries corresponding to nine individuals and subjected the PCR products to SpeI digestion followed by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the genotype of these individuals with respect to the mutation. In five cases, the 425-bp PCR product was completely digested with SpeI resulting in 298- and 127-bp fragments. In four cases, however, ∼50% of the PCR product was digested under identical conditions; a representative agarose gel containing digestion products for seven individuals is shown in Fig. 1. These findings indicate that five of the individuals are homozygous for the wild-type (Thr-325) allele, whereas four individuals were heterozygotes. In this small sample, no individuals were identified that are homozygous for the mutant (Ile-325) allele. However, Brouwers et al. (15Brouwers G.-J. Vos H.L. Leebeek W.G.L. Bulk S. Schneider M. Boffa M. Koschinsky M. Tilburg N.H. Nesheim M.E. Bertina R.M. Garcia E.B.G. Blood. 2001; 98: 1992-1993Google Scholar) have recently determined the frequency of this allele in a much larger population of 152 blood donors and found that 17 individuals were homozygous for the Ile-325 allele, whereas 76 individuals were heterozygous. If we consider the Ile/Thr polymorphism at position 325 and the previously described Thr/Ala polymorphism at position 147, there are four possible variants of TAFI. Therefore, these variants were constructed, stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells with serum-free medium, and were isolated from the medium by affinity chromatography on a column with covalently attached monoclonal antibody to TAFI. The isolated variants all migrated as a single band at ∼60 kDa in SDS-PAGE. In addition, each was fully cleaved to yield the 35-kDa activated enzyme described previously (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar, 5Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Google Scholar, 7Boffa M.B. W"
https://openalex.org/W2141234057,"We have studied the precise temporal requirements for plasticity of orientation preference maps in kitten visual cortex. Pairing a brief visual stimulus with electrical stimulation in the cortex, we found that the relative timing determines the direction of plasticity: a shift in orientation preference toward the paired orientation occurs if the cortex is activated first visually and then electrically; the cortical response to the paired orientation is diminished if the sequence of visual and electrical activation is reversed. We furthermore show that pinwheel centers are less affected by the pairing than the pinwheel surround. Thus, plasticity is not uniformly distributed across the cortex, and, most importantly, the same spike time-dependent learning rules that have been found in single-cell in vitro studies are also valid on the level of cortical maps."

This is a unique N-methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (Fig.1).

Chem. 1993; 268: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzymatic activity at this important step is rather low relative to the entire biosynthetic pathway (1Choi K.B.

Thus, we purified CNMT and characterized its properties. Previous studies have clearly indicated that CNMT is non-stereospecific and has broad substrate specificity;Coptis enzyme methylated even simple dihydroxyisoquinoline alkaloids.Whereas several O-methyltransferases have been characterized at the molecular level (4Morishige T.

Plant J. 1999; 17: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), there have been very few molecular studies of N-methyltransferases in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in plants (13Hibi N. Higashiguchi S. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14Kato M. Mizuno K. Crozier A. Fujimura T. Ashihara H. Nature. 2000; 406: 956-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The differences in the primary structures, including theS-adenosyl-l-methionine binding site of NMTs and OMTs reported to date, suggest that molecular isolation of CNMT based on the structural similarity of methyltransferases would be very difficult. Thus, we adapted the conventional strategy to isolate cDNA based on the amino acid sequence of purified enzyme. Whereas our purified CNMT fraction still contained two protein bands of about 45 kDa, careful inspection of the chromatographic behavior of the proteins and enzyme activity suggested that the slow moving 45-kDa polypeptide would encode CNMT (1Choi K.B. Morishige T. Sato F. Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we determined the N-terminal amino acids, isolated the corresponding cDNA fragment, and finally the full-length cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA suggested that the deduced amino acid sequence showed some similarity to known NMTs such as phosphoethanolamine NMT. Further characterization of recombinant protein heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli confirmed that this isolated cDNA encoded CNMT. Recombinant CNMT was purified to homogeneity, and its enzymological properties were characterized. The evolution of CNMT involved in secondary metabolism is discussed based on the sequence similarity of this novel NMT.DISCUSSIONBased on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified CNMT and information on codon usage in Coptis genes, a full-length cDNA encoding CNMT was successfully cloned and its enzymatic activity was confirmed in a heterologous expression system. Recombinant CNMT purified from transgenic E. coli showed a significantly higher activity than that of CNMT purified from culturedCoptis cells. CNMT deduced from the cDNA sequence was 358 amino acids long with a calculated molecular mass of 41 kDa, which was slightly lower than the apparent molecular mass (45 kDa) of purified CNMT determined by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified recombinant CNMT revealed a similar mobility for CNMT purified fromCoptis cells, indicating that this discrepancy between calculated molecular mass and apparent molecular mass was not due to post-translational modification but rather to experimental variation probably associated with the surface charge or conformation of CNMT.Because this CNMT sequence was the first reported NMT sequence in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and the third reported NMT in alkaloid biosynthesis in plants (13Hibi N. Higashiguchi S. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14Kato M. Mizuno K. Crozier A. Fujimura T. Ashihara H. Nature. 2000; 406: 956-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the sequences of these plant alkaloid NMTs and other methyltransferases were compared to obtain more information about the diversity of methyltransferases. Whereas several plant O-methyltransferases have relatively high sequence homology ranging from 32 to 71%, the diversity ofN-methyltransferases is quite high (Fig. 3); the sequence identity among NMTs is about 5–15%. This means that each NMT may have evolved from an independent origin. CNMT showed relatively high homology to a hypothetical Arabidopsis protein (T05192) and cyclopropane-fatty acyl phospholipid synthase ofMesorhizobium (21Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Asamizu E. Kato T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Idesawa K. Ishikawa A. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kiyokawa C. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Mochizuki Y. Nakayama S. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M.

DNA Res. 2000; 7: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), whereas the functional similarity is not clear.The recent determination of the three-dimensional structures of plantO-methyltransferases suggested the structural conservation of an AdoMet binding site among methyltransferases (22Zubieta C. He X.Z. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As Chandrashekhar and Vincent (23Chandrashekhar P.J. Vincent L.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) have deduced from 56 plant enzyme sequences, motif A (V/I/L)(V/L)(D/K)(V/I)GGXX(G/A) is present in all plant O-methyltransferases with 0–2 mismatches. Motifs B and C, (V/I/F)(A/P/E)X(A/P/G)DAXXXK(W/Y/F) and (A/P/G/S)(L/I/V)(A/P/G/S)XX(A/P/G/S)(K/R)(V/I)(E/I)(L/I/V) respectively, are conserved 98% with 0–3 mismatches (X is any amino acid). On the other hand, the AdoMet recognition domain was not as highly conserved in NMTs, even though motif A was found among almost all OMTs. In CNMT, only motif A is present with two mismatches (Fig. 6). The lower conservation of the AdoMet binding domain in NMT might be due to structural differences between NMTs and OMTs. Whereas many OMTs have an AdoMet binding site in their C-terminal half, motif A in CNMT and other NMTs is located at the N-terminal end (24Quaife C.J. Hoyle G.W. Froelick G.J. Findley S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2079478340,"Different classes of photoreceptor neurons (R cells) in the Drosophila compound eye connect to specific targets in the optic lobe. Using a behavioral screen, we identified LAR, a receptor tyrosine phosphatase, as being required for R cell target specificity. In LAR mutant mosaic eyes, R1-R6 cells target to the lamina correctly, but fail to choose the correct pattern of target neurons. Although mutant R7 axons initially project to the correct layer of the medulla, they retract into inappropriate layers. Using single cell mosaics, we demonstrate that LAR controls targeting of R1-R6 and R7 in a cell-autonomous fashion. The phenotypes of LAR mutant R cells are strikingly similar to those seen in N-cadherin mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1993002467,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the internalization of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR) may be mediated by both β-arrestin-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms. Therefore, we have used the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail to screen a rat brain yeast two-hybrid expression library for novel AT1AR-interacting proteins that might contribute to the regulation of AT1AR internalization. We have identified Rab5a as an AT1AR-binding protein that selectively associates with the AT1AR and not with the β2-adrenergic receptor. A Rab5a-S34N mutant defective in GTP binding does not prevent the internalization of the AT1AR but does prevent the trafficking of the AT1AR into larger hollow cored vesicular structures. Agonist activation of the AT1AR promotes both the formation of Rab5a·AT1AR protein complexes and Rab5a GTP binding. Rab5a interactions with the AT1AR are mediated in part by the last 10 amino acid residues of the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail, and although a mutant receptor lacking these residues internalizes normally, it does not redistribute into larger hollow vesicles. Our data suggest that AT1AR activation modulates Rab5a activity leading to the homotypic fusion of endocytic vesicles. These observations suggest that vesicular cargo proteins, such as the AT1AR, may control their targeting between intracellular compartments by directly regulating the activity of components of the intracellular trafficking machinery such as Rab5a.

These observations suggest that vesicular cargo proteins, such as the AT1AR, may control their targeting between intracellular compartments by directly regulating the activity of components of the intracellular trafficking machinery such as Rab5a. angiotensin II type 1A receptor β2-adrenergic receptor carboxyl-terminal tail G protein-coupled receptor adenine Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate glutathioneS-transferase angiotensin II green fluorescent protein Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium The angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR)1 is a member of the large superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). AT1ARs are coupled via Gq to the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ leading to increases in intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation, the release of calcium from intracellular stores, and the activation of protein kinase C (1Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 639-672PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist activation also initiates the feedback phosphorylation and desensitization of the AT1AR in response to phosphorylation by both second messenger-dependent protein kinases and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (2Oppermann M.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation promotes the membrane translocation and binding of β-arrestins to the AT1AR, which serves both to uncouple the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins and to target the receptor for endocytosis (3Anborgh P.H.

However, β-arrestin-directed internalization of GPCRs in clathrin-coated vesicles may represent only one of many mechanisms contributing to GPCR endocytosis (4Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S.

For example, AT1AR internalization may also involve a pathway that is relatively insensitive to dominant-negative β-arrestin mutants (4Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The AT1AR is a member of a class of GPCRs that remain associated with β-arrestins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the AT1AR is targeted to enlarged hollow core vesicular structures (3Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol.

Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, endocytosis is required for the dephosphorylation and resensitization of GPCRs like the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) but does not appear to contribute to the resensitization of AT1AR responses (3Anborgh P.H.

Although β2AR internalization is exquisitely β-arrestin-dependent, β-arrestin is excluded from β2AR-bearing endocytic vesicles allowing dephosphorylation in endosomes (3Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

The apparent difference in the ability of the β2AR and AT1AR to internalize in a complex with β-arrestin appears to be regulated by their carboxyl-terminal tails (3Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that β-arrestins may also regulate the reestablishment of GPCR responsiveness (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, although the determinants regulating the stable high affinity association of β-arrestin with GPCRs like the AT1AR have been characterized (12Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanism(s) regulating the intracellular trafficking and retention of these receptors in endosomes. To identify additional molecular components contributing to the regulation of both AT1AR internalization and intracellular trafficking, we used the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for novel AT1AR-interacting proteins. Here we describe that the interaction of Rab5a with the carboxyl-terminal tail of the AT1AR not only promotes the vesicular sorting of the AT1AR into enlarged vesicular structures but also activates the GDP/GTP cycle of Rab5a. The truncated AT1AR mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. A 5′-oligonucleotide primer hybridized upstream from a unique EcoRI site within the coding sequence of the AT1AR-encoding gene, and 3′-oligonucleotides introduced a stop codon after residues 319, 329, 339, and 349 in the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail. GST-Rab5 fusion proteins were constructed by subcloning Rab5a, Rab5a-S34N, and Rab5a-Q79L into the eukaryotic expression vector pEBG4. The V2 vasopressin carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 320–371) and the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail constructs (297–359, 310–359, and 297–249) were subcloned by PCR in to the yeast vector pAS2-1. Wild-type canine Rab5a was subcloned into the yeast vector pACT2. Sequence integrity of the DNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All other cDNA constructs used have been reported previously (3Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Barak L.S.

The rat AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 297–359) GAL4 binding domain fusion protein construct was co-transformed into the yeast strain PJ69–4A with a GAL4 activation domain fusion library of rat whole brain cDNA in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out according to theCLONTECH MATCHMAKER protocol. Clones expressing both the bait and the prey were selected on growth medium lacking Leu and Trp, and the interacting proteins were identified for their Ade auxotroph complementation. Isolated library clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid backcrosses were performed using the yeast reporter strain Y190 (MATa, leu2-3, 112ura3-52, trp1-901, his3-D200, ade2-101) co-transformed with pACT2-Rab5a (canine) and pAS2-1-AT1AR-(297–359), pAS2-1-AT1AR-(310–359), pAS2-1-AT1AR-(297–349), or pAS2-1-AT1AR-(297–339) using a modified lithium acetate method according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Double transformants were plated on synthetic yeast drop-out medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, uracyl, and histidine in the absence and presence of 25 mm3-aminotriazol and incubated 3–5 days at 30 °C. Colonies grown in the presence of 3-aminotriazol were grown in selective liquid medium to test for β-galactosidase activity. This was assessed by the colorimetric conversion of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as previously described (18Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1639-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,19Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells and COS7 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt (MEM) and Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium (DMEM), respectively (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). The cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish (Falcon) and were transiently transfected by a modified calcium phosphate method (21Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) with the cDNAs described in the figure legends. COS7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with the cDNAs described in the figure legends. Following transfection (18 h), the cells were pooled and reseeded into 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek) for confocal studies, into six well-dishes (Falcon) for receptor internalization and GTPγS loading studies, into 12-well dishes (Falcon) for receptor radioligand binding assays and 100-mm dishes for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. COS7 cells transiently co-transfected to overexpress FLAG-AT1AR or FLAG-β2AR plus GST-tagged Rab5a, GST-Rab5a-S34N, or GST-Rab5a-Q79L were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence and absence of 100 nm Ang II in serum-free DMEM containing 2.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) cross-linker (Pierce) that had been dissolved in Me2SO (14Zhang J.

The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was gently agitated for 15 min at 4 °C and thereafter centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Cleared supernatants (500–600 μg of protein) were incubated with 20 μl of FLAG M2-agarose affinity beads (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were solubilized in 3× SDS sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. GST-Rab5a was detected via Western blotting with an anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2500) and visualized via chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. COS7 cells transiently co-transfected to overexpress FLAG-AT1AR, FLAG-β2AR, or empty plasmid (control) along with GST-Rab5a were labeled with 5 μm [35S]GTPγS (10 μCi/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in digitonin buffer (1% digitonin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (0.75 ml/well) and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with or without 100 nm Ang II or 10 μm isoproterenol in serum-free DMEM. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm GTγS, 0.1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was gently agitated for 15 min at 4 °C and thereafter centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Cleared supernatants were incubated with 40 μl of glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C. The samples were counted for 35S activity (cpm) in a β-scintillation counter. Aliquots (20 μl) of each cleared supernatant were analyzed for relative expression of GST-Rab5a by immunoblotting using an anti-GST antibody. Radioligand binding measurements of AT1AR internalization were assessed as described previously (20Conchon S. Monnot C. Teutsch B. Corvol P. Clauser E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells transiently transfected to overexpress FLAG-AT1AR in the absence and presence of Rab5a constructs were washed with serum-free MEM with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and then were incubated at 37 °C in the same medium containing 100 nm Ang II for 1 h. The cells were then washed in cold MEM containing 10 mm Hepes and were incubated in acid wash solution (90 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0) for 20 min to dissociate bound ligand. The cells were then washed and incubated with 250 μl [125I-Sar1-Ile8] Ang II for 3–4 h at 14 °C. Nonspecific binding values were obtained in the presence of 10 μm Losartan. The cells were washed on ice and solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH, and radioactivity was counted using β-scintillation. Receptor expression ranged from 250 to 500 fmol/mg protein. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63× 1.3 NA oil immersion lens. Live cell imaging of HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-AT1AR and Rab5a, Rab5a-S34N, or Rab5a-Q79L and β-arrestin2-GFP was performed using cells plated on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes. The cells were kept warm at 37 °C in serum-free MEM on a heated microscope stage as described previously (3Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 17Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-AT1AR staining of HEK 293 cells grown on glass coverslips and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min was performed using monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (1:250 dilution) in conjunction with a rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) (Molecular Probes). Co-localization studies of GFP-Rab5a and rhodamine-labeled FLAG-AT1AR fluorescence were performed using dual excitation (488, 568 nm) and emission (515–540 nm, GFP; 590–610 nm, rhodamine) filter sets. The specificity of labeling and the absence of signal cross-over were established by examination of single-labeled samples. The means ± S.E. are shown for the values obtained for the number of independent experiments indicated in the figure legends. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired two-tailed t test. To identify novel proteins that interact with the AT1AR, we screened ∼20 × 106independent clones of a rat brain cDNA library using the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail (Ct), amino acid residues 297–359, as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Six of the clones isolated for growth on −Leu/−Trp/−Ade plates were positive for both partial and full-length Rab5a sequences. Rab5a is a member of a large family of Rab GTP-binding proteins (∼60 members) that regulate the trafficking of vesicular cargo between intracellular compartments (21Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). In particular, Rab5a regulates the formation, trafficking, and fusion of clathrin-coated vesicles with early endosomes (22Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Growth of a canine Rab5a clone on −Leu/−Trp/−Ade plates was dependent upon the AT1AR Ct GAL4 BD fusion protein and was not observed in the presence of either empty vector or a GAL4 BD fusion protein of the tail of the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) (TableI). To determine whether Rab5a physically interacts with the AT1AR, GST-Rab5a and FLAG-AT1AR were both expressed in COS7 cells and the co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins was assessed. We found that GST-Rab5a and not GST alone was co-immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells transfected with FLAG-AT1AR (Fig.1A). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of Rab5a was specific to the AT1AR, because Rab5a was not co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-β2AR (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these observations indicate that Rab5a represents a novel AT1AR-interacting protein.Table IYeast two-hybrid interactions of Rab5a with the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tailGal4-binding domainGal4 activation domain−Leu/ −Trp−Leu/ −Trp/−AdeAT1AR carboxyl-terminal tailRab5a1-aCanine Rab5.++++AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tailpACT-2+−pAS2–1Rab5a+−V2R carboxyl-terminal tailRab5a+−V2R carboxyl-terminal tailpACT-2+−−, no growth; +, moderate growth; +++, excellent growth.

Therefore, we sought to examine whether Rab5a was involved in the endocytosis and vesicular trafficking of the AT1AR. We find that even though a Rab5a-S34N mutant defective in GTP binding blocks the internalization of several other GPCRs (17Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

In the absence of agonist stimulation, GFP-Rab5a is neither co-localized with FLAG-AT1AR at the cell surface nor localized to large hollow vesicular structures (Fig.3A). Rather, GFP-Rab5a is limited to small endocytic vesicles (Fig. 3A). However, upon agonist stimulation of the AT1AR we observed enlarged GFP-Rab5a-positive vesicular structures and that the AT1AR is completely co-localized with GFP-Rab5a within these enlarged hollow core vesicular structures (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that the proposed association of Rab5a with the AT1AR may contribute to the regulation of AT1AR trafficking and/or vesicular fusion rather than AT1AR endocytosis.Figure 3Co-localization of FLAG-AT1AR and GFP-Rab5a.

The data are the representative images of three independent experiments. The bars represent 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that β-arrestin2-GFP is internalized in a physical complex with the AT1AR making this a useful tool for following the temporal dynamics of AT1AR internalization and trafficking in live cells (3Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 12Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist stimulation, β-arrestin2-GFP is diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol of FLAG-AT1AR-expressing HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4A). In response to agonist stimulation, we observe that AT1AR·β-arrestin2-GFP complexes first redistribute to clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 4A, 5 min) and are then localized in small endocytic vesicles (Fig. 4A,10 min), which subsequently fuse into the enlarged hollow core vesicular structures (Fig. 4A, 15 min) in which the receptor was previously demonstrated to co-localize with GFP-Rab5a (Fig. 3B). To determine whether Rab5a may regulate the intracellular trafficking and fusion of AT1AR-containing endocytic vesicles, we utilized β-arrestin2-GFP to follow the subcellular localization of the AT1AR in the presence of wild-type Rab5a, dominant-negative Rab5a-S34N, or constitutively active Rab5a-Q79L. In either the absence (Fig. 4A, 15 min) or presence (Fig.4B) of wild-type Rab5a, β-arrestin2-GFP-labeled FLAG-AT1ARs are localized to large hollow core endocytic vesicular structures. In contrast, the expression of Rab5a-S34N prevents the agonist-stimulated redistribution of β-arrestin2-GFP labeled FLAG-AT1ARs to enlarged hollow core vesicular structures (Fig. 4C). Instead, β-arrestin2-GFP fluorescence remains limited to smaller endocytic vesicles (Fig.4C). The expression of Rab5a-Q79L did not alter the formation of enlarged vesicles containing β-arrestin2-GFP-labeled FLAG-AT1ARs (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that the GTP-bound form of Rab5a is required for fusion of AT1AR containing endocytic vesicles into enlarged hollow cored endocytic structures. We find that Rab5a forms a physical complex with the AT1AR in the absence of agonist and also regulates the agonist-promoted intracellular trafficking and fusion of AT1AR-bearing endocytic vesicles. Therefore, we examined whether AT1AR activation stimulates both GST-Rab5a association with the receptor and GTPγS loading of GST-Rab5a in COS7 cells. We observe that agonist stimulation increases the relative amount of GST-Rab5a, GST-Rab5a-S34N, and GST-Rab5a-Q79L co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-AT1AR (Fig.5A). Consistently more Rab5a-S34N than Rab5a and Rab5a-Q79L is co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-AT1AR under basal conditions (Fig. 5, A andB), which may reflect preferential interaction of the receptor with the GDP-bound form of Rab5a. Angiotensin II stimulation of the AT1AR increases GTPγS binding to GST-Rab5a by 6.6 ± 1.7-fold above agonist-stimulated GST-Rab5a expressing control cells lacking AT1AR (Fig. 4C). Basal GTPγS binding to GST-Rab5a in AT1AR-expressing cells is also increased 3.2 ± 1.6-fold above GST-Rab5a-expressing control cells lacking AT1AR (Fig. 4C). The increased basal GST-Rab5a GTPγS binding likely reflects the observed agonist-independent association of the GTPase with the AT1AR. Nonetheless, agonist activation of the AT1AR increases GTPγS binding to GST-Rab5a 2.4 ± 0.9-fold above basal. In contrast, β2AR expression and activation has no effect on GTPγS binding to GST-Rab5a (Fig.4C). These data not only demonstrate that the association of Rab5a with the AT1AR is regulated by agonist activation of the receptor but also suggest that the AT1AR may function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5a, thereby serving a function that is analogous to its role as a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor. To identify the regions of the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail contributing to Rab5a binding, we used GAL4 BD fusion proteins of different regions of the AT1AR Ct in the yeast two-hybrid system with Rab5a fused to the GAL4 AD. We find that the removal of either residues 297–310 or residues 349–359 prevents the transactivation of yeast reporter genes in a β-galactosidase activity assay (Fig.6A). This observation suggests that the association of Rab5a with the AT1AR requires Rab5a binding to multiple regions of the AT1AR Ct. Furthermore, amino acid residues 349–359 do not contribute to AT1AR endocytosis, because the truncation of the AT1AR by 10 and 20 amino acid residues had no effect on the agonist-stimulated internalization of the AT1AR (Fig. 6B). The internalization of the AT1AR was not altered until 30 amino acids were deleted from the carboxyl-terminal tail, AT1AR-(1–329) (Fig. 6B). Therefore, the regions critical for Rab5a binding to the AT1AR Ct are distinct from those residues (residues 327–332) required for stable β-arrestin binding and AT1AR endocytosis (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We observed that the removal of either residues 297–310 or residues 349–359 from the AT1AR Ct prevented the interaction of Rab5a with the AT1AR Ct. However, because the removal of residues 297–310 would result in a nonfunctional receptor, we tested whether the deletion of the last 10 amino acid residues from the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail might alter the agonist-stimulated redistribution of the mutant AT1AR into enlarged hollow core vesicular structures. Although the truncation of the last 10 amino acid residues from the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail has no effect on the internalization of AT1AR·β-arrestin2-GFP complexes (Fig. 7A), β-arrestin2-GFP labeled AT1AR-(1–349) is no longer observed to redistribute into large hollow core vesicles (Fig.7A). Rather, the β-arrestin bound AT1AR remains localized in small endocytic vesicular structures (Fig.7A). Moreover, similar to what was previously observed for the β2AR (17Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the AT1AR (1) mutant remains localized to small endocytic vesicles and no longer completely co-localizes with GFP-Rab5a (Fig. 7B). Consequently, the redistribution of the AT1AR into enlarged endocytic structures appears to be dependent both of Rab5a activity and the last 10 amino acids of the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail that contributes to AT1AR/Rab5a interactions. Taken together, our data indicate that Rab5a is an AT1AR binding protein and that the association of Rab5a with the AT1AR appears to regulate the intracellular trafficking and fusion of AT1AR-bearing endocytic vesicles into enlarged hollow core vesicular structures. The association between the AT1AR and Rab5a appears to be interactive, in that activation of the AT1AR increases Rab5a GTP binding and activated Rab5a is required for homotypic fusion of AT1AR-bearing endocytic vesicles into enlarged hollow core vesicular structures. Rab5a binding to the AT1AR requires both the distal and proximal ends of the AT1AR Ct. Because the proximal end of the AT1AR Ct is implicated in heterotrimeric G protein coupling (27Sano T. Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Nakagomi Y. Nakazawa S. Kikyo M. Shirai H. Blank J.S. Exton J.H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it stands to reason that its carboxyl-terminal tail may allow the AT1AR to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5a. As a consequence, activated AT1AR exhibits the capacity to promote the Rab5a-dependent homotypic fusion of endocytic vesicles. The trafficking of proteins between intracellular organelles is a highly regulated process involving several membrane budding and fusion events between donor and acceptor membranes (22Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Rab GTPases are important regulators of intracellular vesicular transport and endosomal fusion (22Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Recent studies have indicated that Rab5 contributes to the formation, trafficking, and fusion of clathrin-coated vesicles with early endosomes (29Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the dominant-negative Rab5a-S34N mutant blocks the internalization and trafficking of β2AR-bearing endocytic vesicles (17Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but Rab5a does not associate with the β2AR. In contrast, although Rab5 binds the AT1AR, similar to what is observed for β-arrestin dominant-negative, the internalization of the AT1AR appears to also be insensitive to inhibition by a dominant-negative Rab5a-S34N mutant. The reason why the internalization of the AT1AR is insensitive to Rab5a-S34N remains unknown. It is possible that the β2AR and AT1AR are internalized by distinct endocytic mechanisms and/or vesicular populations or that the AT1AR recruits additional proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Multiple effector proteins regulate the distribution of Rab5 between membrane compartments and the cytosol. For example, the Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor regulates Rab5 membrane localization where the exchange of GDP for GTP is regulated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (30Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We propose that the AT1AR also functions as a novel Rab5a guanine nucleotide exchange factor linking AT1AR signaling and intracellular trafficking. In particular, AT1AR activation promotes Rab5a GTP binding, which is correlated with enhanced vesicular fusion. Agonist activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also results in the recruitment of intracellular proteins involved in endocytic trafficking. In particular, EGFR stimulation leads to the activation and plasma membrane translocation of Rab5a (32Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, unlike what we observe for the AT1AR, EGFR internalization is blocked by Rab5a-S34N. Furthermore, EGFR-dependent Rab5a activation requires the stimulation of a tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of uncharacterized intermediary Rab5a regulatory proteins (32Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of Rab5a by the AT1AR appears to involve the direct association of the receptor with the GTPase. There is emerging evidence to suggest that Rab GTPases may be required for selecting cargo proteins for sequestration into clathrin-coated vesicles (33Jedd G. Mulholland J. Segev N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34McLauchlan H. Newell J. Morrice N. Osborne A. West M. Smythe E. Curr.

Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Rab9 sequesters cargo proteins into vesicles shuttling from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network. Specifically, this involves an intermediary Rab9 effector protein, TIP47, which acts as a molecular link between the mannose-6-phosphate receptor cargo protein and Rab9 (36Carroll K.S. Hanna J. Simon I. Krise J. Barbero P. Pfeffer S.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 37Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Rab GTPases not only function to recruit vesicular effector proteins but may also regulate their activities. In contrast, the observation that Rab5/AT1AR interactions may stimulate Rab5-dependent homotypic fusion of early endosomes suggests that vesicular cargo proteins, such as the AT1AR, may control their own targeting between intracellular compartments by controlling the activity of specific components of the intracellular trafficking machinery in the absence of an intermediary effector protein. It is now appreciated that the termination of GPCR signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins does not abrogate the potential for “desensitized” GPCRs to signal via other cascades. Through their association with regulatory proteins such as β-arrestins, GPCRs serve as scaffolds for the assembly and compartmentalization of multi-molecular signaling protein complexes (38Luttrell L.M.

Understanding why and how GPCRs regulate the redistribution of these complexes into different intracellular compartments will improve our comprehension of the molecular and physiological consequences of GPCR signaling. The identification of an interdependent relationship between AT1AR activation and Rab5a-mediated intracellular vesicular trafficking and fusion provides the first indication that GPCR subtypes may specify the compartment to which these signaling complexes are mobilized. Because there is evidence that multiple small GTP-binding proteins interact with GPCRs (42Mitchell R. McCulloch D. Lutz E. Johnson M. MacKenzie C. Fennell M. Fink G. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), future studies should reveal whether GPCRs both interact with and regulate additional components of the intracellular trafficking machinery.

Specific antibodies were raised against an N-terminal domain (residues 1–267) and a C-terminal domain (residues 343–486) expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Western blotting of lysates of wild-type 8325-4 and Newman and the corresponding ebpSmutants showed that EbpS migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa. The protein was found exclusively in cytoplasmic membrane fractions purified from protoplasts or lysed cells, in contrast to the clumping factor ClfA, which was cell-wall-associated. EbpS was predicted to have three hydrophobic domains H1-(205–224), H2-(265–280), and H3-(315–342). A series of hybrid proteins was formed between EbpS at the N terminus and either alkaline phosphatase or β-galactosidase at the C terminus (EbpS-PhoA, EbpS-LacZ). PhoA and LacZ were fused to EbpS between hydrophobic domains H1–H2 and H2–H3, and distal to H3. Expression of enzymatic activity in E. coli showed that EbpS is an integral membrane protein with two membrane-spanning domains H1 and H3. N-terminal residues 1–205 and C-terminal residues 343–486 were predicted to be exposed on the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane. The ligand-binding domain of EbpS is known from previous studies to be present in the N terminus between residues 14–34 and probing whole cells with anti-EbpS1–267 antibodies indicated that this region is exposed on the surface of intact cells. This was also confirmed by the observation that wild-type S. aureus Newman cells bound labeled tropoelastin whereas the ebpS mutant bound 72% less. In contrast, the C terminus, which carries a putative LysM peptidoglycan-binding domain, is not exposed on the surface of intact cells and presumably remains buried within the peptidoglycan. Finally, expression of EbpS was correlated with the ability of cells to grow to a higher density in liquid culture, suggesting that EbpS may have a role in regulating cell growth.

It is equipped with an arsenal of virulence factors, including cytolytic toxins, superantigens, extracellular enzymes, and cell-surface-associated proteins (1Bohach G.A. Foster T.J. Fischetti V.A.

The wide variety of virulence factors reflects the organism's ability to cause many infections ranging from superficial skin lesions such as abscesses and impetigo to invasive and more serious infections such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, and endocarditis (3Crossley K.B.

Strains causing nosocomial infections are often resistant to most of the antibiotics available for treatment (e.g.MRSA1). The organism can express an array of surface proteins that promote bacterial interactions with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (2Höök M. Foster T.J. Fischetti V.A. Novick R.P.

The MSCRAMMs have many common structural features, including a cleavable signal sequence at the N terminus, a conserved Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG) pentapeptide sequence at the C terminus, a stretch of hydrophobic residues, and a positively charged tail (11Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Importantly, these MSCRAMMs are covalently attached to cell wall peptidoglycan by the membrane-associated enzyme sortase that recognizes the LPXTG motif and joins the Thr residue of the motif to the nascent cross-bridge of the peptidoglycan precursor prior to its incorporation into the wall polymer (11Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Elastin, along with microfibrillar components, are a major component of the elastic fiber ECM (12Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular matrix assembly and structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Elastin plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of tissues in which reversible extensibility or deformability is required (13Sandberg L.B. Soskel N.T. Leslie J.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus elastin and elastic fibers are present in abundance in tissues that require elasticity such as the lung, skin, and major blood vessels. Physiologic elastin, like interstitial collagen and other matrices, is an insoluble polymeric fiber. Elastin is comprised of cross-linked tropoelastin monomers that are first secreted as soluble precursors from cells (12Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular matrix assembly and structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Lysine residues in the cross-linking domain of secreted tropoelastin are rapidly cross-linked both inter- and intramolecularly by the enzyme lysyl oxidase (14Kagan H.M. Trackman P.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because S. aureus infects many tissues that are rich in elastin, we previously investigated whether S. aureusinteracts specifically with elastin. These studies revealed thatS. aureus binds to soluble tropoelastin via a cell-surface-associated 25-kDa protein named the elastin-binding protein of S. aureus EbpS. EbpS binds to the N-terminal 30-kDa region of elastin, which does not contain the VGVAPG hexapeptide recognition motif for the mammalian elastin receptor (15Park P.W. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham B.R.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The EbpS elastin binding site is also different from the charged C-terminal region in elastin where microfibrillar components associate for elastic fiber assembly (17Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the EbpS binding site in elastin is available for S. aureus binding and that this interaction may promote bacterial colonization to facilitate pathogenesis. In contrast to the fibrinogen-, collagen-, and fibronectin-binding proteins, the elastin-binding protein EbpS was reported to lack a signal sequence and the C-terminal LPXTG motif present inS. aureus MSCRAMMs that are used to link surface molecules covalently to the cell wall peptidoglycan by sortase (15Park P.W.

This suggested novel mechanisms of secretion from the cell and attachment to the cell wall. Here we report that the ebpS gene product is an integral membrane protein. The N terminus, which contains the elastin binding site, is exposed to the extracellular milieu. Using LacZ and PhoA fusions we showed that the EbpS protein has two transmembrane domains, and the C terminus as well as the N terminus is located on the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane. A mutant ofS. aureus lacking EbpS exhibited decreased binding to radiolabeled tropoelastin, a defect that was restored by the presence of the wild-type ebpS gene on a complementing plasmid. These findings clarify how EbpS is expressed on the cell surface and demonstrate that EbpS is the cell-surface protein of S. aureus that mediates binding to soluble tropoelastin. Escherichia coli cells bearing recombinant plasmids were grown in L broth or on L agar incorporating ampicillin (Ap, 100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (Cm, 25 μg/ml) Ranamycin (Va, 25μg/ml) or spectinomycin at 25 μg/ml, where appropriate.

The 5.2-kb PstI fragment on one positively hybridizing clone pFR5.2 was sequenced by MWG Biotech. Two sets of primers were used to PCR amplify the 8325-4ebpS locus from pFR5.2 in two segments, which were cloned together into pUC18 (22Yanish-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) resulting in a deletion of 116 bp (ΔebpS) located between 538 and 654 bp in the coding sequence. A 3′-fragment of approximately 1.4 kb was amplified by F5′-CCCAAGCTTTGAATGGTTGCTGCCGTTTC incorporating aHindIII, site (underlined) and R5′-TCCCCGCGGGATGTTTCTGATTGGTTAGCAC containing aSacII site (underlined). A 3′-fragment of approximately 1.5 kb was amplified by F5′-TCCCCGCGGCTGGTGCAATGGCTGCTTC incorporating a SacII site and R5′-CCGGAATTCCTTCTCGGTAATAAACTAGCG incorporating an EcoRI site. The fragments were cleaved with HindIII andSacII or EcoRI and SacII, as appropriate, and ligated with pUC18 cleaved with HindIII andEcoRI to form pFR1. The ermC gene of pE194 (23Horinouchi S. Weisblum B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 804-814Crossref Google Scholar) was amplified on a 1-kb fragment by F5′-TCCCCGCGGAGGTGTCACAAGACACTC and R5′-TCCCCGCGGAGCTCGTGCTATAATTATAC incorporatingSacII sites (underlined), and cloned into theSacII site in the middle of the ebpS gene in pFR1 forming ebpS::Emr (pFR2). The temperature-sensitive S. aureus plasmid pTS2 (expresses resistance to chloramphenicol) (24Greene C. McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P.E. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) was cloned into theHindIII site located between the two flankingebpS sequences of pFR2 forming pFR3 (ebpS::Emr). This plasmid was transformed into S. aureus RN4220 (25Kreiswirth B.N. Löfdahl M.S. Betley M.J. O'Reilly M. Schlievert P.M. Bergdoll M.S. Novick R.P. Nature. 1983; 305: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) selecting Emr at 30 °C. Recombinational exchange between pFR3 and the chromosomal ebpS locus was detected (21Foster T.J. Methods Microbiol. 1998; 27: 433-454Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) resulting in strain DU5979 (RN4220ebpS::Emr). The fidelity of the exchange was tested by Southern blotting. Genomic DNA was cleaved withEcoRI and HindIII, probed with a DIG-labeled 787-bp 5′-ebpS fragment amplified with primers F5′ and R5′, which revealed that a single 3.15-kb fragment from the wild-type was replaced with a 4.0-kb fragment in the mutant. TheebpS::Emr mutation was transduced to 8325-4 (forming DU5980), to 8325-4spa::Tcr (10Hartleib J. Kohler N. Dickinson R.B. Chhatwal G.S. Sixma J.J. Foster T.J. Peters G. Kehrel B.E. Herrmann M. Blood. 2000; 96: 2149-2156PubMed Google Scholar) to form DU5982, and to Newman spa::Kar (DU5971) forming DU5983. The wild-type S. aureus 8325-4 ebpS gene with 300 bp of 5′-DNA, which should be sufficient to carry the promoter, and 200 bp of 3′-DNA, was cloned from plasmid pFR5.2 into the shuttle plasmid pCU1 (26Augustin J. Rosenstein R. Wieland B. Schneider U. Schnell N. Engelke G. Entian K.D. Gotz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (Apr in E. coli; Cmr in S. aureus) by PCR using Pfupolymerase and primer F5′-CCGGAATTCGGATCAATGTAGACGGAAG containing an EcoRI site (underlined) and R5′-CCCAAGCTTGACAAGACCTTGTTAAATAAC containing aHindIII site (underlined). pCU1ebpS+was transformed into S. aureus RN4220 selecting for resistance to Cm and transduced using phage 85 (21) to other strains ofS. aureus. A single-copy integrating vector plasmid pCL84 (27Lee C.Y. Buranen S.L. Ye Z.H. Gene. 1991; 103: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was also used for complementation tests. pCL84 expresses spectinomycin resistance inE. coli and Tcr in S. aureus. It carries the att site of phage L54a but lacks a replicon that functions in S. aureus. When transformed into S. aureus CYL316 (27Lee C.Y. Buranen S.L. Ye Z.H. Gene. 1991; 103: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which overexpresses the L54a integrase, the plasmid integrated into the chromosomal att site located in the geh gene. The ebpS gene was amplified using the primers for cloning in pCU1 given above, except that the reverse primer carried an EcoRI site. Plasmid pCL84ebpS+ and the pCL84 empty vector control were transformed into CYL316 selecting for Tcr where they integrated into the phage L54a att site forming DU5984 and DU5985, respectively. The integrated plasmids were then transduced by phage 85 into strain 8325-4ebpS::Emr forming DU5986 (8325-4ebpS::Emrgeh::pCL84ebpS+, Tcr) and DU5987 (8325-4ebpS::Emrgeh::pCL84,Tcr). Recombinant EbpS proteins were expressed with 6xHis affinity tags at their N termini using the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). rEbpS1–267, carrying the first 267 residues of EbpS from strain 8325-4, was constructed by PCR amplification using pFR5.2 as the template and primers F5′-CGCGGATCCATAGAAAGGAAGGTGGCTGTG incorporating a BamHI site (underlined) and with the A of the two ATG codons changed to G (in boldface) to avoid internal initiation of translation and R5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATGGAATAACGATTTGTTGACC incorporating aHindIII site (underlined). The PCR fragment was cleaved withBamHI and HindIII and cloned into pQE30 cleaved with the same enzymes. The primers amplified 6 codons upstream from the methionine codon defined by N-terminal sequencing of the 25-kDa form of EbpS purified from S. aureus Cowan. Thus rEbpS1–267 contains 17 extra residues at the N terminus, the first 11 provided by the pQE30 vector and 6 from the open reading frame that extends upstream from the ebpS ATG start codon. The pQE30 plasmid expressing the C-terminal truncate rEbpS343–486 was also constructed by PCR using primers F5′-CGCGGATCCAACAATCATAATAATGGTAC incorporating aBamHI site (underlined) and R5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATGGAATAACGATTTGTTG incorporating aHindIII site (underlined) to facilitate cloning. The resulting plasmids pQEebpS1–267 and pQEebpS343–486 were transformed into E. coli M15 lac ZΔM15 ara gal mtl (pREP4 lacIq, Kar) (Qiagen) for protein expression. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni2+-chelate chromatography. rEbpS1–267 was insoluble and formed inclusion bodies, which were dissolved in 8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer and purified as described previously (18Park P.W.

The entire 1461-bp 8325-4 ebpS open reading frame was PCR-amplified from plasmid pFR5.2 using Pfu polymerase and primers F5′-CATGCCATGGCTAATAATTTTAAAGATGACTTTG containing aNcoI site (underlined) and R5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATGGAATAACGATTTGTTG containing aHindIII site (underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was ligated into the expression vector pKK233-2 (29Amann E. Brosius J. Gene. 1985; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) forming plasmid pKK233ebpS. This construct served as a template for generating a series of ebpS-phoA and ebpS-lacZfusions. The ebpS gene was truncated at the 3′-end by PCR amplification. The same forward primer was used in each amplification. The forward primer was complementary to DNA located 5′ to thetrc promoter in pKK233-2 and contained an EcoRI site. When combined with reverse primers containing a 5′-SalI site that were complementary to different sequences within ebpS, it was possible to generate a set ofebpS-lacZ and ebpS-phoA fusions by cloning between EcoRI and SalI sites in the fusion expression vectors pBAF (phoA) (30Fulkerson J.F. Mobley H.L.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1722-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and pLKC480 (lacZ) (31Tiedeman A.A. Smith J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 163587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was initially tested on LA plates incorporating 100 μg/ml Ap, 1 mm IPTG, and 40 μg/ml of the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma Chemical Co.). β-Galactosidase activities were detected on LA incorporating 100 μg/ml Ap, 25 μg/ml Cm, 2 mm IPTG, and 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Melford Laboratories). To quantify AP activity, the strain CC118 (araD139 Δ(ara, leu)7697ΔlacX74 phoA20 galE galK thi rpsE argE(Am)recA1) (32Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, to quantify β-galactosidase activity, strain TG1 (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd ed.

Bertin, Institute Pasteur, personal communication.IPTG was added to a final concentration of 3 mm(phoA fusions) or 2 mm (lacZfusions), and cultures were grown for a further 4 h. AP activity was assayed by the method of Brickman and Beckwith (33Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with the addition of iodoacetamide (4 mg/ml) to the Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, used to resuspend cells. LacZ activity was measured by the method of Miller (34Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised in young New Zealand White rabbits to rEbpS1–267 and rEbpS343–486, and the immunoglobulin fraction was purified (35Owen P. Korhonen T.E. Dawes E.A. Mäkelä P.H. Enterobacterial Surface Antigens: Methods for Molecular Characterization. Elsevier, Amsterdam1985: 237-238Google Scholar). Antibodies to rEbpS343–486 were affinity-purified to remove antibodies that cross-reacted with other S. aureusproteins. rEbpS343–486 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody that bound to the Sepharose was eluted with 50 mm glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.7. S. aureus Newman spacultures were grown to stationary phase in TSB with aeration (A600 nm of 12). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and washed with PBS. Cells were concentrated by resuspension in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5) supplemented with 30% raffinose at anA600 nm of 100. Cell wall proteins were solubilized by incubation with lysostaphin (200 μg/ml) in the presence of protease inhibitors (mini Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protoplasts were recovered by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was taken as the wall fraction. Protoplasts were washed once in raffinose buffer and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer. Protoplasts were lysed by vortexing and repeated pipetting. Lysis was confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy. The membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C followed by washing and resuspension in lysis buffer. The supernatant became the cytoplasmic fraction. The culture supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and proteins were precipitated by 1:20 volume ice-cold 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were pelleted at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once in ice-cold acetone, air-dried, and dissolved in Laemmli final sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). An equivalent of 1 A600 unit of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Fractions were assayed for isocitrate dehydrogenase (37Ells H.A. Archs. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 85: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). S. aureus Newmanspa was grown to stationary phase in TSB with aeration. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (see above) at an A600 nm of 150. The suspension was transferred to a blue cap Fast RNA tube and shaken in a FP120 Fastprep (Savant) cell disintegrator at speed 6 for 40 s. This was repeated 10 times with cooling on ice for 1 min between cycles. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 min at 3000 × g to remove whole cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to sediment cell wall material. Membranes were sedimented at 40,000 ×g for 60 min, washed in ice-cold lysis buffer, and resuspended in lysis buffer. E. coli strains harboring ebpS-lacZ andebpS-phoA fusions were induced with IPTG. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing 10 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors (40 μl/ml) (mini Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and lysozyme (200 μg/ml) (chicken egg white, Sigma). Cell suspensions were transferred to a blue cap Fast RNA tube and shaken in a FP120 FastPrep cell disrupter at speed 4.5 for 40 s. Shaking was repeated five times with cooling. Lysates were spun at 40,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane-containing pellets were washed in PBS with 10 mm MgCl2, pelleted as above, and finally resuspended in PBS. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by boiling for 5 min in final sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and analyzed in 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Western blotting membranes (Boehringer) by the semidry system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 15 h at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) skim milk. Rabbit polyclonal anti-rEbpS1–267 and anti-rEbpS343–486 antibodies were used at a 1:1500 dilution. Bound antibody was recognized by incubation with protein A-peroxidase (Sigma, 1:2000) and visualized using the Chemiluminescence Detection System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Rabbit anti-Micrococcus luteusF1/F0-ATPase, which cross-reacts with theS. aureus protein, was a gift from P. Owen, Trinity College, Dublin. Mouse anti-β-galactosidase polyclonal antibodies (Sigma) were used at a dilution of 1:50. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to alkaline phosphatase (Abcam Ltd.) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. S. aureus Newman spa, Newmanspa ebpS, and Newman spa ebpS (pCU-ebpS+) were grown to stationary phase in TSB with aeration (A600 nmof 12). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended at an A600 nm of 100 units. Ten microliters from this suspension were dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran) and dried for 30 min. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in PBS for 1 h. Western blots were probed with anti-rEbpS1–267 or anti-rEbpS343–486 antibodies at a 1:1500 dilution. Full-length recombinant human tropoelastin (20 μg) (38Indik K. Abrams W.R. Kucich U. Gibson C.W.

https://openalex.org/W1992317586,"During Drosophila visual system development, photoreceptors R7 and R8 project axons to targets in distinct layers of the optic lobe. We show here that the LAR receptor tyrosine phosphatase is required in the eye for correct targeting of R7 axons. In LAR mutants, R7 axons initially project to their correct target layer, but then retract to the R8 target layer. This targeting defect can be fully rescued by transgenic expression of LAR in R7, and partially rescued by expression of LAR in R8. The phosphatase domains of LAR are required for its activity in R7, but not in R8. These data suggest that LAR can act both as a receptor in R7, and as a ligand provided by R8. Genetic interactions implicate both Enabled and Trio in LAR signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2147437837,"We have determined the crystal structure at 1.8 Å resolution of a complex of α-bungarotoxin with a high affinity 13-residue peptide that is homologous to the binding region of the α subunit of acetylcholine receptor. The peptide fits snugly to the toxin and adopts a β hairpin conformation. The structures of the bound peptide and the homologous loop of acetylcholine binding protein, a soluble analog of the extracellular domain of acetylcholine receptor, are remarkably similar. Their superposition indicates that the toxin wraps around the receptor binding site loop, and in addition, binds tightly at the interface of two of the receptor subunits where it inserts a finger into the ligand binding site, thus blocking access to the acetylcholine binding site and explaining its strong antagonistic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2041091862,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a DNA-binding enzyme that plays roles in response to DNA damage, apoptosis, and genetic stability. Recent evidence has implicated PARP in transcription of eukaryotic genes. However, the existing paradigm tying PARP function to the presence of DNA strand breaks does not provide a mechanism by which it may be recruited to gene-regulating domains in the absence of DNA damage. Here we report that PARP can bind to the DNA secondary structures (hairpins) in heteroduplex DNA in a DNA end-independent fashion and that automodification of PARP in the presence of NAD+ inhibited its hairpin binding activity. Atomic force microscopic images show that in vitro PARP protein has a preference for the promoter region of the PARP gene in superhelical DNA where the dyad symmetry elements likely form hairpins according to DNase probing. Using a chromatin cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assay we show that PARP protein binds to the chromosomal PARP promoter in vivo. Reporter gene assays have revealed that the transcriptional activity of the PARP promoter is 4–5-fold greater in PARP knockout cells than in wild type fibroblasts. Reintroduction of vectors expressing full-length PARP protein or its truncated mutant (DNA-binding domain retained but lacking catalytic activity) into PARP−/− cells has conferred transcriptional down-regulation of the PARP gene promoter. These data provide support for PARP protein as a potent regulator of transcription including down-regulation of its own promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2042575407,"We have examined the roles of Hsc70 and auxilin in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during neuronal endocytosis. We identified two peptides that inhibit the ability of Hsc70 and auxilin to uncoat CCVs in vitro. When injected into nerve terminals, these peptides inhibited both synaptic transmission and CCV uncoating. Mutation of a conserved HPD motif within the J domain of auxilin prevented binding to Hsc70 in vitro and injecting this mutant protein inhibited CCV uncoating in vivo, demonstrating that the interaction of auxilin with Hsc70 is critical for CCV uncoating. These studies establish that auxilin and Hsc70 participate in synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons and that an interaction between these proteins is required for CCV uncoating."

Membranes that effectively stabilize a resting-like state exhibit a relatively large proportion of non-hydrogen-bonded lipid ester carbonyls, suggesting a relatively tight packing of the lipid head groups and thus a well ordered membrane. Functional reconstituted membranes also exhibit gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures that are higher than those of nonfunctional reconstituted membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine alone.

Despite numerous studies aimed at understanding lipid-protein interactions at the nAChR, however, there is still disagreement even as to which lipids are absolutely required for optimal function. Consequently, the molecular mechanisms by which lipids modulate function remain poorly understood. The lack of definitive insight reflects both the complexities of lipid-protein interactions at the nAChR and the inherent difficulties associated with characterizing the structural and dynamic properties of the nAChR and its surrounding lipids in a membrane environment.The pioneering work of the Barrantes and McNamee laboratories originally highlighted the requirement for anionic and/or neutral lipids such as phosphatidic acid and cholesterol (Chol), respectively, in reconstituted phosphatidylcholine membranes to stabilize a functional nAChR (3Fong T.M.

The nAChR in egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) membranes lacking both neutral and anionic lipids appears to be stabilized in a nonconducting desensitized-like conformation (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L.

Increasing levels of either Chol or dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (DOPA) in EPC membranes stabilize an increasing proportion of nAChRs in a resting-like state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational change (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Both lipids also slow nAChR internal motions and increase the lateral packing density of the lipid bilayers (15Baenziger J.E. Darsaut T.E. Morris M.-L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4905-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings were incorporated into the model of lipid action at the nAChR presented in Fig. 1 (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A basic tenet of the model is that the equilibrium between the resting and the nonconducting desensitized states is modulated by bulk physical properties of the lipid bilayer. Specific anionic lipid binding sites are also likely important (see Ref. 5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar for a detailed discussion of the model).The hypothesis that membrane physical properties influence nAChR function is not new, but there is contradictory evidence both in support of and against such a mechanism of lipid action (3Fong T.M.

As we have suggested previously (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), this controversy may stem from the fact that studies testing the link between fluidity and function have generally relied on spin label and fluorescent probes to assess the physical properties of the reconstituted nAChR membranes. Both approaches have characterized the reconstituted membranes in terms of a single parameter, which may not be sufficient considering the complex motional and dynamic properties of lipid bilayers. A combination of solid state 2H NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling can provide a more comprehensive picture of the motions and dynamics of lipids in a membrane environment and could lead to a more accurate assessment of the link between fluidity and nAChR function (18Auger M. Carrier D. Smith I.C.P. Jarrell H.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1373-1381Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Baenziger J.E. Jarrell H.C. Smith I.C.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2H NMR spectroscopy requires membrane lipids with either perdeuterated or single-site deuterium-labeled fatty acyl chains. Lipids such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA) perdeuterated along the saturated palmitoyl chain are commercially available and are ideal for such a study because interpretation of the 2H quadrupolar splittings is not complicated by the orientational constraints of a double bond (32Seelig J. Waespe-Sarcevic N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3310-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, 2H NMR/molecular modeling studies are extremely time-consuming and require the acquisition and analysis of extensive NMR data. The structural and functional properties of the nAChR in mixtures of POPC, POPA, and Chol have also not been defined.As a first step toward rigorously testing the hypothesized link between nAChR conformational equilibria and the physical properties of the lipid environment surrounding the nAChR, we characterize here the structural and functional properties of reconstituted nAChR membranes composed of POPC, 3:2 POPC/POPA, 3:2 POPC/1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (DOPA), 3:2 POPC/Chol, and 3:1:1 POPC/POPA/Chol using both Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemical labeling techniques. These lipid mixtures were chosen because each lipid is available in a deuterated form and because preliminary studies suggested that the mixtures should stabilize the nAChR predominantly in either a resting-like (3:2 POPC/POPA, 3:2 POPC/DOPA, 3:2 POPC/Chol, and 3:1:1 POPC/POPA/Chol) or a desensitized-like (POPC) state. As Chol, DOPA, and POPA have distinct structures and likely distinct effects on membrane physical properties, these mixtures provide simple systems in which potential links between the membrane environment and nAChR function can be rigorously tested.We have characterized the physical properties of the reconstituted nAChR membranes using FTIR spectroscopy, which provides detailed, but qualitative insight into the motional properties of membrane lipids (35Mendelsohn R. Mantsch H.H. Watts A. De Pont J.J. Progress in Protein-Lipid Interactions 2. Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V., Amsterdam1986: 103-146Google Scholar). The FTIR data are consistent with a modulation of nAChR conformational equilibria by membrane fluidity, but show that the physical properties of even these simple reconstituted membranes are complex. Significantly, the data indicate that the nAChR selectively influences the physical properties of the lipid environment in which it is imbedded when either DOPA or POPA is present. This novel finding provides direct evidence for a coupling between the physical properties of phosphatidic acid-containing membranes and the functional state of the nAChR that could underlie a mechanism by which lipids modulate nAChR function. The structural and functional characterization of the nAChR in these lipid mixtures also provides a basis for future2H NMR/molecular modeling studies aimed at further testing the link between fluidity and function.DISCUSSIONA long term goal of this work is to understand the mechanisms underlying the relative abilities of reconstituted nAChR membranes composed of either POPC alone or POPC with either POPA and/or Chol to stabilize the nAChR in a functional conformation. In this report, we focused on the link between membrane fluidity and nAChR conformational equilibria proposed in Fig. 1. Although the results generally support the existence of such a link, the data illustrate the complexity of the physical properties of even these simple reconstituted nAChR membranes and thus the need for more comprehensive 2H NMR/molecular modeling studies to fully test our working model. The data also reveal several unanticipated features regarding the interactions that occur between the nAChR and lipid bilayers.FTIR difference spectroscopy and [125I]TID labeling both indicate, in agreement with previous studies of similar membranes (3Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 73: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), that the nAChR reconstituted into membranes composed of POPC alone is stabilized in a desensitized-like state that does not undergo agonist-induced conformational change. The reconstituted POPC membranes have relatively low gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures and exhibit lipid ester carbonyl stretching band shapes indicative of a high degree of water penetration into the lipid head group region of the bilayer and thus a low lateral lipid packing density. Both are consistent with a relatively disordered or fluid membrane at room temperature.In contrast, the nAChR in 3:2 POPC/POPA and 3:2 POPC/DOPA membranes is stabilized in a resting-like state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced desensitization. Although the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures of the nAChR in 3:2 POPC/POPA and 3:2 POPC/DOPA differ, they are both higher than the phase transition temperature of the reconstituted POPC membranes. The lipid carbonyl ester stretching band shapes suggest a high degree of lateral packing density in the POPA- and DOPA-containing lipid bilayers reconstituted with the nAChR and thus a higher degree of membrane order. In addition, the presence of phosphatidic acid in phosphatidylcholine membranes appears to slow down nAChR internal motions as monitored by a slowing of exchange kinetics for all nAChR peptide hydrogens (15Baenziger J.E. Darsaut T.E. Morris M.-L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4905-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that relatively ordered membranes stabilize the receptor in a resting-like state whereas relatively fluid membranes favor a desensitized conformation.The correlation between fluidity and function is less clear for the reconstituted POPC membranes containing Chol. The nAChR in 3:2 POPC/Chol appears to be predominantly desensitized, although the FTIR data suggest a limited ability to stabilize receptors in a resting-like state. The lipid ester carbonyl stretching band shape of the reconstituted POPC/Chol membranes is intermediate between that observed in the presence and absence of either POPA or DOPA, consistent with a limited ability to stabilize a functional nAChR. On the other hand, 40 mol% Chol in the POPC membranes abolishes the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition and, based on the relatively low methylene C-H stretching frequencies, leads to a bilayer with acyl chains that appear be more ordered in the liquid crystal phase than the acyl chains in the reconstituted 3:2 POPC/DOPA and 3:2 POPC/POPA membranes. According to our working model, the latter requires that the 3:2 POPC/Chol membrane should favor the resting state. It is possible, however, that the POPC membranes containing Chol are ordered in a manner that is different from the ordering that occurs in POPC membranes containing either POPA or DOPA.Note that other studies have reported a greater ability of Chol in either EPC or DOPC membranes to support a functional nAChR that undergoes agonist-induced conformational change (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Rankin S.E. Addona G.H. Kloczewiak M.A. Bugge B. Miller K.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In EPC and DOPC, 40 and 30 mol% Chol, respectively, are optimal for stabilizing the nAChR in a conformation that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational change. The ability of the nAChR to respond to agonist binding in either EPC or DOPC, however, is diminished at both higher and lower levels of Chol (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Levels of Chol different from those used here in the POPC membranes may be more effective at stabilizing a resting-like state. In addition, it is possible that DOPC or EPC membranes containing Chol are more effective in creating an environment suitable for the nAChR than POPC/Chol mixtures.Our data also show, in agreement with several other functional studies (3Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 13Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 73: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), that the nAChR in 3:1:1 POPC/POPA/Chol membranes is stabilized in a fully functional state. This result is surprising given our previous work (5Baenziger J.E. Morris M.-L. Darsaut T.E Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which suggests that either 20% Chol or 20% POPA alone in a POPC membrane is likely to have a very limited ability to stabilize the nAChR in a functional conformation. It appears that Chol and POPA act synergistically in POPC membranes to modulate nAChR conformational equilibria. Unfortunately, the qualitative analysis of membrane physical properties reported here is inadequate to fully understand the unique physical properties of the 3:1:1 POPC/POPA/Chol membrane and why the membrane is particularly effective at stabilizing a functional nAChR. An understanding of how this slightly more complex membrane stabilizes a functional nAChR is important, given that the physical environment of the 3:1:1 POPC/POPA/Chol membranes is likely more representative of that found in native membranes.A surprising, but significant finding of this study is that the physical properties of the “functional” POPC membranes containing either DOPA or POPA are strongly influenced by the presence of the nAChR, whereas the physical properties of the “nonfunctional” pure POPC membranes are relatively unaffected. For all the phosphatidic acid-containing membranes, incorporation of the nAChR leads to a large increase in the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperature as well as a large increase in the lateral packing density of the lipid bilayers, the latter reflected by a decrease in water penetration into the bilayer surface and thus a decrease in the number of hydrogen-bonded lipid ester carbonyls. Large effects of the nAChR upon the bulk physical properties of any lipid bilayer have not been reported previously. To the best of our knowledge, large changes in gel-to-liquid crystal phase transitions have not been reported upon incorporation of any integral membrane protein into a lipid bilayer. The FTIR data, although qualitative, also indicate that the physical properties of some nAChR membranes are not governed by the intrinsic properties of the lipids alone. The nAChR plays a substantial role in defining the physical characteristics of the reconstituted membranes.The ability of the nAChR to selectively influence the physical properties of membranes containing POPA or DOPA is particularly intriguing, given that both lipids are uniquely effective at stabilizing the nAChR in a functional state. These results suggest the nAChR interacts in a unique fashion with POPA- and DOPA-containing lipid bilayers. In the reconstituted 3:2 POPC/POPA membranes, this interaction does not likely lead to or result from a lateral phase separation of POPC and POPA because the membranes behave as a homogeneous mixture in terms of the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition. The ability of the nAChR to modulate the physical properties of the bilayers could stem from hydrophobic mismatching between the nAChR and the fatty acyl chains of the POPC/POPA or POPC/DOPA membranes. A hydrophobic mismatch could lead to large shifts in the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperature upon incorporation of the nAChR (34Gil T. Ipsen J.H. Mouritsen O.G. Sabra M.C. Sperotto M.M. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise mechanism, it seems plausible that the unique coupling between the nAChR and the physical properties of the phosphatidic acid-containing membrane may play an important role in how phosphatidic acid modulates nAChR function.Work by others has also suggested a unique role for anionic lipids in modulating nAChR function, although the additional presence of Chol is usually required to stabilize a fully functional nAChR (3Fong T.M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4065-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We cannot detect the changes in secondary structure of the nAChR in the presence of either POPA or DOPA that have been detected by others (4Fong T.M. McNamee M.G.

We are currently trying to define the structural features of phosphatidic acid that make it such an effective determinant of nAChR function. For example, the importance of the negative charge and/or the small headgroup of phosphatidic acid is being tested by assessing the structural and functional characteristics of the nAChR in POPC membranes composed of either 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl serine or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine.We have characterized the structure and conformational states of the nAChR stabilized in POPC, 3:2 POPC/POPA, 3:2 POPC/Chol, and 3:1:1 POPC/POPA/Chol membranes. Each lipid used in these membranes is available in a deuterated form. We are now in a position to rigorously analyze the physical properties of the reconstituted membranes using2H NMR spectroscopy. These future studies should provide important insight into the mechanisms by which membrane lipids influence integral membrane protein function, in general. Many hypotheses have been suggested to account for the functional sensitivity of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)1 fromTorpedo to the lipid composition of its surrounding environment (1McNamee M.G.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5523-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have all been proposed. Despite numerous studies aimed at understanding lipid-protein interactions at the nAChR, however, there is still disagreement even as to which lipids are absolutely required for optimal function. Consequently, the molecular mechanisms by which lipids modulate function remain poorly understood. The lack of definitive insight reflects both the complexities of lipid-protein interactions at the nAChR and the inherent difficulties associated with characterizing the structural and dynamic properties of the nAChR and its surrounding lipids in a membrane environment. The pioneering work of the Barrantes and McNamee laboratories originally highlighted the requirement for anionic and/or neutral lipids such as phosphatidic acid and cholesterol (Chol), respectively, in reconstituted phosphatidylcholine membranes to stabilize a functional nAChR (3Fong T.M.

It was suggested that phosphatidic acid and Chol stabilize distinct β-sheet and α-helix structures, respectively (4Fong T.M. McNamee M.G.

In contrast, more recent studies indicate that lipids exert their effects on nAChR function through subtle structural alterations (12Méthot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E.

These include OSE1, OSE2 (7Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), AP-1/VDRE (8Goldberg D. Polly P. Eisman J.A. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and GRE (9Meyer T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Starr D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30709-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). OSE1 and OSE2 were identified in mouse OC (mOC) promoter and are responsible for its tissue specific activity in osteoblasts. Both of these cis-elements are occupied by osteoblast-specific transcription factors, Osf1 and Runx2, respectively (7Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 10Schinke T. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30182-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Runx2 belongs to the RUNT domain transcription factor family (11Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and it has an indispensable role in osteoblast differentiation, maturation, and bone formation (12Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Runx2 was shown to bind the OSE2 site and regulates the mOC promoter in a tissue-specific manner (13Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In contrast to mOC promoter (14Zhang R. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 110-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), hOC promoter is highly inducible by vitamin D3 (15Sims N.A. White C.P. Sunn K.L. Thomas G.P. Drummond M.L. Morrison N.A. Eisman J.A. Gardiner E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a result, studies have mostly stressed its regulation by vitamin D3 in bone cells (16Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Little is known about the basal regulation of the gene. Vitamin D response element (VDRE) has been mapped to the proximal promoter and it is contiguous to an AP-1 site (8Goldberg D. Polly P. Eisman J.A. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that various AP-1 factors occupy this site at different stages during osteoblast development and they tightly regulate the interactions between vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its cognate binding sites. In proliferating osteoblasts, the binding of c-Fos and c-Jun heterodimers to the AP-1 site suppresses the rat OC (rOC) promoter activity, while the association of Fra-2 and JunD in the post-proliferate osteoblasts facilitates VDR/retinoid X receptor binding to the rOC promoter and induces its activity (17Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 31: 62-72Crossref Google Scholar). Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in Northern American men. Despite its common occurrence, the molecular mechanisms responsible for prostate cancer growth, androgen-independent (AI) progression and acquisition of bone metastatic potential are poorly characterized. Bone matrix proteins such as OC, bone sialoproteins, and osteopontin are expressed at high levels in primary and metastatic prostate cancer specimens (18Jung C. Ou Y.C. Yeung F. Frierson Jr., H.F. Kao C. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We hypothesized previously that prostate cancer acquires “bone-like properties” to thrive and grow in the bone microenvironment (19Koeneman K.S. Yeung F. Chung L.W. Prostate. 1999; 39: 246-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The goal of this study therefore is to better understand the osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells by studying the regulation of hOC gene expression in an AI prostate cancer cell line, PC3. PC3 cells were established from the bone metastatic lesions of a prostate cancer patient. It is considered a highly aggressive AI cell line which expresses neither AR nor PSA, and it does not require androgen for growth or survival. When injected intracardially in athymic mouse, PC3 cells have high propensity to metastasize to bone. In this study, we established the functional hierarchy of three regulatory elements, OSE1, OSE2, and AP-1/VDRE, in the regulation of the hOC promoter activity in PC3 cells (OSE1 > AP-1/VDRE > OSE2). Furthermore, through EMSA we identified Runx2, JunD/Fra-2, and Sp1 as the transcription factors which regulate OSE2, AP-1/VDRE, and OSE1, respectively. By expressing osteoblast-specific factor-like Runx2 and selectively activating Ap1 factor Fra-2, PC3 is able to behave like a mature osteoblast in activating OC expression. Based on our results, a model was constructed to explain how prostate cancer cells might become osteomimetic. This biochemical switch may contribute to the osteolytic/osteoblastic phenotype of prostate cancer cells frequently observed in metastatic skeletal lesions. Prostate cancer cells (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP) and MG63 (human osteosarcoma cell) were cultured in T-medium (20Gleave M. Hsieh J.T. Gao C.A. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3753-3761PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Rat osteosarcoma cells (rat osteosarcoma cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's mdofied Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfections, cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 105 (PC3, DU145, and rat osteosarcoma cells) cells/well in 12-well plates 24 h or 3 × 105 cells/well (LNCaP) in 6-well plates 48 h before transfection. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into cells either by complexing with DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or Clonfectin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly 1–3.5 μg of tested DNA constructs were used in the experiments. DNA-lipid complexes were allowed to form for 5–15 min at room temperature prior to their addition to each well containing 0.5 or 1 ml of serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were incubated with the complexes for 4–5 h at 5% CO2, 37 °C. DNA-lipid containing medium was then replaced with fresh medium with fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected after 36–48 h of additional incubation. Cells were washed with 0.5 ml/well of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100–300 μl of 1 × lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysates were vortexed for a few seconds and spun for 2 min. For luciferase activity detection, 20 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) and measured by a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). For β-galactosidase activity detection, 50 or 100 μl of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2 × β-galactosidase substrate (Promega) and incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min. The β-galactosidase activity was determined by plate reader at 405 nm wavelength. For protein assays, 10 μl of cell extracts were mixed with 200 μl of Coomassie plus protein reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and measured at 590 nm. Data are expressed as relative luciferase activity (RLA), which is obtained by normalizing the luciferase activity with either CMV-β-galactosidase activity or the protein concentrations of the cell lysates. All transfection experiments were carried out either in duplicate or triplicate, and RLA was expressed as the mean ± S.D. of two to three independent experiments. Genomic DNA was used in the PCR of the 800-bp human osteocalcin promoter (16Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), subsequently cloned into luciferase reporter vector-pGL3/Basic (Promega). The deletion constructs were generated by recombinant PCR method (21Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques.1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Complementary oligomers (the detailed oligos sequences are listed below in the EMSA section) containing two copies of individual element withKpnI and NheI sites were annealed and ligated toKpnI- and NheI-digested pGL3/TATA vector to generate OSE12/, mOSE12/, OSE22/, and AV2/TATA. Ligating respective constructs digested with either BamHI and AvrII or BamHI andNheI generated different combinations of the OSE12/, OSE22/, and AV2/TATA. Immunoblotting was performed using the NOVEX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) system. Briefly, 20 μg of nuclear extracts were separated on 4–12% Tris glycine PAGE gels and transferred onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C. Primary antibody was used at a 1:500-Runx2 (22Meyers S. Lenny N. Sun W. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 303-312PubMed Google Scholar) or 1:200-Fra-2 or JunD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) dilution. Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit antibody) (Amersham Bioscience, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) was used in a 1:4000 dilution. The incubation of both primary and secondary antibodies was done at 37 °C for 1 h with 30 min washing (TBS-T) in between. ECL plus (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) reagent was used for detection. PAGE purified oligos (Sigma-Genosys, Woodlands, TX) were annealed by heating up to 95 °C and slowly cooled down to room temperature. The oligo sequences used as probes or competitors were as follows: ARE-III, 5′-tcgacgaggaacatattgtatcgagtcga-3′ (23Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); SP-1, 5′-attcgatcggggcggggcgagc-3′; mSP-1, 5′-attcgatcggttcggggcgagc-3′; AP-1, 5′-cgcttgatgactcagccggaa-3′; VDRE, 5′-aggtcaaggaggtca-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); OSE1, 5′-caggcatgcccctcctcatcgctgggcac-3′; mOSE1, 5′-caggcatgcctttcctcatcgctgggcac-3′; OSE2, 5′-gctcccaaccacatatcc-3′; AP-1/VDRE, 5′-tggtgactcaccgggtgaa-3′. The double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Nuclear extracts were prepared as describe in Current Protocols (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). 40,000 cpm of labeled probe and 5–10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.), and 1 mm KCl at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE at 35 mA for 2 h. For experiments using Runx2 antibody, 2 μg of antibody was added to the reaction mixture for 30 min after the incubation period of the probe and nuclear extracts. For experiments using Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, VDR, Fra-2, JunD, and AR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), nuclear extracts and 2 μg of antibody were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of probe. In competition experiments, competitor oligos were incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of the probe. RNA was extracted using RNAzolB (Teltest, Friendswood, TX). Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each RT reaction contained 5 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.), and 0.5 μg of random hexamer (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) in a total volume of 20 μl which were then incubated at 42 °C for 1.5 h. Subsequently, 3 μl of the fresh RT reaction was used for PCR. The primers (25Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Buecker J.L. Kriz R. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) used forhOC PCR were: cactcctcgccctattggcc (OCF) and gccaactcgtcacagtccgg (OCR). The primers used for human runx2PCR were: accatggtggagatcatcgc and catcaagcttctgtctgtgc. The cycle for PCR was 94 °C 30 s, 60 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s for 35 cycles. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 (vitamin D3) used in the experiments was a generous gift from Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. (Nutley, NJ). We demonstrated previously that OC protein was not detectable in normal human prostate tissue, yet it was prevalently expressed in primary prostate cancer (85%) and in prostate cancer lymph node (100%) and bone metastasis specimens (100%) (26Chung L. Zhau H. Chung L. Isaacs W. Simons J. Prostate Cancer: Biology, Genetics and New Therapeutics. Human Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 341-364Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of hOC expression in prostate cancer cells, we examined the expression pattern of hOC mRNA in different cancer cell lines. RNA from four cell lines in two different conditions were extracted and used as templates for RT-PCR. Ethanol (the control groups) or 5 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 (vitamin D3) was added to the medium when the cells reached 60% confluence. Cells were collected after an additional 48 h incubation. A human osteosarcoma cell line (MG63) known to express endogenous OC (27Mahonen A. Pirskanen A. Keinanen R. Maenpaa P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. HOC mRNA was detected in both PC3 bone metastatic AI prostate cancer cells and the positive control MG63. Upon addition of vitamin D3, all the AI prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3) and MG63 showed an elevated level of hOC mRNA. However, the androgen-dependent/sensitive nontumorigenic prostate cancer cell LNCaP did not have any hOC expression in either the presence or absence of vitamin D3. To investigate whether the expression of hOC mRNA is controlled at the transcriptional level, the 800-bp hOC promoter was cloned and inserted upstream to a luciferase reporter gene (hOC/luc) for transient expression analysis (Fig.1B). In agreement with the RT-PCR data, PC3 exhibited the highest basal hOC/luc activity (34,850 ± 7,434 RLA) among the three prostate cancer cell lines, whereas the activity (2,311 ± 312 RLA) observed in LNCaP cells was similar to the empty vector. Rat osteosarcoma cells (16Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) served as positive control in the transient transfection experiments because high transfection efficiency can be obtained with rat osteosarcoma cells, but not with MG63. In accordance with previous studies, the hOC promoter was inducible by the addition of vitamin D3 (Fig.1B) in all the cell lines tested. Thus the promoter is tissue-specific and regulated by vitamin D3. In this study, PC3 (which has the highest basal hOC promoter activity) was the target cell line for investigating basal hOC promoter regulation in prostate cancer cells and LNCaP was used as the negative control cell line. OSE1 and OSE2 of mOC promoter were reported to be responsible for its restrictive activity in bone cells (7Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), while AP-1/VDRE (AV) is required for the vitamin D3inductive response in hOC promoter (8Goldberg D. Polly P. Eisman J.A. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the roles of OSE1, OSE2, and AP-1/VDRE have never been examined in the regulation of basal hOC promoter activity in prostate cancer cells. To define the functional hierarchy of these cis-elements in the control of hOC promoter activity in PC3 cells, we used the recombinant PCR method to generate single, double, or triple deletions of these elements (Fig.2A). Among the single deletion mutants, ΔOSE1 suffered the greatest activity drop, followed by ΔAV which contains deletion of half of the VDRE and the contiguous AP-1 site. Deletion of OSE2 did not seem to affect promoter activity to a great extent. Moreover, when OSE2 was removed together with either OSE1 or AV in double deletion, no additional decrease of activity was observed compared with the single deletion mutants (ΔAV or ΔOSE1). Thus, the OSE2 element may not be required for the maintenance of basal hOC promoter activity. On the other hand, OSE1 and AV single or double deletions have caused dramatic loss of activity in the hOC promoter indicating that these two cis-elements are crucial in conferring basal activity to the promoter in prostate cancer cells. It is conceivable that the OSE1 element exerts its effect by being in close proximity to the TATA box, which would allow the OSE1-binding factor(s) to act as a mediator between the binding factors of the other two cis-elements and the TATA binding complex. The effect of deletions on vitamin D induction is depicted in Fig.2B. Constructs that contain AV deletion become unresponsive to vitamin D stimulation, this data agrees with the current understanding that the binding of VDR and AP-1 factors is critical for vitamin D induction. Even though OSE1 and/or OSE2 deletions did not affect fold induction of vitamin D, the overall induced activities of the constructs are significantly less than those of the wild type promoter due to lower basal activities (Fig. 2A). Therefore, OSE1 and OSE2 may function independently of AV and they are required to confer maximum vitamin D-induced activity to hOC promoter. To determine whether these cis-elements can function independently in gene transcription, we generated constructs with two copies of each of the cis-elements inserted upstream to an artificial TATA box. As shown in Fig. 2C, both AV and OSE1 could function independently in PC3 cells, with OSE12/TATA having the highest fold increase above the empty vector activity (28.1-fold) and OSE22/TATA the least activity (2-fold). These results are in agreement with the deletion data, indicating that OSE1 and AV are strong regulatory elements in the hOC promoter in PC3 cells. Interactions among the three elements were investigated by juxtaposing dimers of the elements in different combinations in the pGL3/TATA vector. The results suggested that OSE1 could interact with AV and activate the simple TATA promoter in a synergistic manner (181.3-fold). Addition of OSE22could not further increase the activity of either OSE12/TATA or AV2/TATA. However, when OSE2 was inserted between AV2 and OSE12 in the AV2-OSE22-OSE12/TATA construct, increased activity (299-fold) was observed. These results imply that the OSE2-binding factor is not sufficient to induce transcriptional activation, but it can cooperate with OSE1 and AV-binding factors and collectively activate hOC promoter. Next, we generated a chimeric promoter, AV2-OSE22-OSE12/TATA, which not only retained the tissue-specific characteristic of hOC promoter and was also 8.1-fold more active than wild type hOC promoter in the OC-positive PC3 cells, but not in the OC-negative LNCaP cells (Fig.2D). Tissue-specific transcription factor(s), which are only present in OC positive cells, may be involved in regulating the chimeric AV2-OSE22-OSE12/TATA promoter. Furthermore, the addition of vitamin D did not affect the activity of any of the constructs shown in Fig. 2C (data not shown). The half VDRE in the AV element appears insufficient to confer vitamin D response to the constructs that contain AV2(AV2/TATA, AV2-OSE12/TATA, AV2-OSE22/TATA, and AV2-OSE22-OSE12/TATA). Vitamin D may not be involved in the regulation of the cis-elements. Vitamin D is implicated as a protective factor against prostate cancer development and progression. Studies have indicated that there may be a local deficiency of the growth inhibitory vitamin D in prostate cancer patients (28Hsu J.Y. Feldman D. McNeal J.E. Peehl D.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2852-2856PubMed Google Scholar, 29Corder E.H. Guess H.A. Hulka B.S. Friedman G.D. Sadler M. Vollmer R.T. Lobaugh B. Drezner M.K. Bogelman J.H. Orentreich N. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1993; 2: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in increased proliferation, de-differentiation, and invasion of the cancer cells. Since the physiological level of vitamin D is uncertain in prostate cancer patients, the following sections focus on identifying transcription factors that regulate basal hOC promoter. Even though OSE2 in mOC promoter was shown to associate with the osteoblast-specific factor, Runx2 (13Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the same transcription factor binds to the OSE2 on hOC promoter in PC3 cells. To address this question, we first determined the expression of Runx2 in PC3 cells by both RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis.Runx2 mRNA was expressed in all the OC-positive cell lines tested both in the presence and absence of vitamin D3, with PC3 having the highest level of expression (Fig.3A). Vitamin D3does not seem to regulate the mRNA level of runx2. On the protein level, Runx2 is highly expressed only in the OC-positive PC3 cells, but was not detected in the OC-negative LNCaP cells (Fig.3B). Although the OSE2 site was not necessary for transcriptional activation of hOC promoter, its binding factor Runx2 was expressed at a high level in PC3 cells. To determine whether Runx2 in PC3 cells was capable of binding DNA, we compared EMSA profiles between PC3 and LNCaP nuclear extracts (Fig. 3C). PC3 nuclear extracts gave a specific DNA-protein complex (lane 7) that could only be competed away by a specific competitor, OSE2 (lane 8), but not by a nonspecific competitor, ARE-III (lane 9). With LNCaP nuclear extracts, no specific DNA-protein complex was observed (lanes 2–4). By adding Runx2 antibody or control AR antibody to the EMSA reactions, we observed that, as expected, the protein factor that associates with OSE2 in PC3 cells is indeed Runx2. In lanes 10 and 11, Runx2, but not AR antibody, could supershift the DNA-protein complex, suggesting that transcriptionally active Runx2 may play a significant role in the regulation of hOC promoter activity in PC3 cells as these cells acquire AI and skeletal metastatic potentials. Different AP-1-binding proteins are known to operate at the AP-1/VDRE (AV) site in the rOC promoter during different stages of osteoblast development. In proliferating osteoblasts, c-Fos and c-Jun are involved in phenotypic suppression of the OC promoter while in the post-proliferate stage, JunD and Fra-2 are responsible for enhancing the expression of OC (30McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4398-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Fig.4A shows that the hOC AV was occupied by AP-1 protein factors and not by VDR, because the VDRE consensus site could not compete away the protein-DNA complex observed (lanes 5, 10, and 15) while AP-1 competitor could successfully compete away the complex (lanes 4, 9, and14). Furthermore, we noticed that LNCaP nuclear extract yielded a lower level of the specific protein-DNA complex than the OC-positive PC3 and MG63. This result is further confirmed at the transcriptional level, where AV2/TATA showed lower activity in LNCaP than in PC3 cells (Fig. 4B). We then defined the AP-1 protein factors that regulate AP-1/VDRE in hOC promoter by using various AP-1 antibodies in EMSA (Fig.4C). Neither c-Fos nor c-Jun antibodies could supershift the DNA-protein complex observed (data not shown); however, with JunD antibody, the DNA-protein complex was clearly supershifted, while Fra-2 antibody acted more like a blocking antibody which prevented the protein-DNA complex formation and diminished the intensity of the original band. Furthermore, neither the control AR antibody nor VDR antibody could affect the complex. This confirms our previous observation that VDR does not associate with the AV site at the hOC promoter in the absence of vitamin D3 stimulation. We also demonstrated that there was less Fra-2 protein, but not less JunD (Fig.4D) in the nuclear extracts of LNCaP compared with MG63 or PC3 cells. Therefore,"

A toxic gain-in-function of SOD1 mutants (i.e. increased peroxidase activity, nitration or aggregation) was proposed to be responsible for the enhanced toxicity of SOD1 (1Lyons T.J. Liu H. Goto J.J.

Neurol. 1996; 39: 147-157Google Scholar). The mechanism of pathogenesis of diseases in which SOD1 is overexpressed also remains unknown (6Amstad P. Peskin A. Shah G. Mirault M.E. Moret R. Zbinden I. Cerutti P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9305-9313Google Scholar, 7Groner Y. Elroy-Stein O. Avraham K.B. Schickler M. Knobler H. Minc-Golomb D. Bar-Peled O. Yarom R. Rotshenker S. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 231-240Google Scholar). Thus, a thorough understanding of the basic mechanism underlying these processes (SOD1- or SOD1 mutant-dependent peroxidase activity, nitration, or aggregation) is critical for discovering new therapies. The first evidence for increased peroxidase activity of FALS SOD1 mutants came from the use of electron spin resonance (ESR)-spin trapping (8Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Google Scholar). By monitoring the oxidation of the spin trap 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) to its hydroxyl adduct (DMPO-OH), the investigators concluded that FALS SOD1 mutants exhibit an increased peroxidase activity (8Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the bicarbonate anion (HCO 3−) is required for the peroxidase activity of SOD1 and FALS SOD1 mutants (9Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Google Scholar,10Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Google Scholar). Three decades ago, Hodgson and Fridovich (11Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Google Scholar, 12Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Google Scholar) proposed that a “copper-bound hydroxyl radical” (SOD-Cu2+-⋅OH) generated in the reaction between SOD1 and H2O2was able to oxidize several anionic ligands (11Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Google Scholar, 12Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of SOD1 indicates that access to the active site of copper is via a narrow channel that restricts the entry of a large molecule. However, a relatively small and physiologically relevant anion such as HCO 3− could reach the active site of SOD1 and subsequently undergo oxidation to CO⨪3, a diffusible oxidant that could leave the active site and cause oxidation of various substrates in free solution (9Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Google Scholar, 10Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Google Scholar, 13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar). This model has provided a new perspective on the peroxidative mechanism of SOD1 and explains in part the published discrepancies on the nature and structure of oxidants determined by ESR spin trapping (14Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Google Scholar, 15Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Google Scholar, 16Sankarapandi S. Zweier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Google Scholar). Bicarbonate-stimulated peroxidase activity of SOD1 has now been validated by several different approaches (9Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Google Scholar, 10Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Google Scholar, 13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar). For example, bicarbonate is required for SOD1 peroxidase-catalyzed hydroxylation of DMPO to DMPO-OH, oxidation and nitration of tyrosine to dityrosine and nitrotyrosine, and oxidation of ABTS to the ABTS cation radical. Azulenyl nitrone was converted to an aldehyde in the spinal cords of transgenic mice with SODG93A mutant (17Gurney M.E. Lui R. Althaus J.S. Hall E.D. Becker D.A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 587-597Google Scholar, 18Liu R. Althaus J.S. Ellerbrock B.R. Becker D.A. Gurney M.E. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 763-770Google Scholar). Aldehyde formation was attributed to trapping of SOD1 peroxidase-generated hydroxyl or peroxyl radicals by the azulenyl nitrone (18Liu R. Althaus J.S. Ellerbrock B.R. Becker D.A. Gurney M.E. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 763-770Google Scholar). This was the first in vivo spin-trapping evidence of SOD1 peroxidase activity. The biological relevance of SOD1 peroxidase activity has recently been questioned because of the requirement of a high H2O2 concentration needed to catalyze SOD1 peroxidase-dependent oxidations (19Sampson J.B. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 8-13Google Scholar). We have previously reported that bicarbonate-dependent SOD1 peroxidase activity could be monitored using the DCFH fluorescence method (20Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Gurney M. Zhang H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 127Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended the scope of our preliminary report (20Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Gurney M. Zhang H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 127Google Scholar). We show that the bicarbonate-dependent SOD1 peroxidase activity at a lower H2O2concentration can be conveniently measured by monitoring oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) to dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The extent of DCFH oxidation was greatly amplified by aromatic amino acids and a tyrosine-containing peptide. We also show that SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−-dependent oxidation can be mimicked by photolysis of an inorganic colbalt carbonato complex that generates CO⨪3. Metalloporphyrin antioxidants (e.g. Fe(III)TBAP, Mn(III)TBAP) scavenged the CO⨪3 radical to yield the respective oxo-tetravalent iron or manganese species. These oxidants reacted with cyclic nitrone spin traps to form a characteristic ESR-active oxidation product. Thus, it may now be feasible to distinguish between the hydroxyl radical and carbonate anion radical formation in HCO 3−-dependent SOD1 peroxidase and peroxynitrite/CO2 systems. Tryptophan, tyrosine, hydrogen peroxide, and angiotensin were purchased from Sigma, and dichlorodihydrofluorescein was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Bovine Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. The other chemicals used were from Aldrich. Pentammine carbonato complex of Co(III) was synthesized according to the published procedure (21Basolo F. Murmann R.K. Inorg. Syn. 1953; 4: 171-172Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O in 15 ml of water was added to 45 g of ammonium carbonate dissolved in 45 ml of water, followed by the addition of 75 ml of concentrated ammonia. Air was bubbled through the solution for 24 h. The resulting solution was cooled in an ice bath, and the solid product was recrystallized by dissolving in 55 ml of water at 90 °C and then slowly cooling the solution in an ice bath. Pure crystals were isolated and used in the experiments. DCFH diacetate was hydrolyzed freshly for every experiment according to the published procedure (22Ischiropoulos H. Gow A. Thom S.R. Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 367-373Google Scholar). Briefly, DCFH was dissolved in methanol and hydrolyzed by NaOH (0.01 m) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature and stored in an ice bath during the experiment. SOD1 peroxidase activity was measured as follows. SOD1 (1 mg/ml) was mixed with a solution of DCFH (40–80 μm) in a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) and various amounts of sodium bicarbonate (0–25 mm). The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2, and DCF formation was monitored at 504 nm. For experiments using low concentrations of H2O2 (1–10 μm), DCF formation was measured fluorometrically (excitation = 495 nm, emission = 520 nm). Transgenic mice at different ages (60 and 90 days) were sacrificed, and spinal cords isolated from brain were homogenized in 0.4 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 m) containing DTPA (100 μm). Following centrifugation of homogenates at 8000 rpm for 20 min, supernatants were removed and kept in an ice-bath for SOD1 peroxidase activity assays. A 20 μl of homogenate was incubated with H2O2 (3 mm) and DCFH (80 μm) in a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the formation of DCF was measured at excitation = 495 nm and emission = 520 nm. The protein concentration was determined by Lowry's method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A typical reaction mixture (∼100 μl) for ESR experiments consisted of SOD (1 mg/ml), DMPO (25 mm), H2O2 (1 mm), and bicarbonate (25 mm) in a phosphate buffer (0.1m) containing DTPA (100 μm). ESR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Varian E-109 spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz and with a 100-kHz field modulation equipped with a TE102 cavity. The addition of SOD1 (1 mg/ml) to an incubation mixture containing DCFH (40 μm), H2O2 (1 mm), and DTPA (100 μm) in a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing bicarbonate (25 mm) caused a time-dependent increase in DCF absorbance at 504 nm (Fig.1A). Fig. 1A(inset) shows the time-dependent increase in the absorbance of DCF as a function of HCO 3− concentration. Fig. 1Bshows the H2O2 dependence of SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−-mediated oxidation of DCFH to DCF. As seen in Fig. 1B, bicarbonate-mediated SOD1 peroxidase activity can be easily measured at low H2O2 concentration (∼1 μm). Admittedly, the rate of reactions catalyzed by HCO 3−-dependent SOD1 peroxidase activity is relatively slow; however, the ability to “export” a potent and diffusible oxidant (i.e.CO⨪3) from the active site of SOD1 to initiate the oxidation of amino acids in peptides is unique for this peroxidase system (9Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Google Scholar,13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar). Bicarbonate (25 mm) did not have any effect on oxidation of DCFH (40 μm) to DCF catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (0.1 units) and H2O2 (3 mm) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA (not shown). No significant oxidation of DCFH was detected in the presence of Cu2+ (20 μm) and H2O2 (3 mm) in a phosphate buffer containing DTPA (100 μm) (not shown). These results suggest that the oxidant responsible for oxidation of DCFH in the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system is not derived from “free” copper ions released from the active site of SOD1. The addition of tyrosine, tryptophan, or angiotensin II (a peptide containing tyrosine) greatly increased the oxidation rate of DCFH to DCF (Fig. 2). Tryptophan (100 μm) and tyrosine (1 mm) increased SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−-dependent oxidation of DCFH to DCF by 4-fold (Fig. 2, A andB). Fig. 2D shows that both tryptophan and tyrosine increased SOD1G93A/H2O2/HCO 3−-dependent DCFH oxidation. Results from these studies indicate that bicarbonate is essential for the SOD1 peroxidase activity and that aromatic amino acids (tyrosine and tryptophan) and peptides containing these amino acids exacerbate HCO 3−-mediated DCFH oxidation by SOD1 and H2O2. The addition of H2O2 (1 mm) to an incubation mixture containing SOD1 (1 mg/ml), DMPO (25 mm), and DTPA (100 μm) did not yield a significant amount of DMPO adduct in the absence of bicarbonate (Fig.3, left). In the presence of 25 mm HCO 3−, an intense signal (marked ○) was obtained because of the DMPO-OH (αN = 14.9 G, αH = 14.9 G). Previously, using oxygen-17-labeled water, formation of this adduct was attributed to a direct reaction between CO⨪3 and DMPO, leading to an intermediate that underwent hydrolysis (15Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Google Scholar). The addition of the azide anion resulted in the formation of the DMPO-azide adduct (DMPO-N 3−) spectrum (αN = 14.7 G, αH = 14.7 G, αNβ = 3.1 G) (marked ●) (Fig. 3,left) (23Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Google Scholar). The appearance of a small DMPO-N 3− signal in the absence of HCO 3− was attributed to the direct oxidation of N 3− by the copper-bound hydroxyl radical at the active site of SOD1 (11Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Google Scholar, 12Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Google Scholar). A bicarbonate-mediated increase in the DMPO-N 3− signal is due to the oxidation of azide anion to the azide radical by CO⨪3 (24Huie R.E. Clifton C.L. Neta P. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1991; 38: 477-481Google Scholar) and subsequent trapping of azide radical by DMPO. In the presence of formate, the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system yielded the ESR spectrum (αN = 15.6 G, αH = 18.7 G) (marked ■) due to the DMPO-CO 2− adduct (25Popp J.L. Kalyanaraman B. Kirk T.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10475-10480Google Scholar). The formate radical anion (CO⨪2) is presumably formed from oxidation of HCO 2− by CO⨪3 (26Behar D. Czapski G. Duchovny I. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 74: 2206-2210Google Scholar). Residual formation of DMPO-CO 2− in the absence of HCO 3− results from oxidation of formate at the active site of SOD1. In the presence of ethanol, the ESR spectrum (αN = 15.8 G, αH = 22.8 G) due to the DMPO-ethanol adduct (marked ▪) was detected from incubations containing SOD1, H2O2, bicarbonate anion, and DMPO (27Feix J.B. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 43-51Google Scholar). The formation of an ethanol-derived carbon-centered radical is presumably due to the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from ethanol by CO⨪3 (28Chen S.N. Hoffman M.Z. Radiat. Res. 1973; 56: 40-47Google Scholar, 29Redpath J.L. Willson R.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1973; 23: 51-65Google Scholar). Independent evidence for the intermediacy of CO⨪3 was obtained from photolysis studies using the pentammine carbonato complex of Co(III) (Fig. 3, right). The UV photolysis of this cobalt complex has been shown to generate the authentic CO⨪3 radical (30Copes V.W. Chen S.N. Hoffman M.Z. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 3116-3121Google Scholar) that reacted with substrates (e.g. azide, formate, and ethanol) to yield the same type of radical adducts as detected in the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system. In the absence of UV light, no radical adducts were detected. Fig. 4A(middle) shows the bicarbonate-dependent oxidation of azulenyl nitrone in incubations containing SOD1, H2O2, and DTPA. In the absence of bicarbonate, oxidation of azulenyl nitrone (AZN) to azulenyl aldehyde (AZA) was negligible in phosphate buffers containing SOD1, H2O2, and DTPA (Fig. 4A,left). Bicarbonate alone did not facilitate the oxidation of AZN to AZA (not shown). AZN and AZA exhibit a characteristic optical spectral pattern (Fig. 4A, right). Fig. 4,B and C, shows that a bis-nitrone also undergoes the bicarbonate-dependent oxidation to form a bis-aldehyde. Photolysis of solutions containing a pentammine carbonato complex of Co(III) (that generates the carbonate radical anion) and AZN yielded AZA. AZA formation was not detectable in the absence of the pentammine carbonato complex of Co(III) (not shown). Based on these results, we suggest that CO⨪3 is responsible for SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−-mediated oxidation of AZN to AZA and bis-nitrone to bis-aldehyde. The bicarbonate-dependent peroxidase activity of SOD1 was evaluated from spinal cord extracts of SOD1 transgenic and SOD1G93A transgenic mice. A significant increase in the oxidation of DCFH to DCF was observed in spinal cord extracts from SOD1G93A transgenic mice (Fig.5). Bicarbonate-mediated SOD1-peroxidase activity was the highest in the spinal cord extracts of 90-day old mice. In all age groups, the SOD1 peroxidase activity was clearly enhanced in the presence of bicarbonate. The SOD1G93A mice spinal cord extracts also exhibited a significant increase in bicarbonate-dependent peroxidase activity (Fig. 5). Even in the absence of added bicarbonate, the spinal cord extracts of 90-day old wild type and SODG93A transgenic mice exhibited a slight increase in the peroxidase activity (Fig. 5). This could be due to the residual bicarbonate content in spinal cord extracts. As reported by Liu et al. (18Liu R. Althaus J.S. Ellerbrock B.R. Becker D.A. Gurney M.E. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 763-770Google Scholar), the two transgenic lines, SOD1-G93A and SOD1, had comparable elevation of total Cu,Zn-SOD protein and activity in spinal cord at 60 and 90 days of age. This suggests that the increased peroxidase activity of the SOD1-G93A mutant form is due to the altered enzymatic function in the mutant form. The metalloporphyrins MnTBAP and FeTBAP were reported to inhibit the progression of disease in an ALS mouse model (31Crow, J. (2001) Abstracts Published in the Third International Conference on Peroxynitrite and Reactive Nitrogen Species, May 26–31, in Asilamore, CAGoogle Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate the effect of metalloporphyrins in radical reactions catalyzed by SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system. As shown in Fig. 6A, the addition of SOD1 to incubations containing H2O2, HCO 3−, and DMPO yielded the DMPO-OH adduct. In the presence of MnTBAP, the four-line ESR spectrum of DMPO-OH was replaced by a narrow nine-line spectrum (αN = 7.1 G, αH(2) = 4.2 G) that is assigned to the oxidation product, DMPO-X, in which the free electron is interacting with a nitrogen and two equivalent protons (Fig. 6A) (32Floyd R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 1209-1215Google Scholar). In the absence of HCO 3−, no ESR signal was obtained. Again, in the presence of FeTBAP, the DMPO-X spectrum was obtained from incubations containing SOD1, H2O2, HCO 3− and DMPO (Fig. 6). These findings (Fig. 6) suggest that HCO 3−-derived radical (i.e., CO⨪3) reacted with MnTBAP or FeTBAP and DMPO to form the DMPO-X. We propose that the putative oxidant formed from the reaction between Mn(III)TBAP and CO⨪3 is Mn(IV)=O. Additional proof for this reaction mechanism was obtained from the UV photolysis of a cobalt carbonato complex and MnTBAP. In the presence of MnTBAP, the ESR spectrum due to the DMPO-OH was replaced by that of the oxidation product, DMPO-X (Fig. 6B). That a higher oxidant, Mn(IV)=O, is involved in the oxidation of DMPO to DMPO-X became evident from experiments using the oxidant KSO5 and MnTBAP. When SO 5− was mixed with MnTBAP, we observed a characteristic optical spectrum of Mn(IV) complex (data not shown). The addition of DMPO to a solution containing KSO5 and MnTBAP yielded the characteristic ESR of the DMPO-X adduct (Fig.6C). In the absence of SO 5−or MnTBAP, no ESR signal was detected. Next, we showed that the hydroxyl radicals generated from the Fenton reaction (Fe2+and H2O2) did not yield the DMPO-X spectrum (Fig. 6D) in the presence of MnTBAP, suggesting that the intermediate formed from the reaction of ⋅OH or CO⨪3with MnTBAP may be different. However, FeTBAP reacted with ⋅OH to form an iron-oxo intermediate, which oxidized DMPO to DMPO-X (Fig.6D). Results from these experiments indicated that MnTBAP is an effective scavenger of CO⨪3. (The rate constant between CO⨪3 and MnTBAP is estimated to be at least 100 times greater than that of CO⨪3 and DMPO.) Results also indicate that “free” hydroxyl radicals are not formed in the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system. The enhanced peroxidase activity of the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system has been attributed to the formation of a diffusible oxidant, carbonate radical anion (CO⨪3) formed from a one-electron oxidation of HCO 3− at the active site of SOD1 by a copper-bound hydroxyl radical (i.e.SOD-Cu2+-⋅OH). It was proposed that CO⨪3could diffuse out the active site and cause oxidation of substrates in solution (11Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Google Scholar, 12Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Google Scholar, 13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar, 14Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Google Scholar). We suggest that CO⨪3 is responsible for oxidation of DCFH to DCF via a hydrogen abstraction reaction as follows.CO⨪3+DCFH→DCF⋅+HCO3−2DCF⋅→DCF+DCFHREACTIONS1AND2Tyrosine, tryptophan, and angiotensin II enhanced the oxidation of DCFH by SOD1/H2O2 in the presence of bicarbonate (Fig. 2). CO⨪3 has been shown to react rapidly with tyrosine and tryptophan (k = 107 to 108m−1 s−1) forming the corresponding tyrosyl or tryptophanyl radical (28Chen S.N. Hoffman M.Z. Radiat. Res. 1973; 56: 40-47Google Scholar, 29Redpath J.L. Willson R.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1973; 23: 51-65Google Scholar). These phenoxyl radicals will probably react with DCFH and enhance DCF formation as shown below.CO⨪3+Tyr or Trp→HCO3−+Tyr⋅or Trp⋅Tyr⋅or Trp⋅+DCFH→DCF⋅→→DCFREACTIONS3AND4Dichlorodihydrofluorescein-derived radical, DCF⋅, has also been reported to undergo autoxidation in air forming DCF and the superoxide anion (33Rota C. Fann Y.C. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28161-28168Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that human neuroblastoma cells transfected with SOD1G93A mutant could oxidize DCFH to a much greater extent than cells transfected with wild-type SOD1 (34De Ciriolo M.R. Martino A. Lafavia E. Rossi L. Carri M.T. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5065-5072Google Scholar). The increased oxidation of DCFH to DCF was suggested to be due to an increased peroxidase activity of G93A enzyme (34De Ciriolo M.R. Martino A. Lafavia E. Rossi L. Carri M.T. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5065-5072Google Scholar). The present data clearly show that HCO 3− markedly enhanced the peroxidase activity of SOD1/H2O2 (Fig. 1). Thus, the intracellular HCO 3− in SOD1G93A transfected cells might have been responsible for the increased oxidation of DCFH. The electron transfer reaction between CO⨪3 and azide, formate, and nitrite anion will result in the formation of the respective ligand radical anion. In accord, radical adducts formed from trapping of these radicals by DMPO were detected in the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system (Fig. 3). Independent evidence for CO⨪3-mediated oxidation reactions was obtained from UV photolysis of the pentammine carbonato complex of Co(III) as shown below. Irradiation of the pentammine carbonato complex of Co(III) in the presence of DMPO and azide, formate, or DCFH gave rise to radical adducts (Fig. 3, left) that were similar to those obtained from SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system (Fig. 3, right). Recently, Gurney, Becker, and co-workers (17Gurney M.E. Lui R. Althaus J.S. Hall E.D. Becker D.A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 587-597Google Scholar, 18Liu R. Althaus J.S. Ellerbrock B.R. Becker D.A. Gurney M.E. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 763-770Google Scholar) provided the first in vivo spin-trapping evidence for increased oxygen radical formation in the SOD1G93A transgenic mouse model of FALS. When AZN was administered to the nontransgenic, wild-type transgenic, and mutant transgenic mice of different ages (30, 60, and 90 days), increased levels of AZA (the oxidative metabolite of AZN) were detected in spinal cord extracts of mutant mice than in transgenic wild-type and nontransgenic mice. The open-chain nitrones such as α-phenyltert-butyl N-nitrone (PBN) were oxidized by SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−, forming the corresponding hydroxyl adduct; however, the PBN-hydroxyl adduct (PBN-OH) underwent further decomposition to form the N-tert-butyl hydronitroxide (not shown) (35Kotake Y. Janzen E.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9503-9506Google Scholar). In addition, using the oxygen-17-labeled water, the source of the oxygen atom in PBN-OH was shown to be derived from water (not shown) (36Mottley C. Connor H.D. Mason R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 622-628Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we propose that the bicarbonate-derived radical (i.e. CO⨪3) is responsible for oxidation of AZN to its cation radical, which is then hydrolyzed to give AZA (SchemeFS1). Direct ESR detection of the CO⨪3 radical in the biological system has been difficult due to the extremely short half-life of this species (∼5–8 ms) at physiological pH values. Using the rapid mixing continuous flow ESR, the CO⨪3intermediate formed from concentrated solutions of peroxynitrite and bicarbonate has been detected (37Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Ferreira A.M. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Google Scholar). However, using this technique, we were unable to detect CO⨪3 produced during HCO 3−-dependent peroxidase activity of SOD1. 2O. Augusto, B. Kalyanaraman, and R. P. Mason, unpublished observations. Clearly, this is due to a much slower rate of formation of CO⨪3 in this system. Recently, we proposed that CO⨪3 formed from one-electron oxidation of HCO 3− at the active site of SOD1 could diffuse out of the active site and cause oxidation/hydroxylation of DMPO to an ESR active DMPO-OH adduct (13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar). In order to prove that the DMPO-OH adduct was not formed from trapping of hydroxyl radicals by DMPO, we used the oxygen-17-labeled water and determined that the oxygen atom in DMPO-OH adduct originated from H2O and not from H2O2 (13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar). Despite these reports (9Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Google Scholar, 13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar), investigators continue to attribute the formation of DMPO-OH in SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system to trapping of free hydroxyl radicals (38Kang J.H. Eum W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1524: 162-170Google Scholar). Most conventional hydroxyl radical scavengers (e.g. azide anion, ethanol, formate, etc.) react with ⋅OH or CO⨪3 and DMPO to form the same radical adduct. In this regard, the use of MnTBAP may be able to distinguish spectroscopically the intermediacy of CO⨪3 and⋅OH radicals. As shown in this study, MnTBAP oxidizes DMPO to a characteristic DMPO-X product in the presence of CO⨪3 but not of ⋅OH. We propose the following mechanism (SchemeFS2) for oxidation of DMPO to DMPO-X. The authentic Mn(IV)=O species (λ = 425 nm) formed from the reaction between MnTBAP and potassium peroxymonosulfate (KSO5) reacted with DMPO to form MnTBAP (not shown) and DMPO-X. Photolysis of a mixture containing MnTBAP and the cobalt pentammine carbonato complex produced the same characteristic optical changes associated with the formation of Mn(IV)=O (not shown). In vitro evidence suggests that peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of SOD1 and ALS-linked SOD1 mutants may cause an enhanced neuronal cell death in ALS (4Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Google Scholar), although the in vivorelevance of this hypothesis is debatable (39Williamson T.L. Corson L.B. Huang L. Burlingame A. Liu J. Bruijn L.I. Cleveland D.W. Science. 2000; 288: 399Google Scholar, 40Beckman J.S. Science. 2000; 288: 399Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is now increasingly clear that nitration/oxidation reactions mediated by peroxynitrite are modulated by CO2 (13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar, 41Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Google Scholar), a ubiquitous cellular component. As shown in Scheme FS3, the CO⨪3 radical plays a key role in determining the tyrosine oxidation/nitration product yields (42Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 335-343Google Scholar). Metalloporphyrins (i.e. manganese(III) porphyrin analogs) have been reported to react with both peroxynitrite and the nitrosoperoxocarboxylate intermediate (43Lee J.B. Hunt J.A. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6053-6061Google Scholar, 44Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that CO⨪3 is involved in both nitration and oxidation of tyrosine (13Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Google Scholar). Clearly, metalloporphyrin antioxidants that can scavenge the carbonate anion radical will inhibit both oxidation and nitration of tyrosine. The cytoprotective effect of iron metalloporphyrin catalysts against cytokine and endotoxin-mediated cellular damage may be attributed to the rapid scavenging of CO⨪3 by iron-porphyrins (45Misko T.P. Highkin M.K. Veenhuizen A.W. Manning P.T. Stern M.K. Currie M.G. Salvemini D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15646-15653Google Scholar). The ability of CO⨪3 to induce aggregation, nitration, and oxidation reactions in SOD1 suggests that there may be a common radical-mediated mechanism that is operative in aggregation as well as nitration/oxidation reactions catalyzed by SOD1. By scavenging CO⨪3, metalloporphyrin antioxidants might inhibit aggregation, oxidation, and nitration of SOD1. Metalloporphyrin antioxidants (e.g. MnTBAP and FeTBAP) effectively scavenged the carbonate anion radical to form a characteristic ESR-active oxidation product in the presence of cyclic nitrone spin traps. The use of MnTBAP thus confirmed our original tenet that the SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−system generated the CO⨪3 radical and not the hydroxyl radical. The reasons for increased peroxidase activity in the spinal cord extracts of SOD1G93A are not immediately obvious. Liochevet al. (46Liochev S.I. Chen L.L. Hallewell R.A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 15: 237-239Google Scholar) reported that the rates of inactivation of SOD1A4V, SOD1G93A, and wild-type SOD1 in the presence of H2O2 are similar. Thus, additional factors that enhance SOD1/H2O2/HCO 3−-dependent oxidations should be considered. It is likely that bicarbonate exacerbates the intrinsic difference between wild-type and mutant SOD1 with respect to peroxidase activity. Preliminary ongoing research from our laboratory indicates that bicarbonate-mediated peroxidase activity enhances SOD1 dimerization and aggregation that is inhibited by MnTBAP and nitrone spin traps. These findings suggest that CO⨪3 may be involved in SOD1 aggregation. In conclusion, we showed that bicarbonate dramatically enhanced DCFH oxidation to DCF in the SOD1/H2O2/DCFH system. Peroxidase activity could be measured even at 1 μmH2O2 in this system. We suggest that DCFH oxidation to DCF is a sensitive method for measuring the peroxidase activity of SOD1 and FALS SOD1 mutants and that bicarbonate-derived radical (CO⨪3) is responsible for oxidation of DCFH to DCF (20Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Gurney M. Zhang H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 127Google Scholar,47Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35253-35257Google Scholar). This mechanism also accounts for oxidation/hydroxylation of antioxidant nitrones in ALS animal models. The scavenging of CO⨪3 by metalloporphyrin antioxidant mimetics (i.e.MnTBAP and FeTBAP) may be an important mechanism by which these compounds afford cytoprotection in cytokine-mediated cellular damage."
https://openalex.org/W2019850601,"Control of neuronal gene expression by drugs or neurotransmitters is a critical step in long-term neural plasticity. Here, we show that a gene induced in the striatum by cocaine or direct dopamine stimulation, ania-6, is a member of a novel family of cyclins with homology to cyclins K/T/H/C. Further, different types of neurotransmitter stimulation cause selective induction of distinct ania-6 isoforms, through alternative splicing. The longer Ania-6 protein colocalizes with nuclear speckles and is associated with key elements of the RNA elongation/processing complex, including the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, the splicing factor SC-35, and the p110 PITSLRE cyclin-dependent kinase. Distinct types of neuronal stimulation may therefore differentially modulate nuclear RNA processing, through altered transcription and splicing of ania-6."

Splicing takes place in a large protein·RNA complex known as the spliceosome, which includes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs)1 U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5, together with a large number of non-snRNP protein factors. The snRNPs and non-snRNP factors are involved in forming sophisticated protein-protein and protein-RNA contacts within the spliceosome for the catalytic activity (reviewed in Refs. 1Kramer A. Annu.

Many non-snRNP factors have been described, but the best characterized of these are the serine/arginine-rich protein (SR protein) family (reviewed in Refs.4Fu X.-D.

SR proteins contain either one or two N-terminal RNA-recognition motifs and a C-terminal RS domain of varying length rich in arginine (R)/serine (S) dipeptides. The prototype for this family, SF2/ASF, was initially purified and cloned by two groups using in vitrosplicing to look for factors involved in constitutive splicing and the regulation of alternative splicing, (7Krainer A.R.

A class of related RS domain-containing proteins has recently been described; however, their characters and functions are poorly understood (reviewed in Refs. 4Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar and 18Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). SR proteins have been shown to play a role in constitutive and alternative splicing reactions using both in vitro andin vivo systems. The precise mechanisms whereby the SR proteins mediate these effects have been the subject of much research and appear highly complex and multifactorial (reviewed in Ref. 18Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In this respect, SR proteins have been demonstrated to bind exonic and intronic enhancer sequences to form the early E or commitment complex. SR proteins facilitate the recruitment of U1-snRNP to the 5′ splice site (19Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia B.M. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and of U2AF65/35 to the 3′ site through RS domain-RS domain interactions (20Staknis D. Reed R. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In addition to these effects, SR proteins have also been shown to act at later stages of splicing by recruiting the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP complex and may also participate in the second step of splicing (23Roscigno R.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA. 1995; 1: 692-706PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tarn W.Y. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2504-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Chew S.L.

Conway G.C. Kozak D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), authentic members of the SR protein family have been identified by their ability individually to complement splicing in an S100 extract deficient in SR proteins. Another early observation was that SR proteins tended to favor the utilization of proximal alternative 5′ splice sites (7Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8Ge H. Manley J.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 25-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, it is now well documented that individual SR proteins can show unique specificities in both constitutive and alternative splicingin vitro and in vivo (14Screaton G.R. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Bell M.V. Plebanski M. Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4336-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 27Mayeda A. Screaton G.R. Chandler S.D. Fu X.D. Krainer A.R. Mol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3596-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the fact that a single organism possesses multiple SR proteins and that sequences of individual proteins including the RS domains are highly conserved between different species. In addition, knockout or mutations of individual proteins have been shown to have deleterious effects. One such example is the deletion of SF2/ASF by homologous recombination in the chicken B cell line DT40. This led to cell cycle arrest and death and could be complemented by human SF2/ASF (31Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interestingly complementation with a number of mutant SR proteins, which show full activity in vitro, failed to rescue the knockout DT40 cell lines. Other SR protein knockout experiments have also shown deleterious phenotypes in mouse, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), although in the latter case there is functional redundancy of SR proteins other than the SF2/ASF orthologue (32Ring H.Z.

In this paper we report the characterization of two RNA-binding proteins of apparent molecular masses of ∼40 and ∼35 kDa, whose primary structures are significantly homologous to SC35. We demonstrate that these two proteins have properties that are quite distinctive from other well characterized authentic SR proteins. The expressed sequencing tag clones containing SRrp40 (accession number A167835) and SRrp35 (accession number AW270156) were obtained from the IMAGE consortium and fully sequenced. For expression of recombinant protein the DNA sequences encoding amino acids 3–263 of SRrp40 were subcloned into the BamHI site of baculovirus transfer vector pAcG2T (PharMingen) in frame with, and C-terminal to, GST. Recombinant baculovirus was produced by co-transfecting Sf9 cells with the SRrp40 transfer construct and BacPAK6 viral DNA (CLONTECH). Recombinant virus was plaque-purified, and a high titer virus stock was used to infect 1 liter of cells in serum-free media. Following lysis, SRrp40 was purified over glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST-tagged SF2/ASF and GST-tagged SC35 recombinant proteins expressed in baculovirus were prepared as described (30Chandler S.D. Mayeda A. Yeakley J.M. Krainer A.R. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3596-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For mammalian expression sequences encoding SRrp40 amino acids 3–262 and SRrp35 amino acids 3–261 were subcloned into the pCGNHCFFL (g10) plasmid (36Wilson A.C. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2445-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to form an N-terminal fusion with the 11-amino acid epitope tag (MASMTGGQQMG) from T7 phage gene 10 protein. Multiple human tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with 32P-labeled random hexamer DNA encompassing the SRrp40 coding region. The chimeric protein constructs were made by fusing DNA sequences encoding RRM and the RS domains of the indicated proteins. Amino acid sequences used in these fusion proteins were SRrp40 RRM amino acids 3–119, SC35 RRM amino acids 1–115, SRrp40 RS amino acids 119–262, SRrp35 RS amino acids 114–261, and SC35 RS amino acids 116–221. These sequences were used to construct four chimeric proteins; SC35RRM/SRrp40RS, SRrp40RRM/SC35RS, SRrp40RRM/SRrp35RS, and SC35RRM/SRrp35RS amino acids 108–119 have been deleted in the construct SRrp40ΔYRD. To ascertain molecular masses of the new proteins, lysates of HeLa cells transfected with epitope-tagged proteins by Western blot were probed with anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and revealed by chemiluminescense (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were grown to 50% confluency in 6-well plates and then incubated with 3 μg of SR protein-encoding plasmid and 1 μg of adenovirus E1A reporter plasmid. The medium was changed after 6 h, and following 48 h of incubation total RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) and treated with RQ DNase I (Promega). The corresponding cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR (25–30 cycles) with oligo(dT) primer, Taq polymerase, and the adenovirus E1A primer pair (forward, ctcttgagtgccagcgagtagag; reverse, gtcttgcaggctccggttctgg). Amplified products were resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with a32P-5′end-labeled internal E1A primer (forward, gttttctcctccgagccgctccga) followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned by densitometry, and the relative amounts of 13, 12, and 9 S products were expressed as a ratio to each other. The details of these assays have been described before (37Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with 1 μmg of plasmid DNA per 60-mm dish of 60–75% confluent cells, in the presence of 20 μg of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) (38Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). For incubations of HeLa cells with transcriptional inhibitors, actinomycin D was used at 5 μg/ml, and cycloheximide was added at 20 μg/ml. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15–30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation for 10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100. The fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:1000 anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:200 fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel laboratories). For transient transfections involving interspecies heterokaryons, because of the need for higher transfection efficiency, HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation using 10 μg of plasmid DNA per 60-mm dish of 90% confluent cells in the presence of 15 μg of carrier DNA and seeded on coverslips, followed by co-incubation with an excess number of untransfected mouse NIH 3T3 cells for 3 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. The concentration of cycloheximide was then increased to 100 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min prior to fusion. Cell fusions were done with polyethylene glycol as described (39Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), and the heterokaryons were further incubated for 1 h in media containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide prior to fixation. Immunofluorescence with the anti-T7 monoclonal antibody was performed as described above, except that 0.5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was included to reveal murine versus human nuclei. Samples were observed on a Axioskop microscope (Zeiss), and images were acquired with a Photometrics CH250 cooled CCD camera using Smartcapture extensions (Digital Scientific) within Spectrum software (IP Lab). The immunofluorescence figures show representative data. Each experiment was reproduced in multiple independent transfections, and the cells shown are representative of the large effects observed under each set of conditions. Plasmids encoding βb−-globin (exons 1 and 2), HIV-tat (exons 2 and 3), and IgM (exons C3 and C4) mini-genes were used as templates for in vitro transcription as described previously (27Mayeda A. Screaton G.R. Chandler S.D. Fu X.D. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled pre-mRNA substrates were prepared by run-off in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase as described (40Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear and S100 extracts were prepared as described (41Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro splicing reactions were carried out in 25 μl with indicated volume of nuclear extract or S100 extract, indicated amounts of GST fusion proteins (GST-SRrp40, GST-SF2/ASF, and/or GST-SC35), and 20 fmol of32P-labeled pre-mRNA substrate, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 2 h as described (40Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). RNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5.5 (see Fig. 5) or 9% (see Fig.6A) polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel followed by autoradiography with an intensifying screen at −70 °C.Figure 6Splicing repression of SRrp40 is concentration-dependent, and SRrp40 blocks initial ATP-dependent splicing-complex formation.A, SRrp40 titration assay of in vitro splicing with β-globin pre-mRNA.

Aliquots (4 μl) of each splicing reaction were loaded directly on 1.5% (w/v) low melting agarose gel as described (42Das R. Reed R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with running buffer, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine (43Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The horizontal slab gel (14 × 14 cm) was run at 150 V for 3.5 h at room temperature. Gel was dried on nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by autoradiography with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. Screening of expressed sequencing tag data bases using known SR protein sequences revealed two highly related coding sequences. SRrp40 (SR-repressor protein of ∼40 kDa) was fully sequenced whereas the original expressed sequencing tag clone for SRrp35 (SR-repressor protein of ∼35 kDa) was probably alternatively spliced and lacked an initiation codon. An alternative of this sequence has since been deposited in the data base that contains a complete N terminus and initiation codon. The sequences of SRrp40 (262 amino acids) and SRrp35 (261 amino acids) are shown in Fig.1A, each protein possesses a single N-terminal RRM, and each protein has a predicted molecular mass of around 31 kDa. Overall the two proteins are 59% similar; however, sequence homology in the single RRM is very high (88% identity). An alignment of the single RRM with the canonical N-terminal RRM of 10 other SR proteins is shown in Fig. 1B. SRrp35 and SRrp40 both show the highest homology to SC35 (47/61 and 46/60% identity/similarity, respectively). SRrp40 is identical to TASR-2, which was cloned by yeast two-hybrid screen using TLS, a gene located on chromosome 16 that is the breakpoint for translocations to chromosomes 12 and 21, as a bait (44Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The main area of divergence between SRrp40 and SRrp35 is in the RS domains. Both domains are around 150 amino acids in length, which is longer than the RS domain of SC35 (110 amino acids). Despite this both proteins contain fewer SR/RS dipeptides than SC35, with 25, 17, and 27 for SRrp40, SRrp35, and SC35, respectively. Northern blotting analysis of SRrp40 shows that it is widely yet differentially expressed across a variety of human tissues with the highest expression in skeletal muscle, testis, thymus, and spleen (Fig.2A). The major isoform of SRrp40 migrates at about 3 kbp, whereas a higher 7.5-kbp species is seen in peripheral blood lymphocytes. SRrp35 seems more tightly controlled than SRrp40 and was only found in testis by Northern blot as a major 1.5-kbp species. Northern blotting of HeLa cell RNA showed expression of SRrp40 but not SRrp35 (data not shown). Tissue-specific or cell type-specific expression of these proteins is consistent with their potential role as the splicing regulator. The coding regions of SRrp40 and SRrp35 were cloned into the expression vector in frame with a T7 gene 10 antibody epitope tag, so that all constructs encoded proteins with the T7 epitope tag at their N termini (see “Experimental Procedures”), allowing detection of the exogenous proteins with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes this epitope (45Hanamura A. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar). We assayed the expression of these cDNAs by Western blotting analysis of whole-cell lysates in transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2B). SR proteins are known to run with higher apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE because of phosphorylation of the RS domain (45Hanamura A. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly although SRrp40 and SRrp35 differ by only a single amino acid in length they run differently, and we predict this is partially related to the reduced RS/SR content and hence the level of serine phosphorylation of SRrp35. We transiently overexpressed the T7 epitope-tagged SRrp40 in HeLa cells and observed the subcellular distribution and subnuclear localization of the tagged protein by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As expected SRrp40 is exclusively localized in the nucleoplasm and concentrated in the nuclear speckles in transfected cells (Fig.3A). Nuclear speckles are thought to represent storage or assembly sites for splicing components and contain SR proteins and many other splicing factors (see Refs. 46Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 47Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J.

Accumulation in the speckles seems to be driven by the RS domain in single domain SR proteins such as SRp20 and SC35, as well as other RS domain-containing proteins such as the Suppressor-of-White-Apricot andTransformer genes from D. melanogaster (47Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 50Li H. Bingham P.M.

A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the two RRM-containing SR proteins, such as SF2/ASF and SRp40, localization to the nuclear speckles is more complex being driven by the additive effects of the two RRMs and the RS domain, i.e.deletion of any one of these three domains reduces but does not abolish accumulation in the speckles. (47Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Next we assayed for nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. The transcriptional inhibition assay is based in the fact that many shuttling proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm when transcription is inhibited (52Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). SRrp40 appears to be a shuttling SR protein as cytoplasmic accumulation occurs upon actinomycin D treatment, whereas the control, SC35, does not shuttle (Fig. 3A 37). Cycloheximide is also used in these cultures to exclude new protein synthesis as a cause of the cytoplasmic accumulation. To confirm these results, we also performed a heterokaryon analysis (Fig. 3B). In this assay transiently transfected HeLa cells are fused to murine NIH 3T3 cells. The heterokaryons thus formed are stained for the transfected protein using the anti-g10 monoclonal antibody. Murine cells are then revealed using DAPI stain, which gives a more punctate staining on mouse compared with human nuclei. As shown in Fig. 3B, SRrp40 can be found in murine nuclei, implying that the protein has been exported from the HeLa nucleus to the cytoplasm and then imported back into the NIH 3T3 nucleus within a heterokaryon in the presence of cycloheximide. We conclude that SRrp40 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein. Our previous studies have shown that a subset of SR proteins such as SF2/ASF, 9G8, and SRp20 shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm whereas others such as SC35 and SRp40 do not (37Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Domain-swapped chimeric protein constructs have shown that this activity resides in the precise sequence of the RS domain and may be one of the evolutionary pressures causing the high degree of sequence conservation in individual SR proteins from a variety of species (37Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of SRrp40 and some SR proteins is not yet clear, but it is possible that these proteins may remain bound to the mRNA and play a role in mRNA export or provide some form of chaperone role in the cytoplasm. Modulation of alternative splice site selection can be tested in vivo by co-transfection of the expression vector encoding a protein of interest with an alternative spliced substrate reporter (38Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We assayed the effects of SRrp40 and SRrp35 on the splicing of an adenovirus E1A reporter substrate that contains three alternative 5′ splice sites. 48 h following transfection into HeLa cells, splicing of the E1A substrate was assayed by reverse transcription-PCR. Both SRrp40 and SRrp35 shift splicing of this substrate to the most distal 9 S 5′ splice site (Fig.4, lanes 4, 11, and12), and SRrp40 additionally represses the proximal 13 and 12 S 5′ splice sites, whereas SRrp35 affects these to a lesser degree. This is in contrast to the activities of SF2/ASF and SC35 (the closest homologue of SRrp40 and SRrp35), which shift splicing to the most proximal 13 S 5′ splice site (lanes 2 and 3). This alternative splicing modulation effect could result from repression of the activity of SR proteins, such as SF2/ASF and SC3"

Genetic mapping was used to localize the mutation to the gene encoding inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type I (Inpp4a), where a single nucleotide deletion results in a likely null allele. The substrates of INPP4A are intermediates in a pathway affecting intracellular Ca2+ release but are also involved in cell cycle regulation through binding the Akt protooncogene; dysfunction in either may account for the neuronal loss of weeble mice. Although other mutations in phosphoinositide enzymes are associated with synaptic defects without neuronal loss, weeble shows that Inpp4a is critical for the survival of a subset of neurons during postnatal development in mice."

When exposed to specific cytokines, hematopoietic progenitor cells divide to generate an amplified progeny and give rise to the various lineages (1Reddy G.P. Tiarks C.Y. Pang L. Wuu J. Hsieh C.C. Quesenberry P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2293-2299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several hematopoietic cytokines have been shown to be positive regulators of hematopoiesis. However, negative feedback is likely to be important in regulating signal transduction elicited by a large variety of extracellular signals. To this extent, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 proteins represent a family of feedback modulators of cytokine signal transduction that may play an important role in the regulation of normal hematopoiesis (2Begley C.G. Nicola N.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As in normal hematopoiesis, a hierarchy of events exists in leukemia hematopoiesis and it is assumed that leukemic cells descend from a very small pool of hematopoietic progenitors which are arrested at an immature stage of differentiation (4Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 281-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expected that cytokine-responsive genes, which are critical to the maturation in normal hematopoietic progenitors, are repressed in those cells undergoing leukemic transformation, because of transcription factors and co-factors involved in chromosomal abnormalities (5Ida K. Kitabayashi I. Taki T. Taniwaki M. Noro K. Yamamoto M. Ohki M. Hayashi Y. Blood. 1997; 90: 4699-4704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Look A.T. Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Conversely, such genes should be induced in leukemia cells treated with inducers, such as retinoic acid (RA), which force de novodifferentiation in leukemia cells. This should be the case in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, which, as a result of a specific t(15;17) translocation, express the oncogenic PML-RARα chimeric protein and can undergo complete remission in patients treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which induces differentiation of the leukemic cells in vivo (7Huang M.E.

Blood. 1990; 76: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are RA-dependent transcription factors (9Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar) involved in the control of hematopoietic cells differentiation (10Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,11Kastner P. Lawrence H.J. Waltzinger C. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Chan S. Blood. 2001; 97: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PML-RARα oncogenic effect is thought to involve transcriptional repression of RA target genes. In the presence of RA, PML-RARα activity is switched from repression to activation, acting as a RA-dependent enhancer factor (12Lin R.J. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that growth arrest and differentiation of APL cells by ATRA is triggered directly through a PML-RARα-dependent signaling pathway (12Lin R.J. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In an early response to ATRA, PML-RARα-expressing cells undergo two rounds of cell division before entering post-mitotic G1 phase of the cell cycle. Although post-mitotic G1 is a late event not crucially linked to the differentiation process, the G1 to S phase transition of the first cell cycle is required for the differentiation process to occur (13Casini T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, limitation in cell proliferative activity together with chromatin condensation represent a hallmark in commitment, an irreversible step committing hematopoietic cells to terminal differentiation (14Cole R.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well established that this process is enacted in RA-induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells (15Tsiftsoglou A.S. Wong W. Hyman R. Minden M. Robinson S.H. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2334-2339PubMed Google Scholar) and especially in APL, where ATRA induces growth arrest as well as chromatin condensation, which is characteristic of the emergence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (16Miyauchi J. Ohyashiki K. Inatomi Y. Toyama K. Blood. 1997; 90: 803-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify RA target genes, which are critical to the process of growth arrest and differentiation, we have used differential screening with the NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, which harbors the t(15;17) translocation encoding PML-RARα. These cells undergo granulocytic differentiation when treated with ATRA (17Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified and characterized the humanankyrin-repeat-containing protein with a SOCSbox-2 (ASB-2) cDNA as induced by ATRA in NB4 cells. The ASB-2 mRNA was highly expressed in bone marrow cells. In ATRA-treated NB4 cells, increased ASB-2 mRNA expression correlated with the onset of myeloid differentiation. We demonstrate that, in ATRA-treated U937 myeloid cells, an increase in ASB-2 mRNA expression was mediated through an exogenously expressed PML-RARα. Expression of an inducible exogenous ASB-2 in PLB-985 myeloid leukemia cells resulted in growth inhibition and chromatin condensation, which recapitulate early steps in induced differentiation of APL cells.

PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 and PLB-985/MT cell lines were used for induction of ASB-2 expression or as control respectively. For this, cells were cultured either with or without ZnSO4. U937-MT and U937-PR9 cells were generated by stable transfection of the zinc-inducible MTPR plasmid containing no cDNA and the PML-RARα cDNA, respectively (20Grignani F. Ferrucci P.F. Testa U.

These cells were preincubated with 100 μm ZnSO4 for 12 h and then treated with ATRA. To inhibit de novoprotein synthesis, NB4 and U937-PR9 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) and then incubated with or without ATRA. Cell viability was estimated using standard trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Differentiation was assessed by: (i) the percentage of cells with nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) (Sigma) and (ii) cell morphology under light microscopy on May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained cytospin slides. PML-RARα-expressing primary APL cells obtained from patients at Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France) were kindly provided by C. Chomienne. Cells were purified and cultivated with 10−7m ATRA as described (23Chomienne C. Ballerini P. Balitrand N. Daniel M.T. Fenaux P. Castaigne S. Degos L. Blood. 1990; 76: 1710-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA were purified through Nucleobond columns (Macherey-Nagel), and double-stranded DNA templates were sequenced using pBluescript and internal primers. Sequence analyses and alignments were carried out with the GCG programs (Wisconsin Package, version 10.2-UNIX, Genetic Computer Group, Inc.). Sequence homologies were identified using the FastA and BLAST programs by searching GenBank™ (release 124.0) and EMBL (release 67.0) data banks and in the case of translated sequences by searching SWISS-PROT (release 39.0), PIR/NBRF (release 68.0), and SPTREMBL (release 17.0) data banks. Differential screening was applied to identify RA-induced genes in NB4 cells. Subtracted probes were prepared as described (24Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated and RA-treated (24 h) NB4 single-stranded cDNA probes were obtained through hybridization to an excess of nonhematopoietic HT-29 and NB4 poly(A)+RNA, respectively. Remaining single-stranded cDNAs were then separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography and used as specific probes. Two cDNA fragments (813 and 870) isolated from the RA-treated NB4 cDNA library contained 1007 bp (position 45–1051) and 1351 bp corresponding to the 3′ end of ASB-2 cDNA, respectively. A remaining 5′ cDNA sequence (44 bp) was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR from RA-treated NB4 RNA (with 5 × 10−7m for 48 h) using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) with the primer: 5′-GCTTCAGGCAGGAACGAGGAT-3′. Using the same kit, a contiguous cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of ASB-2 from RA-treated NB4 cells. The ASB-2 coding sequence was subcloned into the pMTCB6+-derived expression vector (25Cook D.M. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1789-1799PubMed Google Scholar) under the control of the zinc-inducible sheep metallothionein promoter resulting in the pMT-ASB-2 vector. Exponentially growing PLB-985 cells (5 × 106/0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)) were electroporated (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 300 V, 960 microfarads in the presence of 20 μg of the pMT-ASB-2 vector or the empty vector. Transfected PLB-985 cells were cultured for 48 h, selected with 0.4 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and cultured under limiting dilution conditions. Total RNA extraction and hybridization were as described (21Lutz P.G. Houzel-Charavel A. Moog-Lutz C. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 2001; 97: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Human RNA master blot and human immune system multiple tissue Northern blot II were obtained fromCLONTECH. The ASB-2 probe corresponded to the 3′ end of the 1351-bp ASB-2 cDNA. Radioactivity was quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). An NH2-terminal peptide (SAPSRSTAPPESSPA) was synthesized according to the ASB-2 deduced amino acid sequence and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through a cysteine residue added to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the peptide (Eurogentec). The rabbit serum (2PNA) was collected following the initial injection and three booster immunizations (Eurogentec). Immunoblot analyses were carried as described (22Moog-Lutz C. Peterson E.J. Lutz P.G. Eliason S. Cave-Riant F. Di Singer A. Gioia Y. Dmowski S. Kamens J. Cayre Y.E. Koretzky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22375-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) except that the antiserum was diluted 1:2000. Cells were cytocentrifuged onto microscope slides, fixed in 1% formaldehyde in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and kept overnight at 4 °C in 70% ethanol. Cells were then stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI; Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma) for 60 min and mounted under a coverslip in a solution of 9 parts of glycerol and 1 part of the PI staining solution. Both in situdetection of DNA strand breaks by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay using the APO-BRDU kit (Phoenix Flow Systems) (26Gorczyca W. Bruno S. Darzynkiewicz R. Gong J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Int. J. Oncol. 1992; 1: 639-648PubMed Google Scholar), and immunocytochemical detection of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage product (27Li X. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were used for identification of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cells were labeled with green fluorescing fluorescein isothiocyanate, and cellular DNA was counterstained with fluorescein red PI (28Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Cellular red and green fluorescence intensities were measured by laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte) as described (29Bedner E. Burfeind P. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Darzynkiewicz Z. Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). DNA content frequency histograms were deconvoluted to obtain the percentage of cells in different phases of the cell cycle. The percentage of cells with condensed chromatin, i.e. with increased intensity of the DNA-associated maximal pixel PI fluorescence and decreased nuclear area, was obtained by gating analysis of the bivariate red integrated fluorescence versus maximal red fluorescence pixel distributions (29Bedner E. Burfeind P. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The frequency of apoptotic cells was estimated from the bivariate distributions of PIversus fluorescein isothiocyanate integrated fluorescence intensities (28Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). At least 3000 cells were measured in each sample. The experiment was repeated three times. Using subtractive hybridization, we have identified two novel cDNA clones (813 and 870) showing homology with the murine ASB-2 cDNA originally deduced from the analysis of contigs derived from expressed sequence tags (31Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Increased ASB-2 mRNA expression occurred 4 h after exposure of NB4 cells to 5 × 10−7m ATRA with a maximum expression at 96 h (Fig.1A). Sequential treatment of NB4 cells with cycloheximide and ATRA indicated that ATRA-induced ASB-2 mRNA up-regulation occurred even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1A). Dose-response studies with ATRA-treated NB4 cells showed that 24 h of treatment with 10−8m ATRA induced peak levels of the ASB-2 mRNA (Fig. 1B), which correlated with differentiation as assessed by the NBT assay (data not shown). As expected, ATRA did not affect growth and differentiation (Fig. 1C, a andb, respectively) of NB4.306 cells that have lost the capacity to encode an intact ATRA-binding PML-RARα (19Dermime S. Grignani F. Clerici M. Nervi C. Sozzi G. Talamo G.P. Marchesi E. Formelli F. Parmiani G. Pelicci P.G. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, no induction of ASB-2 mRNA was observed (Fig. 1C,c). In contrast, ASB-2 mRNA was strongly up-regulated in NB4 cells induced to growth arrest and differentiation by ATRA (Fig.1C). These data indicate that an increased ASB-2 mRNA expression correlated with the capacity of ATRA-treated leukemia cells to undergo growth arrest and granulocytic differentiation. We have cloned a 2396-bp cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AJ251238) (Fig. 2A) showing: (i) complete homology to a 1635-bp unpublished human sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF159164) representing a partial human ASB-2 cDNA (positions 267–1907 in Fig. 2A) and (ii) 87% homology to a 1758-bp murine sequence (32Kile B.T. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Brodnicki T.C. Cancilla M.R. Herlihy A.S. Croker B.A. Baca M. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 258: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession no.AF155353) representing the complete coding sequence of the mouse ASB-2 cDNA (positions 144–1904 in Fig. 2A). Alignments of sequences from the 2396-bp ASB-2 cDNA, the partial human ASB-2, and the human chromosome 14 (GenBank™ accession no. AL079302) revealed some differences. Sequences of the 2396-bp ASB-2 cDNA and chromosome 14 were identical except an insertion of a G at position 1234, which was also found in partial ASB-2. This together with five 1-bp substitutions and two 3-bp insertions found in the 2396-bp ASB-2 cDNA when compared with the partial sequence indicates that the complete ASB-2 cDNA sequence reported here corresponds to the human ASB-2 mRNA. The complete open reading frame of ASB-2 consisted of 1764 bp translating into a 587-amino acid protein sharing 91% identity and 94% similarity with its mouse counterpart (data not shown). This protein harbors 11 ankyrin repeats and a SOCS box as defined by Michaely et al. (33Michaely P. Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and Starr et al. (34Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar), respectively. Ankyrin repeats contained 33 amino acids except repeats 2, 8, 9, and 10, which contained 34, 32, 42, and 30 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 2B). The ∼50-amino acid SOCS box motif is composed of two well conserved blocks of sequence, which are separated by 2–10 nonconserved residues (Fig. 2C). The carboxyl-terminal conserved region is an leucine/proline-rich sequence of unknown function, and the amino-terminal conserved region is a 15-amino acid BC box known to interact with the elongin BC complex (35Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In ATRA-treated NB4 cells, anti-ASB-2 polyclonal antibodies detected a specific 64-kDa protein after 4 h of treatment (Fig.2D). In the human immune system, ASB-2 mRNA was mainly expressed in bone marrow and to a lower extent in spleen and lymph nodes (Fig.2E). Using the Human RNA Master Blot™, ASB-2 mRNA expression was also detected in skeletal muscle, heart, fetal heart, small intestine, appendix, bladder, aorta, stomach, uterus, prostate, and colon (data not shown). Our results indicated that ASB-2 is a member of the SOCS family relevant to normal hematopoiesis. To explore the role of PML-RARα in the induction of ASB-2 mRNA by ATRA, we used U937-MT and U937-PR9 cells. ATRA-treatment of U937-PR9 cells expressing PML-RARα resulted in a 7-fold increased expression of the ASB-2 mRNA (Fig. 3A,a), which occurred even in the absence of de novoprotein synthesis (Fig. 3A, b). A 2-fold-increase was observed in U937-MT cells following ATRA treatment (Fig.3A, a), as expected because U937 cells express an active RAR (36Botling J. Castro D.S. Oberg F. Nilsson K. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ASB-2 mRNA was induced in vitro by ATRA in PML-RARα-expressing leukemia promyelocytes freshly obtained from peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients with APL (Fig.3B). This induction correlated with ATRA-induced differentiation of these cells as assessed morphologically and by NBT assay (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that up-regulation of ASB-2 by ATRA is mediated by PML-RARα. To investigate whether induction of ASB-2 expression was involved in myeloid leukemia cell growth, an ASB-2 expression vector (MT-ASB-2) under the control of a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter was stably transfected into PLB-985 cells. The MT vector was used as an empty control. When ZnSO4 was added to the media, ASB-2 mRNA (Fig.4A, a) and protein (Fig. 4A, b) expression increased dramatically in PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells. In the presence of ZnSO4, a ∼40% growth inhibition was observed in PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells whereas no significant change was detected in PLB-985/MT cells (Fig.4B, a and b). Laser scanning cytometer was used for measurements of cellular fluorescence intensity as assessment of DNA contents. Two representative samples of PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells, either untreated or treated with ZnSO4 for 60 h, are shown in Fig.4B (c and d, respectively). Based on the intensity of the DNA-associated red integrated fluorescence PI, we identified cells in G1versus S and G2/M as shown on DNA content frequency histograms. Mitotic cells with condensed chromatin were distinguished from G2cells by an increased intensity of maximal pixel of red fluorescence (Red Max Pixel) and by a decreased fluorescence area (29Bedner E. Burfeind P. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Darzynkiewicz Z. Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A large number of PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells treated with ZnSO4 exhibited an increased intensity of maximal pixel of red fluorescence. After their relocation by laser scanning cytometer and examination by microscopy, they appeared to be interphase cells with smaller nuclei and condensed chromatin (Fig.4B, d). The pattern of chromatin condensation in these cells did not resemble apoptosis-associated changes but rather was consistent with changes occurring in ATRA-induced HL-60 cells (29Bedner E. Burfeind P. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the effect of ZnSO4 on the DNA contents of PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 versus PLB-985/MT cells as well as the frequency of interphase cells with condensed chromatin. No change in proportions of untreated cells at different phases of the cell cycle or with condensed chromatin were detected (Fig. 4B,e and f). However, in the presence of ZnSO4, few changes were observed with PLB-985/MT cells (Fig. 4B, c), whereas the proportion of PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells with condensed chromatin was markedly increased (up to 35% at 60 h) (Fig. 4B, f). This was associated with an increased percentage of cells with a DNA content equivalent of that of S and G2/M cells (Fig. 4B,f). A large proportion of PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells with condensed chromatin had DNA content equivalent of that of S and G2/M cells (Fig. 4C, d). In separate measurements, we assessed the percentage of apoptotic cells with DNA strand breaks (terminal dUTP nick-end labeling-positive) (Fig.4B, e and f) and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (data not shown). The proportion of apoptotic cells remained below 5% whether PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 and PLB-985/MT were untreated or treated with ZnSO4. Thus, in light of the evidence that proliferation of ASB-2 transfected cells was suppressed by ZnSO4 whereas apoptosis was minimal, the observed increase in proportion of S and G2/M cells including those cells with condensed chromatin indicates that, although commitment events were induced, cells were arrested in their progression through S and G2/M. However, expression of differentiation markers such as CD11b, ICAM-1, MCP-1, interleukin-8, and defensin 1 was not induced in ZnSO4-treated PLB-985/MT-ASB-2 cells (data not shown). Altogether, our results strongly suggest that ASB-2 expression is part of the mechanisms controlling growth arrest and chromatin condensation known to be associated with early phases of ATRA-induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. ASB proteins are evolutionarily conserved because translation of the M60–7 gene of theCaenorhabditis elegans cosmid M60 indicated that it encodes a full-length ASB (37Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) with bona fide ankyrin repeats and SOCS box organization. These proteins belong to the SOCS protein family identified as containing a SOCS box consensus (31Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). They differ in their NH2-terminal part, sharing sequences involved in protein-protein interactions such as a Src homology 2 domain (SOCS proteins), a SPRY domain (SSB proteins), WD-40 repeats (WSB proteins), or ankyrin repeats (ASB proteins). Several cytokines induce transcriptional activation of one or more SOCS genes, suggesting that SOCS proteins play central roles in determining the intensity and duration of cellular responses to many cytokines (3Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Whether ASB-2 is involved in a specific cytokine signaling pathway remains to be determined. We found that the drastic increase in ASB-2 mRNA expression induced by RA in NB4 cells was mediated through a PML-RARα signaling and correlated with growth arrest and differentiation of these cells. Little is known about the signaling pathway through which pharmacological concentrations of RA can induce growth arrest and differentiation in APL cells. PML-RARα behaves as a constitutive transcriptional repressor of RA target genes in the presence of physiological concentrations of RA (38De Grignani F. Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V.

Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), and a central role of RARα pathway deregulation was found in the pathogenesis of APL (42Du C. Redner R.L. Cooke M.P. Lavau C. Blood. 1999; 94: 793-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PML-RARα may repress expression of ASB-2 and thus affect signaling at physiological concentrations of RA. The fact that high RA concentrations can switch PML-RARα from repressor to activator (12Lin R.J. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) may account for a capacity of PML-RARα to transcriptionally activate the ASB-2 gene in the presence of RA. The causal role of PML-RARα in the pathogenesis of APL has been demonstrated in several transgenic mouse models (43He L.Z. Merghoub T. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5278-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the PML-RARα gene in murine bone marrow cells greatly blocked myeloid maturation and led to the immortalization of myeloid progenitors. The ASB-2 transcripts were strongly detected in normal bone marrow and up-regulated upon RA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells. Because target cells for transformation in APL are likely to be myeloid progenitors (44Turhan A.G. Lemoine F.M. Debert C. Bonnet M.L. Baillou C. Picard F. Macintyre E.A. Varet B. Blood. 1995; 85: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), genes involved in myeloid differentiation might be repressed in APL cells and induced when these cells are exposed to RA. Our results suggest that ASB-2 may be one of these genes. In APL cells, RA induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation possibly via the induction of genes implicated in cell cycle arrest and the acquisition of a differentiated phenotype. However, although normal differentiation in most cell types is associated with an arrest in G1, a large proportion of the cells expressing an exogenous ASB-2 were actually arrested in the S and G2/M phases. This was quite evident from the presence of cells with condensed chromatin that had a S+G2/M DNA content and from the increase in overall proportion of S+G2/M cells after treatment with ZnSO4. During normal differentiation, the induction process appears to be sequential, first by arresting cells in G1 (by causing an accumulation of pRb in hypophosphorylated state) (45Juan G. Li X. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and, subsequently, by inducing their differentiation phenotype. However, it should be noted that, in differentiating NB4 cells, hypophosphorylated pRb was found both in G1 and S+G2/M (46Brooks III, S.C. Sturgill R. Choi J. Yen A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the case of ASB-2-expressing cells, the signaling appears to by-pass the cell cycle regulatory system and directly trigger commitment to differentiation. This observation is in agreement with the fact that, in PML-RARα-expressing cells exposed to the differentiative stimulus of RA, G1 arrest occurs as a late phase not causally linked to commitment and differentiation (13Casini T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It should also be noticed that, in uridine-induced HL-60 cells, an arrest in the G1 phase is not required for differentiation as this process is preceded by accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (47Sokoloski J.A. Lee C.W. Handschumacher R.E. Nigam A. Sartorelli A.C. Leuk. Res. 1991; 15: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The fact that ASB-2 expression induced a limitation in cell proliferation together with chromatin condensation strongly suggests that it promotes commitment events found at early stages in RA-induced differentiation of leukemia cells. Further studies on the mechanisms of action of ASB-2 and the identification of its partners will contribute greatly to the understanding of the signaling pathway interrupted by PML-RARα at the early stages of leukemia transformation and reactivated during RA-induced commitment to differentiation in APL cells.

The transport of purine nutrients is crucial to the survival of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,and nucleoside transport activity has been associated with a number of different membrane components within the parasitized erythrocyte. To determine the location of the PfNT1 nucleoside transporter, the first component of the nucleoside permeation pathway to be studied at the molecular level in P. falciparum (Carter, N.

Western blot analysis of parasite lysates revealed that the antibodies were specific for PfNT1 and that the level of PfNT1 protein in the infected erythrocyte is regulated in a stage-specific fashion. The amount of PfNT1 polypeptide increases dramatically during the early trophozoite stage and reaches its maximal level in the late trophozoite and schizont stages. Deconvolution and immunoelectron microscopy using these monospecific antibodies revealed that PfNT1 localizes predominantly, if not exclusively, to the plasma membrane of the parasite and not to the parasitophorous vacuolar or erythrocyte membranes.

Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269PubMed Google Scholar, 2World Health Organization Expert Committee on Malaria WHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892: 1-74Google Scholar). P. falciparum is an intracellular protozoan parasite that exhibits a complex life cycle, going through a sexual phase in the insect vector, the Anopheles mosquito, and multiplying asexually within the human host to precipitate its morbid and lethal sequelae. Chemotherapy and prophylaxis for malaria are available but are severely stymied by drug toxicity and pervasive drug resistance (1World Health Organization Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269PubMed Google Scholar, 2World Health Organization Expert Committee on Malaria WHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892: 1-74Google Scholar). Thus, the need for more efficacious and less toxic antimalarial agents, particularly drugs that are directed toward pathways or targets that are unique to the parasite, is acute. One striking metabolic discrepancy between all parasites and their mammalian hosts is the purine biosynthetic pathway. Whereas mammalian cells are capable of synthesizing purine nucleotides de novo, all protozoan parasites studied to date (3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar), includingPlasmodium spp. (4Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 467-484PubMed Google Scholar), are incapable of making the purine ring. As a consequence, each genus has evolved a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes to scavenge purines from their hosts. This purine salvage process is initiated by the translocation of purines across the parasite membrane. Thus, purine base and nucleoside transporters serve an indispensable nutritional function for the parasite. The discovery by Gero et al. (5Gero A.M. Bugledich E.M. Paterson A.R. Jamieson G.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in 1988 that erythrocytes exhibit altered nucleoside transport properties afterP. falciparum infection has stimulated considerable interest into the underlying mechanisms by which this unusual phenomenon occurs. The predominant nucleoside carrier expressed in uninfected human red blood cells (RBCs)1 is the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (6Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 is a facilitated carrier that recognizes virtually all purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and is extraordinarily sensitive to inhibition by 4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine (6Griffiths M.

Upon infection with P. falciparum, the paramount nucleoside transporter activity in the red blood cell becomes insensitive to 4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine, consists of both saturable and nonsaturable components, and recognizesl-nucleosides as ligands (5Gero A.M.

This unusual capability to translocate l-nucleosides can account for the growth sensitivity of P. falciparum tol-nucleoside analogs (10Gero A.M. Perrone G. Brown D.M. Hall S.T. Chu C.K. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1999; 18: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and implies that nucleoside uptake components could serve as potential drug targets. The enclosure of P. falciparum in a parasitophorous vacuole necessitates that the uptake of purines, or for that matter any nutrient, from the human host into P. falciparum occurs across a multiplicity of membranes. Nutrients generally must be transported across the erythrocyte membrane (RBCM), the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), and the parasite plasma membrane (PPM); these nutrient permeation pathways may involve a variety of complex and novel components including transporters, channels, ducts, and the tubovesicular membranes (TVM) (9Upston J.M.

The altered transport capabilities of the infected RBC, referred to as the new permeation pathway (NPP), appear 10–20 h post-invasion, are attributed at least in part to a channel on the RBCM that transports nucleosides, polyols, amino acids, sugars, and cations (17Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1236: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3339-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of parasite protein synthesis prevents the formation of the NPP, suggesting that it originates from parasite proteins. However the specific protein components of the NPP have yet to be determined, and it is possible that more than one NPP exists (15Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recently Desai et al. (17Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) showed that the nonsaturable, voltage-dependent channel is abundant after invasion, supporting the theory that the channel is a major component of the NPP. Within the parasitized red blood cell, the TVM, an interconnected membrane network extending from the PVM to the periphery of the infected erythrocyte, has also been implicated in nucleoside transport (16Lauer S.A. Rathod P.K. Ghori N. Haldar K. Science. 1997; 276: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Searches of The Institute for Genomic Research P. falciparumdata base uncovered a gene, PfNT1, that encoded a polypeptide with significant homology to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family (20Carter N.S. Ben Mamoun C. Liu W. Silva E.O. Landfear S.M. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Parker M.D. Hyde R.J.

PfNT1 is the first component of the nucleoside permeation pathway to be characterized at the molecular level from P. falciparum. Expression of PfNT1cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed PfNT1 to be a nucleoside transporter of broad specificity that also recognizes purine nucleobases and l-nucleosides as ligands and exhibits insensitivity to inhibitors of human equilabrative nucleoside transporter 1 (20Carter N.S.

Given the complexity of the intraerythrocytic environment in which the parasite resides, the location of PfNT1 becomes particularly important because a restricted milieu can be a determinant of a specialized function and its potential as a therapeutic target. To localize PfNT1, we raised polyclonal antisera against PfNT1 in rabbits and determined by Western blot analysis that the antibodies were specific. These monospecific antibodies were subsequently used to determine by deconvolution and immunoelectron microscopy that the predominant location of PfNT1 is the PPM and that the absolute level of PfNT1 protein is stage-dependent. The chloroquine-sensitive HB3 clone of P. falciparum was propagated in human RBCs at 2% hematocrit and 10% parasitemia by the method of Trager and Jensen (22Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar) except that the serum component in the culture medium was replaced with 0.5% Albumax (Life Technologies, Inc.) (23Ringwald P. Meche F.S. Bickii J. Basco L.K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 700-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 108-base pair fragment of thePfNT1 open reading frame encoding the 36 NH2-terminal amino acids of PfNT1 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a sense primer, 5′-TCTGGATCCATGAGTACCGGTAAAGAGTCATCTAAAGC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TTCGAATTCTGAAATGTTGTTTACTGCTTAATGTAGAT-3′, with engineered BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was subcloned first into the PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-KT expression plasmid (24Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to create pGEX-KT-PfNT1-1–108. The pGEX-KT vector directs the synthesis of the PfNT1 fragment fused to the NH2 terminus of the glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The segment of pGEX-KT-PfNT1-1–108adjoining and encompassing the PfNT1 fragment was sequenced in both directions to verify that the PCR product was subcloned in frame and faithfully. Expression from pGEX-KT-PfNT1-1–108was induced in 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the fusion protein was purified over a glutathione-agarose matrix (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purity was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and the purified fusion protein was sent to CoCalico Biologicals for polyclonal antisera production in rabbits. To generate an antigen for screening and purifying PfNT1-specific antibodies, the 1,075-base pair BamHI/PstI fragment encompassing the 108-base pair PfNT1 insert was excised from pGEX-KT-PfNT1-1–108 and subcloned into the pmal-C2 vector (New England Biolabs) to generate pmal-C2-PfNT1-1–108. The pmal-C2-PfNT1-1–108construct synthesizes the PfNT1 NH2-terminal fragment as a fusion protein to the NH2 terminus of the E. coli maltose-binding protein. pmal-C2-PfNT1-1–108 was expressed in 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the fusion protein, PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein, was purified according to the New England Biolabs brochure. The PfNT1 antisera obtained from CoCalico Biologicals were screened initially against PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (27Engvall E. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1972; 109: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar) and Western blotting (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). After we established the presence of PfNT1 antibodies, the crude serum was affinity-purified over an Affi-15 gel (Bio-Rad) matrix to which PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein was bound covalently. Antibody specificity was then confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting with PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein antigen and glutathione S-transferase and maltose-binding protein proteins as negative controls. 24 plates, each containing 12 ml of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes at ∼10% parasitemia were synchronized with 0.15% sorbitol (29Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar), and 3 plates were harvested every 6 h. Erythrocytes were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and parasites were released from the RBCs by incubation in 0.15% saponin for 15 min on ice. The released parasites were washed three times in PBS and lysed by sonication. Hemozoin was separated from the parasite lysate by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Parasite lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer containing 8 murea and incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). An ECL chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect PfNT1 antibodies following the manufacturer's protocol. The same blot was then stripped and reprobed with antibodies raised against P. falciparum elongation factor-1α. RBCs harboring an asynchronous culture of P. falciparum were washed twice in PBS, placed onto coverslips, and dried at room temperature. The parasites were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and the coverslips rinsed three times in PBS before blocking in a PBS solution containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.1% saponin. A PBS wash buffer containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% normal goat serum, and 0.05% saponin was used for all subsequent washes and incubations. Coverslips were incubated simultaneously with affinity-purified PfNT1 antibodies (diluted 1:100) and mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) to the red blood cell Cl−/HCO 3− exchanger (Band 3) (diluted 1:500) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h. Controls included fixed parasites incubated with preimmune antiserum, antiserum (31Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) against the P. falciparum glucose transporter (PfHT1) (generously provided by Dr. Sanjeev Krishna), and antiserum (32Ben Mamoun C. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11241-11247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) against the P. falciparum protein phosphatase 2C. Control coverslips were also coincubated with the Band 3 antibodies. After rinsing the coverslips in wash buffer, rabbit and mouse antibodies were visualized with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate and anti-mouse conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed three times in wash buffer and then incubated in Hoechst nuclear stain (Molecular Probes) for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted on slides with Molecular Probes Antifade and images acquired with the Applied Precision Deltavision® image restoration system. Deconvolution was accomplished using the iterative constrained algorithm of Agard et al. (33Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 30: 353-377Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and additional image processing was performed on an SGI Octane work station located in the Oregon Health and Science University-Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Imaging Core Facility. Parasitized RBCs were enriched for schizonts (15Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), pelleted, and fixed on ice for 1 h in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 200 mm PIPES and 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. After rinsing in PIPES buffer, the cell pellet was embedded in 10% gelatin and fixed again for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed samples were infiltrated with 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 2.3 m sucrose in PIPES buffer overnight at 4 °C. Samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, cryosectioned and collected on carbon-Formvar-coated grids at the Washington University Molecular Microbiology Imaging Facility. Grids were blocked in 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% goat serum in PIPES buffer and incubated in purified PfNT1 antibody diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Grids were rinsed, incubated with anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to 15 nm gold particles (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking buffer, washed, and counterstained with 0.3% uranyl acetate and 2% polyvinyl alcohol. Images were viewed on a on a Zeiss 902 transmission electron microscope. To determine the location of PfNT1 in the parasitized erythrocyte, antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal 36 amino acids of PfNT1 were generated in rabbits. These antibodies, which had been purified over a PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein affinity matrix, recognized only a single polypeptide on a Western blot of fractionated parasite lysate that migrated with a molecular mass of 45 kilodaltons (Fig. 1A). The size of PfNT1 on the immunoblot is consistent with that predicted from the PfNT1 translation product (20Carter N.S. Ben Mamoun C. Liu W. Silva E.O. Landfear S.M. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Parker M.D. Hyde R.J. Yao S.Y. McRobert L. Cass C.E. Young J.D. McConkey G.A. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The PfNT1 antibodies are specific for the PfNT1 epitope because they recognized PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein but not glutathioneS-transferase or maltose-binding protein alone (data not shown). Binding to PfNT1 was abolished when antibodies were preincubated with excess PfNT1-1–108-maltose-binding protein, and no recognition of the 45-kilodalton polypeptide was observed with preimmune serum (data not shown). Although PfNT1 polypeptide is observed through all stages of the intraerythrocytic life cycle, the level of PfNT1 protein increases dramatically from the ring (4 h after release) to the early trophozoite stage (20 h after release) and then remains relatively constant through the late schizont stage (40–46 h after release). The pattern of expression is mimicked by that of P. falciparumelongation factor-1α (Fig. 1B), a P. falciparum protein known to be up-regulated at the trophozoite stage (34Ben Mamoun C. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The stage-dependent variation in PfNT1 protein levels observed among RBC P. falciparum life cycle stages is consistent with the need for purine precursors prior to and during DNA replication of intraerythrocytic parasites (35Ben Mamoun C. Gluzman I.Y. Hott C. MacMillan S.K. Amarakone A.S. Anderson D.L. Carlton J.M. Dame J.B. Chakrabarti D. Martin R.K. Brownstein B.H. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The amount of PfNT1 protein detected at each time point does not coincide with the levels ofPfNT1 transcript, which is maximal in early trophozoites and subsequently down-regulated in late stage trophozoites and schizonts (20Carter N.S. Ben Mamoun C. Liu W. Silva E.O. Landfear S.M. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similar patterns in the extent of gene expression are observed at the transcript and protein levels with P. falciparumelongation factor-1α (20Carter N.S. Ben Mamoun C. Liu W. Silva E.O. Landfear S.M. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Ben Mamoun C. Goldberg D.E. Mol.

Martin R.K. Brownstein B.H. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The location of PfNT1 within the parasitized erythrocyte was examined initially by deconvolution microscopy. Immunofluorescence analysis of PfNT1 stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody indicates that PfNT1 is found in ring (Fig. 2A), trophozoite (Fig. 2, panel B), and schizont (Fig. 2, C andD) parasites and appears to be localized to the membrane in all of these intraerythrocytic forms. There was no staining observed at the RBCM or in the erythrocyte cytosol. The honeycomb staining pattern observed in the mature schizonts (Fig. 2, C andD) is indicative of PPM staining of developing individual merozoites, because the PVM circumscribes the whole collection of merozoites. A parallel incubation with primary antibodies against PfHT1, a protein previously shown to be associated with the PPM (31Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), demonstrates a similar reticulated staining pattern (Fig.2E), whereas antibodies specific for the cytosolic P. falciparum protein phosphatase 2C enzyme (32Ben Mamoun C. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11241-11247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) produce a diffuse staining pattern indicative of its cytoplasmic milieu (Fig.2F). Staining of P. falciparum-infected RBCs for Band 3, a well characterized marker of the RBCM (36Jay D. Cautlye C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 311-338Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), clearly resulted in a Texas Red immunofluorescence pattern distinct from that obtained with the FITC dye (Fig. 2, A–D). Immunoelectron microscopy was next used to further establish the membrane in which PfNT1 is situated within the parasitized erythrocyte. As shown in Fig. 3, the gold particles localized exclusively to individual merozoites and to the parasite cell surface. At the highest magnification visualized, it was evident that PfNT1 localizes predominantly to the PPM and not to the PVM (Fig.3B). No immunogold labeling was observed at the RBCM, TVM, Maurer's clefts, nucleus, nuclear envelope, or any internal organelle (Fig. 3) including the food vacuole (data not shown). This provides the first clear-cut demonstration of the cellular location of a P. falciparum nutrient transporter in parasitized RBCs using technology that differentiates between the PPM and PVM. It should be noted, however, that immunofluorescence with PfHT1 antibodies is observed at the cell surface of P. falciparum parasites freed from their host environment and therefore theoretically devoid of surrounding membrane structures, implying that PfHT1 is located on the PPM (31Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although this study on PfNT1 constitutes the first immunolocalization of a parasite nucleoside transporter, transfection of green fluorescent protein-tagged constructs of LdNT1 (37Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and LdNT2, the genes encoding the adenosine-pyrimidine and inosine-guanosine nucleoside transporters of Leishmania donovani, also leads to a cell surface fluorescence staining pattern. Both the deconvolution immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy established that PfNT1 is localized primarily, if not exclusively, to the PPM, although the possibility cannot be ruled out that PfNT1 is a minor constituent of other structures and uptake components of the complex nucleoside permeation pathway of P. falciparum. The lack of PfNT1 antibody recognition of the TVM and RBCM in which the NPP is found, both of which accommodate nucleoside uptake capacities (15Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,16Lauer S.A. Rathod P.K. Ghori N. Haldar K. Science. 1997; 276: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), is consistent with the biochemical evidence that PfNT1 is a saturable, nucleoside-specific carrier (20Carter N.S. Ben Mamoun C. Liu W. Silva E.O. Landfear S.M. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Parker M.D. Hyde R.J. Yao S.Y. McRobert L. Cass C.E. Young J.D. McConkey G.A. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, the location of PfNT1 implies that this saturable transporter is not directly responsible for the dramatically augmented 4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine-insensitive nucleoside transport observed upon P. falciparum infection of human erythrocytes (5Gero A.M. Bugledich E.M. Paterson A.R. Jamieson G.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rather, these biochemical alterations, also observed with other nutrients (17Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3339-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are more likely ascribed to a RBCM component such as the anion channel, known to be part of the NPP, which exhibits more generalized transport capabilities. These other components of the nucleoside permeation pathway remain to be dissected at the molecular level. Recently, our laboratory has uncovered a second nucleoside transporter gene from the malaria genome sequencing data base that exhibits most of the structural features of a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. The biochemical properties and cellular milieu of this protein remain to be established. We thank Dr. Sanjeev Krishna of the St. George's Hospital Medical School, Department of Infectious Diseases, for generously providing antibodies to PfHT1. We acknowledge the help of Aurelie Snyder of the Oregon Health & Science University-Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Imaging Core Facility for the deconvolution images and thank Jaime Dante and Wandy Beatty of Washington University School of Medicine, Molecular Microbiology Imaging Facility for help with the immunoelectron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2067913139,"Free fatty acids (FFA) andsn-2-monoacylglycerol (MG), the two major hydrolysis products of dietary triacylglycerol (TG), are absorbed from the lumen into polarized enterocytes that line the small intestine. Intensive studies regarding FFA metabolism in the intestine have been published; however, little is known regarding the metabolism of MG. In these studies, we examined the metabolism of sn-2-monoolein (sn-2–18:1) by human intestinal Caco-2 cells. To mimic the physiological presentation of MG to the enterocyte, the metabolism of [3H]sn-2-monoolein was examined by adding taurocholate-mixed sn-2–18:1 and albumin-boundsn-2–18:1 at the apical (AP) and basolateral (BL) surfaces of the Caco-2 cell, respectively. The results demonstrate that moresn-2–18:1 was incorporated into TG from AP taurocholate-mixed sn-2–18:1, whereas more phospholipid was synthesized from BL albumin-bound sn-2–18:1. The TG:phospholipid ratio was ∼5-fold higher for AP relative to BL MG incubation. Qualitatively similar results were observed for bovine serum albumin-bound MG added at the apical surface. It was also found that substantial sn-2–18:1 radioactivity was recovered in the FFA fraction, suggesting that sn-2–18:1 may be directly hydrolyzed within the Caco-2. We therefore used reverse transcription-PCR with primers designed from the murine MG lipase (MGL) gene, and detected the presence of MG lipase mRNA in Caco-2. The human MGL gene was cloned and found to be 83% identical to the murine MGL, and identical to a previously described lysophospholipase-like protein. Northern blot analysis showed the expression of MGL throughout Caco-2 differentiation. Thus, MG metabolism in Caco-2 cells may include not only well established anabolic processes, but also catabolic processes. Further, the observed polarity of MG metabolism suggests that, as for fatty acids, separate precursor and/or product pools of lipid may exist in the intestinal enterocyte. Free fatty acids (FFA) andsn-2-monoacylglycerol (MG), the two major hydrolysis products of dietary triacylglycerol (TG), are absorbed from the lumen into polarized enterocytes that line the small intestine.

The results demonstrate that moresn-2–18:1 was incorporated into TG from AP taurocholate-mixed sn-2–18:1, whereas more phospholipid was synthesized from BL albumin-bound sn-2–18:1. The TG:phospholipid ratio was ∼5-fold higher for AP relative to BL MG incubation. Qualitatively similar results were observed for bovine serum albumin-bound MG added at the apical surface. It was also found that substantial sn-2–18:1 radioactivity was recovered in the FFA fraction, suggesting that sn-2–18:1 may be directly hydrolyzed within the Caco-2. We therefore used reverse transcription-PCR with primers designed from the murine MG lipase (MGL) gene, and detected the presence of MG lipase mRNA in Caco-2. The human MGL gene was cloned and found to be 83% identical to the murine MGL, and identical to a previously described lysophospholipase-like protein. Northern blot analysis showed the expression of MGL throughout Caco-2 differentiation. Thus, MG metabolism in Caco-2 cells may include not only well established anabolic processes, but also catabolic processes. Further, the observed polarity of MG metabolism suggests that, as for fatty acids, separate precursor and/or product pools of lipid may exist in the intestinal enterocyte. monoacylglycerol unesterified free fatty acid diacylglycerol triacylglycerol phospholipid taurocholate bovine serum albumin glycerol 3-phosphate monoacylglycerol acyltransferase diacylglycerol acyltransferase apical basolateral sn-2-monoolein oleic acid palmitic acid liver fatty acid-binding protein intestinal fatty acid-binding protein acyl-coenzyme A synthetase monoacylglycerol lipase chylomicron pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase endoplasmic reticulum lipoprotein lipase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium long-chain fatty acid transepithelial resistance thin layer chromatography reverse transcriptase polyvinylidene difluoride avian myeloblastosis virus phosphate-buffered saline sn-2-Monoacylglycerol (sn-2-MG)1 and fatty acids (FFA) are the products of pancreatic lipase hydrolysis of dietary triacylglycerol (TG). They are absorbed from the lumen into polarized enterocytes that line the small intestine (1Thomson A.B.R. Schoeller C. Keelan M. Smith L.C. Clandinin M.T. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1993; 71: 531-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Following absorption, across the apical (AP) surface of the enterocyte, sn-2-MG and FFA are reincorporated into TG, which are subsequently secreted as the major component of chylomicrons (CM) into the lymphatic system (1Thomson A.B.R. Schoeller C. Keelan M. Smith L.C. Clandinin M.T. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1993; 71: 531-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). FFA are also taken up across the basolateral (BL) surface of the enterocyte (2Gangl A. Ockner R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and we have shown recently that MG is taken up across the BL surface of Caco-2 cells as well (3Ho S.Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CM and other TG-rich lipoproteins are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that extends into the vascular space from the capillary endothelial cells of extrahepatic tissues. LPL catalyzes the release of FFA from TG, and circulating TG-rich lipoproteins have been reported to accumulate MG after LPL hydrolysis (4Fielding B.A. Humphreys S.M. Allman R.F. Frayn K.N. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1993; 216: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5El Maghrabi M.R. Waite M. Rudel L.L. Sisson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 974-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, serum albumin was found to bindsn-2-monoolein (sn-2–18:1) with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼0.2 μm (6Thumser A.E.A. Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was shown that albumin-bound MG was not hydrolyzed by milk LPL (5El Maghrabi M.R. Waite M. Rudel L.L. Sisson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 974-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely thatsn-2-MG is circulating in the plasma either bound to albumin or as a component of lipoprotein remnants, and is taken up into the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane. However, no studies have addressed the metabolic fate of plasma MG taken up by the enterocyte. The small intestine is capable of synthesizing TG via both the glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and the CoA-dependent MG pathways of acylglycerol synthesis, which under normal conditions contribute about 20 and 80%, respectively, to total TG levels in the CM (7Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 125-141Google Scholar). The CoA-dependent MG pathway proceeds by direct acylation of the sn-2-MG with fatty acyl CoA, yielding thesn-1,2-diacylglycerol (sn-1,2-DG) intermediate (8Brindley D.N. Smyth D.H. Biomembranes. Plenum Publishing Co., London1974: 621-671Google Scholar). The MG pathway is achieved by the enzyme complex “TG synthetase” that has been localized to the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (9Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When the FFA and sn-2-MG levels are low, the G3P pathway becomes a major route for synthesis of TG in the enterocyte (7Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 125-141Google Scholar). This pathway involves the acylation of G3P with fatty acyl CoA to yield lysophosphatidic acid, and subsequent acylation and dephosphorylation of lysophosphatidic acid to obtain DG. The final reaction in both the MG and G3P pathways for TG synthesis is the conversion of DG to TG via diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) (7Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 125-141Google Scholar). Cases et al. (10Cases S. Stone S. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) have shown that two DGAT genes are expressed in the small intestine. It is not yet clear whether the DGAT activities in the MG pathway and G3P pathway have distinct localizations. Luminally derived and plasma-derived FFA were found to have different metabolic fates in the enterocyte. Plasma FFA were primarily oxidized or incorporated into phospholipids in rats and humans (2Gangl A. Ockner R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Gangl A. Renner F. Gastroenterology. 1978; 74: 847-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas FFA absorbed from the intestinal tract were mainly incorporated into TG (2Gangl A. Ockner R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Studies in Caco-2 cells also showed an increase in the ratio of TG:PL for apically, compared with basolaterally, administered FFA, further suggesting polarity of lipid metabolism at the level of the intestinal cell (12Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No studies have addresses the metabolic fate of plasma-derived MG taken up by enterocytes; thus, it is not known whether a similar compartmentation of MG metabolism occurs. The Caco-2 cell line was used to begin to examine enterocyte MG metabolism. When grown in culture, Caco-2 cells spontaneously develop many functions characteristic of mature villus cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including tight junction formation, lipoprotein secretion across the BL membrane, and the expression ofl-and I-FABP (13Darimont C. Gradoux N. Cumin F. Baum H.P. De Pover A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells also have a number of traits that differ from those of native enterocytes, including the synthesis of apoB-100 rather than apoB-48 (14Traber M.G. Kayden H.J. Rindler M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1350-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lower levels of I-FABP expression (15Le Beyec J. Delers F. Jourdant F. Schreider C. Chambaz J. Cardot P. Pincon-Raymond M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that, although Caco-2 cells have both the G3P and MG pathways of TG synthesis, the levels of monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) activity are ∼10% of those found in the mature villus cell (16Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10017-10023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their limitations, Caco-2 cells allow the study of a polarized enterocyte monolayer, provide separate access to AP and BL surfaces, and are a commonly used model system for studies of intestinal lipid absorption and metabolism. In the present studies, the metabolic fate of sn-2-MG in the Caco-2 enterocyte was examined using taurocholate (TC)-mixed MG micelles at the AP surface, to mimic the postprandial luminal environment, and albumin-bound MG at the BL surface, to mimic the plasma situation. In addition, the metabolic fates of palmitate and oleate, two major dietary FFA that are the predominant FFA species in serum, were studied, to directly compare the metabolic fates of FFA and MG. Polycarbonate Transwell filter inserts (6.5-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore) were purchased from Costar Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Tritium-labeled [9,10-3H]triolein (28 Ci/mmol), 9,10-3H-labeled oleic acid (14 Ci/mmol), and 9,10-3H-labeled palmitic acid (56 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeledsn-2-monoolein and sn-1-monoolein were obtained from Serdary Research Laboratory (Englewood Cliffs, NJ). The 3% sodium borate-coated preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were obtained from Analtech (Newark, DE). Silica gel G TLC plates were purchased from Whatman (Hillsboro, OR). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (essentially fatty acid-free) and pancreatic lipase (type VI) were obtained from Sigma. TC was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The PVDF Immobilon-P blotting membranes were from Millipore Corp (Bedford, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), nonessential amino acids, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, trypsin-EDTA, and poly(T) primers were from Invitrogen. Lipid standards were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, diethyl ether, and hexane were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). The SV total RNA isolation kit, β-actin primers, and AMV reverse transcriptase were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide primers were made by Genosys (Woodlands, TX). Vent polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). QIAquick Gel extraction kits and QIAprep Spin Miniprep kits were obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Santa Clarita, CA). Zero Blunt II-TOPO PCR cloning vector was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Purified human pancreatic TG lipase (PTL) and polyclonal antibodies against human pancreatic TG lipase were generous gifts of Dr. M. Lowe (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antibodies against human l- and I-FABP were kindly provided by Dr. J. Veerkamp (University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Caco-2 cell cultures were grown in DMEM with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 20% fetal bovine serum in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The medium was changed every other day. Cells were plated at a density ≥ 104/cm2 in 75-cm2 flasks, and split with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA when they reached 70–90% confluence (12Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Trotter P.J. Ho S.Y. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 336-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105/cm2 onto 24-mm polycarbonate Transwell filter inserts with 0.4-μm pores (Costar Corp.). Cells were grown to 14–18 days post-confluence. Transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements were made to ensure tight junction formation, and the monolayers were used for the experiments only when TER was >250 ohms × cm2 (12Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is no commercially available radiolabeled sn-2-MG, and the isomerization of monoacylglycerides between sn-1 and sn-2 positions is likely to occur by acid, alkali, or heat (18Mattson F.H. Volpenheim R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1962; 3: 281-296Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar),3H-labeled sn-2-monoolein was freshly prepared before each experiment. 3H-Labeled triolein (specific activity 28 Ci/mmol) that has 3H-label on the double bond of all acyl chains was used as substrate. [3H]sn-2-Monoolein was prepared by digestion of radiolabeled triolein with pancreatic lipase (type VI) (Sigma), followed by 3% sodium borate coated preparative TLC separation and elution into hexane (18Mattson F.H. Volpenheim R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1962; 3: 281-296Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recovery was typically 20% (maximum recovery is, theoretically, 33%). As analyzed by borate-TLC separation, the prepared [3H]sn-2-MG in hexane was stable assn-2-MG over a 1-month period when stored in brown vials filled with N2 at −20 °C. For apical incubation, radiolabeled palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1), andsn-2–18:1 (2 mm final concentration, 0.5 μCi/nmol for each ligand) were dried under N2. The dried lipids were then dissolved in ethanol (0.5% volume of the final volume of the solution), and subsequently dispersed in 10 mm TC (typical luminal bile salt level) (19Dakka T. Dumoulin V. Chayvialle J.A. Cuber J.C. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mmNaHPO4, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 90 rpm shaking. Solutions of 30 μm3H-labeled 16:0, 18:1, and sn-2–18:1 complexed to 100 μmBSA (essentially fatty acid-free; Sigma) were made by addition of ethanol (0.5% volume to the final volume of solution) to dried3H-lipids, followed by addition of 100 μm BSA (typical plasma albumin level) (20Berk P.D. Stump D.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 17-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before use. The unbound concentrations of 16:0 and 18:1 in TC micelles were determined using the fluorescent probe ADIFAB (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (21Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ultrafiltration method described by Schulthess et al. (22Schulthess G. Lipka G. Compassi S. Boffelli D. Weber F.E. Paltauf F. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4500-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as described previously (3Ho S.Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unbound concentration of sn-2–18:1 in TC-mixed micelles was determined only by the ultrafiltration method because ADIFAB does not bind MG. The unbound concentrations of LCFA bound to BSA were calculated from the equilibrium binding constants as reported by Spector et al. (23Spector A.A. Fletcher J.E. Ashbrook J.D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3229-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the unbound concentration of sn-2–18:1 bound to BSA was calculated from the binding constant determined by Thumser et al (6Thumser A.E.A. Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake media containing unbound concentrations of lipids below their critical micellar concentrations were used for the studies. The metabolic fates of radiolabeledsn-2–18:1, 18:1, and 16:0 were determined in Caco-2 cells as follows. Media were replaced with serum-free DMEM for 15 h. The Caco-2 cell monolayers were then incubated with TC-mixed lipids apically, and with BSA-bound lipids at either the BL surface or, for some experiments, at the AP surface, for 2, 6, or 24 h at 37 °C. At these designated time points, cells were collected after washing with ice-cold 0.5% BSA solution twice, and ice-cold PBS solution three times, as shown previously to remove all extracellular substrate (3Ho S.Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content and radioactivity were determined after sonication of cells on ice for 30 s using a Branson sonifier equipped with a microtip. Total cell lipids were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity after lipid extraction was found to be ∼80% of the radioactivity prior to lipid extraction. After accounting for extraction efficiency, FFA oxidation was estimated by subtraction of the radioactivity recovered in the lipid extract from that in the cell sonicate, and averaged less than 3%. The incorporation of radiolabeled palmitic acid, oleic acid, andsn-2-monooleion into lipid metabolites was analyzed using two-step TLC separation as described previously (12Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts with added carrier lipids (cholesteryl oleate, triolein (TG), oleate,sn-1,2-diolein (DG), monoolein (MG), cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine) were spotted under nitrogen gas onto 20 × 20-cm TLC plates (Silica gel G; Whatman, Hillsboro, OR). The plates were developed to half the height of the plate in chloroform-methanol-acetic acid-formic acid-distilled water (35:15:6:2:1 v/v), allowed to dry under the hood, and then developed up the entire height of the plate in hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid (70:30:1 v/v). Lipids were visualized with iodine vapor. After allowing the iodine to evaporate under the hood, the area corresponding to each lipid was scraped into 3 ml of Ultrafluor (Fisher Scientific) and radioactivities were counted using a scintillation counter. Caco-2 cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein in the lysate supernatant was measured according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10% gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Blotting membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the polyclonal rabbit anti-human PTL antibody at a 1:2000 dilution. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by incubating with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:10,000 dilution. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Both purified human PTL and polyclonal rabbit anti-human PTL antibody were obtained from Dr. M. Lowe (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal anti-humanl-FABP and anti-human I-FABP antibodies were provided by Dr. J. Veerkamp (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) to serve as positive controls. The presence of MG lipase mRNA in Caco-2 was evaluated by RT-PCR. All assays were done in triplicate or more. RNA from male Sprague-Dawley rat adipose tissue was used for a positive control; RNA from rat jejunal mucosa was also evaluated (26Karlsson M. Contreras J.A. Hellman U. Tornqvist H. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27218-27223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). RNAs were prepared from Caco-2 cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks at designated times after confluence, as indicated in the figure legends. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the SV total RNA isolation kit from Promega. First strand DNA synthesis was done by using the oligo(dT)18 primer from Invitrogen and AMV transcriptase from Promega. cDNA first-strand synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by 94 °C for 10 min for enzyme inactivation. PCR was then carried out using primers designed from mouse MG lipase cDNA (26Karlsson M. Contreras J.A. Hellman U. Tornqvist H. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27218-27223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) as follows: 5′-66GGTCA ATGCA GACGG ACAGT ACCTC TTTTG95-3′ and 5′-861GTTTA CTTCA TGGAG GACGG AGTTG GTCAC832-3′. Ten μl of the first-strand mix was then added to 100 μl of PCR buffer containing 10 μl of 10× buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 1 μl of 100 μm MG lipase primers, 0.5 μl of 100 mm MgSO4, and 2 μl of Vent polymerase from New England Biolabs Inc. After the initiation incubation of 2 min at 94 °C, 40 cycles of PCR consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C were performed. PCR was completed with a final 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified DNA was separated through a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The size of the amplified fragment (800 bp) corresponded to an amplification of cDNA rather than genomic DNA. RT-PCR for human l-FABP served as a positive control for Caco-2 RNA and was performed using the following primers: 5′-29GCAAG TACCA ACTGC AGAGC CAGGA AAAGT58-3′ and 5′-389TTGCT GATTC TCTTG AAGAC AATGT CACCC360-3′, for an expected size of 400 bp. β-Actin primers (expected size of 300 bp) obtained from Promega were also used to ensure the quality of isolated RNA. Total RNA were prepared from Caco-2 cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks at day 18 after confluence, and was extracted using the SV total RNA isolation kit from Promega. First-strand DNA synthesis was done using the oligo(dT)18 primer from Invitrogen and AMV transcriptase from Promega. cDNA first-strand synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by 94 °C for 10 min for enzyme inactivation. PCR was then carried out using primers designed from the human lysophospholipase homolog (27Wall E.M. Cao J.X. Chen N. Buller M.L. Upton C. Virus Res. 1997; 52: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as follows: 5′-130GAATGCAAACGCCAGCACATAATG153-3′ and 5′-1170AGAGATGGCTTCTCAGATATGGCT1147-3′. Ten μl of the first-strand mix was then added to 100 μl of PCR reaction containing 10 μl of 10× buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 1 μl of 100 μm MG lipase primers, 0.5 μl of 100 mm MgSO4, and 2 μl of Vent polymerase from New England Biolabs Inc. After the initiation incubation of 2 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of PCR consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C were performed. PCR was completed with a final 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified DNA was separated through a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The amplified fragment (1000 bp) was then purified using Qiagen gel extraction kit. The purified cDNA was used as template to perform PCR reaction as per above conditions, then the freshly made PCR product was cloned into Invitrogen's PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector. The vector was then transformed into TOP 10 cells and plasmid DNA was purified by Qiagen Miniprep kit. Sequencing of the insert confirmed that it was human lysophospholipase homolog (GI1763010) (27Wall E.M. Cao J.X. Chen N. Buller M.L. Upton C. Virus Res. 1997; 52: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were collected at various times from 0 to 16 days after confluence. A Sprague-Dawley rat small intestine was collected, and adipose tissue was also obtained to serve as a positive control. Total RNA was extracted by guanidinium thiocyanate extraction. Cells and tissues were homogenized on ice using a high speed Tekmar Tissuemizer (Tekmar, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). 20 μg of total RNA was loaded onto 1% agarose gels; the RNA was transferred overnight onto GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 1000-base pair MGL sequence cloned from human Caco-2 cell cDNA was used as probe, and was labeled with 32P using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Labeled probe was purified using ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blots were pre-hybridized and hybridized using Express-Hyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA) in a hybridization oven with rolling motion. Pre-hybridization was for 30 min at 68 °C; hybridization with MGL probe was performed for 1 h at 68 °C. Blots were rinsed once at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and washed once for 10 min at 42 °C. This was followed by two washes with 0.1 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 60 °C. The gene screen was exposed to Kodak Intensifying Screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 days and developed and analyzed using the PhosphorImager Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Equal loading of all lanes was verified using the 18 S RNA. Within each experiment, triplicate samples were analyzed. Each separate experiment was performed at least three times, and results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). A three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine whether differences existed among groups for each time point of each substrate for each incubation. If the effect of any combination was significant, a multiple comparison procedure was conducted by using the Student-Newman-Keuls range test to determine whether a significant difference occurred. These procedures were carried out using the SAS program. Results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Uptake studies were performed using similar concentrations of unbound lipids at the AP and BL surfaces, determined as previously described (3Ho S.Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The net uptake of 3H-labeled MG,sn-2–18:1, from AP (both TC-mixed and BSA-bound) and BL (BSA-bound) surfaces of Caco-2 cells is shown in Fig.1. The net uptake of lipids was greatest from TC-mixed 3H-lipids at the AP surface. A comparison of BSA-bound lipids shows that net uptake was consistently higher at the AP surface than at the BL surface. Uptake of TC-mixed LCFA was greater than TC-mixed MG, with the highest net uptake observed for TC-mixed 18:1. For BSA-bound lipids, in contrast, 16:0 showed higher net uptake than 18:1. BSA-bound sn-2–18:1 has the lowest net uptake at both AP and BL surfaces. As expected, the net uptake of all lipids increased with time of incubation. Caco-2 monolayers were incubated with 2 mm3H-labeled lipid complexed with 10 mm TC at the AP surface. The unbound concentrations of radiolabeled sn-2-monoolein, oleic acid, and palmitic acid were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were 0.22, 0.12 and 0.09 μm, respectively. Caco-2 monolayers grown on polycarbonate filters were also incubated with 30 μm3H-labeled lipids bound to 100 μm BSA at either the AP or the BL surfaces.

The hydrophobicity of GS14K4 was systematically altered by residue replacements in the hydrophobic sites of the molecule to produce a series of analogs that were either less or more hydrophobic than the parent compound. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the molecules were structurally similar and only differed in overall hydrophobicity. The hydrophobicity of GS14K4 was found to be the midpoint for hemolytic activity, with more hydrophobic analogs exhibiting increased hemolytic activity and less hydrophobic analogs showing decreased hemolytic activity. For antimicrobial activity there were differences between the hydrophobicity requirements against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. The hydrophobicity of GS14K4 was sufficient for maximum activity against Gram-negative microorganisms and yeast, with no further increases in activity occurring with increasing hydrophobicity. With Gram-positive microorganisms significant increases in activity with increasing hydrophobicity were seen in three of the six microorganisms tested. A therapeutic index (calculated as a measure of specificity of the peptides for the microorganisms over human erythrocytes) served to define the boundaries of a therapeutic window within which lay the optimum peptide hydrophobicity for each microorganism. The therapeutic window was found to be at a lower hydrophobicity level for Gram-negative microorganisms than for Gram-positive microorganisms, although the limits were more variable for the latter. Our results show that the balance between activity and specificity in the present cyclic peptides can be optimized for each microorganism by systematic modulation of hydrophobicity.

Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Although their mode of action is not fully understood, it is well established that these peptides must interact with the plasma membrane of susceptible microorganisms, where either their accumulation in the membrane causes increased permeability and loss of barrier function or they cross the membrane to access cytoplasmic targets (2Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Studies with gramicidin S have indicated that this peptide is very membrane-active (3Zhang L. Dhillon P. Yan H. Farmer S. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The concept that the site of action of certain peptides is the cell membrane (as opposed to microbial enzymes) is consistent with observations of rapid (minutes to hours), concentration-dependent action, with the development of resistant microbial strains being reduced or eliminated (4Oren Z. Shai Y. Lohner K. Development of Novel Antimicrobial Agents: Emerging Strategies. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2001: 183-204Google Scholar). Moreover, they have also displayed toxicity to higher eukaryotic cells, an unsurprising result if the target is indeed the cell membrane. Differences in the lipid composition and the membrane potential gradient between prokaryotic and higher eukaryotic cell membranes have been used to explain the differences in specificity of these peptides (5Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because it is believed that killing with peptides like gramicidin S occurs after peptide interaction with membranes, efforts have been made to enhance specificity to provide the greatest discrimination between prokaryotic and higher eukaryotic membranes. Two major classes of the cationic antimicrobial peptides are the α-helical and the β-sheet peptides (6van't Hof W. Veerman E.C. Helmerhorst E.J. Amerongen A.V. Biol.

Biochem. 1988; 173: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)) consists of linear peptides that exist as disordered structures in aqueous media and become helical upon interaction with hydrophobic solvents or phospholipid vesicles. Unlike the α-helical peptides, β-sheet peptides are cyclic peptides constrained in this conformation either by disulfide bonds (tachyplesins (13Nakamura T. Furunaka H. Miyata T. Tokunaga F. Muta T.

J. 1980; 32: 807-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). From structure-activity relationship studies of cationic antimicrobial peptides, a number of factors important for antimicrobial and anti-eukaryotic cell activity have been identified. These include the presence of both hydrophobic and basic residues, an amphipathic nature that describes the relative positioning of the basic and hydrophobic residues, and secondary structure, either preformed or inducible in lipid-mimicking environments (1Hancock R.E. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R.

Synthetic Aspects of Biologically Active Cyclic Peptides: Gramicidin S and Tyrocidines. Halsted Press, New York1979: 49-89Google Scholar). The difficulty in interpreting results from such studies is that it is difficult to systematically study one variable while holding other variables constant, because sequence changes generally lead to structural changes that affect amphipathicity. Conformationally constrained peptides have the advantage that sequence changes alter conformation to a lesser degree than in their linear counterparts and thus facilitate the dissection of the relative contributions of each variable. In structure-activity studies on cyclic peptides related to gramicidin S (GS),1 we have previously found that amphipathicity plays a critical role in defining the scope of biological activities in these peptides (23Kondejewski L.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14287-14294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was seen that antimicrobial activity could be dissociated from hemolytic activity and that the differences between these two activities could be maximized by the selection of the appropriate amphipathicity (24Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It was seen that a high amphipathicity is not desirable in these peptides, because this results in high hemolytic activity coupled with low antimicrobial activity. Through systematic reduction of amphipathicity utilizing enantiomeric substitutions within the framework of the highly amphipathic β-sheet peptide, GS14 (cyclo(VKLKVd-YPLKVKLd-YP), where ddenotes a d-amino acid), it was possible to define the optimum amphipathicity leading to the highest therapeutic index (24Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized the structural framework of the GS14 diastereomer possessing the highest therapeutic index, GS14K4 (cyclo(VKLd-KVd-YPLKVKLd-YP)), and have systematically altered the hydrophobicity to define the optimal hydrophobicity leading to the greatest antimicrobial activity and specificity within this structural framework. All peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis usingt-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry, cleaved from the resin, purified by preparative RP-HPLC, N- to C-terminally cyclized, and repurified by preparative RP-HPLC as reported previously (23Kondejewski L.H.

The purity of linear and cyclic peptides was verified by analytical RP-HPLC as described below and correct peptide masses verified by mass spectrometry on a Fisons VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) (26Lavigne P. Crump M.P. Gagne S.M. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Retention times of peptides were determined by RP-HPLC on a Zorbax SB-C8 column (150 × 2.1 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle size; 300 Å pore size; Rockland Technologies, Wilmington, DE) using a Hewlett Packard 1100 chromatograph at 25 °C with a linear AB gradient of 1% B/min (where solvent A was 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) as described (23Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded in either 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, or 5 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a standard microtiter dilution method in LB no-salt medium as described previously (23Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M.

Int. J. Pept. Protein Res.5. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB and diluted in the same medium. Serial dilutions of antibiotics were added to the microtiter plates in a volume of 100 μl followed by 10 μl of bacteria to give a final inoculum of 5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and MICs were determined as the lowest antibiotic concentration that inhibited growth. The bacterial strains utilized were the same as reported (23Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Freshly collected human blood with heparin was centrifuged to remove the buffy coat, and the erythrocytes obtained were washed three times in 0.85% saline and stored at 4 °C. Serial dilutions of the peptides in saline were prepared in round bottom microtiter plates using 100-ml volumes. Red blood cells were diluted with saline to 125 packed volume of cells, and 50 μl were added to each well. The plates were incubated with rocking at 37 °C, and the concentration required for complete lysis determined visually after 24 h. Dansyl-polymyxin displacement from Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS was measured to determine the binding of the affinity of the peptides to LPS as described previously (28Moore R.A. Bates N.C. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 29: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were titrated into cuvettes containing 3 μg of LPS/ml and 2.5 μmdansyl-polymyxin (∼90% saturation of LPS-binding sites) in 1 ml of 5 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, and the decrease in fluorescence was recorded. A plot of the inverse of the percentage of inhibition as a function of the inverse of inhibitor concentration gave a value for IC50, the inhibitor concentration resulting in 50% displacement of dansyl-polymyxin from LPS (−1/xintercept). Permeabilization studies were carried out as described previously (29Ono S. Lee S. Kodera Y. Aoyagi H. Waki M. Kato T. Izumiya N. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Hancock R.E. Farmer S.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly,Escherichia coli UB1005 cells were suspended in 5 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mmglucose and 5 mm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone. NPN was added to 1 ml of cells in a quartz cuvette to give a final concentration of 10 mm, and the background fluorescence was recorded. Aliquots of peptide were added to the cuvette, and fluorescence was recorded as a function of time until there was no further increase in fluorescence. In a previous study we defined the optimum amphipathicity leading to a high specificity for microorganisms over human erythrocytes through the use of systematic enantiomeric substitutions within the framework of a 14-residue head-to-tail cyclic peptide (24Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the present investigation we have attempted to further optimize the biological properties of the diastereomeric peptide possessing the optimum amphipathicity, GS14K4 (cyclo(VKLd-KVd-YPLKVKLd-YP)), by modulation of hydrophobicity. Under the assumption that this “optimum structure” leading to the optimum amphipathicity (relative distribution of hydrophobic and basic residues) is retained, we have systematically replaced the hydrophobic residues in GS14K4 to obtain peptides that are either less hydrophobic or more hydrophobic than GS14K4 (Table I). GS14K4 has twod-tyrosines, three leucines, and three valine residues in its sequence that were selected to alter hydrophobicity in the analogs used in this study. Hydrophobicity was increased relative to GS14K4 by replacing two d-Tyr residues with two d-Phe residues (peptide Y2/F2), three Val with three Leu (peptide V3/L3), or a combination of both (peptide Y2/F2, V3/L3). Hydrophobicity was reduced relative to GS14K4 by replacing three Val with three Ala (V3/A3), three Leu with three Ala (L3/A3), or all six hydrophobes with Ala (V3L3/A6).Table IPeptide sequences, physical properties, and biological activities of peptides used in this studyPeptideLinear sequence1-aLinear sequences of cyclic peptides.

Similar to GS, GS14 exhibited a CD spectrum with large negative ellipticities at 206 and 223 nm (Fig.1) that is indicative of β-sheet structure in these cyclic peptides (23Kondejewski L.H.

The incorporation of a d-Lys residue in the framework of GS14 (GS14K4) resulted in a CD spectrum more characteristic of a disordered structure under aqueous conditions, indicating disruption of both β-sheet structure and amphipathicity of GS14 (Fig. 1A). The NMR solution structure of GS14K4 has recently been determined in this laboratory and has verified the disruption of ordered structure and amphipathicity and showed that the structural basis for the decreased amphipathicity of GS14K4 is the placement ofd-Lys4 on the hydrophobic face of the molecule (25McInnes C. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14287-14294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All of the GS14K4 hydrophobicity analogs, whether less or more hydrophobic, exhibited CD spectra similar to GS14K4, indicating that all possessed a similar disrupted β-sheet/β-turn conformation under aqueous conditions. In the presence of a hydrophobic structure-inducing solvent such as trifluoroethanol, the spectrum of GS14 was greatly enhanced, indicating a stabilization of the β-sheet structure (Fig. 1B). Also, all of the GS14K4 hydrophobicity analogs exhibited some inducibility of structure in the presence of TFE. The measured negative ellipticities in the presence of TFE showed a correlation with predicted hydrophobicity (Table I) at both 205 nm (r = 0.83) as well as at 220 nm (r = 0.80), indicating that the structure of the more hydrophobic analogs was stabilized more efficiently by TFE (data not shown). These findings suggest that TFE-mediated structure induction in these cyclic peptides is a consequence of interactions between the hydrophobic portion of the alcohol with hydrophobic groups present in the peptides. Similar hydrophobic-hydrophobic peptide-alcohol interactions have been noted with melittin, an α-helical peptide (32Hirota N. Mizuno K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Retention time on RP-HPLC can be used as a measure of peptide hydrophobicity (33Parker J.M. Guo D. Hodges R.S.

Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

Chromatogr. 1998; 816: 79-88Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This can be seen in the comparison of the observed retention times between GS14 and GS14K4 (Table I). Both of these peptides have exactly the same composition and sequence and therefore the same intrinsic hydrophobicity but differ only in structure. The 10.6-min difference in retention times between GS14 and GS14K4 (49.5 and 38.9 min, respectively) showed the differences in the ability of the peptides to form a hydrophobic preferred binding domain and at the same time segregate basic residues to the opposite side of the molecule. Retention time differences between these two molecules were therefore a measure of peptide amphipathicity and showed that GS14K4 has a substantially lower amphipathicity compared with GS14. We have attempted to modulate the hydrophobicity of the present analogs through residue substitutions in the framework of GS14K4 under the assumption that the optimum structural features leading to the optimum amphipathicity present in GS14K4 will also be present in the analogs. As shown in Table I, three of the designed analogs were more hydrophobic than GS14K4, and three analogs were less hydrophobic. A plot of the predicted relative hydrophobicity using RP-HPLC retention time data for the hydrophobicity analogs against their observed retention times (Fig. 2) yielded a linear relationship (r = 1.0), indicating that all of the analogs can present their hydrophobic residues in the same orientation for interaction with the reversed-phase matrix. This indicates that the analogs possessed essentially similar structures in a hydrophobic environment and had a similar relative distribution of hydrophobic and basic residues and only differ in their intrinsic hydrophobicity. Interaction with Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide—Cationic antimicrobial peptides interact initially with negatively charged outer membrane LPS on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria (40Hancock R.E. J.

The interaction of the GS14K4 analogs with bacterial LPS was investigated by monitoring the displacement of LPS-bound dansyl-polymyxin B by the peptides (23Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S.

Agents Chemother. 1986; 29: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); the measured binding affinities are listed in TableI. There was a direct correlation (r = 0.99) between peptide hydrophobicity and LPS binding affinity (Fig.3), indicating that increased peptide hydrophobicity resulted in higher binding affinity to LPS. Comparison of the LPS binding affinity of GS14 with GS14K4, two peptides that only differed in amphipathicity, shows that amphipathicity also played a large role in modulating binding affinity (Table I). Permeabilization of E. coli outer membranes by the analogs was monitored using the hydrophobic fluorescent probe NPN. NPN fluorescence is substantially increased when it is incorporated into the hydrophobic bacterial cell membrane (after permeabilization) compared with its fluorescence in the presence of bacterial cells under nonpermeabilizing conditions (42Loh B.

We investigated the effect of estradiol on global histone acetylation in hormone-responsive human breast cancer cells. Pulse-chase experiments and immunoblot analyses of dynamically acetylated histones show that estradiol rapidly increases histone acetylation in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, hormone-dependent T5, but not in ER-negative, hormone-independent MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells. The effect of estradiol on the rates of histone acetylation and deacetylation in T5 cells was determined. We found that estradiol increased the level of acetylated histones by reducing the rate of histone deacetylation, whereas the rate of histone acetylation was not altered. Enzymatic assays and immunoblot analyses of cell fractions showed that estradiol did not affect the level, subnuclear distribution, or activity of class I and II histone deacetylases. However, estradiol did alter the intranuclear distribution of ER and histone acetyltransferases, with both becoming tightly bound in the nucleus and associated with the nuclear matrix. We propose that, following the association of ER with nuclear matrix sites, ER alters the balance of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases at these sites and the dynamics of acetylation of histones associated with transcriptionally active and competent chromatin.

Transcription factors recruit coactivators with HAT activity to regulatory DNA sites, whereas transcriptional repressors recruit corepressors with HDAC activity (1Davie J.R. Moniwa M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 303-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nucleosomal histones at or near regulatory elements associated with coactivators with HAT activity become highly acetylated, resulting in the remodeling of chromatin structure (1Davie J.R. Moniwa M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 303-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These highly acetylated histones are rapidly deacetylated by HDACs accessing these sites. Dynamically acetylated histones, however, are not confined to regulatory regions but are located along the coding region of genes and, in some cases, with a chromatin domain (2Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 3Davie J.R. Spencer V.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32/33: 141-148Crossref Google Scholar, 4Clayton A.L.

Studies on histone acetylation rates have revealed that in animal cells there are different populations of dynamically acetylated histones. One population is rapidly modified to highly acetylated isoforms (e.g. tetra-acetylated H4) and rapidly deacetylated. This population of dynamically acetylated histones is bound to transcriptionally active and competent DNA (5Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34810-34815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another larger population of acetylated histones is slowly modified to highly acetylated states and slowly deacetylated (6Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol.

Further, avian HDAC1 and mammalian HDAC1 are bound to the nuclear matrix, a nuclear substructure that has a critical role in chromatin organization and function (8Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M.

We proposed a model where nuclear matrix-associated HATs and HDACs mediate a dynamic attachment between transcriptionally active chromatin domains and the nuclear matrix. Estrogen plays an important role in the cell proliferation and stimulation of DNA synthesis in hormone-responsible breast cancer cells. The estrogen receptor α (ER), when bound to estradiol, recruits the coactivator/HATs CBP, PCAF, steroid receptor cofactor (SRC) 1, and SRC-3 to estrogen-responsive elements, resulting in acetylation of histones at and near the site of ER binding (13Chen H.

Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Immediately following the addition of estradiol to hormone-responsive breast cancer cells, ER undergoes a rapid intranuclear redistribution to punctate nuclear foci that are associated with the nuclear matrix (10Stenoien D.L.

Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This alteration in ER intranuclear trafficking is accompanied with the recruitment of the coactivator/HAT SRC-1 to nuclear matrix-associated sites containing ER. In this study we investigated the effect of estradiol on global histone acetylation in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells. A previous study demonstrated that estradiol decreased the level of acetylated histones (16Pasqualini J.R. Mercat P. Giambiagi N. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1989; 14: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations, we found that estradiol rapidly increased the level of acetylated histones. An analysis of the rates of histone acetylation and deacetylation in breast cancer cells cultured in estradiol-depleted and -replete conditions revealed that estradiol decreased the rates of histone deacetylation, but had no effect on the rates of histone acetylation. Evidence is presented that estradiol does not affect the levels or nuclear distribution of HDACs, but it does alter the nuclear distribution of HATs. Human breast cancer cell line T5 (ER-positive and estrogen-dependent) and MDA MB 231 (ER-negative and estrogen-independent) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 5% glucose. Under estrogen-depleted conditions, cells were grown in estrogen-depleted medium, consisting of phenol red-free DMEM (Invitrogen), 7% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 5% glucose as described previously (17Spencer V.A.

Cells were grown in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. To study the effect of estradiol on histone acetylation, T5 cells were grown in estrogen-depleted medium. After 3 days of incubation, T5 cells were grown in the same medium containing cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were incubated in the same medium containing cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and [3H]acetate (0.1 mCi/ml; ICN) in the absence (ethanol vehicle only) or presence of 10 nm estradiol for 20 min. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm butyrate and then harvested. Rates of histone acetylation were determined as described previously (6Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). T5 cells were grown to a confluence of 70–80%. The medium was removed and cells were washed with pre-warmed PBS. The cells were grown in the same medium containing cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cycloheximide was present throughout the labeling period. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times with fresh medium containing [3H]acetate in the absence or presence of 10 nm estradiol. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 10 mm sodium butyrate and 0.1 mm nonradioactive acetate. The cells were chased in the same buffer at 37 °C for various times. Rates of histone deacetylation were determined as described previously (6Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). T5 cells were grown in estrogen-depleted medium for at least 3 days. After two washes with PBS, T5 cells were grown in the same medium containing cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 30 min. The cells were incubated for 120 min in the same medium containing 10 mm butyrate, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and [3H]acetate in the presence or absence of 10 nm estradiol. After labeling, the cells were washed three times with pre-warmed PBS, and incubated in the same medium without butyrate and radioactive acetate, and with or without estradiol for various times. The cells were then washed and harvested. T5 cells were resuspended in TNM buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% thiodiglycol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The cells were lysed by being passed through a syringe with 22-gauge needle. The cytosol and nuclei were isolated from lysed cells after centrifugation at 4500 × g. Nuclei preparations were inspected by microscopic analyses. The nuclei were resuspended in TNM buffer. The nuclei were extracted by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation at 4500 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant, named the Triton X-100 supernatant fraction, or Triton-S, was saved. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of TNM buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100; this fraction was named the Triton X-100 pellet fraction, or Triton-P. Immunoblot analyses was carried out as described previously (9Samuel S.K. Spencer V.A. Bajno L. Sun J.-M. Holth L.T. Oesterreich S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3004-3008PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against human HDAC1 (Affinity Bioreagents Inc. (ABR)), human HDAC2 (ABR), human HDAC3 (ABR), human HDAC4 (Santa Cruz), human SRC-1 (ABR), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human ERα (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.) and SRC-3 (AlB1/RAC3) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were used. Antibodies against PCAF-A and PCAF-B were a kind gift from Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani. Acetylated isoforms of H3 and H4 were detected with polyclonal antibodies to di-acetylated H3 and penta-acetylated H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase assays were performed as described previously (7Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the immediate effect of estradiol (E2) on histone acetylation, T5 cells (ER-positive and hormone-dependent) grown under E2-depleted conditions were incubated with or without E2 and [3H]acetate for 20 min to label dynamically acetylated histones. Comparison of the Coomassie Blue-stained AUT gel patterns shows that histones from E2-incubated cells had slightly increased levels of highly acetylated (di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated) isoforms of H4 (Fig.1A). Relative to the di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated H4 isoforms from cells cultured under E2-depleted conditions, the level of these acetylated H4 isoforms increased by 2.5% in the E2-incubated cells. Analyses of the fluorogram revealed a greater change in the levels of the acetylated histones with the labeled highly acetylated isoforms of H3.2, H2B, and H4 being increased in the E2-incubated cells (Fig. 1A). After scanning the fluorogram, the ratios of the level of labeled highly acetylated histone isoforms (Ac3 and Ac4) to total labeled acetylated H4, H3.2, and H2B were calculated. The percentage of acetylated H4 that was highly acetylated was 9 and 12.5% in histones from cells incubated without and with E2, respectively. The highly acetylated H3 isoforms was 18 and 23% of acetylated H3 in preparations from cells grown without and with E2. The acetylated H2B that was highly acetylated increased to 17%, while being 15% in cells grown without E2. To further illustrate the increase in the level of highly acetylated histones in T5 cells incubated with E2 for 30 min, the histones were analyzed by immunoblot analyses with antibodies recognizing highly acetylated isoforms of H3 (Fig. 1B) and H4 (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1B shows that E2incubation increased the levels of highly acetylated isoforms of H3.2. Similarly, Fig. 1C shows that E2 incubation elevated the levels of highly acetylated H4 isoforms. Together, these results demonstrate that E2 rapidly increases the level of highly acetylated histone isoforms. This study was repeated with the human breast cancer cell line MDA MB 231 (ER-negative and hormone-independent). Analyses of Coomassie Blue-stained AUT gels and accompanying fluorograms demonstrated that incubation of MDA MB 231 cells with E2 did not affect acetylated histone levels (data not shown). The ratio of labeled highly acetylated H4 isoforms to total acetylated H4 in E2-treated MDA MB 231 cells was ∼17.5%, which was very similar to the observed 18% for cells cultured without E2. Immunoblot analyses of histones from cells incubated with and without E2 with antibodies against highly acetylated H4 isoforms showed that E2 did not affect the levels of highly acetylated H4 isoforms in MDA MB 231 (data not shown). These observations suggest that the E2-induced increase in histone acetylation in T5 cells involves the ER. The E2-induced increase in histone acetylation in T5 cells may be a consequence of an increase in histone acetylation rates, a decrease in histone deacetylation rates, or a combination of both. To determine rates of acetylation, T5 cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]acetate for 5 or 15 min. After labeling, the cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C in medium containing sodium butyrate and cold acetate for various times, chasing label into highly acetylated histone isoforms. It should be noted that the cells were grown in E2-replete conditions (DMEM with fetal bovine serum). The AUT gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the labeled acetylated histone isoforms were detected by fluorography (Fig.2A). Long AUT polyacrylamide gels were used in these experiments to achieve high resolution of the acetylated histone isoforms. A population of the acetylated histones is engaged in dynamic acetylation, whereas the remainder is “frozen” at various acetylation states. To determine the percentage of histones that were being rapidly acetylated, the loss of unacetylated H4 was plotted as a function of time that the cells were incubated with sodium butyrate as determined by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown). The results showed that ∼10% of H4 were rapidly acetylated, whereas the bulk of H4 was acetylated at a slow rate. The intensities of labeled H4, H3, and H2B acetylated isoforms in the fluorograms were scanned. Fig. 2B shows the plots of the ratio of monoacetylated H4, H3.2, and H2B isoforms to the total acetylated H4, H3, and H2B, respectively, as a function of time in sodium butyrate. The loss of fluorographic intensity from the monoacetylated histone as a function of time determines the rates of histone acetylation (6Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two rates of acetylation were observed for H4, a fast rate with a t½ = 8 min and slow rate with at½ = 200–350 min. H3.2 also had two rates of acetylation: a fast rate with a t½ = 8 min and a slow rate with a t½ = 400 min. The two acetylated rates for H2B were t½ = 10 and 350 min. These rates of acetylation are comparable with those observed in rat hepatoma cells, human fibroblasts, and avian erythrocytes (6Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Horiuchi K. Fujimoto D. Fukushima M. Kanai K. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1488-1491PubMed Google Scholar). To decide whether E2 affects histone acetylation rates, the pulse-chase experiment was repeated with T5 cells grown under E2-replete (10 nm E2) and -depleted conditions. The cells grown under E2-depleted conditions were incubated with [3H]acetate and ethanol or E2 at 37 °C for 15 min, and chased in the same medium containing 10 mm butyrate with ethanol or E2for various times. Electrophoresis and fluorography were performed as described previously. The loss of unacetylated H4 was plotted as a function of time that the cells were cultured with sodium butyrate and with or without E2, as determined by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown). The results showed that 14.0 ± 2.0 and 11.0 ± 1.0% of H4 (n = 3) was rapidly acetylated in cells incubated without and with E2, respectively. The fluorograms were scanned, and the loss of fluorographic intensity from the monoacetylated histone as a function of time was plotted (Fig.3). The fast rates of acetylation of monoacetylated H4 were similar in cells grown in the presence or absence of E2 (t½ = 8versus 7 min, respectively). Additionally, the slow rates of acetylation of monoacetylated H4 were similar for cells grown under E2-replete and -depleted conditions (t½ = 380 versus 320 min, respectively). Similar results were obtained for H3.2 and H2B. These results show that E2 does not affect the rates of histone acetylation in T5 cells. The effect of E2 on histone deacetylation rates was determined. T5 cells were grown in E2-depleted conditions for 3 days. Thirty min following the addition of cycloheximide, T5 cells were incubated with 10 mm butyrate, [3H]acetate, and with or without 10 nmE2 at 37 °C for 2 h. After removal of butyrate, cells were incubated in fresh medium replaced with or without E2 for 0–240 min to monitor histone deacetylation. A comparison of the fluorograms shown in Fig.4 (A and B) revealed that E2-incubated cells had a slower rate of deacetylation for the core histones. The fluorograms were scanned, and the loss of fluorographic intensity from the tetra-acetylated H4 (Fig.4C) and acetylated H3.2 (Fig. 4D) as a function of time was plotted. The rate of deacetylation of tetra-acetylated H4 was rapid, with the intensity of hyperacetylated H4 decreasing significantly after 20 min following the removal of sodium butyrate. The rate of H4-Ac4 deacetylation was appreciably slower in E2-incubated cells. The rates of H4-Ac4 deacetylation weret½ = 8 and 3 min for cells cultured with and without E2, respectively. The rate of deacetylation of H3.2 was also significantly reduced in E2-incubated cells (t½ = 6 versus 3 min in cells without E2) (Fig. 4D). T5 cells were grown under E2-replete conditions for 20 min with or without E2, [3H]acetate, and sodium butyrate to compare the effect of E2 on the hyperacetylation state of histones in the absence of HDAC activity. Analysis of the fluorogram showed that the levels of hyperacetylated histones were similar in cells grown with and without E2(data not shown). These results show that E2 has an effect on histone deacetylation, but not on histone acetylation, in T5 breast cancer cells. The addition of E2 to T5 cells may result in a decline in HDAC levels and/or HDAC activity. The levels of ER and HDAC in cells incubated with or without E2 for different times were analyzed by immunoblotting. The conditions for treating the cells were the same as those used in the deacetylation pulse-chase experiments. Fig. 5 shows the immunoblot analyses of cell lysates with antibodies to ER and HDAC1. After 2 h of incubation with E2 and in the absence of butyrate, ER levels declined. Note that this time period corresponds to cells being incubated for 4 h with E2 and 4.5 h with cycloheximide. This result is consistent with previous studies reporting that E2 increases ER degradation rates (22Eckert R.L. Mullick A. Rorke E.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, HDAC1 levels were not altered. Identical results were obtained with HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC4 (see Fig.6). Thus, the decrease in histone deacetylation rates is not a consequence of a decline in HDAC levels.Figure 6Estradiol affects the intranuclear distribution of ER, but not HDAC, in T5 cells. T5 cells were cultured with or without 10 nm E2 at 37 °C for 20 min. Equal volumes (10 μl) of cell fractions: cell lysate (lanes 1 and 6), cytosol (lanes 2 and7), nuclei (lanes 3 and 8), Triton-S (lanes 4 and 9), and Triton-P (lanes 5and 10), were loaded onto SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

The cells were grown in E2-depleted medium for 3 days and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm E2 for 20 min. The HDAC activity in the lysates from cells incubated with and without E2 were identical (data not shown). Thus, E2 does not have an effect on the HDAC levels and activity in T5 cells. Our studies presented above demonstrated that the E2-induced reduction in histone deacetylation rates was not a consequence of an alteration in HDAC levels or activity. We tested the idea that E2 altered the subcellular distribution of HDAC. Cells were lysed in TNM buffer without any detergents to minimize loosely bound nuclear proteins from leaking out of the nuclei. The nuclei were resuspended in TNM buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice to release loosely bound nuclear proteins (Triton-S fraction). The resulting pellet contained the tightly bound nuclear proteins, which includes proteins associated with the nuclear matrix (Triton-P). The distribution of ER in the cell fractions from the cells treated with or without E2 for 20 min was determined by immunoblot analyses. ER levels in the lysates from cells incubated with and without E2 did not change (Fig. 6A, comparelane 1 with lane 6). Most ER was in the nuclear fraction. However, the cytosol fraction from cells incubated without E2 had higher levels of ER than did the corresponding fraction from cells incubated with E2. As ER is located primarily in the nucleus, the ER in cytosol represents ER that was loosely bound in the nucleus. Fractionation of the nuclear proteins into those that were loosely bound from those that were tightly bound revealed a shift in the intranuclear partitioning of ER following the addition of E2. Comparison of the ER levels in the Triton-S and Triton-P fractions showed that, after 20 min E2, ER became tightly bound to the nucleus. This observation is agreement with previous reports (10Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar, 15Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Further, others and we have demonstrated that the tightly bound form of ER is associated with the nuclear matrix (10Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar, 15Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The distribution of class I HDACs among the cellular fractions was determined by immunoblot analyses with antibodies against human HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. Fig. 6A shows that E2 had little affect on the fractionation of these HDACs. Most HDAC1 and HDAC2 were present in the nuclei. Triton X-100 released only a small amount of HDAC1 and HDAC2 from the nuclei. In low stringency immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that most HDAC2 was in complex with HDAC1. However, HDAC1 was in excess of HDAC2; thus, a population of HDAC1 is not in complex with HDAC2. Further, we found that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were associated with the nuclear matrix (data not shown). HDAC3 was also in the nuclear fraction, and approximately half of HDAC3 was associated with the tightly bound nuclear protein fraction. This result agrees with the findings that HDAC1 and -2 exist in different complexes than those that contain HDAC3 (1Davie J.R. Moniwa M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 303-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HDAC3 was associated with the nuclear matrix (data not shown). In contrast to the class I HDACs, the class II HDAC4 was found exclusively in the loosely bound nuclear protein fraction (Fig. 6). It is possible that the HDAC3 in this fraction is in complex with HDAC4 (24Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). As expected from the lack of HDAC4 in the Triton-P fraction, HDAC4 was not associated with the nuclear matrix (data not shown). However, as with the class I HDACs, E2 did not have an effect on the fractionation of HDAC4. The immunoblot analyses showed the fractionation of several known HDACs. However, the HDAC family of proteins is complex (1Davie J.R. Moniwa M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 303-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured HDAC activities in the nuclei and nuclear fractions, Triton-S and Triton-P. Fig. 6B shows that most nuclear HDAC activity was present in the tightly bound nuclear fraction and that E2 did not affect the distribution of nuclear HDAC activity. An E2-induced alteration in the subcellular trafficking of HATs may also change the histone deacetylase rates (see “Discussion”). HAT activity assays were done with cell lysate, cytosol, nuclei, loosely bound, and tightly bound nuclear fractions from T5 cells incubated with and without E2. Fig. 7A shows that the HAT activity in the lysed cell fractions from cells treated with or without E2 did not significantly change. However, the HAT activity of nuclei from cells incubated with E2 was greater than that of nuclei from cells grown without E2(Fig. 7B). Fractionation of the nuclear fraction showed both the loosely bound and tightly bound nuclear proteins had HAT activity. However, the tightly bound nuclear proteins demonstrated a differential HAT activity with preparations isolated from cells grown with and without E2. After 20 min of E2 incubation, there was an increase in the HAT activity associated with the Triton-P, tightly bound nuclear protein fraction. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to known HATs was done with the intent to identify the HAT responsible for the increased activity in the Triton-P fraction of E2-incubated cells. SRC-1 was located primarily in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 7C). Triton X-100 released less SRC-1 from nuclei in cells treated with E2 than from nuclei of cells treated without E2(Fig. 7C, compare lane 4 with lane 5, and lane 9 with lane 10). These results with SRC-1 are in agreement with those of Mancini and colleagues (10Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar), who analyzed the effect of E2 and ER on the subnuclear trafficking of a bioluminescent derivative of SRC-1 in HeLa cells. The partitioning of SRC-3 (AlB1/RAC3/ACTR) was similar to that of SRC-1, except that SRC-3 was also detected in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 7C). Following 20 min of incubation with E2, there was an increased amount of SRC-3 in the Triton-P fraction. The effect of E2 on the subcellular distribution of the HATs CBP, PCAF-A, and PCAF-B (long form of Gcn5; Ref. 25Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M37-M53Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was also determined. Fig. 7C shows that E2 did not affect the distribution of these HATs among the cellular fractions. Most CBP, PCAF-A, and PCAF-B were present in the tightly bound nuclear protein fraction, suggesting that these transcriptional coactivators/HATs are predominantly associated with the nuclear matrix. Indeed, we observed that these HATs were associated with the nuclear matrix (data not shown). These studies show that E2 has an effect on the intranuclear distribution of SRC-1 and SRC-3, but not CBP, PCAF-A, and PCAF-B, in T5 cells. Estradiol rapidly elevates the level of acetylated histones in ER-positive, hormone-dependent, but not in ER-negative, hormone-independent breast cancer cells. Our results are in striking contrast to those of Pasqualini et al. (16Pasqualini J.R. Mercat P. Giambiagi N. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1989; 14: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), who observed a decrease in histone acetylation following a 20-min incubation of MCF-7 cells with estradiol. Differences in media conditions, histone isolation procedure, and the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor during the labeling period may explain the discrepancy in results. Approximately 60–70% of H4 and H3 were acetylated in human breast cancer T5 cells. These acetylated histones fall into at least three groups: those that are “frozen” in an acetylated state, those that are rapidly acetylated and deacetylated, and those that are slowly acetylated and deacetylated. The latter group comprises the bulk of the dynamically acetylated histones. The rapidly acetylated and deacetylated histones represent ∼10% of the dynamically acetylated histones in T5 cells. The rapidity of the effect of E2 on histone acetylation suggests that histones undergoing rapid acetylation and deacetylation are the population of dynamically acetylated histones being most affected (4Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that E2 decreased the rates of histone deacetylation, but had no effect on histone acetylation rates, in T5 cells. Analyses of the activities of HDACs and HATs showed that the net activities of either group of enzymes were not affected by E2. However, biochemical fractionation studies indicated that the intranuclear distribution of HATs, including SRC-1 and SRC-3, were affected by E2. When presented with E2, ER rapidly locates to specific nuclear matrix sites, binds to estrogen response elements (EREs), and recruits with it SRC-1 and SRC-3 (10Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar,12Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat.

Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). As SRC-1 and SRC-3 acetylate primarily H3, other HATs that acetylate the other core histones would also be recruited by ER bound to E2 to account for the increased acetylation of H2B and H4 that we observe. Elegant studies by the Evans and Brown groups (13Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 14Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) demonstrate that CBP is recruited to EREs. CBP will acetylate the four core histones (3Davie J.R. Spencer V.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32/33: 141-148Crossref Google Scholar,26Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). However, our biochemical fractionation studies were unable to detect E2-induced intranuclear redistribution of CBP. Possibly, ER and the EREs are recruited to the nuclear matrix sites containing CBP (27Thorburn A. Knowland J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that most characterized EREs of breast cancer estrogen-responsive genes have the ERE (½) (N)x Sp1 (a half-site ERE positioned next to a Sp1 site) motif ERE (28Samudio I. Vyhlidal C. Wang F. Stoner M. Chen I. Kladde M. Barhoumi R. Burghardt R. Safe S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been determined experimentally that there are 1.86 × 105 ER molecules/cell in T5 cells (29Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, ER is in far excess to estrogen-responsive genes. The association of Sp1 with ER presents the possibility that Sp1 will recruit ER to Sp1 sites in promoters and enhancers (30Porter W. Saville B. Hoivik D. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Further, we have found that, as with ER-E2, Sp1 is associated with the nuclear matrix of T5 cells. It is conceivable that by binding to nuclear matrix site ER when bound to E2, ER alters the balance of HATs and HDACs and the dynamics of acetylation of histones associated with transcriptionally active and competent chromatin domains. We have shown previously that HAT and HDAC activities are associated with the nuclear matrix (7Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Samuel S.K. Spencer V.A. Bajno L. Sun J.-M. Holth L.T. Oesterreich S. Davie J.R.

In this study we found that HDAC1, -2, and -3, but not HDAC4, are bound to the nuclear matrix of human breast cancer T5 cells. Further, we observed that the HATs CBP, PCAF-A, and PCAF-B are nuclear matrix-associated, and Mancini and colleagues (10Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar) reported that SRC-1 is bound to this nuclear substructure. We have proposed a model in which nuclear matrix-associated HATs and HDACs mediate a dynamic attachment between transcriptionally active chromatin domains and the nuclear matrix. In support of this model, we recently reported that the dynamically rapidly acetylated and deacetylated histones, referred to as class 1 acetylated histones, are bound to nuclear matrix-associated coding regions of transcriptionally active and competent genes in avian immature erythrocytes (5Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34810-34815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Further, we have shown that highly acetylated H3 and H4 are bound to the coding regions of E2-inducible ER and c-myc genes (31Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Davie J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although the dynamics of the histones associated with these genes were not determined, our work and that of Grunstein's group suggest that these histones are dynamically acetylated by HATs and HDACs (2Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol.

We propose that ER bound to E2 alters the balance of HATs and HDACs at specific nuclear matrix sites, which are associated with transcriptionally active and competent chromatin regions in T5 cells. When bound to E2, ER would recruit HATs altering the balance of HATs and HDACs at those sites. The HDACs at these sites would be confronted with greater amounts of acetylated histone substrates, requiring a longer time to deacetylate the acetylated histones (Fig. 8). Hence, this may explain the slower rates of deacetylation in cells incubated with E2 and the increase in the level of dynamically acetylated histones. We are grateful to Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) for anti-PCAF A and B antibodies."

Our data suggest convergent evolutionary adaptations that underlie the preferential expression of crystallin genes in the lens of vertebrates and invertebrates. aldehyde dehydrogenase cAMP-responsive element-binding protein Different theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of the eye. Morphological differences between eyes in various species have been considered as evidence that they arose independently many times during evolution (1Salvini-Plawer L.V. Mayr E. Evol. Biol. 1977; 10: 207-263Google Scholar). More recently, similar developmental features, especially the critical importance of Pax-6, have suggested that all eyes were derived from a common prototype (2Gehring W.J. Ikeo K. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This is consistent with rhodopsin being the visual pigment used in both vertebrates and invertebrates (3Eakin R.M. Am. Zool. 1979; 19: 647-653Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Yokoyama S. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The diversity of the lens crystallins, the major water-soluble proteins responsible for the optical properties of the transparent lens, presents an unusual and perplexing problem. Although some crystallins (the α- and β/γ-crystallins) are present in all vertebrate lenses, others (the enzyme crystallins) are found only in certain species, a situation called taxon specificity (5Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 6de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A.M. Voorter C.E.M. Mol. Biol.

The enzyme crystallins are related or identical to metabolic enzymes and are present in the lenses of both vertebrates and invertebrates (8Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A common theme among many, but not all, lens crystallins is their stress connection. This was first noted for the α-crystallins that are members of the small heat shock protein family (9Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). A critical point is that in many cases the lens crystallin is encoded in the same gene that is expressed in other tissues, where the protein serves a metabolic or stress protective role. This dual use of the same gene has been called gene sharing (10Piatigorsky J. O'Brien W.E. Norman B.L. Kalumuck K. Wistow G.J. Borras T. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3479-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11Piatigorsky J. Wistow G. Cell. 1989; 57: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The recruitment of lens crystallins by gene sharing implies that the evolutionary process was driven by changes in the promoter/enhancer regions rather than in the coding regions. The basis for recruiting a particular protein as a lens crystallin during evolution is not known. The fact that many are derived from proteins providing stress protection or enzymatic function (often detoxification) suggests that their recruitment may have fixed those genes whose encoded proteins could counter metabolic stress or environmental signals (6de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A.M. Voorter C.E.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar, 11Piatigorsky J. Wistow G. Cell. 1989; 57: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The possibility has also been advanced that the regulatory mechanism used for the expression of different crystallin genes in the lens may have common properties despite differences in the nature of the encoded proteins (12Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4277-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If correct, one might expect to find similar transcription factors utilized for high expression of different crystallin genes in the lens. This idea is supported by experiments using transgenic mice showing the conservation of preferential lens activity of numerous crystallin promoters across vertebrate species (13Kondoh H. Katoh K.

Comparisons between regulatory sequences associated with different crystallin genes of vertebrates have revealed a group of ubiquitous transcription factors (AP-1, USF, CREB, and Sp1) as well as other more specialized factors like Pax-6, Maf, Sox, retinoic acid receptor/RXR, and αACRYBP1 (19Piatigorsky J.

S-crystallins (24Siezen R.J. Shaw D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 304-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the principal crystallins of cephalopod (squid, octopus) lenses, are related to glutathioneS-transferase (25Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Science. 1987; 236: 1554-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26Tomarev S.I. Zinovieva R.D. Nature. 1988; 336: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The squid S20-crystallin promoter contains a functional consensus AP-1-binding site that overlaps with an antioxidant response element similar to that in the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter (27Tomarev S.I. Duncan M.K. Roth H.J. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 134-143PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of this AP-1/antioxidant response element for activity of these squid and chicken crystallin promoters in transfected chicken lens suggested that similar cis-control signals may be used for the preferential lens expression of crystallin genes of vertebrates and invertebrates. More recently, a retinoic acid receptor, jRXR, was cloned from a cubomedusan jellyfish and shown to bind the crystallin promoters of this species (28Kostrouch Z. Kostrouchova M. Love W. Jannini E.

It is also noteworthy that ALDH class 3 is the major water-soluble, intracellular protein of most mammalian corneas (36Abedinia M. Pain T. Algar E.M. Holmes R.S. Exp.

Here we characterize the structure and promoter activity of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene. Its exon-intron structure is consistent with its close homology to the ALDH class 1/2 protein family. Comparative sequence analysis and transfection experiments revealed similarities between the scallop Ω-crystallin, squid S-crystallin, and vertebrate αA-crystallin promoters, raising the possibility that there are common mechanisms employed for the lens-specific expression of crystallin genes in vertebrates and invertebrates. Sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) were obtained from the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). The two shells were separated by cutting the adductor muscle with scissors. The eyes were removed from the mantle under the microscope with surgical scissors, and the other tissues were excised with a scalpel. The tissues were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. High molecular weight DNA was extracted from the scallop stomach, and the tissue was homogenized under liquid N2 and suspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. After a digestion with proteinase K the DNA was extracted as described elsewhere (39Ross J. Gielen J. Packman S. Ikawa Y. Leder P. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 697-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking sequence of the Ω-crystallin gene was amplified by PCR using a 3′ primer from exon 1 (PSG5–7601 5′-GTA CAA TCT GGT ATC AGA GGA ATC AAG ACT G-3′) (accession number AF175578) and a 5′ adaptor primer (AP-1) by employing the genome walking kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The adaptor sequences were ligated to the ends of restriction enzyme-digested scallop genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. After digestion withDraI, the product was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and a 2191-bp fragment was extracted and TA-ligated to the pCR2.1 topo cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids were screened by digestion with restriction endonucleases, and the inserts were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method with dye terminators followed by analysis on an ABI 310 sequencing system (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The genome walker kit method was also utilized to determine the genomic structure of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene using synthetic oligonucleotides derived from exons 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, and 14. For this two rounds of PCR amplification were done, the first using a gene-specific oligonucleotide and AP-1 as primers, and the second using a nested gene-specific oligonucleotide and AP-2 (CLONTECH) as primers. The introns between exons 2 and 3, exons 3 and 4, and exons 8 and 11 were amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides specific to each exon, TA-cloned in pCR2.1, and sequenced. A 2191-bp genomic fragment of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene was cut from pCRII-scALDHpro byEcoRI-flanking restriction enzyme and ligated into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to construct pGL3-scALDH−2120/+63 (sense orientation) and pGL3-scALDH+63/−2120 (reverse orientation). The promoter fragments in pGL3-scALDH−714/+63 and pGL3-scALDH−156/+63 were derived from pGL3-scALDH−2120/+63. The Mut1–11, Mut417, and Mut420 mutants were generated by PCR with 5′ and 3′ primers carrying the mutations described in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 using pGL3-scALDH−156/+63 as template and the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pGL3αApro366 was constructed by digesting the 412-bp mouse promoter fragment from pMαACr1800 (40Chepelinsky A.B.

The cells were transfected in 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes with Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 1.8 μg of the specified plasmids containing various Ω-crystallin promoter fragment firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs and 100 ng of pRL-SV40 containing Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase (Promega). After 48 h of culture the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with the passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase (LAA) and Renilla luciferase (LAR) activities were measured sequentially using a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega) and a model Monolight 3010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). The relative luciferase activity was calculated as LAA/LAR. Transfections were performed in duplicate, and the average values from at least three experiments are shown. αTN4-1, L929, and Cos7 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, and a mix of protease inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C. All extracts were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a buffer containing: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 42 mm(NH4)2SO4. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed with their complement, and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Bio-Rad); the CREB-binding site corresponded to positions −109/−86 (5′-AGC TAC AGT TCA TGA CGT AAT CGT TGA-3′); the AP-1-binding site corresponded to positions −58/−39 (AP-1 5′-AGC TCC TGC TTT AAT CAA CAT AAG-3′); the αACRYBP1-binding site corresponded to positions −73/−53 (5′-AGC TCA TGA GCG GAT GTA CCT GCT-3′); the ALDH Pax6-binding sites corresponded to positions −65/−30 (site 1, CGGATGTACCTGCTTTAATCAACATAAGTGGTATG) and positions −106/−73 (site 2, GTTCATGACGTAATCGTTGATTGCGCACCTCTT), respectively. The Pax6-binding sites derived from chicken αA-crystallin (−60/−29, CCCACTAATGCCTTCATTCTGCGAGTGC), chicken βB1- crystallin (region PL2, GCACAGACACTGATGAGCTGGCACTTCCAT), and mouse αB-crystallin (region LSR1, GCTCAGTGAGTACCGGGTATGTGTCACCCTGC), respectively, were used for electromobility shift assay. The expression vectors encoding murine Pax6 was transfected into COP-8 fibroblasts, and protein extracts for electromobility shift assay were prepared as described (46Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human ATF2 and CREM were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Electromobility shift assay was performed using extracts of the mammalian cells containing 14 μg of protein or of scallop tissues containing 28 μg of protein in the binding buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 15% glycerol, 0.3 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Protein-DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on prerun 4% polyacrylamide/0.5× Tris borate-EDTA gels, dried, and autoradiographed. The exon-intron structure of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene was determined by sequence analysis of PCR and genome walking products (Fig.1A). The PCR fragments were obtained with synthetic oligonucleotides derived from exons 2 and 3, exons 3 and 4, and exons 8 and 11. In addition, fragments containing sequences from exons 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, and 14 were obtained using the genome walker kit. The Ω-crystallin gene is split into 14 exons that are distributed over more than 12 kb of DNA. The translation start codon is located in the second exon, and the stop codon is in exon 14. The first, untranslated exon is 64 bp long. A comparison of the genomic organization of scallop Ω-crystallin and human ALDH genes indicated that the position of the introns in the scallop gene is similar to that in the ALDH1/2/6 gene family (Fig.1B) (47Hsu L.C. Bendel R.E. Yoshida A. Genomics. 1988; 2: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 48Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Yoshida A.

Rzhetsky A. Hsu L.C. Chang C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The exon sizes of the Ω-crystallin gene are closer to the ALDH1 and ALDH6 genes than to the ALDH2 gene, despite the fact that the sequence of Ω-crystallin is more similar to human ALDH2 (67% identical) than to ALDH1 (64%) or ALDH6 (61%) (31Piatigorsky J. Kozmik Z. Horwitz J. Ding L. Carosa E. Robison Jr., W.G. Steinbach P.J. Tamm E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41064-41073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the scallop gene contains an additional 5′-untranslated exon whose sequence is not obviously related to other ALDHs (data not shown). Southern blotting of genomic DNA was used to estimate the number of genes encoding scallop Ω-crystallin. A cDNA probe containing exons 2–6 (Fig. 1C, 2-6p) was hybridized toHindIII-digested scallop DNA. Four bands (6.5, 4.8, 4.5, and 2 kilobase pair) were visible after high stringency washes (Fig.1C, gel 2). No extra bands were present when the blot was exposed immediately after an initial low stringency wash (Fig.1C, gel 1). When exon 3 (Fig. 1C,gel 3) or exon 4 (data not shown) was used as a probe, only the 2-kilobase pair DNA fragment hybridized. By contrast, only the 4.5-kilobase pair fragment hybridized to a probe restricted to the noncoding region of exon 2 (Fig. 1C, gel 4). These results are consistent with the existence of a single copy gene encoding Ω-crystallin in the scallop. A 2120-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene was cloned (Fig. 1A) using the genome walker kit from CLONTECH and sequenced (Fig.2). The Ω-crystallin promoter contains a TATA sequence 25 bp from the putative transcription initiation site. Several potential binding sites for transcription factors were identified in the 5′ region of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene; these included two Pax6 and AP-1, three USF, two NKx25, and one CREB/Jun, Oct1, and Sox5 DNA-binding motifs (Fig. 2). Initial sequence comparisons revealed little gross similarity between the scallop Ω-crystallin promoter and that of other crystallin or mammalian ALDH genes (data not shown). This 5′-flanking sequence of the scallop Ω-crystallin gene has been submitted to GenBankTM. Because Ω-crystallin is expressed so highly in the scallop lens, we searched the 5′-flanking sequence for putative binding sites of transcription factors that are known to be important for lens-specific promoter activity of vertebrate crystallin genes in transgenic mice (20Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Using this method for comparison, unexpected similarities were found between the scallop Ω-crystallin promoter and that of the mouse and chicken αA-crystallin gene (Fig.3). Previous investigations have implicated CREB/CREM, AP-1, Pax-6, L-Maf, USF, retinoic acid receptor/RXR, and αACRYBP1 for the lens-preferred activity of the mouse and chicken αA-crystallin promoters in transgenic mice (20Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,51Hejtmancik J.F. Kaiser M. Piatigorsky J. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 6033-6061Google Scholar). Because scallop cell lines are not available, we transfected mammalian cells to test Ω-crystallin promoter function. Three constructs containing different sizes or orientations of scallop Ω-crystallin promoter fragments cloned in front of the firefly luciferase reporter gene were used for transient transfections of αTN4-1 mouse lens cells, L929 mouse fibroblasts, and Cos7 monkey kidney cells (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, all three plasmids containing the truncated scallop Ω-crystallin promoter fragments (pGL3-sc−2120/+63, pGL3-sc−714/+63, and pGL3-sc−156/+63) were about three times more active than the control plasmid containing the mouse αA366-crystallin promoter (pGL3αApro366) in the transfected αTN4-1 lens cells. pGL3-sc+63/−2120, which carries the 2120-bp scallop promoter fragment in the reverse orientation with respect to the luciferase reporter gene, was inactive in the transfected αTN4-1 cells. In contrast to the lens-specific pGL3αApro366 mouse αA-crystallin promoter, the scallop promoters were active in the mouse L929 fibroblast cell line. However, the scallop Ω-crystallin and mouse αA-crystallin promoters were inactive in the Cos7 cells; by contrast, the control SV40 promoter functioned well in the transfected Cos7 cells. Thus, the Ω-crystallin promoter fragments are functional and display some lens preference in the transfected mammalian cells, although less so than the mouse αA-crystallin promoter, under the present conditions. Site-specific mutations were made to test the functional significance of the putative CREB/Jun, αACRYBP1, and AP-1 sites of the scallop Ω-crystallin promoter (Fig.5, upper right panel). For the CREB/Jun-binding site, five point mutations were introduced into the sequence from −102 to −94 on the pGL3-scALDH−156/+63. The mutated constructs were tested for promoter activity in transfected αTN4-1 (Fig. 5, upper left panel) and L929 (Fig. 5, lower left panel) cells. One mutation (Mut5) created the same 3′ sequence as in the analogous CREB/CREM site in the mouse αA-crystallin promoter, although the 5′ nucleotide still differs in this motif in the scallop Ω-crystallin and mouse αA-crystallin promoters. The other mutations (Mut1-Mut4) introduced differences within the center of the CREB consensus sequence (Fig. 5, upper right panel). Mut1, Mut3, and Mut4 reduced but did not abolish the activity of the Ω-crystallin promoter i"

In its mature form the human protein spans residues 23–231 of the polypeptide predicted from cDNA sequence and exists under diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and unglycosylated species. PrPC is composed of an N-terminal unstructured domain, which contains four copies of an octapeptide sequence (PHGGGWGQ) between residues 60 and 91, and a C-terminal region with two short β-sheet structures of four residues each and three α-helical regions (5Pan K.-M.

Previous studies have identified the octarepeat sequence as a Cu2+ binding motif and have assessed that, in the presence of copper, each octapeptide forms an α-helix and acts as an α-helical formation promoter on the region comprising residues 84–103 (8Miura T.

Copper binding stoichiometry is pH-dependent: four octapeptides chelate four Cu2+ at pH 7.4, but bind only two Cu2+ at pH 6. Under acidic conditions, Cu2+ is bound by two histidine residues of different octapeptides, whereas the His-triglycine segment of a single octapeptide represents the binding site at pH 7.4 (9Miura T.

In addition, based on the occupancy of the N-glycosylation sites or the ratio of the three PK-resistant PrPSc glycoforms (diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and un-glycosylated), further biochemical types of PrPSc have been classified (14Collinge J.

Parchi et al.(15Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann.

On the contrary, Wadsworth et al.(18Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) were able to characterize three PrPSc types after separation on 16% Tris-glycine gels, with type 1 found in subjects of the MM genotype, type 2 in all genotypes, and type 3 only in MV or VV genotypes. These three types of PrPSc are further distinguished based on their metal-ion occupancy. Type 1 and type 2 PrPSc upon metal-ion chelation undergo conformational changes that expose an apparently common PK cleavage site, whereas type 3 is unaffected by metal chelators (18Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Given the well known influence of pH on PrPC conformation and the lack of reports addressing the influence of pH on the conformational stability of PrPSc, we undertook a biochemical study on sCJD PrPSc in an attempt to assess pH-dependent strain-specific conformations.RESULTSWe first used conventional Western blot methods, with lysis buffer at pH 7.4, to analyze protease-resistant PrPSc in all cases. Based upon the banding pattern of the three PK-resistant PrPSc species and the apparent molecular mass of the core fragment, two types of PrPSc were observed. In 24 subjects (MM and VV genotypes), PK-cleavage products of the three PrPSc glycoforms migrated at ∼30, 27, and 21 kDa (Fig.1, lane 1), all of them shifting to a 21-kDa zone upon deglycosylation (Fig. 1, lane 3), whereas in 18 subjects (MM, MV, VV genotypes) PK-resistant PrPSc species were resolved at ∼28, 26, and 19 kDa (Fig.1, lane 2), with enzymatic deglycosylation yielding a band at ∼19 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4). When we investigated the physicochemical properties of these two types of PrPSc at pH values other than 7.4, three patterns could be distinguished, based on the size of PK cleavage products.In 15 subjects (MM and VV) with the 21-kDa PrPSc, hereafter designated as group 1, the cleavage products of the three PrPSc bands, corresponding to the di-, mono-, and unglycosylated PK-resistant PrPSc, as obtained at pH 4 and 6, had a molecular mass value ∼1.5 kDa higher than digestion fragments generated at pH 7.4; conversely, when the samples were solubilized in lysis buffer at pH 8, the three PK-resistant PrPSc glycoforms showed a faster migration, corresponding to an additional loss of ∼1 kDa as compared with species generated at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2, A andB). The possibility of a direct pH influence on the electrophoretic mobility of PrPSc was ruled by exposing PK-treated and untreated samples to low and high pH before electrophoretic separation. Subjects of group 1 had a distinct clinical course with early dementia, myoclonus, and periodic sharp-wave electroencephalographic activity, overlapping the typical myoclonic sCJD variant, or cortical visual disturbances, consistent with the Heidenhain variant. These two sCJD variants represent clinical phenotypes of the classical form (17Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schultz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar).Figure 2Western immunoblots with 3F4 antibody of PrPSc followingPKtreatment in the region of pH 4–8.The frontal cortex (A, C, E) and cerebellar cortex (B, D, F) from representative sCJD subjects of group 1 (A, B), group 2 (C, D), and group 3 (E,F) are shown. On the top, pH values of lysis buffer are indicated; molecular masses are shown in kilodaltons on both sides. The size of PK-resistant PrPSc products is affected by acidic and basic pH only in group 1 subjects, but not in groups 2 and 3. G–I show that the molecular mass of the PK-resistant deglycosylated PrPSc is sensitive to pH changes only in group 1; these results suggest that the conformation of both glycosylated and unglycosylated PrPSc in group 1 is pH-dependent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In marked contrast, in 9 subjects, MM genotypes and termed group 2, with the PK-resistant fragment of 21 kDa, the migration of digestion products was insensitive to variations in pH (Fig. 2, C andD). In these cases the three glycoforms migrated to zones of ∼30, 27, and 21 kDa either at low or high pH. At variance with group 1, subjects of this group had an ataxic-dementing sCJD variant of longer duration. Our findings suggest that the physicochemical properties of PrPSc in group 1 and group 2, although apparently similar when examined at pH 7.4, may be further distinguished upon conformational changes induced by acidic and basic pH values.In sCJD subjects (MM, MV, and VV genotypes, group 3) with the 19-kDa core fragment, treatment at different pH values did not affect the molecular masses of PrPSc species generated by PK digestion (Fig. 2, E and F).The results obtained in each single subject were highly reproducible in at least three repetitions for a given sample and were detected in all investigated brain regions.To confirm that changes in migration similarly affected glycosylated and unglycosylated PrPSc species, we examined PK digestion products after removal of sugar chains. As expected, changes in pH affected only the migration of the PrPSc core fragment of group 1 subjects (Fig. 2G), whereas the size of the PrPSc core fragment of group 2 (Fig. 2H) and 3 (Fig. 2I) subjects was unchanged.To gain insight into whether naturally occurring species of the PrPSc types detected in the three groups differed in their polypeptide backbone, detergent-insoluble PrPSc-enriched fractions were prepared from the frontal cortex of each case and analyzed by immunoblots. In group 1 subjects, the insoluble PrPSc had an intact N-terminal region, as suggested by comparable signal intensities with 3F4 and 5B2 antibodies (Fig.3, lanes 1 and 2). Conversely, the remaining cases of groups 2 and 3 were all characterized by prevailing amounts of truncated PrPScfragments, as suggested by a more intense signal with 3F4 (Fig. 3,lanes 4 and 6) as compared with anti-N antibody (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5), reflecting the presence of additional bands which lack the N-terminal region. These results suggest that the PrPSc is mostly present under full-length isoforms in group 1, whereas it is mostly recovered under N-terminally truncated fragments in groups 2 and 3. Accordingly, we designated the three types of PrPSc as type-1full-length (FL), type-2truncated (T)and type-3T.Figure 3Detergent insolubility of PrPScinsCJDbrains. PrPSc was sedimented by high speed centrifugation and immunoblotted, after SDS-PAGE, with 5B2 (lanes 1, 3, and 5) and 3F4 (lanes 2,4, and 6) antibodies. In sCJD brains from group 2 (lane 4) and group 3 (lane 6), but not from group 1 (lane 2), there are significant amounts of truncated PrPSc fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, the PrPSc bands of group 1, named type-1FL, naturally occur as full-length species, change in conformation over the pH range 4–8, and migrate to a 21-kDa zone after PK treatment at pH 7.4 and enzymatic deglycosylation. Conversely, type-2T of group 2 and type-3T detected in group 3 mostly exist as N-terminally truncated fragments, show no response to pH, and generate PK-resistant PrPSc core fragments of 21 and 19 kDa, respectively.Based on physicochemical properties of our three PrPSctypes under the same experimental conditions of Parchi et al. (15Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann.

Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) (see all lanes at pH 7.4 of Fig. 2, A–I), it is evident that both type-1FL and type-2Tcorrespond to their type 1, whereas the type-3T matches their type 2.Regarding the classification of Wadsworth et al. (18Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) no appropriate biochemical relation can be defined due to different experimental conditions.However, according to the electrophoretic migration of PK-resistant PrPSc types, disease phenotype and codon 129 genotype, it may be argued that our type-1FL corresponds to their type-1, our type2T to part of their type 2, and our type-3T to their type 3.DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study show that the conformation of the PrPSc associated with the classical form of sCJD, encompassing the myoclonic and Heidenhain variant, is dependent on pH and clearly distinguishable from the pathological isoforms detected in two other sCJD phenotypes. Interestingly, this distinctive physicochemical property clearly differentiates two PrPSctypes, namely type-1FL and type-2T, found in classical sCJD and in the ataxic-dementing variant, respectively, which, upon conventional Western blot analyses, share the migration of the three glycoforms and the size of the PrPSc core fragment. Although having in common the codon 129 genotype, subjects with type-2T PrPSc show different clinical presentation and disease duration significantly longer than patients with type-1FL PrPSc (data not shown), thus supporting the biochemical detection of two PrPScstrains.Recent sequencing studies have shown that the major PK cleavage site of the 21-kDa isoform associated with sCJD occurs at Gly-82 (22Parchi P. Zou W. Wang W. Brown P. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Kopp N. Schultz-Schaeffer W.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Head M.W. Ironside J.W. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10168-10172Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), although different secondary cleavages are observed depending on the genotype. Accordingly, in MM and MV genotypes a secondary cleavage is observed at Gly-78, whereas in VV subjects additional N-terminal species, starting at Gly-86, are detected (22Parchi P. Zou W. Wang W. Brown P. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Kopp N. Schultz-Schaeffer W.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Head M.W. Ironside J.W. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10168-10172Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all these cleavage sites occur in the region of the third and fourth octapeptide, a region that under normal and pathological conditions may bind Cu2+. On the contrary, N-terminal species of the 19-kDa isoform start at Gly-97, in a Cu2+-free post-octarepeat domain.Two physicochemical properties of the PrPSc associated with classical sCJD are: the acquisition of its conformation in the presence of copper (18Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and a pH-dependent conformational stability (present study). Upon metal-ion chelation (in a lysis buffer at pH 7.4 and with Cu2+-chelators titrated to pH 8) (18Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), PK digestion products have molecular masses lower than PK-resistant PrPSc species obtained in the absence of metal chelators, thus suggesting that removal of Cu2+ induces a loss of β-sheet conformation in the octapeptide region. Our results, showing an increase in molecular masses of PK-resistant species at low pH and a decrease at pH 8, speak in favor of an increase in β-sheet conformation under acidic conditions and a loss of β-sheets under basic conditions. Therefore, the expected loss of two Cu2+ions per PrPSc molecule at low pH is not in keeping with the present findings, unless, as demonstrated at pH 6 for the normal octapeptide motif (9Miura T. Hori-i A. Mototani H. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11560-11569Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), residual Cu2+ ions are shared between two histidine residues of different octapeptide chains. However, the presumed effect of pH on Cu2+ binding does not fully explain results obtained at pH 4 and 8. Although it remains to be determined whether either the stoichiometry or the type of Cu2+binding are maintained after the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc, our result may suggest a direct effect of pH on PrPSc conformation.Why Is PrPSc conformation pH-sensitive only in one type of the sCJD-associated proteins?Although caution is dictated, our present results point to differences in the polypeptide backbone of the naturally occurring PrPSc, which contains the N terminus in group 1, whereas is mostly N-terminally truncated in the other two groups. This suggests that the effect of pH on the different types of PrPSc is strictly dependent on the presence of the N-terminal portion of the protein. Based on the present observations, it can also be suggested that, at variance with the N-terminal region, the conformation of the C-terminal portion of PrPSc is apparently insensitive to changes in pH. This property further differentiates PrPScfrom PrPC (10Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).As an alternative explanation, both Cu2+ binding at the N-terminal region could be simultaneously responsible for changes observed in type-1FL PrPSc; it is of interest to note that the pattern of progressive fragmentation in going from pH 4 to pH 8 (see G) follows the titration curve of the imidazole ring in His. Assuming a pK = 6.5, the latter would be fully protonated at pH 4 and extensively protonated (70%) at pH 6.0, but would only be 11% protonated at 7.4 and would bear only 5% positive charge at pH 8.0. The extent of His protonation, together with possible differences in the polypeptide backbone, might be responsible for the conformational transitions occurring in the type-1FL PrPSc reported here.Taken together, our data show evidence of three PrPSc types in our unselected consecutive series of sCJD patients and provide a novel reproducible method to differentiate PrPSc types in prion diseases. The mammalian prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit sporadic, inherited or infectious presentation (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). These disorders are characterized by the accumulation in affected brains of a misfolded pathogenic isoform of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC), named PrPSc, which is insoluble in nondenaturing detergents and partially resistant to proteolysis (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). PrPSc and PrPC differ in their secondary and tertiary structures, but not in the amino acid sequence (3Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), as an effect of increased β-sheet content and decreased α-helices in the pathological protein (4Caughey B.W. Dong A.

PrPC is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein (6Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, encoded by a single gene located on human chromosome 20 (7Kretzschmar H.A.

In its mature form the human protein spans residues 23–231 of the polypeptide predicted from cDNA sequence and exists under diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and unglycosylated species. PrPC is composed of an N-terminal unstructured domain, which contains four copies of an octapeptide sequence (PHGGGWGQ) between residues 60 and 91, and a C-terminal region with two short β-sheet structures of four residues each and three α-helical regions (5Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified the octarepeat sequence as a Cu2+ binding motif and have assessed that, in the presence of copper, each octapeptide forms an α-helix and acts as an α-helical formation promoter on the region comprising residues 84–103 (8Miura T. Hori-i A. Takeuchi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Copper binding stoichiometry is pH-dependent: four octapeptides chelate four Cu2+ at pH 7.4, but bind only two Cu2+ at pH 6. Under acidic conditions, Cu2+ is bound by two histidine residues of different octapeptides, whereas the His-triglycine segment of a single octapeptide represents the binding site at pH 7.4 (9Miura T. Hori-i A. Mototani H. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11560-11569Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The effect of pH on PrPC conformation is not, however, limited to its influence on Cu2+. At low pH, recombinant forms of human90–231 (10Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) PrPC undergo conformational changes, with an increase in β-sheet content and loss of α-helical structures. Within a single mammalian species, PrPSc exists under multiple conformations that are associated with distinct disease phenotypes. Upon experimental transmission, prion strains are distinguished according to differences in incubation time, regional distribution of cerebral lesions, and the pattern of proteinase K (PK)1-induced proteolytic cleavage of PrPSc (12Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence for the notion that PK cleaves the N-terminal region of PrPSc at different sites in different strains has been obtained so far both in animal (13Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human (14Collinge J. Sidle K.C.L. Ironside J. Hill A.F.

InCaenorhabiditis elegans, RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19 plays a crucial role in the development of ciliated sensory neurons (8Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In humans, the presence of five RFX genes has been reported, four of which have been characterized (4Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 are structurally related proteins that share the DNA-binding domain and four additional conserved regions, A, B, C, and dimerization domains (4Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain is required for homo- and heterodimer formations among RFX members (3Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Katan-Khaykovich Y. Spiegel I. Shaul Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Another common characteristic of these three genes is their highest expression in testis (3Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Other than testis, the RFX1 mRNA is also detectable in most other tissues. The RFX2 mRNA is abundant in lung and stomach, and the expression of RFX3 is ubiquitous but particularly high in brain and intestine (3Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). RFX1 is a well characterized member in the human RFX family. It forms a homodimer or heterodimers with the RFX2 or RFX3 proteins through the dimerization domain (3Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell.

The RFX1 modulates expression of physiologically important genes, such as interleukin-5 receptor α chain (IL-5Rα). RFX1 exerts its function on transcription through distinct transcriptional activation and repression domains and is supposed to cooperate with a cell lineage-specific coactivator to regulate lineage-specific transcription (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other cell lineage, the full-length RFX1 protein exhibits little transcriptional activity; however, when a deletion is made in the C-terminal region, the truncated form of RFX1 becomes a strong transcriptional activator (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This observation means that the C-terminal domain represses the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain in an intramolecular manner. RFX5 protein is structurally different from the other human RFX members. It contains the conserved DNA-binding domain but lacks the A, B, C, or dimerization domains (4Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Steimle V. Durand B. Barras E. Zufferey M. Hadam M.R. Mach B. Reith W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, RFX5 does not interact with other RFX members but forms a complex with other transcription factors that are indispensable for RFX5-dependent transcriptional activation (16Durand B.

RFX5 plays a critical role in the regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression, and germ line mutations in the RFX5 gene cause bare lymphocyte syndrome, a hereditary disease with severe immunodeficiency (15Steimle V.

Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In 1992, Murphy and co-workers (21Dotzlaw H. Alkhalaf M. Murphy L.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) found an aberrant cDNA from human breast cancer. This cDNA encoded a fusion of the N-terminal half of the estrogen receptor and a novel RFX-type DNA-binding domain. This RFX-type DNA-binding domain was thought to be a part of a novel RFX member, which was later referred to as RFX4. Since then, the entire structure of RFX4 has been undefined, whereas the other RFX members have been shown to play important roles in several cellular processes. In this study, we elucidated the entire structure of RFX4. We also studied the molecular properties of the RFX4 protein. Our results demonstrate that the RFX4 protein is the first mammalian RFX member lacking transcriptional activation domains and may be involved in transcriptional regulation through dimer formation with other RFX members. The RFX4 cDNA (nucleotides 328–1661) was isolated in the course of a yeast two-hybrid screening of a Matchmaker human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). To isolate the 3′-end of the RFX4 cDNA, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed with Marathon-Ready human testis cDNA (CLONTECH) and the primers F1 and F3 according to the protocol supplied by CLONTECH. The 3′-RACE yielded a cDNA fragment containing a stop codon in-frame followed by a poly(A) tract. We then carried out 5′-RACE with primers R2 and R3, which amplified a 1-kb fragment. Because no possible ATG initiation codon was found in this fragment, we performed a second 5′-RACE by using primers R4 and R7. The second RACE yielded a 0.5-kb fragment that contained a potential first ATG preceded by an in-frame stop codon. Sequences of the primers are as follows: F1, 5′-GAGTCCTACATTGAGTGGCTGG; F3, 5′-AATCTCTGCACTGTCAGGAGCGG; R2, 5′-TGCTTGGTGATGCTGTTCAGGTCC; R3, 5′-GCCGTCTCAGAATTTGGGAGAACC; R4, 5′-AAACCTTCTCCTCAGGCAGGCTGG; R7, 5′-CCGAGTCTTCTGGTGGTTAACTGAGG. Amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into pT7Blue plasmid vector (Novagen, WI) and sequenced by the CEQ 2000XL DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). The full-length RFX4 cDNA was constructed by ligation of the cDNA fragments. The full-length RFX4 cDNA was cloned into pFLAG-CMV5 (Sigma) and pcDNAHA, respectively. The pcDNAHA was constructed by replacing the Xpress epitope of pcDNA3.1His (Invitrogen) with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. The plasmids carrying RFX1, HA-tagged RFX2, and RFX3 were described previously (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entire open reading frames of RFX1 and RFX3 were subcloned into pcDNAHA to generate pcDNAHA-RFX1 and pcDNAHA-RFX3, respectively. For luciferase reporter analyses, portions of RFX1 and RFX4 were introduced into pBIND vector (Promega, WI) to fuse the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 with various regions of the RFX proteins. The pBIND plasmids contain the Renillaluciferase gene for normalization of transfection efficiency. Reporter plasmid pG5luc (Promega) carries five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. All constructs used in this study were verified by sequencing. The 3′-portion of the RFX4 cDNA (nucleotides 1038–1543) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method and hybridized with the Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Oligonucleotides were synthesized to carry the RFX-binding sites of IL-5α enhancer (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell.

The oligonucleotides for IL-5α enhancer were made double-stranded and end-labeled with 32P by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.54Google Scholar). RFX proteins were synthesized by a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation reaction with a TNT T7 Quick system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein-DNA complex was formed for 15 min at room temperature in a 20-μl mixture containing the 32P-labeled probe (0.5 ng, 108 cpm/μg), 0.5–2 μl of in vitro translation products, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, NJ), 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol. For competition analyses, an excess amount of unlabeled oligonucleotides was included in the binding reaction prior to the addition of the probe. For supershift experiments, 2.5 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the binding reaction. The samples were run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate EDTA buffer at room temperature. After the gel was dried, the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. Plasmids carrying FLAG- and HA-tagged RFX members were cotransfected by using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were collected and then lysed in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 0.4% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the cleared lysates were reacted with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) conjugated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The immunocomplex was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20. The proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.54Google Scholar), and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The blotted proteins were reacted with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10;Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and detected by the chemiluminescent method with SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). HeLa cells were maintained as described above. For reporter assays, cells were grown in 35-mm dishes at 70% confluence and then cotransfected with the pBIND derivatives (1 μg) and the pG5luc reporter plasmid (1 μg) by using TransIT LT-1 lipofection reagent (Panvera) as described previously (28Yano K. Morotomi K. Saito H. Kato M. Matsuo F. Miki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected with a scraper, and lysed in the passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities in the lysates were measured by the TD20 luminometer (Turner Designs, CA) with dual luciferase reporter assay systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We performed two-hybrid screening with human testis cDNA library and carried out sequence analysis of many cDNA clones. In the course of large scale sequence analysis, we found a cDNA that encodes a novel RFX-type dimerization domain. To elucidate the entire structure of this cDNA, we performed multiple RACE analyses of human testis cDNA. We isolated cDNA fragments for the 5′- and 3′-ends and then reconstituted the full-length cDNA from these isolated cDNA fragments. The combined cDNA sequence contained one large open reading frame. Searching the DNA data base, we found that this cDNA encodes the RFX4 protein. Originally, RFX4 was identified from human breast cancers as a partial cDNA encoding a short RFX-type DNA binding domain fused to the estrogen receptor (21Dotzlaw H. Alkhalaf M. Murphy L.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but the entire structure of RFX4 has been unknown until now. We also noticed that the RFX4 gene is located on chromosome 12q24. Since the estrogen receptor gene is on chromosome 6q25 (29Menasce L.P. White G.R. Harrison C.J. Boyle J.M. Genomics. 1993; 17: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the reported fusion of the estrogen receptor and the DNA binding domain of RFX4 appears to be generated by abnormal chromosomal translocation in breast cancers. The combined RFX4 cDNA consists of 2186 bp with a large open reading frame that is preceded by a nonsense codon in frame. The RFX4 protein is deduced to consist of 563 amino acids (Fig. 1). Among RFX family members, the RFX4 protein is closely related to RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 in structure (Fig. 2). The RFX4 protein carries the DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region and the dimerization domain in the C-terminal region but lacks some other domains, such as Q-rich and A regions, which play roles in transcriptional activation (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by Fig.3, RFX4 exhibits extensive sequence homology with other RFX members at the DNA-binding domain, the dimerization domain, and the B and C regions. Outside of these regions, RFX4 shows little similarity to the other RFX members. RFX4 protein does not share significant homology with any known protein other than the RFX members.Figure 2Schematic representation of eukaryotic RFXfamily members. RFX members of human (RFX4, RFX1, RFX2, RFX3, and RFX5), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sak1), S. cerevisiae (Crt1), C. elegans (DAF19), andDrosophila melanogaster (DmRFX) are shown.

Gaps were introduced for the best alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then carried out Northern hybridization with human multiple tissue blot to analyze tissue specificity of the RFX4 expression. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of RFX4 was highly specific to testis. The RFX4 mRNA was ∼3.7 kb in length. A faint band of larger size was also detectable in the brain. Since the RFX4 protein contains the typical RFX-type DNA-binding domain, we examined whether RFX4 has DNA binding ability. Oligonucleotides for the binding site of the RFX members in the IL-5Rα enhancer and its mutated sequence (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Sun Z. Yergeau D.A. Tuypens T. Tavernier J. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1462-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were synthesized, made double-stranded, and end-labeled with32P. The RFX4 protein tagged with HA epitope was synthesized in vitro and reacted with32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. EMSA showed that the RFX4 protein binds to the IL-5Rα enhancer (Fig.5, lane 3) but not to the mutated sequence (Fig. 5, lane 4). We confirmed the sequence-dependent binding of the RFX4 protein to DNA by competition analysis with an excess amount of unlabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 5, lanes 5–10). We also verified the presence of the RFX4 protein in the DNA-protein complex, since the band was supershifted by adding the anti-HA monoclonal antibody to the reaction (Fig. 5,lane 11). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that RFX4 binds to DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. We then tested the DNA-binding preferences of human RFX members. Double-stranded oligonucleotides for reported binding sites of the RFX members were used as unlabeled competitors in EMSA with the RFX proteins and the radiolabeled IL-5Rα probe (Fig.6A). Loss of the signal for the RFX-probe complex meant effective competition and thus high affinity binding of the RFX proteins to the unlabeled competitors. As shown in Fig. 6B, oligonucleotides for hepatitis B virus enhancer, polyomavirus EF-C site, rpL30, and X-box served as efficient competitors, indicating that the RFX members bound to these sequences. This observation means that RFX4 has DNA binding specificity similar to those of other human RFX members. However, MIE1 oligonucleotide did not disrupt the complex between the IL-5Rα probe and the RFX4 protein. Together, these results demonstrate that the DNA recognition profile of RFX4 is similar to those of other RFX members, with a minor difference in affinity for the MIE1 binding site. We also observed that the binding of the RFX members to the peripheral cell nuclear antigen E1A-responsible element sequence was not effective under our experimental conditions. As RFX4 contains a typical RFX-type dimerization domain, we examined whether RFX4 interacts with other RFX members. The RFX4 protein tagged with FLAG epitope was coexpressed with the HA-tagged RFX1, RFX2, RFX3, and RFX4 proteins, respectively in COS7 cells. We carried out immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and examined whether the HA-tagged RFX members coprecipitated with FLAG-RFX4. As shown in Fig. 7, RFX4 formed stable complexes with RFX2 and RFX3, respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, the interaction between RFX1 and RFX4 could not be detected (Fig. 7), while the stable complexes of RFX1·RFX1 and RFX1·RFX2 were observed (data not shown). We also found that the RFX4 protein formed a homodimer. We then examined whether RFX4 could function as a transcriptional regulator. RFX1 is known to carry a transcriptional activation domain in its N-terminal region, but the full-length RFX1 protein is functional as a transactivator only in a certain cell lineage (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other cell lineage, the transcriptional activity of RFX1 is masked intramolecularly by two inhibitory domains in its C-terminal region (12Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We first studied whether RFX4 carries a transcriptional activation domain. We constructed a series of plasmids expressing various portions of the RFX4 protein fused to the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4. These plasmids were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid-carrying luciferase gene under the control of Gal4-binding sites. Transcriptional activities of the Gal4-RFX fusion proteins were tested as measured by luciferase activities. As shown in Fig.8A, the full-length RFX1 had little transcriptional activation in HeLa cells (Fig. 8A,GAL4-RFX1 Full), but the truncated form of RFX1 showed strong transcriptional activation (Fig. 8A,GAL4-RFX1N). On the other hand, no domains of RFX4 activated luciferase, demonstrating that RFX4 lacks a distinct transcriptional activation domain. Next, we examined whether the C-terminal domain of RFX4 acts as an inhibitory domain. As mentioned above, the truncated RFX1 showed a strong transcriptional activation, while full-length RFX1 exhibited little activation. Two overlapping regions in RFX1 are known to function as separate inhibitory domains (13Katan-Khaykovich Y. Spiegel I. Shaul Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We generated a series of plasmids to express chimeric RFX1·RFX4 proteins (Fig.8B). When the C-terminal domain of the RFX1 protein was replaced with the corresponding region of the RFX4 protein, this chimeric RFX protein exhibited little transcriptional activity (Fig.8B, GAL4-RFX1N-RFX4), suggesting the C-terminal portion of the RFX4 inhibited the transcriptional activity of the N-terminal region of RFX1 intramolecularly. We also showed that two overlapping regions of the RFX4 protein (amino acids 224–320 and 283–499) could function as distinct inhibitory domains (Fig. 8B, GAL4-RFX1N-RFX4ΔD and GAL4-RFX1N-RFX4ΔB). These observations indicate that the two regions of the RFX4 protein may possibly have inhibitory activities, as reported for the RFX1 protein (13Katan-Khaykovich Y. Spiegel I. Shaul Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we found a cDNA clone which encodes a novel RFX-type dimerization domain in the course of sequencing of human testis cDNA clones. Because the RFX members play important roles in many organisms (8Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 20Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), the finding of the novel RFX-type dimerization domain prompted us to elucidate the entire structure of this protein. A series of RACE analyses revealed that this novel RFX-type dimerization domain was a part of RFX4. RFX4 was originally identified in breast cancers as a short DNA-binding domain fused to the estrogen receptor (21Dotzlaw H. Alkhalaf M. Murphy L.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but the entire structure of RFX4 has been unknown until now. Here, we have described the entire primary structure and molecular properties of RFX4. We mapped the RFX4 gene to chromosome 12q24 by searching the human genome data base. Since the estrogen receptor gene locates on the chromosome 6q25 (29Menasce L.P. White G.R. Harrison C.J. Boyle J.M. Genomics. 1993; 17: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the reported fusion of the estrogen receptor to the DNA binding domain of RFX4 appears to be generated by abnormal chromosomal translocation in breast cancers. Genetic instability is one of the major characteristics of malignant tumors, and chromosomal translocations are aberrations caused by genetic instability (30Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 31Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3390) Google Scholar). In some cancers, chromosomal translocations generate gene fusions that express aberrant proteins with oncogenic activity (30Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Since the reported fusion protein carries the DNA binding domain of RFX4 and the transcriptional activation domain of estrogen receptor (21Dotzlaw H. Alkhalaf M. Murphy L.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is of interest whether the chimeric RFX4-estrogen receptor is involved in abnormal gene expression that contributes to the development and progression of breast cancers. Although the structure of RFX4 is highly homologous to other human RFX members, several differences in molecular properties were found in RFX4. First, the expression of RFX4 is stringently restricted to testis. This testis-specific mRNA distribution may reflect roles of RFX4 yet to be identified. Second, RFX4 had slightly different DNA binding specificity, in contrast to RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3, which display almost indistinguishable DNA binding properties. We observed that RFX4 is able to bind to several RFX-binding sites, such as the enhancer of IL-5Rα, but not to the MIE1 sequence in EMSA. These observations indicate that RFX4 has similar but slightly different DNA binding specificity compared with other RFX members. Finally, we showed that RFX4 exhibited no transcriptional activation, even when a deletion was made in its C-terminal domain. This means that among RFX members that function as dimers, human RFX4 is the first mammalian member not showing transcriptional activation. It is of interest whether homologs of human RFX4 exist in other mammalian species. Crt1 is a RFX-type transcription repressor of S. cerevisiae. In normal conditions, the Crt1 protein is highly phosphorylated and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Upon DNA damage or replication block, Crt1 is rapidly dephosphorylated, and a set of genes for DNA repair is derepressed (11Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). At present, we could not rule out the possibility that RFX4 is posttranslationally modified in response to signals and then contributes to some transcriptional activation processes. The C-terminal domain of RFX4 shows strikingly conserved structure with human RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 and exhibits inhibitory activity when fused to the N-terminal activation domain of RFX1. The C-terminal domain of RFX4 also mediates selective dimer formation with other RFX members. Based on these observations, we speculate that the dimer formation with other RFX members constitutes a major part of the mechanism by which RFX4 functions. RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 have been thought to be redundant genes because of their highly conserved structures and indistinguishable DNA binding properties. In this study, however, we showed that RFX4 binds stably with RFX2, RFX3, and RFX4 itself and does not bind to RFX1. This preference of interactions among human RFX members could lead to the formation of various RFX dimers. We speculate that various RFX dimers could have different properties, and each human RFX member could play a distinct role. Our results will contribute to further investigation in an effort to elucidate the functional roles of human RFX members in transcriptional regulation. We thank Michael J. Rasiej for valuable comments on the manuscript. We also thank Bernard Mach and Walter Reith for plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W1984204954,"Among the myogenic regulatory factors, myogenin is a transcriptional activator situated at a crucial position for terminal differentiation in muscle development. It is unclear at present whether myogenin exhibits unique specificities to transactivate late muscular markers. During Xenopus development, the accumulation of myogenin mRNA is restricted to secondary myogenesis, at the onset of the appearance of adult isoforms of β-tropomyosin and myosin heavy chain. To determine the role of myogenin in the isoform switch of these contractile proteins, we characterized and directly compared the functional properties of myogenin with other myogenic regulatory factors in Xenopusembryos. Two distinct cDNAs related to myogenin, XmyogU1 and XmyogU2, were differentially expressed during myogenesis and in adult tissues, in which they preferentially accumulated in oxidative myofibers. Animal cap assays in Xenopus embryos revealed that myogenin, but not the other myogenic regulatory factors, induced expression of embryonic/larval isoforms of the β-tropomyosin and myosin heavy chain genes. Only XmyogU1 induced expression of the adult fast isoform of the myosin heavy chain gene. This is the first demonstration of a specific transactivation of one set of muscle structural genes by myogenin."

Experimental evidence from various groups including ours substantiates the notion that the function of this rapid ligand-gated channel is influenced by its lipid microenvironment (see reviews in Refs. 1Barrantes F.J.

Although the occurrence of specific interactions between the transmembrane region of the AChR and adjacent lipid molecules in the membrane has been reported (4Giraudat J. Montecucco C. Bisson R. Changeux J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3121-3127Google Scholar, 5Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Google Scholar, 6Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar), the exact nature of these interactions has not been clearly established. The first shell of lipids around the AChR, the so-called annular lipid (7Marsh D. Barrantes F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4329-4333Google Scholar, 8Marsh D. Watts A. Barrantes F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 645: 97-101Google Scholar), exhibits distinct characteristics, such as a higher degree of order and a lower mobility than the bulk lipids. This specialized region of the membrane has received particular attention as the likely candidate domain where modulation of AChR function by lipids occurs (7Marsh D. Barrantes F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4329-4333Google Scholar, 9Bhushan A. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1027: 93-101Google Scholar).

Various hypotheses were postulated to explain this functional dependence, because these lipids may modify the biophysical properties of the lipid annulus and/or the bulk lipid bilayer (12Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3871-3880Google Scholar, 18Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1108: 240-246Google Scholar, 19Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 59-64Google Scholar). A second possibility is the occurrence of specific sites for certain lipids at the lipid-facing surface of the AChR, substantiated by the work of several groups (20Jones O.T. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2364-2874Google Scholar, 21Narayanaswami V. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12420-12427Google Scholar, 22Dreger M. Krauss M. Herrmann A. Hucho F.

Upon interacting with these sites, lipids would stabilize the secondary structure of the AChR transmembrane segments (12Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3871-3880Google Scholar, 26Fernandez-Ballester G. Castresana J. Fernandez A.M. Arrondo J.L. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochem. Soc.

Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Google Scholar) proposed a model of how lipid composition modulates the function of the AChR, suggesting that membrane fluidity or some other bulk property of the membrane modulates the equilibrium between the resting and desensitized states of AChR. They also suggested that in addition to this indirect effect, the AChR has a specific requirement for anionic lipids (such as phosphatidic acid) binding to a specific site on the AChR or exerting a less specific charge effect on AChR conformation. Previous studies from several laboratories demonstrate that free fatty acids (FFA) inhibit the ion flux mediated by the AChR in vitro (29Andreasen T.J. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4719-4726Google Scholar, 30Villar M.T. Artigues A. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 938: 35-43Google Scholar) or in vivo (31Bouzat C.B. Barrantes F.J. Receptors and Channels. 1993; 1: 251-258Google Scholar). Analysis of single-channel electrophysiological data argues for a mechanism compatible with noncompetitive inhibition of the AChR. From these studies the conclusion was drawn that the effect of FFA is related to their hydrophobic character, but the exact mechanism of FFA action is still not clear. To further investigate the possibility that these compounds exert their effect on AChR at the lipid-protein interface and to investigate the nature of these effects on the biophysical property of the AChR-rich membrane, we carried out fluorescence studies using the fluorescent probes Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene) and ADIFAB, an Acrylodan-derivatized intestinal fatty acid-binding protein. Laurdan possesses an exquisite sensitivity to the phase state of the membrane. The physical origin of Laurdan spectral properties resides in its capacity to sense the polarity and the molecular dynamics of dipoles in its environment because of the effect of dipolar relaxation processes (32De Parasassi T. Stasio G. d'Ubaldo A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1179-1186Google Scholar, 33De Parasassi T. Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Google Scholar). The principal dipoles sensed by Laurdan in the membrane are water molecules. When no relaxation occurs, high Laurdan GP values result, indicative of low water content in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface region of the membrane. Thus, GP values depend on the extent of water penetration allowed by the local membrane packing and hence provide a direct report on the AChR membrane environment. In the present work, we have exploited the advantageous spectroscopic properties of Laurdan to study the effect of FFA with different structure in the native membrane in which the AChR protein is embedded. Complementary studies with ADIFAB were also performed to determine the partition coefficient of the different fatty acids in the membrane. This information enabled us to compare the effects caused by fatty acids at the same effective concentration in the membrane. We found that the carbon chain length of fatty acids, as well as the number of double bonds and their stereochemical configuration, are important determinants of the unique effects of the different FFA species on the physical properties of the AChR-rich membrane. Furthermore, changes in the efficiency of the energy transfer from the protein to Laurdan, brought about by the addition of exogenous FFA, revealed the presence of sites for FFA at the lipid-protein interface in the native AChR membrane. Preliminary data have been presented in abstract form (34Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): 370Google Scholar). Torpedo marmorata specimens were obtained from the Mediterranean coast off Alicante, Spain. They were killed by pithing, and the electric organs were dissected and stored at −70 °C until further use. Laurdan and ADIFAB were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other drugs were obtained from Sigma. Membrane fragments rich in AChR were prepared from the electric tissue of T. marmorata as described previously (35Barrantes F.J. Hucho F. Neuroreceptors. W. de Gruyter, Berlin, New York1982: 315-328Google Scholar). Specific activities in the order of 2.0–2.8 nmol α-bungarotoxin sites/mg protein were obtained. The orientation of AChR in vesicles was measured as described by Hartig and Raftery (36Hartig P.R. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1146-1150Google Scholar) by determining the total toxin-binding sites in the presence of Triton X-100 and the right side out toxin-binding sites in the absence of detergent (36Hartig P.R. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1146-1150Google Scholar) as in previous work from our laboratory (37Gutiérrez-Merino C. Bonini de Romanelli I.C. Pietrasanta L.I. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4846-4855Google Scholar). For fluorescent measurements, AChR-rich membranes were suspended in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) at a final concentration of 50 μg protein/ml (0.2 μm). The optical density of the membrane suspension was kept below 0.1 to minimize light scattering. Sodium salts of FFA were dissolved in buffer A with a bath sonicator. In same cases we first prepared a sodium salt FFA stock solution in 4 mm NaOH, and aliquots were diluted to final concentrations with buffer A. FFA were dissolved in ethanol (in all cases the amount of ethanol added to the samples was kept below 0.5%). All fluorimetric measurements were performed in an SLM model 4800 fluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) using a vertically polarized light beam from a Hannovia 200-W mercury/xenon arc obtained with a Glan-Thompson polarizer (4-nm excitation and emission slits) and 10 × 10-mm quartz cuvettes. Emission spectra were corrected for wavelength-dependent distortions. The temperature was set at 20 °C with a thermostated circulating water bath (Haake, Darmstadt, Germany). Laurdan was added to AChR-rich membrane samples from an ethanol solution to give a final probe concentration of 0.6 μm. The amount of organic solvent was kept below 0.2%. The samples were incubated in the dark for 60 min at room temperature. Excitation GP (exGP) (32De Parasassi T. Stasio G. d'Ubaldo A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1179-1186Google Scholar, 33De Parasassi T. Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Google Scholar) was calculated as follows. exGP=(I434−I490)/(I434−I490)Equation 1 where I434 andI490 are the emission intensities at the characteristic wavelength of the gel phase (434 nm) and the liquid crystalline phase (490 nm), respectively. Excitation GP values were obtained from emission spectra obtained with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. The energy transfer efficiency (E) in relation to all other deactivation processes of the excited donor depends on the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor. According to Förster's theory (38Förster Th. Ann. Phys. (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 55-75Google Scholar), E is given by the following equation. E=R06/(R06+r6)Equation 2 where r is the intermolecular distance andRo is a constant parameter for each donor-acceptor pair, defined as the distance at which E is 50%. E can be calculated as followsE=1−(φ/φD)=1−(I/ID)Equation 3 where φ and φD are the fluorescence quantum yields of donor in the presence and absence of the acceptor, respectively, and I and ID are the corresponding emission intensities in any given measurement. HereI and ID correspond to the maximal intrinsic protein emission intensity, which is 330 nm. When E was measured in the presence of exogenous FFA, a further correction was introduced to compensate for any modification of the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp by any other quenching mechanism induced by FFA.Ecorr=E(+Laurdan)−E(−Laurdan)Equation 4 where Ecorr is the experimentally determined value of E corrected by the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence by the FFA. E(+Laurdan)and E(−Laurdan) values were calculated using Equation 3 in the presence of FFA, with or without Laurdan, respectively. Kp was calculated with the following expression. Kp=([FFA]m/[FFA]a)Va/VmEquation 5 where [FFA]m and [FFA]a are the concentrations of fatty acid in the membrane phase and in the aqueous phase, respectively, and Va and Vm are the corresponding volumes of the aqueous and membrane phases, respectively. [FFA]m is defined as [FFA]T − [FFA]a, where [FFA]T is the added FFA concentration. Experimentally, the Kp values were obtained using ADIFAB, which responds to FFA binding with a shift in fluorescence emission from 432 nm in the apoform to 488 nm in the holoform. As a consequence, [FFA]a can be determined from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at 488 nm to that at 432 nm (39Anel A. Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 530-536Google Scholar), according to the following expression.[FFA]a=KdQ(R−R0)/(Rmax−R)Equation 6 where R is the measured ratio of 488 to 432 nm intensities, Ro is this ratio with no FFA present, Rmax is the value when ADIFAB is saturated with FFA, and Q =IF(432)/Ib(432), whereIF(432) and Ib(432) are the ADIFAB intensities with zero and saturating concentrations of FFA, respectively. On the basis of the numerical analysis of FFA titration data, Q and Rmax values were found to be 19.5 and 11.5, respectively (40Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Google Scholar). These values are constant for all FFA. Kd is the dissociation constant for FFA (ADIFAB-FFA ⇔ ADIFAB + FFA), calculated from a plot obtained by titration of ADIFAB with FFA, after linearization according to a logarithmic form of Equation 6 (Hill plot). Kdvalues were obtained using the following expression.[FFA]a=[FFA]T−[ADIFAB]×{A/(1+A)}Equation 7 where A = Q(R −Ro)/(Rmax −R) and [ADIFAB] was 0.2 μm. The [FFA]T for each addition was converted to its effective concentration inside the membrane ([FFA]e) using the following equation. [FFA]e=CL×[FFA]TEquation 8 where CL = Kp/{1 + (Kp − 1) γL [L]}, γL is the lipid molar volume, and [L] is the lipid concentration in the cuvette, which increases for each addition of FFA. A value of 0.95 dm3/L (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine fluid phase) was assumed because AChR-rich membranes are in a liquid fluid phase at 20 °C (41Antollini S.S. Soto M.A Bonini de Romanelli I Gutiérrez-Merino C. Sotomayor P. Barrantes F.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1275-1284Google Scholar). Intergroup comparisons were done by impaired t test. Statistical significance was accepted as p < 0.05. To compare the effects caused by the presence of different exogenous FFA on the native AChR-rich membrane from T. marmorata, we first measured their partition coefficient. There are several methods for measuring partition coefficients of lipids in membranes, but the clear advantage of using ADIFAB is that it is not necessary to physically separate free and membrane-bound fatty acid, as is the case when using radiolabeled fatty acids, a method more prone to error. ADIFAB, an Acrylodan-tagged intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (39Anel A. Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 530-536Google Scholar, 40Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Google Scholar), is a suitable fluorescent indicator for the measurement of FFA concentration in the 1 nm to 20 μm range. The detection of FFA by ADIFAB is based on a change in the position of the Acrylodan fluorescent tag relative to the nonpolar binding pocket of the protein when the latter is occupied by a fatty acid. ADIFAB undergoes a marked spectral shift upon FFA binding, allowing the determination of FFA concentrations from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of bound and unbound forms, measured at about 488 and 432 nm, respectively. In the example shown in Fig. 1, the decrease in intensity at 432 nm and the corresponding increase at 488 nm of the ADIFAB spectrum is apparent upon titration of AChR-rich membrane fromT. marmorata with arachidonic acid. Using Equations 6 and 5 we obtained the values of the dissociation constant (Kd) and partition coefficient (Kp) for the different fatty acids and ADIFAB in aqueous solution and in the presence of Torpedo AChR-rich membranes, respectively (Table I). The calculated Kp values allowed us to classify the fatty acids into three different groups: (i) highly hydrophobic fatty acids, such as 20:0 and 18:0; (ii) less hydrophobic fatty acids, such as 18:1cis and 18:1trans, and (iii) more hydrophilic fatty acids, such as 18:2, 18:3, 20:4, and 22:6.Table IFatty acid-ADIFAB dissociation constants (Kd) and fatty acid-native Torpedo AChR-rich membrane partition coefficients (Kp)Fatty acidKdKp (× 10−4)Stearic (18:0)0.49114.5 ± 17Arachidic (20:0)0.72156.5 ± 12Oleic (cis18:1)0.2654.6 ± 10Elaidic (trans18:1)0.2666.9 ± 20Linoleic (18:2)2.407.0 ± 0.5Linolenic (18:3)4.322.7 ± 0.1Arachidonic (20:4)2.218.2 ± 1.0Docosahexanoic (22:6)1.9610.8 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab The experimentally determined Kp values of the fatty acids in native AChR-rich membrane were subsequently used to transform the nominal concentration added in the cuvette into an effective concentration in the membrane for each fatty acid (see “Experimental Procedures”). To study the modification of the physical properties of the Torpedonative membrane induced by the presence of FFA, we exploited the amphiphilic fluorescence probe Laurdan's exquisite sensitivity to the phase state of the membrane. We have previously used the so-called GP of Laurdan as a sensitive tool to measure the physical state ofTorpedo native AChR-rich membrane (25Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16653-16662Google Scholar, 41Antollini S.S. Soto M.A Bonini de Romanelli I Gutiérrez-Merino C. Sotomayor P. Barrantes F.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1275-1284Google Scholar). In the present work we investigated the possible modification of the polarity of both the AChR belt and bulk lipid regions by fatty acids. Laurdan GP values were obtained by direct excitation (at 360 nm) or under FRET conditions, using the intrinsic membrane fluorescence as donor (excitation at 290 nm) and Laurdan molecules as acceptor. In a previous work we characterized this system and showed that the GP values obtained under FRET conditions exhibit higher absolute GP values than those obtained by direct excitation of the probe, indicating that the microenvironment of the AChR has lower polarity than the bulk lipid (41Antollini S.S. Soto M.A Bonini de Romanelli I Gutiérrez-Merino C. Sotomayor P. Barrantes F.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1275-1284Google Scholar). The changes in GP values caused by different FFA could be compared using the effective concentration of each fatty acid inside the membrane, calculated using their Kp values (Fig.2). We found that addition of FFA toTorpedo native membrane changed GP values, albeit to different extents, in a manner dependent on the chemical structure of the fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids decreased GP values, whereas saturated ones caused a small increase. Statistically significant differences were observed between different fatty acids: 18:0–18:1cis(p < 0.005); 18:1–18:2 (p < 0.001); 18:2–18:3 (p < 0.001); 18:2–20:4 (p< 0.005); 18:2–22:6 (p < 0.001); 18:3–20:4 (p < 0.001); 18:3–22:6 (p < 0.001); and 20:4–22:6 (p < 0.025), the exception being 18:0–20:0 (p > 0.05). In a fatty acid, each double bond induces a kink of nearly 30° in the acyl chain (42Prasad R. Prasad R. Manual of Membrane Lipids. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1996: 1-15Google Scholar). Thus, a fatty acid with several double bonds undergoes noticeable changes in the direction of its main molecular axis, resulting in an increase in the cross-sectional area of the hydrocarbon chain over the minimum found in a saturated fatty acid. The decrease in the GP values induced by unsaturated FFA indicates an increase in polarity within the Laurdan microenvironment. This in turn is a clear reflection of the disordering of the bilayer caused by the kinked chains of unsaturated fatty acids, which increases the content of water molecules in the membrane. In contrast to unsaturated FFA, saturated FFA induce only a small increase in GP and thus a slight decrease in polarity and hence in the amount of water in the membrane. In other words, saturated fatty acids induce a slight ordering effect in the membrane, probably because of their rigid linear structure. The effect of fatty acid isomerization on GP was studied next. A notable difference was observed in the effect caused on Laurdan GP by 18:1cis (oleic acid) and 18:1trans (elaidic acid) (Fig. 3). Whereas oleic acid decreased GP values, elaidic acid caused no changes. Again, the difference in molecular structure of these fatty acids is a plausible explanation for this behavior, because as stated above, cis-double bonds induce a kink in the chain, whereas trans-double bonds produce no change in chain direction (Fig. 3, inset). In a previous work we were able to discriminate between distinct sites for phospholipids and sterols, both accessible to fatty acids, at the lipid-protein interface in Torpedo native membrane, by measuring the decrease of E between the membrane intrinsic fluorescence (tryptophan residues) and Laurdan upon addition of different exogenous lipids (25Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16653-16662Google Scholar). Here we measured changes ofE between AChR and Laurdan, brought about by the addition of FFA of different chain length and degree of saturation. The addition of FFA decreased the efficiency of FRET in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal diminution ofE achieved by all fatty acids was very similar (∼ 50%) (Fig. 4). This suggests that all fatty acids, independently of their physical characteristics, bind to similar sites at the lipid-protein interface in the TorpedoAChR-rich native membrane. To corroborate whether different FFA bind to similar sites, we conducted an additional series of experiments using the following strategy. We added first a given FFA, and, after obtaining the maximal decrease of E, we added a second FFA, with similar or different structural characteristics, to the sample. If different FFA bind to different sites, E should further decrease when a second FFA is added, whereas no additional decrease of Ewould occur if the two FFA compete for the same site. Fig.5 (a and b) shows one such series of experiments. When, for example, 20:0 was added first, Laurdan GP increased. When a second FFA was added, changes in GP depended on its chemical structure; 18:0 caused a furtherincrease in GP, whereas 18:1 and 20:4 decreasedGP values to the same extent as they did by themselves separately. The differences between GP values obtained after addition of different fatty acids were in all cases statistically significant. Only in the case of the saturated fatty acids 18:0 and 20:0 did we find statistically nonsignificant differences. The fact that Laurdan GP was affected under FRET conditions (Fig. 5b) is a clear indication that the second FFA partitioned well into the membrane and localized in the AChR-vicinal region. The decrease of Eobtained with the first fatty acid (saturated or unsaturated) remained constant in the presence of a second fatty acid, independently of its physical characteristics (Fig. 5, c–f). In the present work, we used fluorescence techniques to study the modifications of the physical properties of native TorpedoAChR-rich membrane by the addition of fatty acids with different structural characteristics. We first determined the partition coefficient of different FFA using an Acrylodan-labeled fatty acid-binding protein, ADIFAB. This enabled us to calculate the effective concentration of the FFA in the membrane. Quantification of Laurdan GP yielded information on the physical state of the bulk and belt-lipid region of the AChR-rich membrane in the presence of known concentrations of FFA. Changes in FRET efficiency induced by fatty acids made possible the measurement of fatty acid-protein interactions within short distances of the probe Laurdan. The FFA partition coefficients, determined using the extrinsic fluorescent properties of ADIFAB, made apparent relatively pronounced differences in Kp between different fatty acids (Table I). Although FFA are highly hydrophobic compounds, their physicochemical properties have a common origin: their carbon atoms confer hydrophobicity, and the double bonds reduce hydrophilicity in the molecule (42Prasad R. Prasad R. Manual of Membrane Lipids. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1996: 1-15Google Scholar). We have attempted to relate these two opposite effects in the same molecule by using an empirical algorithm that we have coined the actual hydrophobicity coefficient (AHC).AHC=number of C/FFA−number of C in double bond/FFAnumber of C of the longest FFAEquation 9 We calculated this coefficient for all FFA studied and correlated it with their partition coefficient (Fig.6). Using this approach, it is observed that the tendency of different FFA to partition in the membrane follows the sequence: 20:0 > 18:0 > 18:1 > 18:2 ≅ 20:4 ≅ 22:6 > 18:3. According to this order, FFA can be classified into three different groups: (i) high AHC fatty acids, such as 20:0 and 18:0; (ii) fatty acids of intermediate AHC, such as 18:1cis and 18:1trans; and (iii) lowAHC fatty acids, such as 18:2, 18:3, 20:4, and 22:6. All fatty acids tested decreased the efficiency of the energy transfer,E, between the membrane intrinsic fluorescence and Laurdan. In a previous work (25Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16653-16662Google Scholar), we interpreted this diminution as an increase in the distance between donor and acceptor resulting from the displacement of Laurdan molecules from the AChR lipid microenvironment caused by the exogenously added lipid (Fig.7). We were also able to characterize distinct sites for phospholipids, sterols, and oleic acid. Here, we investigated whether the sites to which oleic acid binds are the same as those to which other fatty acids bind. The fact that a similar decrease in E was observed for all FFA is a strong indication that this is indeed the case. Further evidence in support of the above hypothesis is that the addition of a second fatty acid did not produce a further decrease of the E caused by the first fatty acid. The most striking finding of the present work is that although all fatty acids displaced a fatty acid analog such as Laurdan to almost the same extent (Fig. 4), different fatty acids perturbed the physical properties of native Torpedo AChR-rich membranes quite differently, in a manner that strongly depended on their structure (Fig. 2). Thus, saturated fatty acids ordered the membrane, whereas unsaturated fatty acids disordered it. Applying a simple algebraic rearrangement of the changes in GP made it possible to classify FFA effects.FFA effect=(GPfinal−GPinitial/(GPg−GP1c)Equation 10 where GPfinal andGPinitial are the GP values obtained at the same fatty acid effective concentration in the membrane and before addition of the fatty acid, respectively, and GPg andGPlc are the larger and smaller GP values obtained for a pure gel and liquid crystalline phase, respectively.GPg (0.61) and GPlc(−0.19) were experimentally measured at 20 °C in multilamellar DOPC and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes, which are in the liquid crystalline and gel phases, respectively. Applying Equation 10, the changes induced by FFA ranged from ordering (positive values of FFA effect) to disordering (negative values of FFA effect) effects and followed the sequence: 20:0 (0.016) > 18:0 (0.005) > 18:1cis (−0.047) ≅ 18:2 (−0.046) ≅ 20:4 (−0.047) ≅ 22:6 (−0.047) > 18:3 (−0.056). Furthermore, whereas 18:1cis (oleic acid) induced a net disordering effect, 18:1trans (elaidic acid) produced no change whatsoever in GP values (Fig. 3). This enables us to conclude that FFA carbon chain length as well as the number of double bonds and their stereochemical configuration are important determinants of the unique effects of the different FFA on the physical properties of theTorpedo AChR-rich membrane. In living BC3H-1 cells in culture, fatty acids exert inhibitory effects on AChR channel activity (31Bouzat C.B. Barrantes F.J. Receptors and Channels. 1993; 1: 251-258Google Scholar). These effects are also observed in membrane patches excised from the cell and are therefore not mediated by signal transduction pathways that require soluble factors such as nucleotides and Ca2+. Thus, fatty acids appear to regulate the action of the AChR channel directly, much as they regulate the action of several purified enzymes and other channels (43Ordway R.W. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 96-100Google Scholar). In chick ciliary neurons and in α7 neuronal type AChR heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, saturated FFA or with only one double bond had little effect on ACh-mediated currents, whereas FFA with two or three double bonds produced partial inhibitory effects but less effectively than arachidonic acid (44Vijayaraghavan S. Huang B. Blumenthal E.M. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3679-3687Google Scholar). The latter FFA has also been reported to inhibit ACh-mediated currents in bullfrog sympathetic neurons (17Minota S. Watanabe S. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 2396-2401Google Scholar). The mechanism by which 20:4 or other fatty acids inhibit nicotinic transmission is unknown. To account for these inhibitory effects on AChR function, binding of fatty acid to a site(s) at the lipid-AChR interface and/or perturbation of the local receptor microenvironment have been suggested. Structurally different fatty acids (i) all appear to alter AChR function in a similar manner, in terms of single channel open channel durations at the level of resolution achieved (31Bouzat C.B. Barrantes F.J. Receptors and Channels. 1993; 1: 251-258Google Scholar); (ii) occupy equivalent sites at the lipid-protein interface, in fact the same sites as cholesterol and phospholipids (25Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16653-16662Google Scholar); and (iii) induce changes in the fluidity of the AChR lipid microenvironment that clearly depend on their chemical structure. Thus, an explanation of fatty acid action mediated only through fluidity changes is difficult to sustain, because different fatty acids induce changes in membrane fluidity of different sign and magnitude; some in fact induce no change at all. We suggest that it is the direct action of FFA in displacing essential lipids from their sites at the lipid-protein interface and not changes in bulk properties such as membrane fluidity that is responsible for the inhibitory effect of FFA on AChR function."

These activities are entirely dependent on the interaction of IFNs with their particular cell surface receptor. In this report, we identify two specific tyrosine residues located within the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c that are obligatory for IFN-dependent signaling. Various IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants were expressed in a human lung fibroscarcoma cell line lacking IFNAR2c (U5A). Stable clones expressing these mutants were analyzed for their ability to induce STAT1 and STAT2 activation, ISGF3 transcriptional complex formation, gene expression, and cell growth regulation in response to stimulation with type I IFNs. The replacement of all seven cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of IFNAR2c with phenylalanine resulted in a receptor unable to respond to IFN stimulation. Substitution of single tyrosines at amino acid residue 269, 316, 318, 337, or 512 with phenylalanine had no effect on IFN-dependent signaling, suggesting that no single tyrosine is essential for IFN receptor-mediated signaling. In addition, IFNAR2c retaining five proximal tyrosines residues (269, 306, 316, 318, and 337) or either two distal tyrosine residues (411 or 512) continued to be responsive to IFN stimulation. Surprisingly, the presence of only a single tyrosine at either position 337 or 512 was sufficient to restore a complete IFN response.

These phosphorylated tyrosines are specifically recognized by Src homology domains (SH2 or SH3) that are present in many transcription factors, phosphatases, and other mediators of downstream signaling (1Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Google Scholar). The binding of SH2 or SH3 domains to phosphorylated tyrosines is, in many cases, an absolute requirement for the activation of transcription factors (2Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar). In addition, these phosphotyrosine residues are essential mediators of the interactions of specific phosphatases with certain cell surface receptors (3Mason J.M. Beattie B.K. Liu Q. Dumont D.J. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4398-4406Google Scholar, 4Sugimoto S. Wandless T.J. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13614-13622Google Scholar, 5Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol.

Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Google Scholar). For some receptors, the mutation or deletion of specific tyrosines completely abrogates ligand-dependent signaling, whereas other cell surface receptors, such as the erythropoietin receptor, do not appear to depend upon any one particular tyrosine but instead are capable of utilizing any one of several tyrosines for signaling (8Mulcahy L. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 2: 19-23Google Scholar). Overall, such observations demonstrate the importance of tyrosine residues in signaling and suggest that in certain pathways particular tyrosine residues can mediate the activation of specific transcription factors that may in turn induce the expression of a distinct subset of genes.One example of how intracellular tyrosines are utilized in signaling is the type I interferon (IFN)1pathway. Human type I IFNs (α, β, and ω) have been shown to induce the expression of a large number of genes involved in regulating a variety of important biological responses, including antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. The mechanisms by which type I IFNs initiate such a broad spectrum of biological activities is only beginning to emerge. Type I IFN-dependent signaling requires both type I IFN receptor chains, IFNAR1 (human type I interferon α receptor chain 1) and IFNAR2c (human type I interferon α receptor chain 2) (9Uze G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Google Scholar, 10Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Morgensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Google Scholar). Binding of type I IFNs induces the assembly of these receptor chains, which leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in the intracellular domain of each receptor chain. These tyrosine phosphorylation events are thought to be carried out by the Janus kinases TYK2 and JAK1, which are themselves activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (13Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 14Stark R.G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). IFN receptor activation also leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2. Additional transcription factors, such as STAT3 (15Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5613Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (16Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.-J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15938-15947Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (17David M. Petricoin E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Google Scholar), and CrkL/STAT5 (18Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29997Google Scholar, 19Fish E.N. Uddin S. Korkmaz M. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 571-578Google Scholar), also become activated in response to IFN. It is clear that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosines of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c is involved in type I IFN signaling; however, the role that specific tyrosines play in this signal transduction pathway is unclear.It is thought that the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c plays a critical role in the activation of STAT1 or STAT2. The proposed STAT2-binding site on IFNAR1 includes two phosphorylated residues, Tyr466 and Tyr481(20Yan H. Krishman H. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J. Schreiber R.D. Schlinder C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Google Scholar). STAT-binding sites on IFNAR2c have also been proposed from studies using IFNAR2c truncation mutants expressed in human (21Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Rani M.R.S. Vogel Colamonici O. Ransohoff R.M. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23981-23985Google Scholar) or mouse cell lines (22Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Google Scholar). In human cells, truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c to amino acid 417 produces a receptor that is unable to mediate the phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2. Expression of a specific tyrosine mutant of human IFNAR2c in mouse L929 cells suggests that the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one of the proximal tyrosines (Tyr269, Tyr306, Tyr316, Tyr318, and Tyr337) of IFNAR2c is required but not sufficient by itself, for STAT2 activation (22Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Google Scholar). Thus, in both human and mouse cells, IFN-dependent signaling requires both the presence of specific tyrosines within the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor chains and the presence of STATs competent to interact with these domains.To examine the role of tyrosines present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c, we have expressed tyrosine mutants of IFNAR2c in U5A cells, which do not express IFNAR2c, and have analyzed their ability to respond to IFN (23Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Google Scholar). This approach has allowed us to analyze, for the first time, the functional importance of specific tyrosine residues of IFNAR2c in a human cell background.RESULTSThe cell surface expression of IFNAR2c for all the stable IFNAR2c tyrosine mutant clones (Fig. 1) was confirmed by FACS (Fig. 2A) and radioligand binding (Fig. 2B). FACS and radioligand binding analysis correlated closely with each other (Fig. 2) and demonstrated that the cell surface expression levels of IFNAR2c on all the clones analyzed was equal to or greater than that observed in the parental HT 1080 cell line. The only cell line in which IFNAR2c could not be detected on the cell surface was the U5A cell line that was previously shown to lack IFNAR2c (Fig. 2).Using these clones, we analyzed STAT1 and STAT2 activation by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting after 15 min of stimulation with either IFNα2 or IFNβ1b (1000 units/ml/107 cells). For all clones in which only a single tyrosine had been substituted with phenylalanine, STAT1 and STAT2 activation were efficiently induced by both IFNα2 and IFNβ1b (Fig.3A). IFN-dependent STAT activation was also observed in the two cluster mutants of IFNAR2c, one having both the distal tyrosines at amino acid positions 411 and 512 substituted to phenylalanine (4F5F) and the other having all five proximal tyrosines (Tyr269, Tyr306, Tyr316, Tyr318, and Tyr337) substituted by phenylalanine (4Y5Y) (Fig. 3B). However, STAT activation was not observed when all seven tyrosines were absent (clone 7F) (Fig. 3B). Next, IFNAR2c mutants in which each of the seven tyrosines were individually added back were assessed for their ability to induce STAT activation in response to IFN stimulation (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, a single tyrosine at either amino acid position 337 or 512 (clones F337Y or F512Y, respectively) was sufficient to mediate IFN-dependent activation of STAT1 and STAT2. All of the remaining single tyrosine add-back clones (269Y, 306Y, 316Y, 318Y and 411Y) were unable to sustain any detectable IFN-dependent STAT activation.Figure 3STAT1 and STAT2 activation in U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c tyrosines mutants. The cells were left untreated (0) or stimulated with IFNα2 (α) or IFNβ1b (β) (1000 units/106 cells) for 15 min and solubilized in lysis buffer, and STAT1 and STAT2 were immunoprecipitated. Following immunoprecipitation, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was detected by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The positions of STAT1 and STAT2 are indicated1 and 2, respectively. After detection of phosphotyrosine, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with STAT1- and STAT2-specific antibodies. The positions of STAT1 and STAT2 are indicated.

All other cell lines are as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)After receptor activation, STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated and form a complex with the DNA-binding protein p48 to make up the IFN-stimulated growth factor complex, ISGF3. The ISGF3 transcription factor then translocates to the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements, located within the promoter regions of IFN-responsive genes, to induce gene expression. Therefore, it was important to determine whether the IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, mediated by the various IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants, resulted in the assembly of a functional ISGF3 (Fig.4). Cell lines expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants were stimulated with 1000 units/106 cells IFNβ1b or IFNα2 for 30 min, cells were harvested, and ISGF3 complex formation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” In all cases, formation of an ISGF3 complex was detected in IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants that were previously shown (Fig. 3) to be capable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to IFN stimulation.Figure 4ISGF3 complex formation as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants.

To further characterize IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants, we investigated the differential expression of a number of IFN-inducible genes using an RNase protection assay. The I-TAC, ISG 54, and TRAIL genes 2T. C. Wagner, S. Velichko, D. Vogel, M. R. S. Rani, S. Leung, R. M. Ransohoff, G. R. Stark, H. D. Perez, and E. Croze, unpublished observations. are preferentially induced by IFNβ1b, as compared with various IFNα species, whereas the ISG 6-16 gene was induced by either IFN (21Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Rani M.R.S. Vogel Colamonici O. Ransohoff R.M. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23981-23985Google Scholar, 26Sandhya R. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22878-22884Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were stimulated with 1000 units/ml of either IFNβ1b or IFNα, cells were harvested, RNA was isolated, and the RNase protection assay was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Induction of I-TAC, ISG 54, ISG 6-16, and TRAIL by IFN appeared to be unaffected by any of the single tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions (Fig.5A). As expected, both the U5A cells and the 7F clone did not demonstrate IFN-mediated gene expression, whereas the 4F5F and 4Y5Y cluster mutants were fully functional (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, single tyrosine add-backs, except for 337Y and 512Y, failed to exhibit IFN-inducible expression of I-TAC, ISG 54, and TRAIL. Surprisingly, IFN-dependent stimulation of the 337Y and 512Y clones resulted in the full expression of all of the genes analyzed. IFN-inducible gene expression in 337Y and 512Y was at levels equal to or greater than those observed for the parental HT1080 cells (Fig.5C). It is also of interest to note that the expression of ISG 6-16, especially in response to IFNβ1b, was not completely lost in the single tyrosine add-back clones 269Y, 306Y, 316Y, and 318Y (Fig.5C).Figure 5IFN-dependent gene induction in U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants.IFN-dependent gene expression of U5A cells expressing tyrosine mutants of IFNAR2c was determined using RNase protection. The relative expression levels of I-TAC, ISG 54, TRAIL, and ISG 6-16 were determined for all mutant cell lines. The cells were left untreated (0) or stimulated with IFNα2 (α) or IFNβ1b (β) (1000 units/106 cells) for 17 h, harvested, and processed for RNase protection analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The figure shows an autoradiogram derived from one representative experiment. The relative expression levels of β-actin were included as a control. The location of each gene is indicated. HT1080, parental cell line;U5A, U5A cells. All other cell lines are as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The relative levels of gene expression did vary somewhat among the different IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants with the highest level observed in a cell line expressing wild type IFNAR2c (Fig. 5). Finally, the preferential induction of I-TAC, ISG 54, and TRAIL by IFNβ1b that was observed in the parental HT1080 cell line was still present in both the 337Y and 512Y clones.IFNs have potent antiproliferative effects on many different cell types. Therefore, to evaluate the IFNAR2c mutants in terms of a functional response, we measured the IFN-dependent antiproliferative effects for each clone (Fig.6). The results are expressed as the percentages of growth compared with untreated controls. Cell growth rates were measured for up to 6 days using Alamar Blue, as previously described (27Ahmed S.A. Gogal R.M. Walsh J.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 211-224Google Scholar). As expected, in U5A cells expressing wild type IFNAR2c, all the single tyrosine knock-out mutants and the proximal and distal cluster mutants were able to express clear antiproliferative effects in response to IFNβ1b stimulation (Fig. 6). Among the single tyrosine add-backs, only the 337Y and 512Y IFNAR2c clones were able to elicit an antiproliferative effect in response to IFN stimulation. The magnitude of the effect was equal to or greater that that observed for HT1080 or U5A cells expressing wild type IFNAR2c (R2c). This result further illustrates the importance of Tyr337 and Tyr512 in IFN-dependent signaling and extends this observation to include their roles in the mediation of important biological effects such as antiproliferative responses.Figure 6Antiproliferative activities of U5A cells expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants in response toIFNβ1b stimulation. Cell growth was measured in all mutants cell lines in the absence or presence of IFNβ1b (1000 units/ml) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cell growth was determined using the Alamar BlueTM method and expressed on the y axis as a percentage of cell growth relative to untreated cells.

Many different cytokine and growth factor receptors contain specific tyrosine residues within their cytoplasmic domains that are required for signaling. In the case of the type I IFN receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation events have been shown to involve the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (28Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events in type I IFN signaling appears to be tightly controlled by the interplay of a complex system of different tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, which is not yet understood.In terms of IFN signaling, STAT1 and STAT2 play a major role in type I IFN signaling, although STAT3 (15Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5613Google Scholar), STAT4 (29Farrar J.D. Smith J.D. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2693-2697Google Scholar), and STAT5 (19Fish E.N. Uddin S. Korkmaz M. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 571-578Google Scholar) can also be activated in response to IFN in some cells. In all cases, ligand-dependent activation of STATs require that they become phosphorylated on specific tyrosines located in the C-terminal portions of the proteins. The phosphorylation of these tyrosines involves the receptor-associated Janus kinases JAK1 and TYK2, which themselves become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation of JAK1 and TYK2 requires the heterodimeric assembly of the two type I IFN receptor chains, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. It is thought that one of the first phosphorylation events carried out by activated Janus kinases is the specific phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c.Because it is known that the Janus kinases can phosphorylate various STATs, other mechanisms must be involved that confer signaling specificity. One of these mechanisms may involve the specific phosphorylation of either IFN receptor chain. Indeed, a number of studies have identified important tyrosines located within the cytoplasmic domain of many cytokine and growth factor receptors. It has been shown that these tyrosines can mediate the specific docking of adapter proteins, STATs, and phosphatases to the receptors (30Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). Indeed, specific tyrosines in IFNAR1 have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of IFNAR1-associated phosphatase activity (31David M. Chen H.E. Goels S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Google Scholar) as well as STAT2 binding (20Yan H. Krishman H. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J. Schreiber R.D. Schlinder C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Google Scholar). Further studies have suggested that STAT2 and STAT1 preassociate with IFNAR2c and that phosphorylation of Tyr466 on IFNAR1 acts as an additional docking site and/or activation step for STAT2 that leads to STAT1 activation and the subsequent formation of a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer (32Xiaoxia L. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Google Scholar). Recent studies using mutants of IFNAR2c having a truncated (21Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Rani M.R.S.

Lim J. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 125-133Google Scholar) cytoplasmic domain lend support to the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic tyrosines of IFNAR2c play a role in the activation of STAT1 and STAT2. Furthermore, such studies suggest that tyrosines located in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c play an important role in STAT activation leading to IFN-mediated gene activation and antiproliferative effects. This assumption is supported by recent studies carried out using mouse L929 cells expressing a tyrosine mutant of human IFNAR2c in which it was shown that tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c are important for IFN-dependent activation of ISGF3 (22Nadeau O. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Google Scholar). However, other studies demonstrate that when a form of human IFNAR1, in which all the tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanines, was expressed in a mouse background, it retained its ability to respond to human IFN (36Gibbs V.C. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Google Scholar). This observation calls into question the essential role of IFNAR1 tyrosines in IFN signaling and explains the complicated nature of analyzing the effects of human receptor chains expressed in a mouse cell background.A summary of the functional properties of all the IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants analyzed in the study is presented in TableI. We have shown that replacing all of the cytoplasmic tyrosines of IFNAR2c with phenylalanines results in a receptor unable to induce JAK-STAT-mediated signaling in response to IFN stimulation, thereby demonstrating the general importance of these tyrosines in type I IFN-dependent signaling. Tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c are physically clustered into two groups, both proximal (Tyr269, Tyr306, Tyr316, Tyr318, and Tyr377) and distal (Tyr411 and Tyr512) to the cell membrane. Of the seven cytoplasmic tyrosines of IFNAR2c, Tyr306 and Tyr411 are not conserved across species and are therefore not likely to be crucial to signaling. Complete tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution of either tyrosine cluster (4F5F or 4Y5Y) resulted in clones fully responsive to IFN stimulation, suggesting that important tyrosines reside in both the proximal and distal tyrosine clusters. Furthermore, the single substitution of each of the remaining tyrosines-to-phenylalanine had no effect on IFN signaling, which also suggests that no single tyrosine is absolutely essential for IFN-dependent STAT activation, gene regulation, and biological effects.Table IFunctional characteristics of U5A cell lines expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutationsCell lineU5AR2C7F269F316F318F337F512F4F5F269Y306Y316Y318Y337Y411Y512Y4Y5YLigand binding−++++++++++++++++STAT1/2 activation−+−++++++−−−−+−++ISGF3−+−++++++−−−−+−++Gene expression−+−+++++++/−+/−+/−+/−+−++Growth inhibition−+−++++++−−−−+−++The cell lines are defined as shown in Fig. 1. Specific ligand binding was performed using radiolabeled IFNα. Clones that bind ligand equal to or greater than HT1080 cells (+) or fail to bind IFN at all (−) are shown. STAT1 and STAT2 activation was determined by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting where a plus sign (+) indicates that both phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were detected after IFN-stimulation and a minus sign (−) means that no STAT activation was detected. IFN-dependent ISGF3 formation was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In this case, a plus sign (+) designates when an ISGF3 complex was detected after IFNα or IFNβ1b stimulation, whereas a negative sign (−) indicates no detectable complex formation. An RNase protection assay was used to detect the presence of four IFN-inducible genes: I-TAC, ISG 54, ISG 6–16, and TRAIL ligand. Cell lines in which the IFN-dependent induction of these genes was detected (+) or not (−) are presented. Cell lines in which the induction of I-TAC, ISG 54, and TRAIL ligand by IFNβ1b were not detected but a small induction of ISG 6–16 was observed are also included (+/−). An antiproliferative response to IFNβ1b was observed in a number of cell lines (+); however, other cell lines were unable to elicit an antiproliferative effect in response to IFNβ1b (−). Open table in a new tab When single IFNAR2c tyrosine add-backs were analyzed for their ability to mediate IFN-dependent signaling, Tyr337 and Tyr512 were both capable of mediating signaling on their own. Surprisingly, only the individual substitution of these two tyrosines was able to restore STAT1 and STAT2 activation, ISGF3 complex formation, gene expression, and antiproliferative responses in U5A cells. Detailed studies are ongoing to determine the roles of Tyr337 and Tyr512 in IFN-dependent antiviral responses.Previous studies using IFNAR2c truncation mutants expressed in U5A cells suggested that the distal region of IFNAR2c (amino acids 462–515) was not necessary for receptor function. However, truncation of IFNAR2c at amino acid residues 417 or 346 resulted in a completely inactive receptor (21Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Rani M.R.S. Vogel Colamonici O. Ransohoff R.M. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23981-23985Google Scholar). Both of these mutants contain Tyr337, which we have now shown is sufficient to mediate signaling in the context of an otherwise functional receptor. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the fact that a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c might disrupt the tertiary structure around Tyr337 in such a way that it is no longer able to"

Activation of p70S6K is regulated by phosphorylation of seven different residues distributed throughout the protein, a subset of which depends on the activity of p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); in fact, the phosphorylation status of Thr229 and Thr389 is intimately linked to PI3K activity. In the full-length enzyme, however, these sites are also acutely sensitive to the action of FKBP 12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP). The mechanism by which PI3K and FRAP cooperate to induce p70S6K activation remains unclear. Here we show that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K also controls p70S6K activation by mediating formation of a ternary complex with p70S6K and FRAP. The p85 C-terminal SH2 domain is responsible for p85 coupling to p70S6K and FRAP, because deletion of the C-terminal SH2 domain inhibits complex formation and impairs p70S6K activation by PI3K. Formation of this complex is not required for activation of a FRAP-independent form of p70S6K, however, underscoring the role of p85 in regulating FRAP-dependent p70S6K activation. These studies thus show that, in addition to the contribution of PI3K activity, the p85 regulatory subunit plays a critical role in p70S6K activation.

Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Google Scholar). Recruitment of these mRNAs to translating polysomes may be the mechanism by which p70S6K regulates cell growth (2Thomas G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E71-E72Google Scholar). Inhibition of p70S6K with specific antibodies or with the immunosuppressant rapamycin blocks cell cycle progression through G1, implicating this serine/threonine kinase in the control of cell cycle and cell growth (3Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Google Scholar, 4Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Google Scholar, 5Lane H.A. Fernández A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Google Scholar). Recent studies support this idea, because p70S6K-deficientDrosophila and p70S6K knockout mice show a significant reduction in body size (6Montagne J. Steward M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Google Scholar, 7Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Google Scholar).p70S6K activity is tightly regulated by the coordinated phosphorylation of at least seven different residues. Four proline-directed sites have been identified in the autoinhibitory domain at the C terminus of the protein (Ser411, Ser418, Thr421, and Ser424). These residues are rapidly phosphorylated in response to mitogenic stimuli, but the kinase(s) responsible for this modification remains to be identified. Phosphorylation of these sites contributes to but is not sufficient for p70S6K activation; other critical residues, such as Thr229 in the activation loop, Ser371, and Thr389 in the linker region must be phosphorylated for full p70S6K activity (8Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr229 and Thr389 is sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K activity, and p70S6K can be activated by constitutively active mutants of PI3K in the absence of mitogenic signals (9Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Google Scholar, 10Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14426-14433Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PI3K in the regulation of p70S6K activity.Whereas PI3K does not appear to phosphorylate p70S6K directly, the generation of 3-phosphoinositide (3-PtdIns) products by PI3K is required for Thr229 and Thr389 phosphorylation (11Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Google Scholar, 12Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Google Scholar). Recent studies show that Thr229 is phosphorylated by the 3-PtdIns-dependent kinase PDK1 (12Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Google Scholar, 13Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Google Scholar, 14Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Google Scholar), whereas Thr389 is phosphorylated by the NEK6/7 kinases, members of never-in-mitosis-Aspergillus-like family kinases (15Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Google Scholar). Other authors propose that FRAP catalyzes this step, because Thr389 phosphorylation is blocked by rapamycin (16Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Google Scholar). FRAP has also been shown to phosphorylate Thr389in vitro, although this observation has not been reproduced in vivo (17Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Google Scholar, 18Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Google Scholar). A distinct function for FRAP, consistent with its ability to regulate phosphorylation of multiple p70S6K residues (19Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Google Scholar), was recently proposed by Peterson et al. (20Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Google Scholar). They show that PP2A associates directly and dephosphorylates p70S6K and that FRAP inhibits PP2A-mediated p70S6K dephosphorylation. Finally, mitogen-regulated phosphorylation of Ser371 by a still uncharacterized kinase also contributes to p70S6K activation (21Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Google Scholar). The current model for p70S6K activation thus suggests that the coordinated phosphorylation of several residues is required for enzyme activation. According to this model, the phosphorylation of residues lying within the pseudosubstrate domain by proline-directed kinases releases the catalytic domain from the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain; this permits subsequent Thr389 phosphorylation by the NEK6/7 kinases (15Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Google Scholar), further facilitating Thr229 access to PDK1 (13Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Google Scholar, 14Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Google Scholar, 22Mahalingam D.J. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Google Scholar). In addition, FRAP action would be required to protect p70S6K from PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation (20Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Google Scholar).Here we analyzed the contribution of PI3K to p70S6K activation in greater detail. PtdIns 3-kinases are lipid kinases that modify PtdIns at position 3 of the inositol ring (23Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 358-360Google Scholar). The first characterized form of PI3K, class IA PI3K, is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic (p110α, β, or δ) and a regulatory (p85α, β, or p5γ) subunit (reviewed in Refs. 24Vanhaesebroek B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Google Scholar and 25Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the p110 catalytic subunit comprises several regions, including the p85-binding region, a Ras-binding domain, a region homologous to phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, and the catalytic core (24Vanhaesebroek B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Google Scholar, 25Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar). The p85 regulatory subunit has an SH3 domain, a Bcr homologous region flanked by two proline-rich regions, and two SH2 domains separated by an inter-SH2 region (24Vanhaesebroek B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Google Scholar, 25Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar). Stimulation of growth factor receptor Tyr kinases induces p85/p110 binding to these receptors via the p85 SH2 domains, resulting in PI3K activation (26Skolnik E.Y. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Lowenstein E. Fischer R. Drepps A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Google Scholar, 27Kodaki T. Woscholski R. Hallberg B. Rodrı́guez-Viciana P. Downward J. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Google Scholar). Activated mammalian p85/p110 PI3K controls several important cell functions, including cytoskeletal organization, cell growth, cell division, and survival (28Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. McDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar, 29Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr.

A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p85/p110 PI3K regulates such a variety of cellular responses is not fully known but involves the binding of proteins containing SH2 and pleckstrin homology domains to 3-phosphorylated PtdIns on the cell membrane (32Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Google Scholar, 33Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Google Scholar), a feature that contributes to the induction of some PI3K effectors. In addition, p85 contributes to cell stimulation by recruiting signaling molecules to the stimulated receptors via its SH3, SH2, and Bcr homologous domains (24Vanhaesebroek B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Google Scholar, 25Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar). Many cellular effectors of PI3K have been identified and include the small GTP-binding protein Rac, the Ser/Thr kinase AKT/PKB, Bruton tyrosine kinase, PDK1, certain PKC isoforms, and p70S6K (9Chung J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Google Scholar).In this study, we examined the contribution of the p85 regulatory subunit to p70S6K activation. We used a mutant p85 form, p65PI3K, which lacks one of the adapter SH2 domains but binds to p110, exhibiting higher associated lipid kinase activity than p85/p110 and enhancing receptor-stimulated PI3K activation (39Jiménez C.

Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Google Scholar). With this construct, we show that PI3K regulation of p70S6K activation requires not only PI3K enzymatic activity but also the adaptor function of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. In this function, p85 mediates formation of a multimolecular complex that links FRAP to p70S6K. Formation of this complex, mediated by the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85, is required for efficient p70S6K activation. This complex, however, is not necessary for p70S6K activation when PP2A is inhibited nor for activation of a FRAP-independent form of p70S6K that does not bind PP2A. These results show that p85 contributes to p70S6K activation by bringing FRAP into complex with p70S6K, which in turn protects p70S6K from dephosphorylation. Whereas PI3K activity is required for Thr229 and Thr389 phosphorylation, the p85-PI3K regulatory subunit is necessary for p70S6K to retain its active/phosphorylated conformation.DISCUSSIONHere we show that p85/p110 PI3K has a dual role in p70S6K activation. In addition to the requirement for PI3K activity in PDK1-dependent p70S6K phosphorylation (13Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Google Scholar, 14Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K contributes to p70S6K stimulation by establishing a multimolecular complex that brings p70S6K into proximity with its activators, PI3K and FRAP. Formation of this complex requires the p85 C-SH2 domain, because the p65PI3K mutant, which lacks this domain (39Jiménez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez V.P. González G.A. Leonardo E. Wennstrom S. von Kobbe C. Torán J.L. Rodriguez-B L. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Dı́ez E. Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martı́nez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Google Scholar), associates moderately with p70S6K and very poorly with FRAP. Complex formation is required for p70S6K activation, which is defective in p65PI3K/p110-expressing cells. In accordance with this, p70S6K shows a lower degree of phosphorylation in multiple residues in these cells. p65PI3K/p110 nonetheless activated a FRAP-resistant p70S6K mutant, suggesting that impaired p70S6K activation in these cells is related to the defect in FRAP complex formation. FRAP protects p70S6K from PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation (20Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Google Scholar). We show that inhibition of PP2A restored p70S6K activation in p65PI3K cells, further indicating that the C-SH2 deletion mutant defect is related to impaired FRAP action. These data highlight the essential role of the p85 C-SH2 domain in establishing the formation of a ternary complex of p85, p70S6K, and FRAP, required for efficient p70S6K phosphorylation and activation.For these experiments, we used a mutant form of the PI3K regulatory subunit, p65PI3K, which lacks part of the p85 inter-SH2 and C-SH2 domains (39Jiménez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez V.P. González G.A. Leonardo E. Wennstrom S. von Kobbe C. Torán J.L. Rodriguez-B L. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Dı́ez E. Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martı́nez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Google Scholar). p65PI3K/p110 exhibits higher in vivo lipid kinase activity than p85/p110 and enhances receptor-stimulated PI3K activation (39Jiménez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez V.P. González G.A. Leonardo E. Wennstrom S. von Kobbe C. Torán J.L. Rodriguez-B L. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Dı́ez E. Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martı́nez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Google Scholar). The increase in 3-phosphorylated lipids in p65PI3K-expressing cells appears to be sufficient for activation of the downstream effector AKT (39Jiménez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez V.P. González G.A. Leonardo E. Wennstrom S. von Kobbe C. Torán J.L. Rodriguez-B L. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Dı́ez E. Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martı́nez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Google Scholar) but insufficient to activate p70S6K. These results suggest that PI3K contributes differently to the activation of its effectors AKT and p70S6K. Other activation requirements have been shown to differ for these proteins. AKT activation requires phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, which are homologous to p70S6K residues Thr229 and Thr389. Whereas AKT T308 and p70S6K Thr229 are both phosphorylated by PDK1 (13Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Google Scholar,14Pullen N. Dennis P.B.

Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Google Scholar), there are differences in the phosphorylation mechanisms of AKT Ser473 and p70S6K Thr389. AKT Ser473 is phosphorylated by PDK1 complexed to a region of protein kinase C-related kinase-2, called the PDK1-interacting fragment, whereas phosphorylation of Thr389 of p70S6K is mediated by NEK6/7 (12Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Google Scholar, 15Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Google Scholar, 52Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Google Scholar). Conus et al. (53Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Google Scholar) have also shown that depletion of calcium from intracellular stores blocks p70S6K activation, whereas the AKT response is unaffected, highlighting the differential activation requirements of these two proteins. The present report suggests that additional differences in the activation mechanism of p70S6K and AKT reside in the contribution of the p85 C-terminal region.Several lines of evidence suggest that p70S6K is downstream of AKT. Although constitutively active membrane-targeted forms of AKT activate p70S6K, AKT does not appear to phosphorylate p70S6K directly (13Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Google Scholar). The finding that p65PI3K/p110 activates AKT and not p70S6K shows that activation of AKT is not sufficient for p70S6K activation. It has also been suggested that AKT regulates FRAP function (54Nave B.T. Ouwens M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Google Scholar), and the data presented here do not refute this possibility. Nonetheless, the observation that kinase-dead mutants of AKT do not inhibit FRAP-dependent p70S6K activation by growth factors (36Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Google Scholar, 47Dufner A. Andjelkovic M. Burgering B.M. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4525-4534Google Scholar) does question the contribution of AKT in the process.To study the mechanism by which the p85 C-terminal region affects p70S6K activation, we examined whether impaired p70S6K activation in p65PI3K/p110-expressing cells correlated with an altered p70S6K phosphorylation pattern. Acidic substitutions of residues in the pseudosubstrate domain and in Thr389 did not compensate the activation defect of p70S6K in p65PI3K/p110-expressing cells. This suggests that defects other than phosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate region or Thr389 contribute to impairment of p70S6K activation in these cells. Similarly, although a significant reduction in overall p70S6K phosphorylation was found in p65PI3K/active p110-expressing cells, phosphotryptic peptide maps of p70S6K immunoprecipitated from p85/p110 or from p65PI3K/p110-expressing cells did not reveal a specific phosphorylation site defect. The lower overall phosphorylation may result from an inefficient early step in p70S6K activation or, alternatively, may reflect that p70S6K is dephosphorylated in p65PI3K-expressing cells.The observations presented demonstrate that the complex of p85, p70S6K, and FRAP plays an essential role in p70S6K activation. Romanelliet al. (48Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Google Scholar) reported that p70S6K associates with PKCζ and PDK1 and that formation of this complex is essential for PI3K-dependent p70S6K activation but not for PMA-induced p70S6K activation (48Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Google Scholar, 55Akimoto K. Nakaya M. Yamanaka T. Tanaka J. Matsuda S. Weng Q.P. Avruch J. Ohno S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 417-424Google Scholar). Although atypical PKCs are PI3K effectors and modulate p70S6K activity (48Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Google Scholar, 55Akimoto K. Nakaya M. Yamanaka T. Tanaka J. Matsuda S. Weng Q.P. Avruch J. Ohno S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 417-424Google Scholar, 56Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Google Scholar, 57Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the inability of p65PI3K/p110 to activate p70S6K depends on an atypical PKC, because constitutively active mutants of this protein failed to rescue p70S6K activation in p65PI3K transfectants (Fig. 5). In contrast, differential association was found of p85 and p65PI3K with p70S6K and even more clearly with FRAP. Whereas p85 associated efficiently with both p70S6K and FRAP, the association of these proteins with the mutant p65PI3K form was significantly weaker and, in the case of FRAP, could be detected only by reprecipitation techniques after prolonged exposure of the gels. We propose that p85 association with p70S6K and FRAP involves the C-SH2 domain, because this is absent in p65PI3K. Furthermore, the finding that the defective activation of p70S6K in p65PI3K cells can be overcome by deletion of the N- and C-terminal domains of p70S6K, conferring FRAP sensitivity, shows that the defective association with FRAP is responsible for the impaired p70S6K activation in p65PI3K cells. This observation underscores the role of the FRAP·p85 complex in regulating the endogenous p70S6K enzyme and supports the hypothesis that p85 links FRAP to p70S6K.The use of the immunosuppressant rapamycin has positioned FRAP upstream of p70S6K in the signaling cascade. FRAP has been shown to phosphorylate Thr389in vitro, but this observation has not been reproduced in vivo (17Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Google Scholar, 18Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Google Scholar). Indeed, the finding that the N- and C-terminally truncated p70S6K mutant is phosphorylated in vivo on Thr389 in the presence of rapamycin (19Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Google Scholar) suggests that FRAP must regulate p70S6K at a different stage. Concurring with this, whereas deletion of the regions that confer FRAP sensitivity restored p65PI3K/p110 activation of p70S6K, acidic substitution at p70S6K residue Thr389 was unable to rescue p70S6K activation. Belhamet al. (15Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Google Scholar) recently provided evidence suggesting that NEK6 and NEK7 are the Thr389 kinases. A distinct function for FRAP, consistent with its ability to regulate phosphorylation of multiple p70S6K residues (19Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Google Scholar), was recently proposed by Petersonet al. (20Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Google Scholar). They show that PP2A associates directly and dephosphorylates p70S6K and that FRAP inhibits PP2A-mediated p70S6K dephosphorylation. Moreover, they show that activation of the ΔN54ΔC104-p70S6K deletion mutant is FRAP-independent, because this p70S6K mutant does not bind PP2A (20Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Google Scholar). p65PI3K/p110 activates the ΔN54ΔC104-p70S6K mutant that does not bind PP2A (Fig.8A). In addition, PP2A inhibition restored p70S6K activation in p65PI3K-expressing cells (Fig. 8C). These observations demonstrate that the deficient phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K in p65PI3K-expressing cells is related to inefficient PI3K·p70S6K·FRAP complex formation by p65PI3K, which results in dephosphorylation of p70S6K by PP2A.Our results support a specific role for the p85 C-SH2 domain in mediating complex formation with p70S6K and FRAP. It is nevertheless possible that the p65PI3K N-SH2 domain partially compensates for the absence of C-SH2, accounting for the moderate association of p65PI3K with p70S6K and the very low association with FRAP. The differential specificity of the two SH2 domains of p85 (25Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar, 32Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Google Scholar) offers an explanation for the greater efficiency of the C-SH2 compared with the N-SH2 in mediating complex formation. Despite the defective p70S6K activation in p65PI3K cells, these cells grow efficiently. Activation of the other p70S6K isoform (p70S6K-II) (7Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5111Google Scholar), which is less dependent on PI3K and FRAP (58Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Google Scholar), or activation of p90rsk(60Templeton D.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R596-R599Google Scholar) may compensate for the p70S6K-I activation defect in these cells.Our results highlight the importance of the PI3K regulatory subunit in stabilizing a protein complex required for p70S6K activation. This complex includes p70S6K, PI3K, FRAP, and probably PDK1 and PKCζ, bringing p70S6K into the proximity of its activators and thereby mediating p70S6K activation. The studies presented here show that PI3K exerts two independent actions on p70S6K activation. The first, described previously, is dependent on PI3K enzymatic activity implicated in phosphorylation of Thr229 and Thr389 residues (9Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Google Scholar, 10Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14426-14433Google Scholar, 11Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Google Scholar); the other, described here, depends on the p85-PI3K regulatory subunit that mediates the formation of a multimolecular complex involving p85, FRAP, and p70S6K. This complex is required for efficient p70S6K activation. p70S6K1 is a mitogen-induced kinase with an important role in ribosome biogenesis. p70S6K phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal protein S6, regulating the translation of a set of mRNA transcripts containing a polypyrimidine tract at the 5′ transcriptional start site (1Jefferies H.B.

Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), as has previously been shown for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT-11 (2Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3244) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence relating promoter region CpG methylation to repression of gene expression has accumulated (3Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bird A. Cell. 1992; 70: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is presently known about the relationship between transcriptional repression and CpG methylation in the transcribed regions of vertebrate genes. Graessmannet al. (5Graessmann A. Sandberg G. Guhl E. Graessmann M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) microinjected hemi-methylated herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene DNA molecules into thymidine kinase-negative rat2 cells (5Graessmann A. Sandberg G. Guhl E. Graessmann M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and observed that conversion of the hemi-methylated DNA into symmetrically methylated DNA and integration into the host genome occurred early after gene transfer, before the cells entered into the S phase. Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene expression was inhibited either by promoter methylation or by methylation of the coding region (5Graessmann A. Sandberg G. Guhl E. Graessmann M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In transiently transformed protoplasts, using derivatives of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter lacking CG and CNG methylation targets, it was demonstrated that even when the promoter region was free of methylation targets, reporter gene expression was markedly reduced when cytosine residues in CG dinucleotides were methylated in vitro before transformation. Methylation nearer the 5′ end of the coding region was more inhibitory (6Hohn T. Corsten S. Rieke S. Muller M. Rothnie H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8334-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies, however, have not addressed the significance of transcribed region methylation on transcriptional repression for a native gene. Interestingly, in several situations active expression has been observed in the presence of extensive methylation in the transcribed region (7Jones P.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 34-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The relationship between two global mechanisms of gene regulation, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, remains unsettled. At present four proteins with a methyl-CpG-binding domain have been implicated in transcriptional repression (MeCP-2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3) (8Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Three of the four proteins (MeCP-2, MBD2, and MBD3) are part of complexes (MeCP-2, MeCP-1, and Mi-2) that contain histone deacetylases, and histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to relieve repression in some cases (8Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). However, the failure of TSA to activate naturally methylated CpG island promoters of tumor suppressor genes (9Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar, 10Singal R. van Wert J. Bashambu M.

Genet. 1999; 22: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), suggests that there exists a histone deacetylase-independent mechanism(s) for gene silencing by DNA methylation. In the avian β-type globin cluster (5′-ρ-βH-β-ε-3′), silencing of the embryonic ρ-gene occurs concomitantly with activation of the adult β-gene on day 5 of embryonic development (13Brown J.L. Ingram V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3960-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In definitive embryonic and adult chicken erythroid cells, the embryonic globin genes are non-transcribed (14Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, we have demonstrated that the ρ-globin gene in adult erythroid cells in vivo can be transcriptionally stimulated by treatment of adult chickens with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, butyrate, but only if the gene is first demethylated (16Burns L.J. Glauber J.G. Ginder G.D. Blood. 1988; 72: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Ginder G.D. Whitters M.J. Pohlman J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our group have shown that methylation of the ρ-gene begins in the 248-bp proximal transcribed region shortly after the initiation of the switch from embryonic ρ-globin gene transcription to adult β-globin gene transcription at day 6 of embryonic development. This occurs at a time when the ρ-gene promoter remains largely unmethylated (19Singal R. vanWert J.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 3441-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the transcription inhibitory effect of physiologically precise CpG methylation of the ρ-globin gene 248-bp proximal transcribed region in primary embryonic erythroid cells and discuss its potential role in globin gene switching. Transfection vectors for testing the effects of the proximal exon-1/intron-1 sequences were constructed in pUC18. The starting vector for transfections was a ρ-promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter containing hypersensitive sites 2 and 3 of the chicken 5′ locus control region element, as described previously (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A 248-bp fragment containing exon 1 and part of intron 1 of the ρ-gene was cloned into this plasmid in reading frame with the CAT protein-coding sequences. The bicistronic construct was based on the dual reporter gene plasmid pIRESneo(CLONTECH) 1.65-kilobase luciferase reporter gene, derived from the plasmid pGL-3 (Promega) and was inserted upstream of the ECMV internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The Neoexpression cassette downstream from the internal ribosome entry site was replaced with the ρ exon-1/intron-1-CAT fusion gene. A 4-kilobase fragment containing the avian β-globin cluster hypersensitive sites 2 and 3 was then cloned upstream from the ρ-promoter. The internal ribosome entry site permits translation of both the luciferase and CAT open reading frames from the same mRNA. The 248-bp exon-1/intron-1 fragment, flanked by the unique restriction sites NheI andStuI, was then excised and methylated at every cytosine by the bacterial methylase, SssI (New England Biolabs), or mock-methylated in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine. The methylated or mock-methylated control NheI/StuI fragment was then re-ligated into the parent vector before transfection. The bicistronic gene construct was methylated similarly. DNA was isolated from 5-day embryonic or adult chicken erythroid cells and treated with sodium bisulfite as previously described (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was achieved by nested primer PCR using the following primers: outer forward, 5′-TGT TAA GTT GGT TAT TGT TTT GTT ATG GAA-3′; outer reverse, 5′-TTC CCC AAA AAA ACT CAA CAC TTT TTT ACC-3′; inner forward, 5′-GGG GTG GGG AGG AGT TGT TAG-3′; inner reverse, 5′-AAA TTA TCA AAA AAC CTC TAA ATC CA-3′. Primers were constructed based on the predicted sequence after bisulfite conversion. Sequencing of the PCR product was carried out using α-33P-labeled dideoxy-NTP terminators as per the manufacturer's protocol (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) using the internal primers. Transfection of primary chicken erythroid cells was carried out as previously described (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were cultured for 36 h in Leibovitz's culture medium. Cells were harvested, and cytoplasmic extracts were assayed for CAT activity using a liquid scintillation assay kit (Promega) in a Beckman LS400 scintillation counter. All transfections were repeated at least three times, and values are expressed as the mean value with S.E. of the mean for each construct tested. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system. Controls for transfection efficiency were carried out for each assay using a β-galactoside reporter construct driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter enhancer. In some experiments, trichostatin A (TSA) at a 100 nm final concentration was added 6 h after transfection. 5-Day chicken red blood cells were harvested and transfected with a ρ-promoter-driven CAT reporter plasmid construct as described above. Nuclei were isolated and prepared 48 h after transfection as previously described (18Ginder G.D. Whitters M.J. Pohlman J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nuclei from each transfection were immediately digested with 0.5 units of micrococcal nuclease for 3 min at 37 °C, followed by deproteination and DNA isolation for Southern blot analysis, all as previously described (18Ginder G.D. Whitters M.J. Pohlman J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,20Brotherton T.W. Ginder G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3447-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Southern blot probe for the transfected plasmid sequence was a 300-bp EcoRI/NcoI restriction fragment (2528–2829) of the 3′-CAT sequence isolated from the pCAT-Basic plasmid vector (Promega). The probe for the endogenous chicken ovalbumin gene was the region from 1614 to 2163 (GenBankTMV00438). HeLa cell and 11-day embryonic erythroid cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to a modified Dignam procedure as previously described (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The probes used were CG11, a 135-bp fragment containing 20 GCGC sites and 7 CCGG sites, and ρ-248, a 248-bp fragment containing exon 1 and part of intron 1 of the ρ-globin gene. Each probe was obtained by restriction enzyme digestion of the parent plasmid and labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. Assay conditions were as previously described (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Quantitative competition assays were carried out by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis of three electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) gels for each probe-competitor combination in which separate probe and nuclear extract preparations were used. Histones were isolated from transfected primary erythroid cells as previously described (20Brotherton T.W. Ginder G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3447-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis in a precast 16.5% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane was performed at 30 volts and 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk for 20 min at 25 °C with agitation followed by incubation with 700 ng/ml anti-acetylated histone H-4 antibody or anti-acetylated H-3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 25 °C. After washing 5 times in distilled water, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG using a Western blot kit (Bio-Rad). The detection assay was performed using an ECL detection reagent according to the protocol provided by the vendor (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For antibody supershift/ablation experiments, EMSA was performed as described above with or without the addition of one of the following anti-sera or affinity-purified antibodies: sheep anti-MBD-2 antisera, 13–23 μg (a gift of Dr. A. Bird); sheep pre-immune sera; N-18 goat anti-MBD-2 IgG (0.8 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); or goat pre-immune IgG, 0.8 μg before the addition of probe to either HeLa or erythroid nuclear extracts. Antibody affinity beads were prepared by incubating 200 μl of protein G-agarose gel solution (Pierce) with 15 μg of either C-19 (C-terminal) or N-19 (N-terminal) goat polyclonal anti-HDAC-1 antibody (Santa Cruz) or goat pre-immune IgG overnight at 4 °C. Affinity beads were incubated with either HeLa or erythroid cell nuclear extracts for 3 h at 4 °C. After low speed centrifugation, immunodepleted extracts were incubated with a32P-end-labeled probe and subjected to EMSA. We determined the methylation pattern of CpG dinucleotides in the 248-bp proximal transcribed region distal to the transcription start site of the ρ-globin gene in erythroid cells from 4.5-day embryos and adult chickens by the bisulfite genomic-sequencing technique (21Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar, 22Singal R. Ginder G.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 4059-4070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1A, sequencing of the PCR products showed the presence of cytosine residues (indicated byarrows) only in PCR products obtained from adult erythroid cell DNA. All unmethylated cytosine residues in the original sequence were converted to thymidines in DNA derived from both primitive and definitive erythroid cells, demonstrating the completeness of the bisulfite conversion. As summarized in Fig. 1B, the 248-bp proximal transcribed region of the embryonic ρ-globin gene contains completely methylated cytosine residues in all CpG dinucleotides in DNA from definitive adult chicken erythroid cells, whereas none of the cytosine residues were methylated in primitive 4.5-day embryonic erythroid cells. The 248-bp proximal coding region contains 14 CpG dinucleotides. Because the MeCP-1 complex requires 10 CpG dinucleotides for its binding activity (23Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 24Cross S.H. Meehan R.R. Nan X. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the 248-bp proximal transcribed region could potentially be an efficient substrate for MeCP-1 binding. To allow us to isolate, differentially methylate, and re-ligate the proximal coding region into the vector, we cloned this fragment in-frame 5′ to the CAT gene at unique restriction sites in the plasmid ρ235 (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because this fragment includes both the transcription and translation start sites of the ρ-globin gene, we anticipated that transcription through these sequences would be reflected by the CAT activity of the resulting fusion protein. Others have used a similar strategy to generate a fusion protein that retains CAT activity (25Albano C.R. Randers-Eichhorn L. Bentley W.E. Rao G. Biotechnol. Prog. 1998; 14: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After obtaining the clone ρ235/ρ248, it was sequenced to be certain that the downstream CAT gene remained in-frame. The CAT fusion protein derived from the ρ235/ρ248 clone demonstrated significant CAT activity in a transient transfection assay using primary erythroid cells, confirming the integrity of the CAT reading frame. Because all CpG dinucleotides were found to be methylated in the 248-bp proximal coding region of the ρ-globin gene from adult erythroid cell genomic DNA, methylation experiments were carried out using the enzyme SssI methylase, which methylates all CpG dinucleotides. As shown in Fig. 2, methylation of the 248-bp proximal coding region alone resulted in a 5-fold repression of expression from the ρ-promoter. Methylation of both the promoter and the 248-bp proximal transcribed region resulted in a >30-fold repression. Because previous studies had shown a ∼10–20-fold effect of methylation of the promoter alone (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and concomitant studies of “promoter only” versus “promoter plus proximal transcribed region” methylation showed an additional effect mediated by the proximal transcribed sequences (data not shown), this result suggests that methylation of the 248-bp sequences contributes to repression. It is not clear if this effect is truly additive, however, because of technical limitations of the assay system. (See Fig. 2.) A number of observations support the notion that DNA methylation exerts its inhibitory effects on transcription primarily in the context of chromatin (3Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 26Buschhausen G. Wittig B. Graessmann M. Graessmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although the repressive effects of CpG methylation on the ρ-gene promoter that are demonstrated in the present studies mirror the physiologic repression associated with methylation of the same CpG sites in adult chickensin vivo (18Ginder G.D. Whitters M.J. Pohlman J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the role of chromatin in the current primary erythroid cell transient transfection assays remained uncertain. Previous studies showed that transiently transfected gene constructs can be packaged into nucleosomes, the most basic organizational level of chromatin (27Reeves R. Gorman C.M. Howard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3599-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To test the status of the transfected ρ-promoter constructs in transfected primary erythroid cells, micrococcal nuclease digestion of transfected and control untransfected primary erythroid cell nuclei were carried out (20Brotherton T.W. Ginder G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3447-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the resultant DNA samples were analyzed by Southern blot analysis as shown in Fig.3. The results of this micrococcal assay show that the transfected ρ-promoter-driven CAT construct is efficiently packaged into nucleosomes. To test whether methylation of the exon-1/intron-1 sequences of the ρ gene can inhibit transcription elongation or if it only inhibits transcription when positioned proximal to the promoter, the bicistronic gene construct illustrated in Fig.4A was tested. This construct contains the ρ gene 5′ hypersensitive site enhancer and promoter driving a luciferase reporter followed by an internal ribosome entry site upstream from the ρ intron-1/exon-1 segment ligated in reading frame to a CAT reporter gene. The ρ exon-1/intron-1 segment was then excised, either methylated or mock-methylated with SssI methylase, then re-ligated back into the dual reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, methylation of the exon-1/intron-1 sequences did not inhibit expression of either the upstream luciferase reporter or the downstream CAT reporter. Thus, methylation does not block downstream transcription elongation. Likewise, in contrast to the situation when the methylated exon-1/intron-1 segment is located immediately adjacent to the ρ promoter (Fig. 2), there is no inhibition of the promoter when the segment is located 2.7 kilobases downstream. These results are consistent with the findings of Schubeler et al. (28Schubeler D. Lorincz M.C. Cimbora D.M. Telling A. Feng Y.Q. Bouhassira E.E. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9103-9112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that methylation of a reporter gene segment inhibited initiation rather than elongation of transcription from a human γ globin gene promoter in a stably transfected immortalized MEL cell line. The present results extend those findings to a naturally occurring gene sequence methylated in a physiologically correct fashion in primary erythroid cells and demonstrate that inhibition of transcription initiation requires that the methylated DNA segment be positioned close to the promoter. Direct binding of specific transcriptional repressor complexes to methylated DNA appears to be a major mechanism of transcriptional repression (8Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Methyl cytosine-binding protein complexes 1 and 2 (MeCP-1 and MeCP-2) have been identified and shown to bind to methylated CpG residues in any sequence context (23Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 29Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. Bird A.P.

Suppl. 1992; 16: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MeCP-1 binds to multiple symmetrically methylated CpGs in contrast to MeCP-2, which is more abundant than MeCP-1 in the cell and is able to bind to DNA containing a single methylated CpG pair (29Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. Bird A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 30Meehan R. Lewis J. Cross S. Nan X. Jeppesen P. Bird A. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1992; 16: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies from this laboratory have shown previously that methylated ρ-gene promoter sequences can bind to an MeCP-1-like complex, MeCPC (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the transcriptional repression conferred by methylated ρ-gene 248-bp transcribed sequences correlates with their affinity for MeCPC, which would imply a role for MeCPC in mediating transcriptional repression as was previously demonstrated for the ρ-gene 235-bp promoter sequences (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). End-labeled methylated and mock-methylated CG11 probes (M-CG11 and CG11, respectively) were incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extract and then subjected to EMSA to detect an MeCP-1-like complex as described (17Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). On autoradiography, a complex was observed with M-CG11, as shown in Fig.5A, and this complex was effectively competed by a 25-fold molar excess of cold M-CG11 but not by a 100-fold excess of cold, unmethylated CG11. In contrast, methylated ρ 248-bp fragment (M-ρ 248) was unable to compete more than 50% of the MeCP-1 complex, even at a 200-fold molar excess (Figs.5, A and C). Moreover, when an end-labeled M-ρ 248 probe was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts under identical conditions, no complex was observed after EMSA (Fig. 5E). To determine whether the M-ρ 248 can form a specific complex, we incubated an end-labeled M-ρ 248 probe with primary erythroid cell nuclear extracts and carried out EMSA in the presence or absence of an increasing molar excess of cold M-ρ 248 or M-CG11 competitor DNA. As shown in Fig. 5B, M-ρ 248 does form a specific complex that is competed approximately 2-fold more effectively by itself than by M-CG11 (Fig. 5D) but is not competed by mock-methylated ρ 248 or CG11. These results suggest that MeCPC is similar but not identical to MeCP-1. Interestingly, nuclear extract from mouse erythroleukemia cells also formed a complex with M-ρ 248. This complex migrates at the same position as MeCPC (data not shown). Thus, the formation of MeCPC appears to be cell type-specific, suggesting a difference in its composition compared with canonical MeCP-1. Because MeCP-1 has been shown to contain MBD-2 as a major DNA binding component and HDAC-1 as a mediator of repression, we sought to determine whether MeCPC also contains these critical components. End-labeled M-ρ 248 was incubated with primary erythroid nuclear extracts and subjected to EMSA, and end-labeled M-CG11 was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts as a positive control. As shown in Fig.6, incubation with an anti-MBD-2 antiserum (the kind gift of Dr. Adrian Bird) resulted in a supershift of both MeCP-1 and MeCPC (panel A), whereas incubation with an N-terminal specific affinity-purified anti-MBD-2 antibody (Santa Cruz) resulted in ablation of both complexes (panel B). To determine whether HDAC-1 is present in the MeCPC complex, end-labeled M-ρ 248 was incubated with primary erythroid extracts that had been immunodepleted by incubation with protein G-bound anti-HDAC-1 antibody. As shown in lanes 4–6 of Fig. 6C, immunodepletion with anti-HDAC-"
https://openalex.org/W2055737551,"Synthesis of the type 3 capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae is catalyzed by the membrane-localized type 3 synthase, which utilizes UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA to form high molecular mass [3-beta-d-GlcUA-(1-->4)-beta-d-Glc-(1-->](n). Expression of the synthase in Escherichia coli resulted in synthesis of a 40-kDa protein that was reactive with antibody directed against the C terminus of the synthase and was the same size as the native enzyme. Membranes isolated from E. coli contained active synthase, as demonstrated by the ability to incorporate Glc and GlcUA into a high molecular mass polymer that could be degraded by type 3 polysaccharide-specific depolymerase. As in S. pneumoniae, the membrane-bound synthase from E. coli catalyzed a rapid release of enzyme-bound polysaccharide when incubated with either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA alone. The recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli was capable of releasing all of the polysaccharide from the enzyme, although the chains remained associated with the membrane. The recombinant enzyme was also able to reinitiate polysaccharide synthesis following polymer release by utilizing a lipid primer present in the membranes. At low concentrations of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA (1 microm in the presence of Mg(2+) and 0.2 microm in Mn(2+)), novel glycolipids composed of repeating disaccharides with linkages consistent with type 3 polysaccharide were synthesized. As the concentration of the UDP-sugars was increased, there was a marked transition from glycolipid to polymer formation. At UDP-sugar concentrations of either 5 microm (with Mg(2+)) or 1.5 microm (with Mn(2+)), 80% of the incorporated sugar was in polymer form, and the size of the polymer increased dramatically as the concentration of UDP-sugars was increased. These results suggest a cooperative interaction between the UDP-precursor-binding site(s) and the nascent polysaccharide-binding site, resulting in a non-processive addition of sugars at the lower UDP-sugar concentrations and a processive reaction as the substrate concentrations increase."
https://openalex.org/W2022757625,"Tec is the prototypic member of a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that includes Txk, Bmx, Itk, and Btk. Tec family kinases share similarities in domain structure with Src family kinases, but one of the features that differentiates them is a proline-rich region (PRR) preceding their Src homology (SH) 3 domain. Evidence that the PRR of Itk can bind in an intramolecular fashion to its SH3 domain and the lack of a regulatory tyrosine in the C terminus indicates that Tec kinases must be regulated by a different set of intramolecular interactions to the Src kinases. We have determined the solution structure of the Tec SH3 domain and have investigated interactions with its PRR, which contains two SH3-binding sites. We demonstrate that in vitro, the Tec PRR can bind in an intramolecular fashion to the SH3. However, the affinity is lower than that for dimerization via reciprocal PRR-SH3 association. Using site-directed mutagenesis we show that both sites can bind the Tec SH3 domain; site 1 (155KTLPPAP161) binds intramolecularly, while site 2 (165KRRPPPPIPP174) cannot and binds in an intermolecular fashion. These distinct roles for the SH3 binding sites in Tec family kinases could be important for protein targeting and enzyme activation."

Ca2+, an important intracellular messenger, and calmodulin (CaM), one of the primary Ca2+ sensors, have been implicated in controlling diverse cellular processes in plants including tuberization. The regulation of cellular processes by CaM involves its interaction with other proteins. To understand the role of Ca2+/CaM in tuberization, we have screened an expression library prepared from developing tubers with biotinylated CaM. This screening resulted in isolation of a cDNA encoding a novel CaM-binding protein (potato calmodulin-binding protein (PCBP)). Ca2+-dependent binding of the cDNA-encoded protein to CaM is confirmed by 35S-labeled CaM. The full-length cDNA is 5 kb long and encodes a protein of 1309 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant similarity with a hypothetical protein from another plant,Arabidopsis. However, no homologs of PCBP are found in nonplant systems, suggesting that it is likely to be specific to plants. Using truncated versions of the protein and a synthetic peptide in CaM binding assays we mapped the CaM-binding region to a 20-amino acid stretch (residues 1216–1237). The bacterially expressed protein containing the CaM-binding domain interacted with three CaM isoforms (CaM2, CaM4, and CaM6). PCBP is encoded by a single gene and is expressed differentially in the tissues tested. The expression of CaM, PCBP, and another CaM-binding protein is similar in different tissues and organs. The predicted protein contained seven putative nuclear localization signals and several strong PEST motifs. Fusion of the N-terminal region of the protein containing six of the seven nuclear localization signals to the reporter gene β-glucuronidase targeted the reporter gene to the nucleus, suggesting a nuclear role for PCBP.

Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 3Knight H.

Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 95-122Crossref Scopus (915) Google Scholar). A tip-focused Ca2+ gradient has been shown to be important for the growth of root hairs and pollen tubes (6Pierson E.S. Miller D.D. Callaham D.A. Shipley A.M. Rivers B.A. Cresti M. Hepler P.K.

Furthermore, diverse signals including hormones, light, touch, wind, cold, drought, oxidative stress, nodulation factors, and fungal elicitors have been shown to cause a transient increase in free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm (2Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 5Bush D.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 95-122Crossref Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 9Reddy A.S.N.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Ca2+sensors then transmit the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ level to cellular metabolic processes. Plants have at least four major families of Ca2+ sensors: (i) calmodulin (CaM)1; (ii) CaM-like and other EF-hand containing Ca2+-binding proteins; (iii) Ca2+-regulated protein kinases; and (iv) Ca2+-binding proteins without EF-hand motifs (2Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). An EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix that binds Ca2+. CaM, a highly conserved well characterized Ca2+ sensor in eukaryotes, is a small protein with four EF-hands that each bind Ca2+ (11Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The EF-hands are paired in two globular domains connected by a central helix (12Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). In plants, CaM is encoded by multiple genes that have been shown to be expressed differentially (11Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31727-31733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ to CaM results in a conformational change that exposes hydrophobic pockets that can then interact with target proteins (23O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar,24Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). CaM mediates intracellular Ca2+ by regulating the activity/function of diverse proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The physiological response that is elicited by the elevated cytosolic Ca2+signal is derived, to some extent, from the expression patterns and activities of the proteins regulated by CaM (11Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In a few cases CaM can interact with its target proteins in the absence of Ca2+ (2Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Identification and characterization of calmodulin-binding proteins (CBPs) is critical to the understanding of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling pathways. The CaM-binding domain of CBPs is not conserved; hence, biochemical and molecular methods based on protein-protein interaction have been used to identify CBPs (25Fromm H. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 1944-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These methods have allowed identification of several plant CBPs that are involved in morphogenesis, cell division, cell elongation, ion transport, gene regulation, cytoskeletal organization, cytoplasmic streaming, pollen function, and stress tolerance (2Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Potato is the fourth most important crop, and understanding of molecular events in potato tuber initiation and development is of importance for manipulation of these processes to improve the yield and quality of potato (30Jackson S.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Both environmental and hormonal factors affect tuberization. Three factors have a major effect on tuberization: nitrogen levels, temperature, and light. High nitrogen levels were found to prevent tuberization, but how nitrogen levels control tuberization is not known (31Krauss A. Li P.H. Potato Physiology. Academic Press, London1985: 209-231Google Scholar). Some evidence shows that a withdrawal of nitrogen affects phytohormone levels, causing a reduction in gibberellic acid (GA) and an increase in abscisic acid, whereas other evidence indicates that the nitrogen/carbohydrate ratio is involved (31Krauss A. Li P.H. Potato Physiology. Academic Press, London1985: 209-231Google Scholar, 32Koda Y. Okazawa Y. Jpn. J. Crop Sci. 1983; 52: 582-591Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). High temperature is also an inhibitor of tuberization and may also be mediated by GA levels. In one study, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis overcame the inhibition of tuberization caused by high temperature (33Menzel C.M. Ann. Bot. 1983; 52: 697-702Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Light intensity as well as day length affects tuberization. Potato is a short day plant (the length of the dark period is the important factor) (34Snyder Ewing E.E. Hortic. Sci. 1989; 24: 336-338Google Scholar). Low light intensity delays tuberization even in short day conditions, and as is the case with nitrogen levels, both GA and carbohydrate have been implicated as mediators (30Jackson S.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The photoperiodism response of tuberization has to be transmitted from the leaf to the underground stolons, and GA has been implicated in this response also (30Jackson S.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). There is some evidence indicating the involvement of Ca2+/CaM in tuberization (35Balamani V. Veluthambi K. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 856-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Poovaiah B.W. Takezawa D. An G. Han T.J. J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 149: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Potato leaf cuttings could be induced to produce tubers under short day conditions. Ca2+ depletion in the leaf cuttings prevented tuberization, and subsequent to Ca2+ depletion, if the leaf cuttings were transferred to CaCl2 solution, tuber development occurred (35Balamani V. Veluthambi K. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 856-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of leaf cuttings with CaM antagonists was found to inhibit tuberization (35Balamani V. Veluthambi K. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 856-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer of the leaf cuttings that were pretreated with CaM antagonists to medium with no antagonists reversed the inhibition. Furthermore, transgenic potato plants with a moderate increase in expression of a CaM gene (PCM1) produced elongated tubers, whereas a large increase of PCM1 inhibited tuber formation and increased stolon elongation (36Poovaiah B.W. Takezawa D. An G. Han T.J. J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 149: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Eight CaM (PCM1–PCM8) genes have been isolated and characterized from potato (16Takezawa D. Liu Z.H. An G. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Jena P.K. Reddy A.S.N. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of these genes differed in various tissues (16Takezawa D. Liu Z.H. An G. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Jena P.K. Reddy A.S.N. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These studies indicate regulation of tuberization by Ca2+/CaM. To identify CaM-binding proteins that mediate CaM action in tuberization, we have used labeled CaM to screen an expression library prepared from developing tubers. A full-length clone of a novel CaM-binding protein (potato calmodulin-binding protein (PCBP)) was isolated in this screen. Ca2+-dependent binding of PCBP to CaM was confirmed using both biotinylated and35S-labeled CaM. The CaM-binding site was mapped to a stretch of 22 amino acids. Bacterially expressed PCBP interacted with three CaM isoforms. Fusion of the N-terminal region of PCBP to a cytosolic reporter gene targeted the fusion protein to the nucleus, indicating a nuclear role for PCBP. Easy tag [35S] isotope labeling mix was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Exassist helper phage andEscherichia coli SOLR cells were from Stratagene. Triton X-100 free nitrocellulose filter discs were obtained from Millipore. Nitroblue tetrazoleum, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and IPTG were obtained from Invitrogen. pET vectors and E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) were purchased from Novagen. Gelatin and diaminobenzidene were obtained from Sigma. Biotinylated CaM and bovine CaM were procured from Calbiochem. Avidin/biotin blocking reagents and Vectastain ABC horseradish peroxidase kit were obtained from Vector Laboratories. The complete protease inhibitor mix was fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Bovine CaM Sepharose-4B was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Immobilon membrane was obtained from Millipore. Potato plants were grown in the greenhouse at 26 °C (day)/18 °C (night). A potato cDNA expression library was screened using biotinylated CaM following the procedure described previously (26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 355-363Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cDNA library in λZap II was made from RNA isolated from swelling stolon tips of potato (38Taylor M.A. Mad Arif S.A. Kumar A. Davies H.V. Scobie L.A. Pearce S.R. Flavell A.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). About 5 × 104plaque-forming units were plated on each plate using E. coliXL1-blue MRA as the host strain. The plates were incubated at 42 °C until the plaques appeared. Then the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that were presoaked in 10 mm IPTG. The plaques were allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C, the plates were cooled to 4 °C, and the filters were removed and rinsed briefly in TNMC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2) at room temperature. The filters were blocked for 1 h in the above buffer containing 3% (w/v) gelatin at 30 °C, rinsed, and blocked with avidin and biotin as described earlier (26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 355-363Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The filters were then incubated in TNMC buffer containing biotinylated CaM (1 μg/ml) and 1% gelatin for 3 h at 30 °C. The filters were washed and transferred to TMNC buffer containing Vectastain ABC-horseradish peroxidase reagent (avidin DH-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H complex) at 30 °C. The filters were washed twice, and the positive plaques were identified by incubating them in a substrate solution (0.8 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, 0.4 mg/ml NiCl2, and 0.009% H2O2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Screening of about a million recombinants resulted in the isolation of 10 putative CaM-binding clones, which were purified by two additional rounds of screening. The cDNA clones were excised in vivo in a plasmid (pBluescript) form following standard procedures. Ca2+-dependent binding of the isolated clones to CaM was further confirmed with35S-labeled CaM. An E. coli strain UT481 containing a CaM gene in an expression vector (pVUCH-1) was used to label CaM with [35S]methionine (26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 355-363Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39Lukas T.J. Craig T.A. Roberts D.M. Watterson D.M. Proc. Fifth Intnl. Symp. on Calcium Binding Proteins in Health and Disease. Academic Press, New York1987: 533-543Google Scholar). Preparation of35S-CaM was described earlier (26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 355-363Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A cDNA (λICM-1) encoding a Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase from mouse was used as a positive control (40Sikela J.M. Hahn W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3038-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert from each clone was sequenced by a dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using double-stranded DNA as a template. Both strands of cDNAs were sequenced. Nucleotide sequences were assembled and analyzed using MacVector and Sequencher. BLAST searches were performed at the websites of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and theArabidopsis Information Resource. Nuclear localization and PEST signals were identified using ExPASy Proteomics tools (www.expasy. ch/tools). Two constructs expressing truncated fusion proteins (pET 1.1 and pET 0.3) were prepared in pET28 expression vector. A 1.1-kb SacI/SalI cDNA fragment corresponding to the C-terminal end of the protein (amino acids 976–1309) was cloned into a pET28c vector that is digested with the same enzymes to generate pET 1.1 construct. The second construct (pET 0.3) containing the coding region for residues 976–1098 was made by deleting a 0.9-kb XhoI fragment from the pET 1.1 construct. pET 1.1 and pET 0.3 constructs were introduced into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Overnight cultures containing these constructs were used to inoculate fresh cultures that were grown to an approximate optical density of 0.6. The fusion protein was induced by adding 0.2 mm IPTG and growing the culture overnight at room temperature. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml lysozyme, and complete proteinase inhibitor mix. Lysed cells were sonicated six times for 10–15 s each and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (Sorvall) for 30 min to obtain soluble proteins. A calmodulin-Sepharose-4B column was prepared and equilibrated according to the instructions provided by Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The bacterial pellet from a 50-ml culture was suspended in 5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and complete proteinase inhibitor mix. The suspension was lysed by incubating on ice for a period of 1 h in the presence of 200 μg/ml lysozyme followed by five to six pulses of sonication on ice. The supernatant obtained after high speed centrifugation was passed through a CaM-Sepharose column. The unbound protein was washed with several volumes of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2), and the bound protein was eluted with binding buffer except that CaCl2 was replaced with 2 mm EGTA. Fusion proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked overnight in 3% gelatin, and incubated with biotinylated CaM (26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 355-363Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The blots were then incubated in Vectastain ABC-horseradish peroxidase in TBS/calcium/magnesium or TBS/EGTA/magnesium for 30 min and washed three times for 10 min each time with the above buffer, and the CaM-binding proteins were detected colorimetrically as described above. A synthetic peptide (SKLKKLILLKRSIKALEKARKF) corresponding to amino acids 1216–1237 was synthesized in the Macromolecular Resource facility at Colorado State University. The purity of the peptides is over 95%. The interaction of bovine CaM and Arabidopsis CaM isoforms with the synthetic peptide was analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift of CaM in the presence of the synthetic peptide (27Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Erickson-Vitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Each of theArabidopsis CaM isoforms and the bovine CaM (178 pmol) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the synthetic peptide (89, 178, and 356 pmol) in the presence of 4 m urea in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmCaCl2 at room temperature for 1 h in a total volume of 20 μl. Ten μl of sample buffer (0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, and 0.023% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample, and the mixture was electrophoresed in 14% polyacrylamide gels containing 7.5% glycerol, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 1 mm CaCl2. The gels were run, stained, and destained essentially as described previously (42Safadi F. Reddy V. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35457-35470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Soluble and insoluble proteins from the induced and uninduced cultures containing the pET 1.1 construct and the pET 1.1 protein that was purified on CaM-Sepharose column were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted as described above. To detect the binding of the fusion protein to35S-labeled CaM isoforms, blots were incubated for 15 min in a blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% nonfat dry milk) containing 5 mmof either CaCl2 or EGTA. The blots were then incubated for 12 h in 35S-labeled CaM2, CaM4, or CaM6 isoforms at 1 μg/ml in the same buffers as above. The filters were then washed with the corresponding buffer, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Genomic DNA was isolated from potato leaves following standard procedures and purified by CsCl density gradient (43Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). About 8 μg of genomic DNA was digested with different restriction enzymes, electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel, and transferred onto a Hybond N nylon membrane. The DNA was fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking. The blot was hybridized to radiolabeled cDNA fragment at 65 °C and washed under high stringency conditions (43Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by homogenizing the tissue in guanidinium thiocyanate and pelleting the RNA through a cesium chloride cushion (43Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was separated in a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and blotted onto a nylon membrane. The RNA blots were prehybridized and hybridized as above using the full-length cDNA as a probe. Prior to blotting RNA gels were tested for equal loading by staining with ethidium bromide. A recombinant plasmid with a 2-kbBglII/BamHI fragment from PCBP containing multiple nuclear localization sequences was cloned in-frame following a GUS gene driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in pRTL 2-GUS. A pRTL 2-GUS-NIa construct (44Restrepo M.A. Freed D.D. Carrington J.C. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was used to make the pRTL 2-GUS-PCBP construct. The BglII/BamHI fragment in pRTL 2-GUS/NIa was deleted and replaced with theBglII/BamHI fragment from PCBP to create pRTL 2-GUS-PCBP. The plasmids pBI-GUS, in which GUS is driven by the same promoter, and pRTL2-GUS-NIa, in which GUS is fused to a known nuclear protein, were used as controls. Cells in the epidermal layer of onion bulbs were transformed with the pRTL 2-GUS-PCBP, pRTL 2-GUS-NIa, or pBI-GUS using the helium biolistic particle delivery system (Bio-Rad). Onion epidermal layers were peeled and placed on solidified phytagar (0.4%) in Petri dishes. Plasmid DNA was precipitated on to sterilized tungsten particles (1.1 μm) by mixing 50 μl (3 mg) of particles, 5 μl of DNA (1 μg/μl), 50 μl of 2.5 m calcium chloride, and 20 μl of 0.1 m spermidine. The mixture was vortexed, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged briefly. The beads were washed first with 70% ethanol and then with 100% ethanol. Tungsten particles coated with DNA were resuspended in 48 μl of 100% ethanol, and 12 μl of this was used for each bombardment. 1100 p.s.i. rupture discs were used. After bombardment, Petri plates containing the epidermal layers were incubated overnight at 22 °C. The cell layers were then stained for GUS activity as described earlier (45Stomp A.-M. Gallagher S.R. GUS Protocols: Using the GUS Gene as a Reporter of Gene Expression. Academic Press, New York1992: 103-113Crossref Google Scholar) and mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The GUS-stained cells were visualized using bright field microscopy, and the nuclei were visualized under UV. The pictures were captured using a digital camera (Kodak). To isolate CBPs from developing tubers, a cDNA library from swelling stolon tips of potato was screened with biotinylated CaM (26Fordham-Skelton A.P. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 355-363Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Screening of about one million recombinants resulted in isolation of 10 positives. Rescreening of these positive clones by excluding the incubation step with biotinylated CaM did not yield positive signals, indicating that the isolated clones are true positives. Furthermore, all 10 clones bound biotinylated CaM only in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). To further confirm Ca2+-dependent binding of proteins encoded by isolated clones, plaques from positive clones were probed with35S-CaM in the presence of CaCl2 or EGTA. A cDNA (λICM-1), which encodes a CaM-binding protein from mouse, was used as a positive control (40Sikela J.M. Hahn W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3038-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Positive clones were detected in the presence of CaCl2 but not in the presence of EGTA (Fig.1). Sequence analysis of all the clones has revealed that the isolated cDNAs fall into two groups. One group of clones was represented by three independent clones (PCBP4, PCBP7, and PCBP25) of the same gene but differing in their length. One of the three clones (PCBP25) is a full-length cDNA, whereas the other t"

Among these latter, PEA3/E1AF, ER81/ETV1, and ERM, members of the well conserved PEA3 group from the Ets family are involved in these processes. We show here that protein kinase A (PKA) increases the transcriptional activity of human ERM and human ETV1, through a Ser residue situated at the edge of the ETS DNA-binding domain. PKA phosphorylation does not directly affect the ERM transactivation domains but does affect DNA binding activity. Unphosphorylated wild-type ERM bound DNA avidly, whereas after PKA phosphorylation it did so very weakly. Interestingly, S367A mutation significantly reduced the ERM-mediated transcription in the presence of the kinase, and the DNA binding of this mutant, although similar to that of unphosphorylated wild-type protein, was insensitive to PKA treatment. Mutations, which may mimic a phosphorylated serine, converted ERM from an efficient DNA-binding protein to a poor DNA binding one, with inefficiency of PKA phosphorylation. The present data clearly demonstrate a close correlation between the capacity of PKA to increase the transactivation of ERM and the drastic down-regulation of the binding of the ETS domain to the targeted DNA. What we thus demonstrate here is a relatively rare transcription activation mechanism through a decrease in DNA binding, probably by the shift of a non-active form of an Ets protein to a PKA-phosphorylated active one, which should be in a conformation permitting a transactivation domain to be active.

Several molecules involved in intracellular signaling are encoded by oncogenes, which directly link their potential aberrant expression to cell transformation or altered proliferation. The final step of the transduction pathway is the activation of nuclear transcription factors. For example, the cyclic-AMP- and calcium-regulated nuclear factor is activated through the protein kinase A (PKA)1 pathway via phosphorylation. The differential phosphorylation of transcription factors by signal transduction pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. This is the case for the c-fos gene expression, which is regulated by the binding to DNA of the Elk/TCF factor after phosphorylation through the MAPK pathway. The activation of MAPK cascades leads to changes in the activity of many Ets factors such as Elk/TCF (for reviews, see Refs. 1Treisman R. Curr. Opin.

These factors can be subclassified primarily because of the amino acid conservation in their ETS domains and also because of the conservation of other domains generally characterized as transactivating.

Defossez P.-A. de Launoit Y. Stéhelin D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1397-1406Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that ERM is induced by interleukin-12 through a Stat4-dependent pathway in Th1 and could play a highly specific role by inducing Th1 differentiation in the mouse (21Ouyang W.

The transcription capacities of mouse and zebrafish PEA3, mouse and human ER81/ETV1, and human ERM are increased by components of the MAPK cascades, Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and the MAPK ERK-1 and ERK-2; this suggests that these factors may contribute to the nuclear response to cell stimulation and Ras-induced cell transformation (15Janknecht R.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 93-104Google Scholar) probably through phosphorylation since we have previously demonstrated that ERM can be phosphorylated in vitro by active PKA (15Janknecht R. Monté D. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754Google Scholar). In this study we show that, in contrast to human ERM and ETV1, PKA is not able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of mouse PEA3. In fact, this transcription factor lacks a classical PKA phosphorylation site present at the beginning of the ETS domain of ERM and ETV1; this domain is phosphorylated by PKA, and is necessary for the activation of ERM by the kinase. We further show that the increase in ERM transcriptional activity after PKA phosphorylation is closely correlated with a drastic reduction in the DNA binding of the transcription factor. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of ERM by PKA is involved in ERM-mediated transcription and suggest that the activation of ERM is probably related to conformational changes. Rabbit kidney epithelial-like RK13 cells (ATCC number CCL 37), HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The 3xE74-tk-Luc reporter plasmid and the overexpression vectors for the catalytic subunit of PKA have been described previously (15Janknecht R. Monté D. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR, digested, and subcloned in theEcoRI and BglII sites of the pSV vector, an expression vector which provides an amino-terminal hemagglutinin tag (14Laget M.-P. Defossez P.-A. Albagli O. Baert J.-L. Dewitte F. Stéhelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1325-1336Google Scholar), to produce pSV-ERM, pSV-ETV1, and pSV-PEA3, respectively. The point mutations of ERM were generated by the double PCR method: oligonucleotide 5′-AGAGGCGAGGTNNNCTTCAGCTGT-3′ where NNN corresponded to GCC, GAT, and GAG and its antisense counterpart, generated a specific mutation of Ser367 into alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid, respectively. The final PCR fragments were subcloned as SmaI-BstEII fragments into the SmaI and BstEII sites of pSV-ERM yielding pSV-ERM S367A, pSV-ERM S367D, and pSV-ERM S367E. The ERM mutant containing a deletion of amino acids 226–250 was constructed by the double PCR method using oligonucleotides 5′-CAGAGACAACTGTCTGAACCT-3′ (nucleotides 849–870) and 5′-TTTCAGAGACAACTGTCTGAACCTATTGTC-3′ (nucleotides 922–951); the underlined nucleotides indicate changes in nucleic acid bases to optimize overlapping in the second round of PCR. The PCR fragment was cloned as a BglII-SmaI fragment into the BglII-SmaI sites of the pSV-ERM and pSV-ERM S367A to generate pSV-ERM Δ and pSV-ERM Δ S367A, respectively. The full-length region of ERM wild-type and ERM S367A was also subcloned in the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEFIN3 vector to produce pEFIN-ERM and pEFIN-ERM S367A, respectively. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression vectors pGEX-ERM-(12–510) and pGEX-ERM-(354–510) have been described previously (17Baert J.-L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 590-597Google Scholar). Expression vectors generating truncated ERM gene products (ERM-(1–226), ERM-(1–298), and ERM-(1–363)) were constructed by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-1λT. To generate pGEX-ERM S367A, pGEX-ERM Δ, and pGEX-ERM Δ S367A, the pSV-ERM vectors carrying the corresponding mutations were digested by BglII and BstEII and the resulting fragments were cloned in theBglII and BstEII sites of pGEX-ERM-(12–510). GAL4-ERM fusions were made by cloning parts of the human ERM coding region in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4-(1–147) in pGAP (26Defossez P.-A. Baert J.-L. Monnot M. de Launoit Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4455-4463Google Scholar). The 5xGAL4 Luc plasmid containing five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene has been described earlier (14Laget M.-P. Defossez P.-A. Albagli O. Baert J.-L. Dewitte F. Stéhelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1325-1336Google Scholar). All the mutations and PCR products were verified by dideoxy sequencing. RK13 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected in triplicate using the PEI Exgen 500 procedure (Euromedex, France) with a total of 300 ng of DNA, including 50 ng of reporter plasmid, 50 ng of pSV expression vectors and, when mentioned, 150 ng of PKA expression vector. Luciferase activity was determined 24–48 h after transfection and normalized to transfection efficiency by assaying for β-galactosidase activity expressed from 50 ng of co-transfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase plasmid. Typically, the results are given as a mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. HeLa cells were transfected using the same procedure except that 100 ng of pEFIN3 expression plasmid (Euroscreen, Belgium) was used with a total of 350 ng of DNA. COS-7 cells were transfected using the same procedure with a total of 1 μg of DNA including 150 ng of reporter plasmid, 300 ng of pSV expression vectors and, when mentioned, 150 ng of a pSV-PKA expression vector. The cells were allowed to grow for 40 h before the labeling experiments were performed. Transiently transfected cells were placed into Met/Cys-free or phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. 100 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys per ml or 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate per ml were added to the medium and left for 3 h. At the end of the labeling period the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in an ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfoxyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 25 mm pyrophosphate. The cells debris was centrifuged and the supernatant subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-ERM antibody (15Janknecht R. Monté D. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 17Baert J.-L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 590-597Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. After washing and elution, a second immunoprecipitation step was performed with the anti-hemagglutinin antibody as described previously (17Baert J.-L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 590-597Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were then eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. GST-ERM fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified, essentially as described (17Baert J.-L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 590-597Google Scholar), using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). The concentrations of GST fusion proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis. In vitro transcription-translation reactions were performed using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with 1 μg of DNA template and [35S]methionine. One μl of the reaction products was separated by electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The in vitro phosphorylation by PKA was performed for 1 h at 30 °C using the catalytic subunit of PKA from a bovine heart (Sigma) in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of GST-ERM fusion proteins or the products of in vitro translation reactions. Assays were carried out in the presence of either non-radiolabeled ATP (EMSA) or [γ−32P]ATP. The specific inhibition of the PKA activity was performed by adding 1 μg of the peptide inhibitor PKI (Sigma) to the reaction buffer. The dephosphorylation of in vitro translated ERM with bacterial alkaline phosphatase was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl for 1 h at 30 °C. The effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on DNA binding by ERM protein was tested by first treating the ERM proteins as described above. A portion of the reaction was mixed with 1 ng of the 32P-labeled E74 probe (sense strand: 5′-GAGCTGAATAACCGGAAGTAACTCAT-3′) or the32P-labeled Coll1 probe (sense strand: 5′-CTAATCAAGAGGATGTTATAAAGC-3′) in the presence of 25 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 4 °C in a 0.5 × Tris borate EDTA buffer at 180 V. EMSA were also performed using nuclear extracts made by standard procedures (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Google Scholar). The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was established by supershift assays using a goat polyclonal antibody generated against the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of human ERM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). COS-7 cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and the blots were probed with anti-ERM antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Although human ERM and ETV1 are targeted by the PKA signaling pathway (15Janknecht R. Monté D. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 24Coutte L. Monté D. Imai K. Pouilly L. Dewitte F. Vidaud M. Adamski J. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6278-6286Google Scholar), no information is available concerning the transactivation of mammalian PEA3 through PKA activation. We therefore began by comparing the effect of the PKA pathway on the transactivation capacities of human ERM, human ETV1, and mouse PEA3 in transient transfection experiments. Based on previous experiments showing that the E74 reporter plasmid is not activated by PKA in RK13 cells (15Janknecht R. Monté D. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 24Coutte L. Monté D. Imai K. Pouilly L. Dewitte F. Vidaud M. Adamski J. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6278-6286Google Scholar), we used this system to compare the activation of the PEA3 group members by the kinase. In the absence of a PKA expression vector none of the three proteins was found to stimulate the transactivation of the E74 reporter plasmid (Fig.1). In contrast, the expression of these transcription factors led to a 30–70% transcription repression when compared with the basal level. The co-transfection of a PKA expression vector did not increase the basal transactivation on the E74 reporter. However, as previously reported, the expression of PKA significantly increased transactivation when ETV1 or ERM were coexpressed. Concerning PEA3, the coexpression of PKA only abolished the repression on the reporter since no significant increase in transactivation was observed as compared with the basal level. These data clearly show that of the three mammalian PEA3 group members, only ERM and ETV1 are targeted by the PKA pathway on the E74 reporter. As previously described (15Janknecht R. Monté D. Baert J.-L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754Google Scholar), ERM is phosphorylated in vitro by purified PKA. The examination of the ERM amino acid sequence for phosphorylation consensus sites by known kinases revealed a single consensus PKA phosphorylation site (RRGS367) in a region located at the beginning of the DNA-binding ETS domain. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the region including this site is well conserved among the PEA3 group members of different species. Interestingly, only mouse and human PEA3 contain an alanine substitution at the putative serine phosphoacceptor site (RRGA, Fig.2A). Since PKA is also able to putatively phosphorylate other sites present in the protein (RXXS or RXS (28Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Google Scholar)), we first determined the regions of ERM that are phosphorylated in vitro by this kinase. We thus expressed human ERM (aa 12–510) and mutants lacking portions of the NH2 or COOH termini as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (Fig.3A). Partially purified proteins were then tested for their ability to serve as substrates for purified PKA (Fig. 3B).Figure 3ERM is phosphorylated in vitroby PKA in different regions.A, a schematic representation of the GST fusion proteins used in B andC.

However, the proteins of the 363 and 298 residues obtained by the COOH-terminal truncation of ERM were also efficiently phosphorylated by the kinase, whereas further COOH-terminal truncation of ERM to a protein with 226 residues led to a severe reduction in phosphorylation. Accordingly, when ERM-(199–283) was used as a substrate, there was efficient phosphorylation of the fusion protein, and only the GST moiety was not phosphorylated (data not shown). Thus, by deletion analysis, the PKA phosphorylation domains of ERM were located both at the COOH-terminal region including the consensus PKA phosphorylation site (Ser367), and at a central region between residues 226 and 298. This latter domain contains two contiguous potential sites for PKA phosphorylation (Arg-Pro-Ser242-Tyr-His-Arg-Gln-Met-Ser248), the first being specific to human and mouse ERM and the second shared by ERM and ETV1 (Fig. 2B). To specify the PKA phosphorylation sites, mutations within the mapped regions were generated in the GST-ERM protein, i.e. GST-ERM S367A, in which the serine indicated was mutated into an alanine, GST-ERM Δ, in which the 226–250 region was deleted and GST-ERM Δ S367A, which combined the two mutations. When compared with GST-ERM, a significant decrease in 32P incorporation was observed in the GST-ERM S367A following incubation with PKA (Fig.4A, compare lanes 1and 2). Similarly, the GST-ERM Δ exhibited substantially less total phosphorylation (lane 3). A combination of the two mutations eliminated nearly all the ERM phosphorylation (lane 4). Since a Coomassie Blue stain of the same gel indicated that approximately equal amounts of the four substrates were present in the kinase reaction (Fig. 4B), these data show that the in vitro PKA phosphorylation of ERM is mainly dependent on Ser367 and Ser242 or/and Ser248. To analyze the functional role of phosphoacceptor sites in the activity of ERM protein we assessed whether the mutated proteins were still transcriptionally active in the presence of PKA. In the absence of the PKA expression vector, the co-transfection of RK13 cells with the E74 reporter and plasmids expressing either wild-type ERM or mutant ERMs (ERM S367A, ERM Δ, and ERM Δ S367A) resulted in similar levels of luciferase activity, which were slightly lower than the basal level (Fig.5A). In contrast, when the catalytic subunit of PKA was coexpressed, wild-type ERM gave a 7.4-fold transcription activation in relation to ERM alone, which was very similar to that seen with ERM Δ (7.7-fold activation). However, a significantly lower level of transcription activation was observed when Ser367 was mutated into alanine, i.e. in cells expressing ERM S367A (3.2-fold activation) and ERM Δ S367A (2.3-fold activation). Under the conditions used for the transcriptional assays it was very difficult to determine the expression level of the wild-type and mutant ERM proteins. Nevertheless, an immunoprecipitation analysis of 35S-radiolabeled RK13 cells co-transfected with higher concentrations of the ERM effectors demonstrated that the Ser367 mutation did not affect the relative expression level of the mutated ERM protein compared with the expression level of the wild-type protein in either the absence or presence of coexpressed PKA (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data indicate that whereas mutating Ser367 to alanine results in a protein with a reduced transcriptional enhancement capacity by PKA, the PKA phosphorylation site located in the central part of the protein does not affect ERM in response to the kinase. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays were also performed on co-transfected cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate to investigate in intact cells whether the expression of PKA alters ERM phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5C, the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into immunoprecipitated wild-type ERM or ERM S367A was observed in cells in the absence of PKA. Concerning wild-type ERM this incorporation was, however, increased in cells co-transfected with the PKA catalytic subunit as compared with cells in the absence of active kinase. In contrast, the phosphorylation of ERM S367A was relatively unaffected in the cells expressing the kinase. These results therefore strongly suggest that ERM is the subject of PKA phosphorylation in intact cells and that the activation of ERM transcriptional activity in the presence of PKA is associated with the phosphorylation of Ser367. The PKA-dependent activation of ERM was also tested on another Ets-responsive reporter construct, the human collagenase 1 (Coll1 (20Schneikert J. Peterziel H. Defossez P.-A. Klocker H. de Launoit Y. Cato A.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23907-23913Google Scholar)). Neither wild-type ERM nor ERM S367A was able to activate the promoter in RK13 cells and coexpression of PKA resulted in induction of promoter activity by wild-type ERM (about 10-fold) whereas ERM S367A was less efficient in activating the promoter under these conditions (about 5-fold, Fig. 6). Thus, while Ets proteins are described as weak activators of transcription, ERM was unable to activa"

In addition to their extracellular roles, numerous observations demonstrate the importance of the C-propeptide domain in chaperone-assisted chain association during intracellular assembly of procollagen molecules (21Chessler S.D.

Each procollagen molecule consists of three polypeptide chains encoded by one or more genes, giving rise to homotrimers or heterotrimers, respectively, with specific chain stoichiometries. For example, procollagen III molecules are homotrimers with the chain composition proα1(III)3, whereas procollagen I molecules are normally heterotrimers of the form proα1(I)2proα2(I). The C-propeptides direct association within the rough endoplasmic reticulum to ensure correct chain stoichiometry, which is particularly important in cells producing more than one procollagen type. Once associated into a trimer, and after prolyl hydroxylation, triple helix formation within the collagenous region is initiated at the C terminus and proceeds in a zipper-like manner toward the N terminus (22Mclaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The importance of the C-propeptides in chain association has been demonstrated by both naturally occurring (26Pace J.M. Kuslich C.D. Willing M.C. Byers P.H. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 443-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and engineered (22Mclaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J.

Biochem. 1998; 71: 216-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) mutations/deletions, which result in failure of or impaired procollagen molecular assembly. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that recombinant type I collagen molecules devoid of N- or C-terminal propeptides can assemble in a yeast expression system to form correctly aligned triple-helices (28Olsen D.R. Leigh S.D. Chang R. McMullin H. Ong W. Tai E. Chisholm G. Birk D.E. Berg R.A. Hitzeman R.A. Toman P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24038-24043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), albeit with poor control of chain stoichiometry. Because expression was necessarily carried out at relatively low temperatures, however, the significance of these results for mammalian cells is unclear. Overwhelming evidence indicates that in mammalian cells the C-propeptides are essential for procollagen chain association with the correct stoichiometry. Throughout the fibrillar procollagens, the C-propeptide domain is highly conserved (1Kadler K.E. Sheterline P. Protein Profile. 2. Academic Press, Inc., London1995: 491-619Google Scholar, 29Dion A.S. Myers J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which suggests a common overall three-dimensional structure in the C-propeptide region once the three chains have assembled to form a trimer. Within this conserved framework, a relatively variable and discontinuous sequence of 15 amino acid residues has been identified as being required for type-specific chain selection and trimer formation (30Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-propeptide trimer (composed of three chains each of molecular mass ∼30 kDa) contains both inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds, the former involving cysteine residues in the N-terminal region of each chain and the latter involving cysteines in the C-terminal region (31Koivu J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Beyond this, there exists no three-dimensional structural information for any of the procollagen C-propeptide trimers that might be used to understand the mechanism of chain selection and association. Furthermore, because there are no known homologous proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available, molecular modeling by homology is precluded. Recently, a baculovirus system has been developed for the expression of recombinant human procollagen III C-propeptides in insect cells (32Zafarullah K. Brown E.M. Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this system, disulfide-linked trimers are formed and secreted into the culture medium that appear to have the same secondary structure as native C-propeptide trimers from chick procollagen I. Here we have used a variety of biophysical approaches to study the overall shape of the procollagen III C-propeptide trimer (CPIII)1in solution. We show that the trimer has an elongated shape, which by small angle x-ray scattering appears to be a cruciform structure with three large lobes and one small lobe, consistent with each large lobe corresponding to one of the three constituent chains.

Conditioned medium was then centrifuged at 900 ×g for 15 min followed by the addition of enzyme inhibitors to the supernatant to final concentrations 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm4-aminobenzamidine dihydrochloride, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (all from Sigma). After a second centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant was stored at −80 °C for up to 10 months without significant loss of protein integrity. Three chromatographic steps were used to purify recombinant CPIII. Typically 800 ml of conditioned medium was processed. Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After the addition of 4-aminobenzamidine dihydrochloride (final concentration, 1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 1 mm) and adjustment of the pH to 7.4 using a stock solution of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, medium was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g to pellet any suspended material. Clarified medium was loaded at 75 ml/h onto a 5 × 2.5-cm column of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4). After extensive washing to remove non-bound material, CPIII was eluted at 10 ml/h using buffer A containing 1 m methyl α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma). The eluate was then diluted with 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and loaded onto a 10 × 2.6-cm column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) preequilibrated in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.5). After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a 500 ml of linear gradient of Buffer B containing 50–300 mm NaCl. Fractions of interest were then pooled, 3.4 m (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and the sample was loaded at 10 ml/h and at room temperature on to a 5 × 1.6-cm column of butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m(NH4)2SO4, pH 8.0). After washing, bound proteins were eluted at 10 ml/h and at room temperature using a linear gradient of buffer C containing 1 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4. After analysis by SDS-PAGE, fractions of interest were pooled, concentrated up to 10 mg/ml using an UltraFree 15 device (Millipore, 30-kDa cut off), and stored at −80 °C. CPIII concentrations were measured by absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 1.23 ml mg−1 cm−1, based on the presence of 8 cysteine, 5 tryptophan, and 7 tyrosine residues in the sequence of each polypeptide chain (33Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). This value was confirmed using a commercial protein assay (Pierce) based on the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide for samples reduced with dithiothreitol, 6% acrylamide in non-reducing conditions) was carried out according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using reagents from Bio-Rad. Western blotting and immuno-labeling on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were done according to Towbinet al. (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Their epitopes are as follows: 48D34, amino acids 1–30; 48B14, amino acids 80–207; 48D19, amino acids 207–245 (numbering follows the TrEMBL CPIII sequence, GenBankTM accession number Q15112). Detection was with a commercial anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako) coupled with alkaline phosphatase followed by color development using an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Deglycosylation in native conditions was carried out in 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, using CPIII at a concentration of 1 mg/ml andN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0.1 unit/μg substrate and incubating for 4 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylation of denatured CPIII was done on protein previously heated for 10 min at 100 °C in the presence of 1% SDS then diluted to 0.1% SDS with buffer containing 0.15% Nonidet P-40 and applying the same procedure as used for native conditions. Samples were analyzed in Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) by both static and dynamic light scattering (38Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar) using a Malvern 4700 spectrometer and 7132 256-channel correlator with a 40-mW He-Ne laser (Siemens). Before analysis, solutions were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 × g, then supernatants were transferred to 10-mm-diameter sample cells and examined at 25 °C. Samples were analyzed in the concentration range of 1.8–4.2 mg/ml. For static light scattering, samples were analyzed in the angular range 30–130°, and the molecular mass of CPIII was calculated using a Zimm plot (38Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar). Rayleigh ratios were determined with reference to a toluene standard, and a value of 0.182 ml/g was assumed for the refractive index increment. For dynamic light scattering, samples were analyzed at 90°, and correlation curves were analyzed using the Contin program provided by the manufacturers. Diffusion coefficients (experimentally observed D or correctedD20,w) were related to the frictional factor f and hydrodynamic diameter Dh by the relation D = RT/Nf =RT/3πηDh, where R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, N is Avogradro's number, and η the solvent viscosity. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60 TI rotor (Beckman Instruments). The experiments were carried out at 25 °C in Buffer D. Three samples of 400 μl at protein concentrations of 0.24, 0.44, and 0.81 mg/ml were loaded into 1.2-cm path cells and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm. Scans were recorded at 278 nm every 5 min using a 0.003-cm radial spacing. Sedimentation profiles were analyzed by different methods using time derivative analysis or direct modeling of boundary profiles in terms of one non-interacting component (dcdt+ and Svedberg from J.

These procedures allow the evaluation of both sedimentation (s) and diffusion (D) coefficients, from which the molar mass is derived using the Svedberg equation: M = sRT/D(1 − ρV̄).

B. Haynes, T. Laue, and J. Philo) for the calculation of the corrected S20w and D20,wvalues. For SAXS, CPIII samples in buffer D were analyzed at 20 °C on beamline ID2 (42Narayanan T. Diat O. Bösecke P. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 2001; 467–468: 1005-1009Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble. Samples (25 μl) in the concentration range 4–10 mg/ml were placed in a quartz capillary (GLAS, 2-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness) mounted in a thermostatted flow-through cell. Scattering was measured using a two-dimensional detector, either an x-ray Image Intensifier FReLoN CCD camera (at 2.5 m from the sample) or a multiwire proportional gas-filled detector (at 1 m) using x-rays of wavelength λ = 0.995 Å. Data were averaged from individual exposures of 500 ms (CCD detector, 1024 × 1024 pixels) or 600 s (gas-filled detector, 512 × 512 pixels). Two-dimensional data reduction consisted of normalization for detector response, exposure time and sample transmission, absolute intensity calibration, azimuthal integration, and background subtraction from buffer alone to obtain the normalized scattered intensity I as a function of Q ors, where Q = 2πs = 4πsin(θ)/λ, and 2θ is the scattering angle. Data from the CCD detector in the Q range 0.01–0.15 Å−1 were merged with data from the gas detector in the Q range 0.15–0.3 Å−1. No concentration dependence in the scattering curves was observed at the concentrations used. SAXS data were analyzed using Guinier plots (43Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays.

Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar) was used to determine the distance distribution functionp(r) after eliminating data for Q< 0.0272 Å−1 to suppress subsidiary maxima at large distances (45Chacon P. Diaz J.F. Moran F. Andreu J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For modeling of the structure, three programs were used: SASHA (46Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), DAMMIN (47Svergun D.I. Biophys.

J. 1998; 74: 2760-2775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Model building using spherical harmonics (SASHA) was carried out up to a maximum harmonic order of 4, corresponding to 19 independent parameters for 11.9 Shannon channels. The dummy atom-simulated annealing program DAMMIN automatically subtracted a small constant from each data point to force the Q−4 decay of the intensity at higher angles (49Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., London1982Google Scholar). Subtraction of the same constant before modeling using SASHA had no effect on the final structure. Modeling using the genetic algorithm DALAI_GA was carried out using an initial conformational space in the form of a sphere or a prolate ellipsoid with maximum dimensions at least 30 Å greater than that given by GNOM using cycles with progressively smaller dummy atoms starting at a radius of 10 Å decreasing to 5 Å in steps of 1 Å. A small constant determined by DAMMIN was also subtracted from the data before modeling with DALAI_GA to suppress internal cavities in the structure (45Chacon P. Diaz J.F. Moran F. Andreu J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Model structures were visualized using the program ASSA (50Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Crossref Google Scholar). Optimal production of recombinant CPIII was found when insect cells were infected with baculovirus for 45 h with a multiplicity of infection (expressed as number of viral particles per cell) = 3. As previously reported (32Zafarullah K. Brown E.M. Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the presence in the medium of the ∼90-kDa disulfide-linked C-propeptide trimer was confirmed by SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions (not shown). In reducing conditions, two bands (I and II) were systematically observed with apparent molecular masses of 34 and 32 kDa, respectively. Both bands were identified by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody 48B14, specific for the central region of the human procollagen III C-propeptide (not shown). The relative intensities of these bands varied as a function of multiplicity of infection with the upper band (band I), predominating at a multiplicity of infection = 3. In these conditions CPIII production, representing 30% of total protein in the medium, was about 20 mg/liter. Recombinant CPIII was purified using a three-step procedure (Fig.1). As previously reported (32Zafarullah K. Brown E.M. Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), initial purification was by concanavalin-A affinity chromatography. Subsequent cation exchange chromatography at low pH led to considerable losses due to proteolysis; hence, this step was replaced by DEAE anion-exchange at pH 8.5. A final purification step by hydrophobic interaction on butyl-Sepharose resulted in essentially pure CPIII that was enriched in band I in the early part of the elution gradient (see Fig. 1). The total yield of purified CPIII from 1 liter of conditioned medium was 6.4 mg. To determine the nature of bands I and II seen by SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions, purified CPIII was probed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for the N-terminal 30 residues (antibody 48D34) and C-terminal 39 residues (antibody 48D19) of human CPIII (37Burchardt E.R. Heke M. Kauschke S.G. Harjes P. Kohlmeyer J. Kroll W. Schauer M. Schroeder W. Voelker M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Both bands I and II were recognized by both antibodies (not shown), indicating that the difference in apparent molecular mass was not due to partial proteolytic degradation. A further possibility was differences in post-translational modifications, in particular,N-linked glycosylation. The observed molecular mass difference (∼2 kDa) corresponds to the presence of a single high mannose glycan Man9GlcNAc2, as commonly found in glycoproteins produced in insect cells (41Jarvis D.L. Kawar Z.S. Hollister J.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a single asparagine linked N-glycosylation site in each of the three identical chains of CPIII. Recombinant CPIII, both native and denatured, was thus subjected to treatment by N-glycosidase F, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2,N-glycosidase F treatment of native CPIII led to the appearance of four bands migrating in the region of 100 kDa by SDS-PAGE in non-reducing conditions as well as a relative increase in the intensity of band II in reducing conditions. When exposed toN-glycosidase F after denaturation of CPIII, deglycosylation was complete, resulting in a single fast migrating band in non-reducing conditions and the total disappearance of band I in reducing conditions. We conclude that the four bands observed in non-reducing conditions correspond to CPIII trimers glycosylated at a single site on 0, 1, 2, or 3 chains. Thus, the recombinant CPIII used in these experiments consists of a mixture of mostly fully glycosylated (i.e. on all three chains) and partially glycosylated (i.e. on two of three chains) trimers. Analysis of CPIII by static light scattering (not shown) revealed no significant angular dependence in scattering intensity, indicating the absence of large aggregates in the concentration range studied (2–4 mg/ml). Extrapolation to zero concentration and zero angle using a Zimm plot gave a molecular mass of 103 ± 8 kDa, consistent with the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence of 88 kDa (TableI). We conclude that CPIII behaves as a freely soluble trimer (composed of three polypeptide chains) in solution.Table IHydrodynamic and scattering data for CPIIIMethodMolecular massStructural parametersD20,w (×107, cm2s−1) s20,w(×1013, s−1) Rg (Å)Diameter of equivalent spherekDaÅCalculated1-aAssuming one high mannose glycan Man9GlcNAc2 per chain (41).88.158.61-bUnhydrated.65.81-cAssuming hydration of 0.3 g of water/g of protein.Static light scattering103 ± 8Dynamic light scattering901-dMass calculated usings20,w from analytical ultracentrifugation. ± 6D20,w 4.8 ± 0.389 ± 6Analytical ultracentrifugation81 ± 6s20,w 5.0 ± 0.0580 ± 6D20,w 5.4 ± 0.4Small angle x-ray scattering100 ± 10Rg 33.4 ± 0.386.2 ± 0.41-a Assuming one high mannose glycan Man9GlcNAc2 per chain (41Jarvis D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2160641097,"The C57BL/6ByJ (B6By) mouse strain is resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, despite its near genetic identity with the atherosclerosis-susceptible C57BL/6J (B6J) strain. We previously identified a genetic locus,Diet1, which is responsible for the resistant phenotype in B6By mice. To investigate the function of Diet1, we compared mRNA expression profiles in the liver of B6By and B6J mice fed an atherogenic diet using a DNA microarray. These studies revealed elevated expression levels in B6By liver for key bile acid synthesis proteins, including cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and sterol-27-hydroxylase, and the oxysterol nuclear receptor liver X receptor α. Expression levels for several other genes involved in bile acid metabolism were subsequently found to differ between B6By and B6J mice, including the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, sterol-12α-hydroxylase, and hepatic bile acid transporters on both sinusoidal and canalicular membranes. The overall expression profile of the B6By strain suggests a higher rate of bile acid synthesis and transport in these mice. Consistent with this interpretation, fecal bile acid excretion is increased 2-fold in B6By mice, and bile acid levels in blood and urine are elevated 3- and 18-fold, respectively. Genetic analysis of serum bile acid levels revealed co-segregation with Diet1, indicating that this locus is likely responsible for both increased bile acid excretion and resistance to hypercholesterolemia in B6By mice.

Variations in human plasma cholesterol levels result from both genetic and environmental factors. Although behavioral changes such as lower dietary intake of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids or exercise may alleviate many environmental causes of hypercholesterolemia, genetic factors still account for over 50% of the variation in plasma lipid levels in the human population (1Austin M.A. King M.C.

Identifying the genetic components involved in the determination of plasma lipid levels is relevant in understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in complex human diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity, gall stone formation, and stroke. Because of the relative ease of environmental manipulation and abundance of genetic information, inbred mouse strains provide a useful tool to study these genetic factors. We previously identified a locus on mouse chromosome 2,Diet1, which is associated with variation in cholesterol levels and susceptibility to atherosclerosis in closely related mouse strains (5Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. X. W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different alleles at the Diet1 locus that occur in two C57BL/6 mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6J)1 and C57BL/6ByJ (B6By), confer strikingly different responses to an atherogenic (Ath) diet. B6J mice fed an Ath diet develop plasma cholesterol levels of ∼200 mg/dl and aortic lesions that are among the largest found in standard inbred mouse strains (6Paigen B. Ishida B.Y. Verstuyft J. Winters R.B. Albee D. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 316-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, B6By mice are largely resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and aortic lesions. This is associated with lower LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels on the Ath diet, which reach only 40 mg/dl in B6By mice compared with 120 mg/dl in B6J mice (5Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. X. W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in cholesterol response between B6J and B6By mice is particularly striking given the near genetic identity between the two strains; B6J and B6By were isolated as separate breeding stocks of C57BL/6 in the 1960s, ∼100 generations ago (7Fox R.R. Witham B.A. Handbook on Genetically Standardized JAX® Mice. 5th Ed. The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME1997Google Scholar). In fact, in screening 100 microsatellite markers spanning the genome and 20 markers concentrated within the Diet1 locus, no polymorphism has been detected between B6By and B6J mice (5Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. X. W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Phan and K. Reue, unpublished data. Thus, variation at theDiet1 locus in the two strains appears to have resulted fromde novo mutation rather than genetic contamination from another mouse strain. Scrutiny of known genes mapping to theDiet1 locus, and to the homologous region in the human genome, has revealed no obvious candidate genes, suggesting thatDiet1 may represent a novel gene(s) involved in lipid metabolism. Many metabolic pathways influence plasma cholesterol homeostasis, including cholesterol biosynthesis, dietary absorption, uptake by liver and peripheral cells, and clearance from the liver through bile acid metabolism (8Hofmann A.F. Arch. Intern. Med. 1999; 159: 2647-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 9Repa J. Mangelsdorf D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

We previously determined that food consumption and cholesterol absorption are similar in B6J and B6By mice, suggesting that differences in these factors are not responsible for the lower plasma cholesterol levels in B6By animals (5Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. X. W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we have sought to gain insight into the genetic variation between B6By and B6J mice by examining the expression of more than 18,000 genes. We detected elevated expression of genes for several proteins involved in bile acid synthesis, including cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (C7AH) and sterol-27-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzymes in the classic and alternative bile acid synthetic pathways (13Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Russell D.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and LXRα, which regulates gene expression in response to oxysterols (14Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). B6By mice also exhibited altered expression levels for additional bile acid synthetic enzymes, bile acid transporters from both the sinusoidal and canalicular membranes, and the bile acid-responsive nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). These results suggest that more efficient conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and increased bile secretion may contribute to the lower plasma cholesterol levels in B6By mice. In support of this interpretation, B6By mice exhibited increased fecal bile acid excretion and elevated bile acid levels in plasma and urine. Using a genetic cross, we determined that elevated bile acid levels segregate with Diet1, indicating that this locus determines both the resistance to hypercholesterolemia and increased bile acid excretion in B6By mice. C57BL/6J, C57BL/6ByJ, and CAST/EiJ mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were maintained in a 14-h/10-h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum Purina Mouse Chow 5001 (chow) or an atherogenic diet containing 75% chow, 7.5% cocoa butter, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate (TD90221, Teklad Research Diets, Madison, WI). All animals received humane care under an institutionally approved experimental animal protocol as outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mouse Gene Discovery Array I filters containing 18,378 mouse cDNA clones chosen from the I.M.A.G.E. collection were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). These arrays contain each mouse cDNA in a double-spotted pattern, as well as 30 double-spotted hybridization controls and 24 double-spotted orientation markers. Hybridization probes were prepared from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from liver of male mice fed the Ath diet for 3 weeks (Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system; Promega, Madison, WI). An equal amount of RNA from three mice of each strain was pooled to reduce spurious results because of individual variation. RNA (2 μg) was labeled with [32P]dATP to a specific activity of 7 × 106 cpm/μg by incubation with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passing through Sephadex G-50 spin columns (Bio-Rad). Labeled probes (106 cpm/ml) were combined with 1.5 mg of sheared salmon testes DNA (Sigma) and 5 μg of Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), and a labeled orientation marker (RNA corresponding toArabidopsis and Drosophila internal control clones spotted on the filters; Genome Systems). DNA was denatured at 95 °C and incubated with filters in roller bottles at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for 16 h. Hybridization of duplicate filters was performed with probes prepared from B6J and B6By RNA samples. After hybridization, filters were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and twice in 0.6× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and placed on phosphorimaging screens overnight. Images were visualized on a PhosphorImager 451 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the resulting GEL files were analyzed with Genome Discovery software (Genome Systems). Hybridization signals were corrected for background and normalized to 30 double-spotted controls present on each filter. Intensities of each signal and ratios between the signals on the B6By and B6J filters were calculated. We quantitated absolute levels of C7AH mRNA using a competitive RT-PCR assay (15Riedy M.C. Timm Jr., E.A. Stewart C.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar). We first generated a C7AH competitor RNA standard identical to nucleotides (nt) 969-1620 of endogenous C7AH mRNA (GenBank™ accession no. L23754) except for an internal deletion of 62 bp (nt 1540–1601). The C7AH competitor RNA was generated by RT-PCR of mouse liver cDNA with primers 1 and 2 (below) followed by in vitro transcription using Sp6 polymerase (Promega). Primer 1 contains sequence derived from exon 1 of the mouse C7AH gene preceded by an Sp6 RNA polymerase binding site (primer 1, 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAACACAAACTCCCTGTCATACCAC-3′, nt Sp6/969–990). Primer 2 is a reverse primer based on two noncontiguous C7AH exon2 sequences (primer 2, 5′-CCAGAAGGTTGCAGGAATGGAGGTGGAGAGTGTGTCGTTG-3′, nt 1620–1601/1540–1521). The resulting 591-bp reference standard RNA was quantitated in a fluorometer for use in the competitive RT-PCR assay (see below). To quantitate C7AH mRNA in mouse liver samples, 10 μg of liver RNA was reverse transcribed in the same reaction tube with one of five serial dilutions of the competitor RNA using the cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen). Primer 3 (5′-CCAGAAGGTGGCAGGAATGG-3′, nt 1620–1601), an oligonucleotide with sequence identical to the 5′ half of primer 2, was used to efficiently prime reverse transcription of both competitor and sample RNAs. Subsequent PCR amplification was performed with this primer coupled with a forward primer identical to primer 1, but lacking the Sp6 site (5′-CACAAACTCCCTGTCATACCAC-3′, nt 969–990). PCR was performed using a “touchdown” thermocycling program (16Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 194008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar), with cycle number titrated to fall within the linear range of the amplification reaction. PCR products were analyzed on 3% Metaphor agarose gels (FMC, Rockland, ME), and the amount of product estimated by determining intensity of the corresponding bands using RFLPscan (Scanalytics, San Diego). Concentration curves were generated by plotting the ratio of sample to competitor RT-PCR productsversus concentration of competitor RNA in the reaction. The amount of C7AH mRNA in the sample was defined as the point on the concentration curve where the ratio of sample to competitor RT-PCR product was equal to 1. Northern blot analysis was performed using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from liver of B6J and B6By mice as described (17Cohen R.D. Castellani L.W. Qiao J.-H. Van Lenten B.J. Lusis A.J. Reue K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Probes used for hybridizations were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium collection (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) or prepared by RT-PCR using mouse liver cDNA as template. All probes were verified by sequencing. Mouse cDNA clones obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium, with identification number, were as follows: Cyp7a1, 679505; Cyp27, 680217; LXRα, 679617; FXR, 679617; NTCP, 547429; OATP-1, 1923988; BSEP, 1924363; mdr2, 818518; mEH, 1482690; 3αHSD, 1886084. Primers used to prepare probes by RT-PCR were: Cyp8b-f, GACGCTGTGGTGTACAGTGCTAG; Cyp8b-r, GAACAGCTCATCGGCCTCATCC; SHP-f, TGGATGTCCTAGCCAAGACAG; SHP-r, GCATGTCTTCAAGGAGTTCAG; LRH-f, GACAAGCTGCAATCTTTCTCAC; and LRH-r, CTCTTCTCCTTCCAGTCTGTG. Blood was obtained after a 16-h fast by retroorbital bleeding under isoflurane anesthesia. Enzymatic assays for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, unesterified cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acids were performed using a Biomek 2000 automated laboratory workstation (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) (18Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (LDL + VLDL) cholesterol levels were determined as the difference between total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Bile acids were quantitated using an enzymatic assay (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO) using 50 μl of plasma or 25 μl of urine. Fecal bile acid determinations were made after extraction of bile acids using a radiolabeled internal standard to monitor recovery (19Bianchini F. Caderni G. Dolara P. Fantetti L. Kriebel D. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We crossed male C57BL/ByJ and female CAST/EiJ mice to produce F1 animals, which were subsequently crossed to C57BL/6ByJ mice. At 2 months of age, mice were fed the Ath diet for 3 weeks.

Our previous work established that resistance of B6By mice to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis is not a result of reduced food consumption or reduced cholesterol absorption compared with B6J mice (5Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. X. W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify differences in gene expression that may reflect metabolic differences between the two strains, we performed gene expression profiling using a DNA array. Hepatic mRNA isolated from B6J and B6By mice fed the Ath diet for 3 weeks was hybridized to arrays containing more than 18,000 mouse cDNA sequences, approximately one-third of which represent known genes and the remainder derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Of the 18,000 genes represented on the array, only 35 (0.19%) differed in expression levels by more than 10-fold between B6J and B6By mice; 80% of the genes in this category were expressed at higher levels in B6J than in B6By. 622 mRNA species (3.5%) exhibited expression levels that differed more than 3-fold between the two strains, with 1.2% having higher expression in B6By and 2.3% having higher expression in B6J. Based on fold differences in expression levels, we chose the 100 mRNAs having higher expression levels in B6J and the 100 having higher expression levels in B6By for further analysis. Comparison to data base sequences revealed that 29 of the 200 correspond to known mouse genes, 65 are ESTs that appear to be homologues of genes identified in other species, and 106 are ESTs of unknown function. Among the known mouse genes, we recognized three with prominent roles in bile acid synthesis, Cyp7a1, Cyp27, andLXRa. Cyp7a1 encodes C7AH, and Cyp27encodes sterol-27-hydroxylase, enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting steps in conversion of cholesterol to bile acids via the classic and alternative pathways, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 20Vlahcevic Z.R.

To confirm the results of the DNA array experiment and to obtain absolute quantitation of C7AH mRNA levels, we performed competitive RT-PCR (15Riedy M.C. Timm Jr., E.A. Stewart C.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the array data, the C7AH mRNA levels were 3-fold higher in B6By than B6J mice fed the Ath diet (218 versus 61 pm, Fig.1). Furthermore, B6By mRNA levels were higher in mice fed a chow diet (615 versus 227 pm), indicating that the difference between the strains is evident even under basal conditions and is not diet-dependent. In agreement with previous findings, the Ath diet repressed C7AH mRNA levels by 70–80% in both strains (13Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Russell D.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

The expression difference between the two strains for sterol-27-hydroxylase (S27H) and LXRα mRNAs seen on the array were confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.2). As with C7AH, mRNA levels for these genes were higher in B6By mice on both chow and Ath diets, with differences of 1.5–2.5-fold.Figure 2Differential expression of bile acid synthesis and transport genes in B6By and B6J liver. Hepatic mRNA levels for proteins involved in bile acid metabolism were determined by RT-PCR (C7AH) or Northern blot (all other mRNA species). Values shown represent the average of RT-PCR performed on five samples of each strain and diet or Northern blot hybridizations performed on samples pooled from five mice. Northern blots contained 2 μg of poly(A) RNA/lane, and signals were quantitated by integration on a PhosphorImager. For each mRNA species, the levels detected in B6J mice fed the chow diet were set to 1, and values for other samples expressed relative to that value.

Oxysterol-7α-hydroxylase (O7AH) is the mitochondrial counterpart to C7AH and functions to catalyze the C-7 hydroxylation of 27-hydroxylated bile acids (25Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We observed elevated expression of O7AH in B6By, with 70% higher levels on the chow diet, and 50% higher levels on the Ath diet (Fig. 2). We also examined mRNA levels for sterol-12α-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the C-12 hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic acid to form cholic acid (8Hofmann A.F. Arch. Intern. Med. 1999; 159: 2647-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). mRNA levels for this enzyme were slightly higher in B6By mice on a chow diet, but slightly lower in B6By on the Ath diet (Fig. 2). Thus, the genes for four enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis had a higher basal expression level in chow-fed B6By compared with B6J mice. Although the Ath diet repressed expression in both strains, mRNA levels remained higher in B6By liver for three of the enzymes, C7AH, C27H, and O7AH. As described above, we observed a modest increase in mRNA levels for the nuclear receptor LXRα in the liver of B6By mice. We subsequently examined expression levels for three additional nuclear receptors that, together with LXRα, serve as sensors for the regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in the cell: the FXR, small heterodimer partner (SHP), and LRH-1 (27Lu T.T. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37735-37738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). FXR acts as a bile acid receptor, maintaining homeostasis in response to increased bile acid levels by repressing genes involved in bile acid synthesis. In contrast to LXRα, FXR mRNA levels were reduced ∼50% in B6By compared with B6J on both chow and Ath diets (Fig. 2). SHP, which is a key target gene of FXR, showed 6-fold lower mRNA levels in liver of B6By mice on the chow diet, but levels increased o"

Given that the activation of EGFr by exogenous growth factor has no further effect on DNA synthesis, the question arises as to what function this additional EGFr activation might have. We report that EGF induces integrin α2 expression, integrin-mediated adhesion, and micromotility of HCT116 cells. The stimulatory effect of ligand on these biological functions is abrogated by treatment with AG1478- and EGFr-blocking monoclonal antibody. This provides evidence that the biological responses are EGFr-mediated and EGFr is located upstream of integrin α2 expression. Therefore, although exogenous EGF has no effect on DNA synthesis beyond that induced by autocrine TGF-α (at subsaturating levels of EGFr occupation) exogenous growth factor does induce integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and micromotion. An important finding revealed by this study is the documentation of biological responses of EGFr-mediated functions, including DNA synthesis, cell adhesion, and micromotion, which differ in sensitivity with respect to different degrees of EGFr activation at the basal state and in response to exogenous ligand.

The HCT116 cell line is representative of growth factor-independent carcinoma cell lines (2Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol.

Constitutive expression of a full-length TGF-α1antisense cDNA has shown that the basis for the growth factor independence of these cells is the constitutive expression of TGF-α and, consequently, a low level constitutive activation of EGFr even when the cells are growth-arrested in G0 (6Jiang D. Liang J. Humphrey L.E. Yang H. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Howell G.M. Ziober B.L. Humphrey L.E. Willson J.K.V. Sun L.-Z. Lynch M.

We hypothesize that the relatively low level of EGFr activation resulting from autocrine TGF-α may be sufficient to fulfill one or more highly sensitive responses to EGFr signal transduction but would require augmentation by exogenously activated EGFr to optimally enable less sensitive functions. In HCT116 cells DNA synthesis from the G0 state is fully activated by autocrine TGF-α such that exogenous EGF (or other growth factors) has no effect on this EGFr function despite the availability of unoccupied EGFr and signal transduction intermediates such as ERK (2Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Howell G.M. Ziober B.L. Humphrey L.E. Willson J.K.V. Sun L.-Z. Lynch M. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the objective of this work was to identify whether there are any important functions mediated by the unoccupied EGFr in response to exogenous EGF and to determine whether this function is shared in part by autocrine TGF-α as well. We report that EGFr activation by exogenous ligand results in increased integrin expression, cell adhesion, and cell micromotion with less sensitivity than that exhibited by the optimal mitogenic function stimulated through relatively low level receptor occupation generated by autocrine TGF-α activity. In contrast, low level receptor occupation of EGFr by autocrine TGF-α resulted in a relatively low level of basal integrin expression and biological function relative to that obtained with high levels of receptor occupation generated by exogenous EGF or TGF-α. Growth factors are important effectors of cell adhesion, cell motility, and integrin expression, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear (8Chen J.D. Kim J.P. Zhang K. Sarret Y. Wynn K.C.

It has been demonstrated that EGF can induce β1 integrin mRNA expression in quiescent mouse 3T3 cells (11Bellas R.E. Bendori R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12008-12014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not determined whether EGF-induced changes in β1 subunit mRNA expression led to changes in cell surface protein levels as well as functional alterations in cell adhesion. Fujii et al. (12Fujii K. Dousaka-Nakajima N. Imamura S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that EGF induced HSC-1 human cutaneous squamous carcinoma cell interaction with type I collagen by up-regulation of integrin α2β1but not by α3β1, α5β1, or αvβ3expression. Recently, Moro et al. (13Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) showed that, in normal human skin fibroblasts and FCV 304 endothelial cells, integrin-dependent EGFr activation was associated with cell survival and proliferation in response to ECM. These reports suggested that EGFr activation of integrin expression might represent an additional function to that of mitogenesis by EGFr signaling in HCT116 cells. EGFr-mediated control of integrin expression is important, because integrins and their ligands have significant roles in tumor cell biology (14Pasqualini R. Bourdoulous S. Koivunen E. Woods V.L. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). For example, transformation of epithelial cells to the malignant state is often accompanied by quantitative changes in integrin expression, which in turn may control cell proliferation and cell metastasis (16Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 17Wang D.H. Zhou G.-H. Birkenmeier T.M. Gong J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14154-14159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, alteration of integrin expression can in turn lead to cross-talk with growth factor signaling by the insulin and the transforming growth factor β system (18Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 19Wang D.-H. Sun L.-Z. Zborowska E. Willson J.K.V. Gong J. Verraraghavan J. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

We report that exogenous EGF up-regulates cell surface integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and cell micromotion on ECM protein irrespective of its inability to induce DNA synthesis above that of the basal EGFr activation in these cells induced by autocrine TGF-α. However, autocrine TGF-α is also responsible for basal levels of integrin α2, because disruption of autocrine TGF-α signaling by EGFr antibodies or chemical inhibitors of EGFr activation inhibits basal cell adhesion, cell locomotion, and integrin α2 expression. This indicates differences in sensitivity of EGFr responses in which the signal transduction pathway leading to DNA synthesis is fully saturated by a relatively low level of EGFr activation whereas the signal transduction pathway leading to integrin expression is not saturated by a low level of EGFr activation, instead showing increased response with increasing receptor saturation. Collagen type IV (CN IV) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). A polyclonal antibody specific for integrin α2 subunit (Ab1936) was procured from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA), and monoclonal antibodies PIE6 (α2), PIB5 (α3), and PID6 (α5) were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). EGFr monoclonal blocking antibodies, mAb528 and mAb225, were obtained from Oncogene Science (Manhesset, NY), and tyrphostin AG1478 was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-EGFr (activated) and anti-actin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. McCoy's 5A medium, transferrin, and insulin were obtained from Sigma, whereas EGF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Arrays of gold-film-coated electrodes for cell motility experiments were purchased from Applied Biophysics Inc, New York. HCT116 cells and TGF-α antisense mRNA-expressing HCT116 clones 33 were previously established in tissue culture and extensively characterized (5Howell G.M. Humphrey L.E. Ziober B.L. Awwad R.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in chemically defined serum-free medium consisting of McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml transferrin (T) and 20 μg/ml insulin (I) either in the absence or presence of EGF (E) (10 ng/ml) depending upon experimental design. For adhesion assays, 96-well tissue culture clusters were coated with CN IV by allowing 0–2.5 μg/ml collagen in 0.25 m acetic acid to bind to culture plates at room temperature overnight, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) procedure was followed as described previously (20Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gong J. Wang D.-H. Sun L.-Z. Zborowska E. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth Diff. 1997; 8: 83-90PubMed Google Scholar). For the inhibition of adhesion by specific antibodies, 96-well tissue culture clusters were coated with CN IV as described above. Mouse ascites anti-integrin α2, α3, and α5 subunit monoclonal antibodies were added to the plates as 1:50 to 1:500 dilutions, and cells were incubated in the presence or absence of antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. Similarly, EGFr antibody was used to determine the effects of blocking autocrine TGF-α on cell adhesion. After trypsinization, cells were incubated at 37 °C with AG1478 for 3 h as an additional approach to determine autocrine TGF-α-mediated cell adhesion functions. Subsequently, adhesion assays were performed as given above. The iodination of cell surface proteins was carried out using suspended cells. Cells at 80% confluency were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended by scraping in Tris buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), centrifuged, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cell surface iodination was carried out by addition of 1 mCi/ml Na 125I (Dupont, 17 Ci/mg), 0.2 mg/ml lactoperoxidase (Sigma), and 0.001% H2O2 (Sigma) for 10 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation, and cells were washed four times in the same buffer. The cell pellet was solubilized by vortexing in an ice-cold buffer consisting of 125 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mmn-octal-β-d-glycopyranoside (Sigma) for 30 min. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad assay, and radioactive incorporation was calculated. Equal amounts of supernatant protein were treated with Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) and BSA (0.5 mg/ml), precleared by incubation with 50 μl of packed protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science, Manhesset, NY) for 2 h, and centrifuged. Precleared supernatants containing equal amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against integrin α2 at 1:50 dilution for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation, followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at 1:20 dilution for 2 h at 4 °C. The use of equal amounts of protein from each sample ensured that changes in integrin expression were selective rather than a reflection of overall changes in protein synthesis. Immune complexes were precipitated by protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, washed four times with 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, and 1 mg/ml BSA and once with 150 mm NaCl and 25 mmTris, at pH 7.4. Laemmli buffer was added, samples were heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining, destaining, gel drying, and autoradiography. Subconfluent cultures of cells were treated with Joklik's EDTA for 8 min at room temperature, and, subsequently, cells were scraped into a tube and kept on ice. The culture dish was rinsed with cold PBS, and cells were pooled with the Joklik's EDTA fraction. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge for 1–2 min at 800 ×g. The pellet was washed twice with cold PBS, and cells were biotinylated in suspension with NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), 0.1 mg/ml in Me2SO at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1% Nonidet P-40) by shearing them through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuging at 16,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was analyzed for protein content by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein from treated and untreated (control) cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Invitrogen) for 90 min at 4 °C. Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and subsequently washed five times with lysis buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The beads were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and the supernatant was filtered through Bio-Rad columns (22Sawhney R.S. Hering T.M. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9231-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and applied in 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond) by electroblotting using a mini-Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. The membrane was blocked for at least 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Triton Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antibody. After washing the membrane with TTBS, it was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit or mouse secondary antibody. The membrane was washed, and detection of specific binding was achieved by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Total cellular RNA was isolated by lysing cells with guanidine isothiocyanate-EDTA and fractionating the resulting extract through a cesium trifluoroacetic acid gradient (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. Mackondla R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts (40 μg) of RNA samples were used in RNase protection assays. The α2 subunit template was constructed by subcloning a 292-bp EcoRV-HincII fragment of the human α2 subunit cDNA into plasmid PBSK(−). A high specific activity α2 subunit riboprobe was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase, whereas actin an antisense probe was prepared by Sρ6-RNA polymerase in presence of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). High specific activity α3, α5, and β1 subunit riboprobes were synthesized by T3 polymerase in presence of [32P]UTP. Normalization of sample loading was assessed as previously described (4Howell G.M. Humphrey L.E. Awwad R.A. Wang D. Koterba A. Periyasamy B. Yang J. Li W. Willson J.K.V. Ziober B.L. Coleman K. Carboni J. Lynch M. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9214-9223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and quantitation of protected fragments was achieved by densitometry (Alpha Imager 2000). Cell motility was quantitated by the micromotion detection method using the ECIS technique (24Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 25Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 26Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on small gold electrodes (area 5 × 10−4cm2) etched by photolithographic procedures on the bottom of tissue culture wells (area 0.5 cm2) (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY). A 1-μA, 4000-Hz AC signal from a constant current source was applied between the small electrode and a much larger counter electrode, while the culture medium acted as an electrolyte. This signal was not large enough to disturb the cells or to change cell behavior (27Mitra P. Keese C.R. Giaever I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 504-510PubMed Google Scholar). The voltage of the system was monitored by a lock-in amplifier (Model SR 830, Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA) interfaced with a computer that controlled amplifier settings as well as stored the data collected by the amplifier. The in-phase and out-of-phase voltage across the electrode were recorded by the lock-in amplifier once every second for measuring micromotion and once every 2 min for measuring cell attachment. The ECIS software (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY) calculated the resistance and capacitance values of the electrode over this period of time. Attachment and movement of the cells on the electrode changed the flow of the current, resulting in fluctuations in the electrode resistance and capacitance. These cellular movements were called micromotion (25Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and were a measure of the motile ability of the cell being measured. As the cells moved on the electrode, the sensitive nature of the lock-in amplifier detected the fluctuations in the resistance and capacitance values (24Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These fluctuations were then statistically analyzed using the ECIS software to reveal the percentage variation in resistance, which in turn was a reflection of cellular micromotion on the electrode (25Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). A multipoint binding assay was performed on HCT116 cells grown in serum-free medium lacking EGF to measure the number of cell surface EGFrs in the basal state without exogenous growth factor. Using a computer Scatchard analysis program (EBDA/LIGAND), it was determined that HCT116 cells have ∼6.8 × 104 EGF cell surface receptors with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼10 nm, and the Bmax was 110 fmol/106 cells. There is only one class of receptors based on Scatchard analysis. HCT116 cells have been extensively characterized in previous studies. This work has shown that exogenous EGF (as well as other growth factors) does not influence proliferation or induction of DNA synthesis in the HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line due to autocrine activation of EGFr by TGF-α (2Mulder K.M.

Despite saturation of mitogenesis by autocrine TGF-α, additional EGFr activation and downstream signaling is observed upon addition of exogenous EGFr ligands. This raised the question as to the function of this response to exogenous EGFr ligand. We hypothesized that EGFr activation resulted in the modulation of α integrin expression. The maintenance of cells in serum-free chemically defined medium allowed us to determine the effects of the long term (∼5 days) presence or absence of EGF on cellular adhesion to tissue culture plates coated with basement membrane type IV collagen (0–2.5 μg/ml). HCT116 cells showed a 2-fold higher level of adhesion to this extracellular matrix (ECM) protein than on BSA coating in the absence of EGF. Maintenance of the cells in an EGF-containing medium resulted in approximately a 6-fold increase in adhesion to CN IV (2.5 μg/ml) relative to adhesion in the absence of EGF (Fig.1A). In contrast, withdrawal of EGF from the culture medium for 48 h resulted in lower attachment to CN IV (Fig. 1B). HCT116 cells adhere well to other ECM proteins fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) in the absence of EGF because they showed 2-fold higher levels of adhesion on FN and LN than on BSA coating (Fig. 1C). Maintenance on EGF-containing medium resulted in more than a 4-fold increase in adhesion on LN and about a 3-fold increase in adhesion on FN (Fig. 1D) relative to adhesion in the absence of EGF. Thus, HCT116 cells exhibit differential adhesion with respect to specific ECM proteins. Higher cell adhesion was observed on CNIV than on LN and FN. It is also noteworthy that higher concentrations (10 μg/ml) of FN and LN were required for optimal cell adhesion as compared with lower concentrations of CNIV (2.5 μg/ml). Approximately, 2.5 μg (20 pmol) of CN IV are equivalent to 4.4 μg (20 pmol) of FN and 8.8 μg (20 pmol) of LN, whereas the molarities of the EGFr ligands used are equivalent. Thus, after adjustment for molar concentration, higher cell adhesion was observed on CN IV than on FN and LN. At 20 pmconcentration of CN IV, cell adhesion in the presence of EGF is 5.5-fold over that in the absence of EGF. Moreover, adhesion to 20 pg of CN IV is 2.25-fold higher than that of bovine serum albumin in the absence of EGF. In comparison to CN IV, the cell adhesion on 20 pm LN in the presence of EGF is ∼3.5-fold over that in the absence of EGF. Adhesion to 20 pm FN is even less than that of LN. The role of TGF-α as a promoter of cell adhesion in HCT116 cells was also determined (Fig. 1E). The effect of exogenously added TGF-α (the ligand responsible for autocrine control of these cells) was essentially the same as that of EGF. The specificity of α2integrin in mediating adhesion of HCT116 cells was determined by treatment with specific functional blocking antibodies to inhibit binding to CN IV. Monoclonal anti-α2 integrin antibody was highly effective in preventing HCT116 cell adhesion to CN IV both in the presence and absence of EGF. Inhibitory levels ranged from 65 to 8% in the absence of EGF and 80 to 45% in the presence of EGF at antibody dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:500) (Fig.2A). Antibody to the integrin α5 subunit had no effect on HCT116 cell adhesion to CN IV. However, antibody to the integrin α3 subunit was only slightly inhibitory (5–10% at 1:50 dilution) to HCT116 cell adhesion to CN IV. Integrin subunits α3 and α5 are the predominant cell adhesion receptors for laminin and fibronectin, respectively, on these cells (Fig. 2, B andC). Antibody to α3 subunit inhibited binding of HCT116 cells to LN-coated plates in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Inhibitory levels ranged from 80 to 15% in the absence of EGF and 90 to 40% in the presence of EGF at antibody dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:500. Although the integrin α2 predominately mediates adhesion to CN, it has been shown that it is a receptor for LN on endothelial cells and some types of tumor cells (30Kirchofer D. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 615-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lotz M.M. Korzelius C.A. Murcurio A.M. Cell Reg. 1990; 1: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was not surprising that antibody to integrin α2 subunit was also capable of inhibiting HCT116 cell adhesion to LN (Fig. 2B). However, inhibition by antibody to α2 subunits was not as effective as anti-α3 subunit. Antibody to the integrin α5 had no effect on HCT116 cell adhesion to LN (Fig.2B), whereas the antibody was extremely effective in preventing adhesion to FN. Inhibitory levels ranged from 90 to 70% both in the presence and absence of EGF at dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:500 (Fig. 2C). These results showed that cell adhesion to FN was primarily through integrin α5. Neither antibody to the α2 nor the α3 subunit affected adhesion of HCT116 to FN. The experiments described above were performed with cells continuously maintained in the presence or absence of EGF. Therefore, they could reflect a steady-state situation in which cells may have made adaptations leading to differences in cell adhesion and integrin expression, which were not related to control by EGFr activation. Thus it was necessary to determine whether short term changes in EGF exposure could alter cell adhesion and integrin expression. Therefore, we determined the kinetic effects on cell adhesion of removal of EGF from the medium of HCT116 cells adapted to growth in the presence of the polypeptide as well as determining the kinetic effects of addition of EGF to the medium of HCT116 cells adapted to growth in EGF-deficient medium. Subsequent characterizations were performed with CN IV and integrin α2, because this pair appeared to enhance adhesion to a greater extent than the other integrin-ECM combinations investigated. Significant enhancement of adhesion to CN IV was observed within 6 h of EGF addition, and, by 12 h, cell adhesion was increased by 2-fold rising to nearly 4-fold by 24 h and 6-fold by 48 h (Fig. 3). Withdrawal of EGF from the medium of EGF-adapted HCT116 cells would be predicted to generate the opposite results. Within 6 h of EGF removal from the EGF-adapted cells, adhesion to CN IV was reduced by 15% and was further reduced by nearly 35% to 70% between 12 and 48 h. The results of integrin antibody blockin"

In the ileum, it is thought to be implied in their enterohepatic circulation. Because the fecal excretion of BA represents the main physiological way of elimination for cholesterol (CS), the I-BABP gene could have a major function in CS homeostasis. Therefore, the I-BABP gene expression might be controlled by CS. I-BABP mRNA levels were significatively increased when the human enterocyte-like CaCo-2 cells were CS-deprived and repressed when CS were added to the medium. A highly conserved sterol regularory element-like sequence (SRE) and a putative GC box were found in human I-BABP gene promoter. Different constructs of human I-BABP promoter, cloned upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, have been used in transfections studies. CAT activity of the wild type promoter was increased in presence of CS-deprived medium, and conversely, decreased by a CS-supplemented medium. The inductive effect of CS depletion was fully abolished when the putative SRE sequence and/or GC box were mutated or deleted. Co-transfections experiments with the mature isoforms of human sterol responsive element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and Sp1 demonstrate that the CS-mediated regulation of I-BABP gene was dependent of these transcriptional factors. Paradoxically, mice subjected to a standard chow supplemented with 2% CS for 14 days exhibited a significant rise in both I-BABP and SREBP1c mRNA levels. We show that in vivo, this up-regulation could be explained by a recently described regulatory pathway involving a positive regulation of SREBP1c by liver-X-receptor following a high CS diet.

CS balance is the result of an equilibrium between dietary and biliary CS absorption, cellular de novo synthesis, and hepatic catabolism into BAs. A dysregulation of these input and output pathways produces metabolic disorders leading to gallstones formation and the development of atherosclerosis. Molecular mechanisms contributing to CS homeostasis are progressively elucidated. They are supported by a set of transcriptional factors directly activated by both CS and its metabolic derivatives, BA and oxysterols. CS modulates the transcription rate of target genes through the action of specific transcriptional factors termed sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Google Scholar). In contrast to the other members of the basic helix-loop-helix zipper family, SREBPs are synthesized as inactive precursors bound to endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nucleus envelope. In cultured cells, CS depletion triggers the proteolytic release of an active NH2-terminal domain, which after translocation into the nucleus, induces the transcription rate of sterol target genes. Conversely, the proteolytic activation of SREBPs and the transcriptional activity of target genes are low, when the cellular CS levels are increased (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Google Scholar, 2Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Google Scholar). BAs and oxysterols also affect the CS balance through regulatory pathways recently depicted that involve different nuclear hormone receptors. BAs are the natural agonists of the farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) (NR1H4) (3Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B.

Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Google Scholar), whereas oxysterols specifically activate the liver-X-receptor α and β (LXRs) (NR1H3 and NR1H2) (5Peet J. Janowski B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Google Scholar). Once activated, these nuclear receptors bind, as heterodimers with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR), specific responsive elements located in the promoter of target genes (6Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 557-563Google Scholar, 7Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Google Scholar). BA synthesis and elimination are major determinants for body CS homeostasis. Primary BAs are synthesized from CS in the liver where they are conjugated with glycine or taurine prior to be secreted into bile. More than 90% BAs are reabsorbed along the small intestine and return to the liver to be secreted again into bile. This enterohepatic BAs circulation is essential for the maintenance of CS balance. Indeed, BAs not reclaimed by intestinal absorption constitute the main way to eliminate a CS excess. If the regulation of hepatic BA biosynthetic pathway is presently well understood (7Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Google Scholar), by contrast, the molecular mechanisms responsible for intestinal BA reabsorption/elimination are poorly known. Conjugated BA are efficiently reabsorbed in the ileum by an active transport system constituted by a couple of BA transporters, the ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (I-BAT) and ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP). I-BAT is a 38-kDa integral brush border membrane protein that co-transports sodium and BAs (8Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Google Scholar). The expression of I-BAT is restricted to the ileum, the biliary ductal system, and the proximal tubules of the kidney. Its involvment in ileal BA absorption is supported by the fact that patients with a mutation in the I-BAT gene or with a diminished expression level of I-BAT, as in familial hypertriglyceridemia, fail to absorb BAs efficiently (9Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Google Scholar, 10Duane W.C. Hartich L.A. Bartman A.E. Ho S.B. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1384-1389Google Scholar). Once into the cell, BAs are reversibly bound to I-BABP, also termed ileal lipid-binding protein. It is an abundant soluble 14-kDa protein that belongs to the fatty acid-binding protein superfamily (11Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Google Scholar). As with the other members of this multigenic family, the tertiary structure of I-BABP consists of 10 antiparallel β strands organized into two orthogonal β sheets forming an hydrophobic pocket (12Lücke C. Zhang F. Rüterjans H. Hamilton J.A. Sacchettini J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 785-800Google Scholar). Specificities in the I-BABP structure (high volume cavity, great flexibility of the backbone structure) account for its preferential binding of bulky hydrophobic and rigid ligands such as unconjugated and conjugated BAs (13Lucke C. Zhang F. Hamilton J.A. Sacchettini J.C. Ruterjans H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2929-2938Google Scholar). In the digestive tract, I-BABP is found in both small intestine and liver, in which its expression is strictly restricted to the ileocytes (14Sacchettini J.C. Hauft S.M. Van Camp S.L. Cistola D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19199-19207Google Scholar, 15Gong Y.Z. Everett E.T. Schwartz D.A. Norris J.S. Wilson F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4741-4745Google Scholar) and large cholangiocytes (16Alpini G. Glaser S.S. Rodgers R. Phinizy J.L. Robertson W.E. Lasater J. Caligiuri A. Tretjak Z. LeSage G.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1734-1740Google Scholar), respectively. The physiological function of I-BABP is not yet clearly established. However, its ligand binding properties, its abundance and strict localization in cells in which BA flux is substantial, and its physical interactions with I-BAT (17Kramer W. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Jouvenal K. Müller G. Tripier D. Wess G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18035-18046Google Scholar, 18Kramer W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 230-238Google Scholar) strongly suggest that I-BABP plays a role in cellular BA uptake, trafficking, and/or protection against the detergent effect of free BAs. Such functions suggest that the expression of I-BABP gene is crucial for the BAs circulation and hence for CS balance. Therefore, it was tempting to speculate that the expression of I-BABP gene is subjected to a tight regulation. In agreement with this assumption, we have recently demonstrated that BAs up-regulate the human I-BABP gene expression (19Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 261-265Google Scholar) through the interaction of FXR/RXR heterodimer with a BA-responsive element located in the proximal part of promoter (20Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Google Scholar). In the current report, we show that the positive feedback of the I-BABP gene in response to CS feeding is because of an indirect pathway involving the LXR-mediated induction of SREBP1c. The implication of different CS sensors (FXR, LXR/SREBP1c) in the regulation of the I-BABP gene in the ileum strongly suggest that this soluble BA carrier contributes to CS balance. French guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals were followed. Male Swiss mice (30 ± 2 g) from the Center d'Elevage Dépré(Saint Doulchard, France) were used. Animals were housed individually in a controlled environment (constant temperature and humidity, darkness from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.) and fed ad libitum a standard chow (UAR A04, Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle, France). To explore the effects of a high CS diet on I-BABP gene expression, mice were fed for 14 days a standard chow supplemented with 2% CS (w/w). Controls were fed the standard chow containing <0.02% CS. In the second set of experiments, mice were either sacrified 24 h after a gavage with a specific LXR agonist (36 mg/kg GW3965). Controls received by force feeding the vehicle alone (0.9% carboxymethylcellulose, 9% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.05% Tween 80). After sacrifice, the ileal mucosa corresponding to the 5-cm intestinal segment before the cecum were scraped, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C until RNAs extraction. Caco-2 cells (passages 55–60) were cultured in controlled environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 4 mmglutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS). Medium was changed every 2 days. At the first day of confluence, cells were incubated for 24 h in the medium A containing 10% fetal calf serum (v/v) in presence of 50 μm chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone (control) or associated with either 5 μg/ml simvastatin (sterols −) or 10 μg/ml CS and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxy-cholesterol (25-(OH)CS) (sterols +). Control cultures received the vehicle alone (2 μl/ml ethanol). Male Swiss mice were fasted overnight and ileal explants were prepared then cultured as described previously (21Mallordy A. Poirier H. Besnard P. Niot I. Carlier H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 801-807Google Scholar). In brief, ileal samples were rapidly removed, washed, then sliced into strips whom serosa was stripped off. Ileal explants were precultured for 4 h at 37 °C under an oxygenated atmosphere in Hepes-buffered DMEM containing 10% NCTC-135, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% fungizone, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (all from Invitrogen). Then, the explants were cultured for 16 h in the same medium supplemented with 5% in lipoprotein free medium in presence of 50 μm GW3965 (LXR agonist). Control cultures received the vehicle alone (2 μl/ml Me2SO). Total RNAs were isolated following the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) or with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) for organ cultures of ileal explants. The RNAs (10–30 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using previously published procedures (20Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Google Scholar). cDNA from human I-BABP were used as probes (23Fujita M. Fujii H. Kanda T. Sato E. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 406-413Google Scholar). The cDNA from murine 18 S rRNA was used to ensure that equivalent amounts of RNAs were loaded and transferred. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN) by a megaprime kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA in 20 μl using random hexamers and murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyzes were performed starting with 50 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA (diluted in 5 μl of 1× Sybr Green buffer), with 200 nm of both sense and antisense primers (Genset) in a final volume of 25 μl using the Sybr Green PCR core reagents in a ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems). Because we used Sybr Green in measurements of amplification-associated fluorescence for real-time quantitative RT-PCR, it was important to verify that generated fluorescence was not overestimated by contaminations resulting from residual genomic DNA amplification (using controls without reverse transcriptase) and/or from primer dimers formation (controls with no DNA template nor reverse transcriptase). RT-PCR products were also analyzed on ethidium bromide stained agarose to ensure that a single amplicon of the expected size was indeed obtained. 18 S rRNA and GAPDH amplifications were used to account for variability in the initial quantities of cDNA. Relative quantitation for any given gene, expressed as-fold variation over control, was calculated after determination of the difference between cycle threshold (CT) of the given gene in both control (A) and treated (B) samples using the 2−Δ(CTA− CTB)formula according to manufacturer's protocol. Individual CT values are means of triplicate measurements. Sense and antisense primers were: GGCCATCCACAGTCTTCTGG and ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCCA for GAPDH, GGGAGCCTGAGAAACGGC and GGGTCGGGAGTGGGTAATTT for 18 S, GCGCCATGGACGAGCTG and TTGGCACCTGGGCTGCT for SREBP1a, GGAGCCATGGATTGCACATT and GCTTCCAGAGAGGAGGCCAG for SREBP1c, CCCTTGACTTCCTTGCTGCA and GCGTGAGTGTGGGCGAATC for SREBP2, GGGAAGGACATTCGCTCGG and TTGCTTTTCAGCTTGCTCGG for ABCA1, GAGTGGCAGGACCCCTTTG and GTTTCGAGCCAGGCTTTCAC for HMG-CoA reductase. Wild type −2769/+44 (2769 I-BABPwt) and −148/+44 (148 I-BABPwt) bp fragments of the human I-BABP promoter were cloned upstream from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the pCAT3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutations of the sterol-responsive element (SRE; 148 I-BABPmut1) and the GC box (148 I-BABPmut2) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the following oligonucleotides 5′-ggagggagaagaaGTGGGATATCttaggggctgagcc-3′ (SRE sequence in capital letters, mutations in bold letters) and 5′ ggagaagaagtggggtgacttCTAGACtgagcctcagcaactggg-3′ (CG box sequence in capital letters, mutation in bold letters). Deletion of these sequences (148 I-BABPdel) was realized using the following primer 5′-caggacaggagggagaagaagcctcagcaactgggagag-3′. All constructs were confirmed prior to use by restriction digestions. CaCo-2 cells were used for the transfection studies. They were plated in six-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS at 40–50% confluence. Transfection mixes contained 4 μg of I-BABP-CAT reporter plasmid and 500 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. Co-transfection mixes contained 4 μg of I-BABP-CAT reporter plasmid, 10 or 100 ng of human SREBP1a, SREBP1c, or SREBP2 expression vectors (generous gift from Dr T. F. Osborne, University of California, Irvine, CA) or 4 μg of human Sp1 expression vector (generous gift from Dr R. Tjian, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA) and 500 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were transfected overnight by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. In transfection studies, the medium was changed by DMEM supplemented with 1% of lipoprotein-depleted serum (sterols −) or 10 μg/ml CS and 1 μg/ml 25-(OH)CS (sterols +). In co-transfections studies, the medium was changed by DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS associated with 10 μg/ml CS and 1 μg/ml 25-(OH)CS to inhibit maturation of endogenous SREBPs. The cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activities. SREBP1c (24Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Google Scholar) was synthesized in vitro using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel mobility shift assays (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 120 mm KCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and freshly synthesized SREBP1c protein (5 μl). Competitor oligonucleotides, including the wild type SRELDL(gatcaaaATCACCCCACtgc), wild type SREI-BABP(gatcccctaaGTCACCCCACttcttc), mutated SREI-BABP(gatcccctaaGATATCCCACttcttc, mutations indicated in bold letters), were included at a 500-fold excess. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 10 ng of 5′ end-labeled [γ-32P]ATP oligonucleotide (wild type SREI-BABP) was added and the incubation continued for an additional 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 m TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mmEDTA). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. The results were expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the differences between groups was determined by Student's t test. Statistical significance for real-time quantitative RT-PCR was assessed by analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls comparison tests (Statistica, StatSoft Inc.). In undifferentiated Caco-2 cells cultured under standard conditions, I-BABP mRNA levels are too low to detect a putative inhibitory effect. Because CDCA is known to be a strong I-BABP gene inducer (19Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 261-265Google Scholar), the effect of a sterol addition (10 μg/ml CS + 1 μg/ml 25-(OH)CS) or depletion (5 μg/ml HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin) on I-BABP mRNA levels was studied on cells simultaneously subjected to 50 μm CDCA. According to previously published data (19Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 261-265Google Scholar), CDCA alone led to a 2-fold increase in I-BABP transcripts as compared with the control culture (data not shown). As shown in the Fig.1, the I-BABP mRNA levels were significantly increased when Caco-2 were sterol-deprived and repressed when the sterols were added to the medium. Similar modifications in mRNA levels have also been found for the 3-HMG-CoA reductase, which is known to be a typical sterol target gene (data not shown). To determine whether the sterol-mediated effects on I-BABP mRNA levels might be secondary to a direct gene regulation, Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected either with a long (2769 I-BABPwt) or a short (148 I-BABPwt) human I-BABP promoter fragments cloned into a CAT reporter vector in presence or in absence of sterols. Lipoprotein deprivation resulted in a 4-fold rise in CAT activity as compared with sterol-treated cells. Additional transactivation occurred in cells cultured in sterol-depleted medium in which cholesterol synthesis was inhibited by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (Fig. 2). This finding brings the first demonstration that the human I-BABP gene is a sterol target gene. The fact that the short promoter construct was always sterol-sensitive strongly suggests a proximal localization for the sterol-responsive sequence. According with this assumption, the sequence inspection of human I-BABP promoter revealed the decamer (5′-GTGGGGTGAC-3′) at the position −72/−62 exhibiting a high homology with the SREBP-binding site-1 (SRE-1) found in the promoters of LDL receptor (25Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar), HMG-CoA synthase (26Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (27Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Google Scholar). To function efficiently, SREBPs require the additional transcription factors NF-Y or Sp-1 (28Schoonjans K. Brendel C. Mangelsdorf D. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 114-125Google Scholar). A putative Sp-1-binding site (GC box−58/−54) flanking the SRE−72/−62sequence was also identified in the human I-BABP promoter. Sequence alignment of the proximal promoter of human, rabbit, and mouse I-BABP genes demonstrated that the SRE sequence and GC box are highly conserved in these different mammalian species (Fig.3). Deletion/mutation analyzes of the short promoter confirmed the importance of these sequences (Fig.4). Indeed, the strong induction of the CAT activity triggered by sterol depletion in the wild type promoter (148 I-BABPwt) was fully abolished when SRE−72/−62 or GC box−58/−54 were mutated (148 I-BABPmut1 and 148 I-BABPmut2) or deleted (148 I-BABPdel). Interestingly, similar results were also found in the context of the large promoter (2800 bp), demonstrating that only the proximal sequence −72/−54 is critical for CS response (data not shown).Figure 3A conserved putative SRE sequence in the human, rabbit and mouse I-BABP gene promoters.

Means ± S.E., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In cultured cells sterol-depleted conditions lead to the proteolytic activation of SREBPs that bind to SRE in the promoter of sterol target genes. To determine the involvment of SREBPs on sterol-mediated regulation of I-BABP gene, Caco-2 cells were co-transfected with the wild type version of the short I-BABP promoter-CAT plasmid and expression vectors expressing mature SREBP1a, SREBP1c, or SREBP2. As shown in Fig.5A, CAT activity driven by the 148 I-BABPwt promoter was similarly induced by both SREBP1a and SREBP2 in dose-dependent manner. A lower, but significant, effect was also found in presence of 100 ng of SREBP1c expression vector (Fig. 5A). This observation is in good agreement with the fact that SREBP1c isoform is a much weaker transcription activator than SREBP1a in cultured cells (29Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Google Scholar). Constructs in which SRE−72/−62 was mutated or deleted were unresponsive to SREBPs (Fig. 5B). To function efficiently SREBPs must be activated by co-factors such as Sp-1 or NF-Y. To explore the functional role of the putative Sp-1-binding site (GC box−58/−54) identified in the close proximity of the SRE-1 (Fig. 3), Caco-2 cells were co-transfected with different constructs of the short I-BABP promoter in the presence of a Sp-1 expression vector or empty plasmid (CMV5). The 4-fold induction of CAT activity mediated by Sp-1 in wild type promoter was not affected by the mutation of SRE-1 sequence (148 I-BABPmut1). By contrast, it was substantially decreased when mutations were introduced in the GC box (148 I-BABP mut2), suggesting that the nucleotide sequence −58/−54 is a Sp-1-binding site (Fig.5C). It is noteworthy that the different modifications introduced in the sequence of the proximal promoter of human I-BABP gene do not alter its functional activity. Indeed, the mutation or deletion of the SRE−72/−62 sequence and GC box−58/−54 in a promoter construct containing the BA-responsive element did not abrogate the FXR/CDCA-mediated transactivation of the CAT reporter gene (data not shown). Taken together, the current in vitroexperiments demonstrate that I-BABP gene expression might be regulated by SREBPs in response to alteration of cellular sterol levels. To assess the physiological pertinence of this finding, I-BABP expression was explored in mice fed for 14 days a standard chow supplemented with 2% CS. Surprisingly, the I-BABP mRNA levels were significantly higher in the ileum from mice subjected to the CS supplementation than in animal fed the control diet (Fig.6A). Interestingly, ileal SREBP1c mRNA levels were also significantly increased by the high CS diet, whereas the transcripts encoding SREBP1a were unchanged (Fig.6B), and as previously reported, SREBP2 mRNA levels were reduced by the CS feeding (30Shimomura I.

To determine whether the SREBP1c isoform can specifically bind to the SREI-BABP motif, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the32P-labeled SRE from the human I-BABP promoter as probe. In the presence of SREBP1c, a shift was found (Fig.7, lane 12). The binding specificity of SREBP1c to wild type SREI-BABP was demonstrated by the existence of a competitive inhibition in presence of an excess of either wild type SREI-BABP or SRELDL sequences (Fig. 7, lanes 13 and14), not reproduced with mutated SREI-BABP (Fig.7, lane 15). No binding was obtained when mutated SREI-BABP was used as probe (Fig. 7, lanes 15–20). LDL receptor SRE was also used as positive control probe (Fig. 7, lanes 1–10).Figure 7SREBP1c specifically binds the humanSRE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed in presence of in vitro translated SREBP1c and wild type (WT) I-BABP SRE (WT SREI-BABP) as probe.

https://openalex.org/W2091383444,"We developed a fluorescence-based assay method for determining ligand binding activities of C-reactive protein (CRP) in solution. Using this method, we compared the phosphorylcholine (PC)- and polycation-based binding activities of human CRP. The PC-based binding required calcium, whereas a polycation (e.g.poly-l-lysine) was bound in the presence of either calcium or EDTA, the binding being stronger in the presence of EDTA. The published crystallographic structures of CRP and the CRP·PC complex show it to be a ring-shaped pentamer with a single PC-binding site per subunit facing the same direction. As expected from such a structure, binding affinity of a ligand increased tremendously when multiple PC residues were present on a macromolecular structure. In addition to PC-related structures, certain sugar phosphates (e.g.galactose 6-phosphate) are bound near the PC-binding site, and one of the sugar hydroxyl groups appears to interact with CRP. The best small ligands for the polycationic binding site were Lys-Lys and Lys4. Because of the presence of multiple Lys-Lys sequences, polylysines have tremendously enhanced affinity. Although PC inhibits both PC- and polycation-based binding, none of the amines that inhibit polylysine binding inhibits PC binding, suggesting that the PC and polycationic binding sites do not overlap.

At the onset of infection or inflammation, the concentration of CRP may increase as much as 1000-fold. CRP acts as a defense molecule against some pathogens such as pneumococcal bacteria by initially binding to their surface components, e.g.phosphorylcholine (PC), and then activating the complement system or causing opsonization. The other major biological functions of CRP include removal of damaged cells and cell debris, wound healing, and immunomodulatory effect (1Kilpatrick J.M. Volanakis J.E. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Gewurz H. Zhang X.-H. Lint T.F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Szalai A.J. Agrawal A. Greenbough T.J. Volanakis J.E. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Such a diverse range of biological activity of CRP is matched by a wide range of ligand with which it interacts. The known ligands can be classified into three major groups. They are 1) compounds that contain phosphorylcholine or related structures, 2) polycationic compounds such as poly-l-lysine and protamine sulfate, and 3) carbohydrates that containd-galactose-related structures.CRP is a member of the pentraxin family and, thus, is a homopentamer whose subunits associate non-covalently side by side to form a wreath-like structure (4Shrive A.K. Cheetham G.M.T. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Turnell W.G. Volanakis J.E. Pepys M.B. Bloomer A.C. Greenhough T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because all subunits face the same direction, the surface of each side of the wreath has distinct binding characteristics. It is known that the conformation of CRP changes depending on the presence or absence of calcium (5Kilpatrick J.M. Kearney J.F. Volanakis J.E. Mol. Immun. 1982; 19: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, the soluble form of CRP and CRP bound to a plastic surface or cell surface (so-called neo-CRP) present different epitopes (6Ying S.-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immun. 1989; 143: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, there is a potential for altered binding specificity (7Kempka G. Roos P.H. Kolb-Bachofen V. J. Immun. 1990; 144: 1004-1009PubMed Google Scholar).We describe here a sensitive assay method for the ligand binding activities of CRP in the solution phase. The assay is based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation of CRP complexed with Eu-labeled, high affinity ligands. This method allows measurement of the binding activity of all three ligand groups, namely PC-, polycationic-, and galactose-based binding, using a similar assay strategy and the same detection method. We describe in this paper a detailed mapping of the PC-binding site and polycationic binding site of human CRP and the relationship between the two types of ligand.RESULTSEffect of pH on Ligand BindingThe binding activity of CRP for Eu-PC40-Et-BSA was remarkably constant in the pH range of 4.5–8.5 in the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 2) and showed a slight decrease in the bound amount at pH 9. On the acidic side, however, there was a sharp drop in the binding activity below pH 4.5, reaching essentially no activity at pH 4. The pH dependence of Eu-PL binding was quite similar, with a sharp drop in the binding activity between pH 4.5 and 4.0 (not shown). This sudden loss of activity on the acidic side may be because of dissociation of the pentameric organization of CRP.Dependence of Ligand Binding on CalciumThe conformation of CRP is known to change depending on the presence or absence of calcium ion (5Kilpatrick J.M. Kearney J.F. Volanakis J.E. Mol. Immun. 1982; 19: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding activity of CRP for Eu-PC40-Et-BSA without added calcium was about 60% of the maximal binding activity, which occurred at around 10 mmcalcium, and there was a gradual increase in the bound Eu-PC40-Et-BSA between 0 and 10 mm of added CaCl2. Perhaps the amount of calcium in the CRP sample and buffer is sufficient to mostly maintain the calcium-bound conformation of CRP without any added calcium. The bound amount of Eu-PL in the presence of 0–10 mm calcium did not seem to change much.To investigate if calcium is truly required for the binding, binding activity was measured in the presence of EDTA. As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” EDTA competes Eu off the labeled macromolecules so that they had to be reloaded with Eu after filtration. Using this modified assay method, we found that CRP does not bind Eu-PC40-Et-BSA in the presence of EDTA (0.5 mm), since the fluorescence recovery was essentially the same whether CRP was present or not. This observation is in agreement with the prevailing idea that the PC-dependent binding to CRP requires calcium.As to Eu-PL, DiCamelli et al. (16DiCamelli R. Potempa L.A. Siegel J. Suyehira L. Petras K. Gewurz H. J. Immun. 1980; 125: 1933-1938PubMed Google Scholar) report that the binding of PL (measured by nephelometry) was inhibited in the presence of calcium. However, PL apparently can be bound by CRP in the presence of calcium if PC is also present (17Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1509-1514PubMed Google Scholar). We carried out two parallel assays of CRP binding Eu-PL in the presence of EDTA and in the presence of calcium at the Eu-PL and CRP concentrations of 185 and 380 nm, respectively. The bound amount in the presence of EDTA was 0.274 million counts/s (Mcps) as compared with 0.11 Mcps in the presence of 2 mm calcium, suggesting that Eu-PL binds better to the calcium-free conformation. To find out if this increase in the bound amount is because of an increased number of binding sites or because of increased affinity, IC50 of PL (DP 240) was determined in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA and in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 using the same washing/reloading protocol. IC50 in the presence of EDTA was 150 nm as compared with 600 nm in the presence of calcium, indicating that Eu-PL bound tighter to CRP in the calcium-free conformation. It should be noted, however, that the IC50 determined in the presence of calcium by this modified protocol is about four times higher than that obtained in the standard assay. Presumably the higher values resulted from excessive manipulations of washing and loading in the modified assay.Inhibition AssaysAt least two separate series of inhibition assay were carried out for each inhibitor. Inhibition curves generally had an appearance similar to those of PC9-Et-BSA and PC-glycerol shown in Fig. 1. In each case, 10–90% inhibition was observed within 2 decades of inhibitor concentration. The only exception to this was PC, which showed a very steep inhibition curve (Fig. 1). This may mean that there is cooperative inhibitory effect among five subunits of CRP,i.e. binding of the first PC molecule somehow facilitates the subsequent binding events.Inhibition of the Eu-PC40-Et-BSA BindingPolyvalent InhibitorsAs shown in TableI, binding affinity of the short-armed, PC-substituted BSA derivatives (PC-Et-BSA) was highly dependent on the PC content, showing a 42-fold increase in affinity when the PC content was increased by 6-fold. In contrast, there was only a small increase in affinity of the long-armed derivatives (PC-AhAe-BSA) beyond the PC content of 27 mol/mol. Affinity even higher than the PC-BSA derivatives could be attained when PC residues were on the flexible backbone of polylysine (DP 240). However, we found that the high inhibitory potency of PC-PLs is dependent not only on the PC content but also on its polycationic nature because when the three PC-PL preparations wereN-acetylated to eliminate the polycationic nature, the affinity of all three so-modified PC-PLs decreased. For instance, PC75-PL, which has roughly 165 unmodified amino groups, is an ∼4-fold stronger inhibitor than the N-acetylated counterpart, whereas PC139-PL, which has fewer free amino groups, was only a 2-fold better inhibitor than the NAc-PC139-PL. Thus, NAc-PC-PLs not only had lower overall affinities, but their affinities were more dependent on the PC content than PC-PLs.Table IInhibition of the Eu-PC40-Et-BSA binding to CRP by multivalent, PC-containing inhibitorsInhibitorPC contentIC50mol/molμmPC-Et-BSA 91.50 210.20 400.102 570.036PC-AhAe-BSA 270.098 410.085 450.070PC-PL 750.0281140.0121390.0105NAc-PC-PL 750.1081140.0681390.024 Open table in a new tab Small InhibitorsThe IC50 value for PC of 40 μm obtained by us (TableII) is quite comparable with what was reported by others, e.g. 42.5 μm (18Young N.M. Williams R.E. J. Immun. 1978; 121: 1893-1898PubMed Google Scholar) and 75 μm (19Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 136: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These values are slightly higher thanKD of 18 μm determined by capillary electrophoresis (20Heegaard H.H. Robey F.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 166: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A KD value as low as 3 μm was obtained using a less direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (21Tanaka T. Robey F.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The relative IC50 values were also comparable; the values for PC, PC-glycerol, and phosphorylethanolamine were 1:18:32 in our assay and 1:22:55 by Volanakis and Kaplan (19Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 136: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Shown also in Table II are IC50values of a number of other phosphate-containing compounds and related structures. These non-choline-containing phosphates can be divided into three groups: 1) compounds with the binding affinity comparable with Pi (IC50 20 mm): Glc-6-P and Man-6-P; 2) compounds with ∼10-fold higher affinity than Pi: glycerol phosphate, Gal-6-P, Rib-5-P, 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-P as well as AMP and dAMP; 3) compounds that have very poor inhibitory potency: α-Glc-1-P and α-Gal-1-P. Interestingly, Gal-6-sulfate, although quite similar in structure to Gal-6-P (Fig. 3), was totally inactive at 50 mm. As will be described under “Discussion,” the phosphate group of PC is held in the binding site by direct coordination to a pair of calcium ions. The failure of Gal-6-sulfate to bind suggests that somehow sulfate cannot make strong coordination bonds to calcium ions. Galacturonic acid (at 47 mm) was also totally ineffective as an inhibitor. However, serum amyloid P-component, another pentraxin structurally homologous to CRP, binds methyl 4,6-(1-carboxyethylidene)-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fig. 3) via its carboxylate interacting with calcium atoms much the same way as phosphate does in CRP (22Elmsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Perhaps in the case of galacturonic acid the carboxylate group is unfavorably oriented for the calcium chelation, probably because of close proximity of carboxylate to the sugar ring.Table IIInhibition of the Eu-PC40-Et-BSA binding to CRP by small, PC-related and other phosphate-containing moleculesInhibitorIC50μmPC40 ± 10PC-glycerol550PE1270 ± 130Glycerophosphate4500Phosphate24000 ± 1000Gal-6-P1900 ± 300Glc-6-P20000 ± 3000Man-6-P16000 ± 0Rib-5-P2000 ± 5002-Deoxy-Rib-5-P1650 ± 50AMP3100 ± 400dAMP3100 ± 400Galα1-PNI (40,000)2-aNI, not inhibitory at the concentration shown in parentheses.Glcα1-PNI (11,000)2-aNI, not inhibitory at the concentration shown in parentheses.2-bGlcα1-P gave 27% inhibition at 45,000 μm.Manα1-P30000 ± 01-Hexanoylphosphatidylcholine1180 ± 201-Decanoylphosphatidylcholine1500 ± 5001-Decanoyl-2-acetyl phosphatidylcholine2300 ± 500PE, phosphorylethanolamine.2-a NI, not inhibitory at the concentration shown in parentheses.2-b Glcα1-P gave 27% inhibition at 45,000 μm.

Narkates A.J. J. Immun. 1981; 126: 1820-1825PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the inhibitory potency of the individual lysolecithin molecule in solution as well as to assess the importance of having free β-OH for binding, two lysolecithins, each with one short fatty acid chain (C6 and C10) and 1-decanoyl-2-acetyl-phosphatidylcholine, were tested. All three phosphatidylcholine derivatives were soluble in water and expected to remain dispersed as monomers because of short acyl chains and the presence of a zwitterionic PC residue. The IC50values of these acylated phosphatidylcholine derivatives were all in 1–2 mm range, only slightly higher than that of PC-glycerol (0.5 mm), suggesting that the presence of free β-OH is not a requirement for binding. Perhaps, as suggested by others, physical disposition of lysolecithin on the membrane and/or disruption of membrane structure caused by the presence of lysolecithin are the reasons for preferential binding of lysolecithin-containing vesicles. The compounds with amino groups, Lys (50 mm), Arg (11 mm), Lys-Lys (8 mm), and Lys4 (4 mm), choline chloride (30 mm) as well as PL of DP 240 (5.6 μm) and histones (400 μm) did not inhibit the PC-dependent binding at the highest concentration tested, which is indicated in parenthesis.Inhibition of the Eu-PL BindingPolyvalent InhibitorsTable IIIlists the inhibitory potency of all the polyvalent inhibitors tested. As observed for Eu-PC40-Et-BSA binding, the inhibitory potency of PL is highly dependent on the number of cationic groups present, which is proportional to the molecular weight. A comparison of PL of DP 16 and DP 240 shows that an increase in DP of 15-fold resulted in the affinity increase of 1000-fold. Poly-l-Arg and poly-l-ornithine, although tested at only one molecular size, seem to inhibit at the concentration comparable to polylysines. Among the basic proteins tested, only a lysine-rich histone preparation (enriched in H-1) had a measurable IC50 (220 μg/ml), although its affinity was much weaker than polylysine of the comparable size, i.e. DP-60 PL (13 kDa) had IC50 of 23 μg/ml. PC40-Et-BSA could inhibit the Eu-PL binding but much less effectively (IC50 = 2.7 μm) than it inhibited the Eu-PC40-Et-BSA binding (IC50 = 0.1 μm).Table IIIInhibition of the Eu-PL (DP-240) binding to CRP by poly-(basic amino acid) and basic proteinsInhibitorDegree of polymerizationMolecular massIC50μg/mlμmkDaPoly-L-Lys163.4480100601322.81.75240505 ± 1.50.1 ± 0.03Poly-L-Arg20038.312.30.32Poly-L-Orn1693315.50.47Histone3-aHistones II-AS and III-S are both preparations from calf thymus.

The reason for this interesting phenomenon is unclear, but to find out which groups are responsible for this effect, we tested various substituted Lys derivatives. As shown in TableIV, the presence of both unmodified α-carboxylic acid and α-amino group may be responsible, sinceNα-acetyl-Lys (slight activation) and Lys methyl ester had normal inhibition curves, whereasNε-acetyl Lys gave the activation (190%). A neutral amino acid, Ala, gave activation, although only up to 140%. Of all the amino-containing compounds tested, only Lys-Lys and Lys4 had sub-mm IC50 values, whereas all other amines were much poorer inhibitors.Figure 4Enhancement of Eu-PL binding by certain amino acids. ▪, l-Lys; ▴, l-Arg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IVInhibition of the Eu-PL (DP-240) binding to CRP by basic moleculesInhibitorIC50μmLys-Lys370 ± 50Lys4230 ± 30Lys, Arg, HisEnh4-aA transient increase in the bound amount of ligand does not allow accurate IC50determination.Nε-Acetyl-LysEnhLys methyl ester15,000 ± 3,000Nα-Acetyl-Lys13,000 ± 1,0001,2-Diaminoethane62,0001,6-Diaminohexane17,0001,8-Diaminooctane3,500 ± 5001,12-Diaminododecane27,000 ± 0Octylamine20,000 ± 4,000Choline chloride20,000 ± 4,000PC4,700 ± 7004-a A transient increase in the bound amount of ligand does not allow accurate IC50determination. Open table in a new tab Human C-reactive protein (CRP)1 is a prototype acute-phase reactant. At the onset of infection or inflammation, the concentration of CRP may increase as much as 1000-fold. CRP acts as a defense molecule against some pathogens such as pneumococcal bacteria by initially binding to their surface components, e.g.phosphorylcholine (PC), and then activating the complement system or causing opsonization. The other major biological functions of CRP include removal of damaged cells and cell debris, wound healing, and immunomodulatory effect (1Kilpatrick J.M. Volanakis J.E. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Gewurz H. Zhang X.-H. Lint T.F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Szalai A.J. Agrawal A. Greenbough T.J. Volanakis J.E. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Such a diverse range of biological activity of CRP is matched by a wide range of ligand with which it interacts. The known ligands can be classified into three major groups. They are 1) compounds that contain phosphorylcholine or related structures, 2) polycationic compounds such as poly-l-lysine and protamine sulfate, and 3) carbohydrates that containd-galactose-related structures. CRP is a member of the pentraxin family and, thus, is a homopentamer whose subunits associate non-covalently side by side to form a wreath-like structure (4Shrive A.K. Cheetham G.M.T. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Turnell W.G. Volanakis J.E. Pepys M.B. Bloomer A.C. Greenhough T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because all subunits face the same direction, the surface of each side of the wreath has distinct binding characteristics. It is known that the conformation of CRP changes depending on the presence or absence of calcium (5Kilpatrick J.M. Kearney J.F. Volanakis J.E. Mol. Immun. 1982; 19: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, the soluble form of CRP and CRP bound to a plastic surface or cell surface (so-called neo-CRP) present different epitopes (6Ying S.-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immun. 1989; 143: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, there is a potential for altered binding specificity (7Kempka G. Roos P.H. Kolb-Bachofen V. J. Immun. 1990; 144: 1004-1009PubMed Google Scholar). We describe here a sensitive assay method for the ligand binding activities of CRP in the solution phase. The assay is based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation of CRP complexed with Eu-labeled, high affinity ligands. This method allows measurement of the binding activity of all three ligand groups, namely PC-, polycationic-, and galactose-based binding, using a similar assay strategy and the same detection method. We describe in this paper a detailed mapping of the PC-binding site and polycationic binding site of human CRP and the relationship between the two types of ligand. RESULTSEffect of pH on Ligand BindingThe binding activity of CRP for Eu-PC40-Et-BSA was remarkably constant in the pH range of 4.5–8.5 in the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 2) and showed a slight decrease in the bound amount at pH 9. On the acidic side, however, there was a sharp drop in the binding activity below pH 4.5, reaching essentially no activity at pH 4. The pH dependence of Eu-PL binding was quite similar, with a sharp drop in the binding activity between pH 4.5 and 4.0 (not shown). This sudden loss of activity on the acidic side may be because of dissociation of the pentameric organization of CRP.Dependence of Ligand Binding on CalciumThe conformation of CRP is known to change depending on the presence or absence of calcium ion (5Kilpatrick J.M. Kearney J.F. Volanakis J.E. Mol. Immun. 1982; 19: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding activity of CRP for Eu-PC40-Et-BSA without added calcium was about 60% of the maximal binding activity, which occurred at around 10 mmcalcium, and there was a gradual increase in the bound Eu-PC40-Et-BSA between 0 and 10 mm of added CaCl2. Perhaps the amount of calcium in the CRP sample and buffer is sufficient to mostly maintain the calcium-bound conformation of CRP without any added calcium. The bound amount of Eu-PL in the presence of 0–10 mm calcium did not seem to change much.To investigate if calcium is truly required for the binding, binding activity was measured in the presence of EDTA. As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” EDTA competes Eu off the labeled macromolecules so that they had to be reloaded with Eu after filtration. Using this modified assay method, we found that CRP does not bind Eu-PC40-Et-BSA in the presence of EDTA (0.5 mm), since the fluorescence recovery was essentially the same whether CRP was present or not. This observation is in agreement with the prevailing idea that the PC-dependent binding to CRP requires calcium.As to Eu-PL, DiCamelli et al. (16DiCamelli R. Potempa L.A. Siegel J. Suyehira L. Petras K. Gewurz H. J. Immun. 1980; 125: 1933-1938PubMed Google Scholar) report that the binding of PL (measured by nephelometry) was inhibited in the presence of calcium. However, PL apparently can be bound by CRP in the presence of calcium if PC is also present (17Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1509-1514PubMed Google Scholar). We carried out two parallel assays of CRP binding Eu-PL in the presence of EDTA and in the presence of calcium at the Eu-PL and CRP concentrations of 185 and 380 nm, respectively. The bound amount in the presence of EDTA was 0.274 million counts/s (Mcps) as compared with 0.11 Mcps in the presence of 2 mm calcium, suggesting that Eu-PL binds better to the calcium-free conformation. To find out if this increase in the bound amount is because of an increased number of binding sites or because of increased affinity, IC50 of PL (DP 240) was determined in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA and in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 using the same washing/reloading protocol. IC50 in the presence of EDTA was 150 nm as compared with 600 nm in the presence of calcium, indicating that Eu-PL bound tighter to CRP in the calcium-free conformation. It should be noted, however, that the IC50 determined in the presence of calcium by this modified protocol is about four times higher than that obtained in the standard assay. Presumably the higher values resulted from excessive manipulations of washing and loading in the modified assay.Inhibition AssaysAt least two separate series of inhibition assay were carried out for each inhibitor. Inhibition curves generally had an appearance similar to those of PC9-Et-BSA and PC-glycerol shown in Fig. 1. In each case, 10–90% inhibition was observed within 2 decades of inhibitor concentration. The only exception to this was PC, which showed a very steep inhibition curve (Fig. 1). This may mean that there is cooperative inhibitory effect among five subunits of CRP,i.e. binding of the first PC molecule somehow facilitates the subsequent binding events.Inhibition of the Eu-PC40-Et-BSA BindingPolyvalent InhibitorsAs shown in TableI, binding affinity of the short-armed, PC-substituted BSA derivatives (PC-Et-BSA) was highly dependent on the PC content, showing a 42-fold increase in affinity when the PC content was increased by 6-fold. In contrast, there was only a small increase in affinity of the long-armed derivatives (PC-AhAe-BSA) beyond the PC content of 27 mol/mol. Affinity even higher than the PC-BSA derivatives could be attained when PC residues were on the flexible backbone of polylysine (DP 240). However, we found that the high inhibitory potency of PC-PLs is dependent not only on the PC content but also on its polycationic nature because when the three PC-PL preparations wereN-acetylated to eliminate the polycationic nature, the affinity of all three so-modified PC-PLs decreased. For instance, PC75-PL, which has roughly 165 unmodified amino groups, is an ∼4-fold stronger inhibitor than the N-acetylated counterpart, whereas PC139-PL, which has fewer free amino groups, was only a 2-fold better inhibitor than the NAc-PC139-PL. Thus, NAc-PC-PLs not only had lower overall affinities, but their affinities were more dependent on the PC content than PC-PLs.Table IInhibition of the Eu-PC40-Et-BSA binding to CRP by multivalent, PC-containing inhibitorsInhibitorPC contentIC50mol/molμmPC-Et-BSA 91.50 210.20 400.102 570.036PC-AhAe-BSA 270.098 410.085 450.070PC-PL 750.0281140.0121390.0105NAc-PC-PL 750.1081140.0681390.024 Open table in a new tab Small InhibitorsThe IC50 value for PC of 40 μm obtained by us (TableII) is quite comparable with what was reported by others, e.g. 42.5 μm (18Young N.M.

Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Google Scholar, 2Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Google Scholar). However, the important question regarding which region or regions of the II-III loop are involved in the voltage-dependent interaction with the RyR has not yet been settled. According to the studies with myotubes expressing chimeric II-III loop, the region encompassing the residues Phe725–Pro742 of the II-III loop (3Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Google Scholar) or its extended region encompassing Leu720–Leu764 region (4Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Google Scholar) plays a critical role in both orthograde and retrograde communications between the DHP receptor and the RyR. On the other hand, studies with shorter synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions of the II-III loop suggested that the important functions of E-C coupling are localized in the two different regions of the loop. Namely, the peptides corresponding to the overlapping regions encompassing Glu666–Glu726(5Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A372Google Scholar) and Thr671–Leu690 (peptide A; see Refs.6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 7Dulhunty A.F.

Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Google Scholar) produced a strong activation of the RyR. This suggested that the putative activator of E-C coupling resides in the peptide A region, although whether the activating function is localized in the Arg681–Leu690 (peptide A-10; see Ref. 11El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar) region or in the Thr671–Glu680 region (12Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Google Scholar) has not yet been settled. Another peptide corresponding to the Glu724–Pro760 region of the II-III loop, peptide C, inhibited peptide A-mediated activation of the RyR (6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar,14Ikemoto N. El-Hayek R. Sugi H. Pollack G.H.

Ikemoto N. Stephenson D.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C891-C905Google Scholar). Thus, the information derived from the peptide probe studies suggested that these two regions of the II-III loop are involved in E-C coupling (13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar). However, according to the recent report of Proenza et al.(16Proenza C. Wilkens C.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29935-29937Google Scholar), scrambling of the amino acid sequence in the peptide A-10 region, which produced a severe loss of the activating function of peptide A-10 in our in vitro experiments (11El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar), produced no detectable changes in E-C coupling in the dysgenic myotubes. Similarly, chimeric construct, in which the Leu720–Leu764 region is the skeletal muscle-type sequence, but the rest is identical to the housefly II-III loop with the sequence quite dissimilar to the skeletal muscle sequence, produced essentially the same E-C coupling activity as the wild-type skeletal muscle system (17Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Ntl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Google Scholar). Furthermore, according to the more recent report of Ahern et al. (18Ahern C.A. Arikkath J. Vallejo P. Gurnett C.A. Powers P.A. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. Proc. Ntl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6935-6940Google Scholar) deletion of the Thr671–Leu690 peptide A region from the α1 subunit produced virtually no effect on Ca2+ conductance, charge movement, and Ca2+ transients. These reports raised the possibility that the only Leu720–Leu764region, containing the Phe725–Pro742 region (the so-called determinant of skeletal-type E-C coupling), may be sufficient for the in vivo E-C coupling without the requirement of the peptide A region. Although the chimera approach suggested that the Leu720–Leu764 region (containing the determinant region) is important for in vivo E-C coupling as described above, the actual functions of this region have not yet been elucidated. What kind of function or functions does this region retain? Can we find any of the functions required for E-C coupling, such as activation, re-priming, and physical linking of the II-III loop with the RyR? As described previously (6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 14Ikemoto N. El-Hayek R. Sugi H. Pollack G.H. Mechanisms of Work Production and Work Absorption in Muscle. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 199-207Google Scholar, 15Lamb G.D. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Stephenson D.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C891-C905Google Scholar), peptide C that corresponds to essentially the same region as the Leu720–Leu764 region suppresses activation of the RyR by peptide A and T-tubule depolarization, suggesting that this region may be required for at least the blocking or re-priming process of E-C coupling. According to the recent report by Stange et al. (12Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Google Scholar), the peptide corresponding to the Leu720–Gln765 (a slightly extended version of peptide C) activated the RyR Ca2+ channel, suggesting that this region may contain the potential activating function, as well. The main aim of the present study is to gain further insight into the functions to be assigned to the peptide C region of the II-III loop. The peptide probe has permitted us to perform functional and site-localization assays in a highly quantitative manner. Using this advantage we re-investigated the effects of peptide C, as well as peptide A, on the ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release activities at both higher ([Ca2+]s >0.1 μm; above-threshold or contracting) and lower ([Ca2+]s <0.1 μm; sub-threshold or relaxing) concentrations of Ca2+. An interesting new finding in the present study is that peptide C enhanced ryanodine binding and induced SR Ca2+ release at sub-threshold [Ca2+] for muscle contraction, but at above-threshold [Ca2+] it produced an antagonistic effect against the channel activation by peptide A and T-tubule depolarization. On the other hand, peptide A significantly enhanced ryanodine binding and induced SR Ca2+ release in both ranges of Ca2+(0.01–1.0 μm). In the present study, we also carried out the peptide-mediated site-directed fluorescent labeling using peptide C as a site-directing carrier at various [Ca2+]s ranging in both sub- and above-threshold concentrations. The results of the labeling experiment suggest that there are two classes of peptide C binding; one, Ca2+-independent and the other, Ca2+-dependent. Based upon these findings, we propose that the Ca2+-independent binding of peptide C produces activation of the RyR, whereas the Ca2+-dependent binding produces the antagonistic effect. Triad-enriched microsomal fraction of skeletal muscle was prepared from the rabbit back paraspinous and hind leg skeletal muscle by a method of differential centrifugation as described previously (19Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Google Scholar). Microsomes from the final centrifugation were homogenized in a sample solution containing 0.3 m sucrose, 0.15 m potassium gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), 20 mmMES, pH 6.8, to a final concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −78 °C. Cardiac muscle microsomes were prepared as follows: rabbit ventricular cardiac muscle was homogenized in 4 volumes of 0.3 msucrose, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 50 μm BAPTA in a Waring blender at high speed. During the homogenization the pH value was adjusted to 7.2. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 6,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was filtered through Whatman filter paper. The filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 50 min. The pellet was discarded, and supernatant was filtered through Whatman filter paper. The filtrate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 50 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in the above solution to a final concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −78 °C. We used two II-III loop peptides corresponding to the Thr671–Leu690(peptide A) and Glu724–Pro760 (peptide C) regions of the II-III loop of the DHP receptor α1 subunit of the rabbit skeletal muscle (6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431A synthesizer employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as the α-amino protecting group. The peptides were cleaved and de-protected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. [3H]Ryanodine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant calpain II was purchased from Calbiochem. SAED was obtained from Pierce. The microsomes (1.0–2.0 mg/ml) were incubated in 0.1 ml of a reaction solution containing 10 nm [3H]ryanodine (68.4 Ci/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.15 m KCl, 1 mmBAPTA, various concentrations of CaCl2 (to create various levels of well defined Ca2+ concentration), and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 for 16 h at 22 °C in the presence of various concentrations of peptides and/or modulators. Samples were filtered onto glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/A) and washed three times with 5 ml (in each washing step) of distilled water. Filters were then placed in scintillation vials containing 10 ml of scintillation mixture Ecoscint A and counted in a Beckman LS 3801 counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the binding in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μm non-radioactive ryanodine. The assays were carried out in duplicate, and each datum point was obtained by averaging the duplicates. Site-specific fluorescent labeling of the peptide C binding site of the RyR moiety of the triad was performed using the cleavable heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent, SAED (20Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Google Scholar) in the following way. First, peptide-SAED conjugates were formed by incubating 0.5 mm peptide C with 0.5 mm SAED in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 60 min at 22 °C in the dark. The reaction was quenched by 20 mm lysine. Free SAED was removed using Sephadex G15 gel filtration. The peptide-SAED conjugate (∼5 μm) was mixed with 2 mg/ml triad protein in the sample solution (see “Preparation”) containing 1 mmBAPTA and various concentrations of CaCl2 (to create various levels of well defined Ca2+ concentration) and incubated for 5 min in the dark. Then the reaction mixture was photolyzed with UV light in a Pyrex tube at 4 °C for 2 min. β-Mercaptoethanol was added (100 mm final concentration) to cleave the disulfide bond of SAED. After incubation on ice for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 15 min, and the sedimented vesicles were re-suspended in the sample solution to a final protein concentration of ∼ 20 mg/ml. Fluorescence-labeled microsomes (1 mg/ml) were mixed with recombinant calpain II at the ratio of 6 units of calpain to 1 mg of SR protein in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. Digestion was started with the addition of 3 mm CaCl2. After the digestion for 6 min at 22 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 mm BAPTA. Fluorescence gel was illuminated with a 360-nm UV lamp through a UG-1 filter (Schott), and the images were obtained with a digital camera (Olympus C-2020) using a 440-nm interference filter with 40 nm of bandwidth. The fluorescence intensity was analyzed with NIH image software. To induce Ca2+ release by T-tubule depolarization, we employed the K+ to Na+replacement protocol, which was originally devised in the skinned fiber system by Lamb and Stephenson (21Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 495-517Google Scholar) and was adopted to our triad system (22Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Google Scholar). The T-tubule moiety (1.0 mg/ml) of the triad was first polarized by incubating in the base solution (150 mm potassium gluconate, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8) containing 5.0 mm MgATP, 100–150 μmCaCl2, and an ATP-regenerating system (2.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvic acid and 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase) for 10 min. Then the T-tubule moiety was depolarized by mixing in a stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4) 30 μl of the solution (Solution A) containing the polarized triads with 120 μl of depolarization solution (150 mm sodium gluconate, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8; Solution B). The time course of Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4 with a MOS-200 optical system; excitation at 440 nm, emission at 510 nm using an interference filter with 40 nm of bandwidth) using fluo-3 as a Ca2+indicator as described previously (13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 22Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Google Scholar, 23Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Google Scholar). Six to ten traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each experiment. To induce Ca2+ release triggered by several voltage-independent agonists of the RyR as a control, the microsomes (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing 0.15 mpotassium gluconate, 1 mm MgATP, 40–50 μmCaCl2, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, for 5 min for active Ca2+ loading. Then 1 volume of the above solution was mixed with 1 volume of a release solution containing 0.15 mpotassium gluconate, 5.0 μm fluo-3, 20 mmMES, pH 6.8, and various concentrations of peptide C or peptide A or both. The time course of SR Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4) using fluo-3 as a Ca2+ indicator as described previously (24El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Google Scholar). Six to ten traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each stopped-flow measurement, and several measurements were repeated for each experiment. In the experiment shown in Fig.3A and the upper part of Fig. 4, 30 μm BAPTA was added to Solution B. This concentration of BAPTA, together with an endogenous calcium, weakly buffered the [Ca2+] of the reaction mixture at 0.035 μm, as determined by calibration.Figure 4The fluorescence intensity of the MCA-labeled calpain fragments of the RyR (the 400-kDa band in the case of peptide A-mediated incorporation, and the 150-kDa band in the case of peptide C mediation) varies with the Ca2+ concentration at which the fluorescence labeling was performed.Upper panel, Coomassie Blue-stained gel picture,−calpain, microsomes before calpain digestion;+calpain, microsomes after calpain digestion (see “Experimental Procedures”). Upper panel,fluorescence gel picture, fluorescence labeling was performed at various Ca2+ concentrations adjusted by strong BAPTA-Ca buffers, followed by digestion with calpain II (“Experimental Procedures”). Lower panel, the fluorescence intensity of the incorporated MCA as a function of the Ca2+ concentration. The incorporated fluorescence was determined by densitometric scan of the gel and expressed as % maximal incorporation (taking the value at 1.0 μmCa2+ as 100%). The dotted line in the peptide C curve shows the peptide A curve as the reference. Note that the peptide A curve shows the essentially same Ca2+ dependence profile as that of enhancement of ryanodine binding by the peptide. However, the peptide C curve is less Ca2+-dependent, suggesting that peptide C-mediated MCA incorporation (or peptide C binding) consists of Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent components. The whole set of this experiment was repeated four times for the reproducible results. Error bar represents mean ± S.E. of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Most Ca2+ release time courses could be fitted by the equation: y = A {1 − exp (− k × t)}, where A is the maximum amount of Ca2+ release, k is the rate constant of Ca2+ release, and t is the reaction time; A*k gives the initial rate of Ca2+ release, because (dy/dt)t = 0 = A*k. For the calculation of the maximal rate of Ca2+ release in an early phase in the experiments shown in Fig. 3, A and B, in which some traces could not be fitted by an exponential equation, the release curve was fitted first by y = at5 + bt4 + ct3 + dt2 + et + f and then the rate was calculated from the maximal value of the dy/dt curve. Pairedt test was employed to determine the statistical significance. In our previous studies (6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 11El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar, 13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 14Ikemoto N. El-Hayek R. Sugi H. Pollack G.H. Mechanisms of Work Production and Work Absorption in Muscle. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 199-207Google Scholar), we reported that peptide A enhances ryanodine binding and induces a rapid Ca2+release, whereas peptide C antagonizes the activation of ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release by peptide A. However, most of our previous studies were carried out at [Ca2+]s higher than 0.2 μm; many experiments were carried out at or higher than 1.0 μm. Because the in vivo studies of E-C coupling described in the Introduction (3Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Google Scholar, 4Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Google Scholar, 16Proenza C. Wilkens C.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29935-29937Google Scholar) have been carried out probably in a rather low range of the [Ca2+], we decided to investigate the effects of peptide A and peptide C in a broad range of [Ca2+] (0.01–1.0 μm) with particular focus to the lower range of [Ca2+]. Fig.1, A and B shows the effects of 50 μm peptide A (a maximally activating concentration) on the ryanodine binding activity of the RyR of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle microsome preparations, respectively, at different Ca2+ concentrations in the assay solution. Incidentally, the Ca2+ of our assay solution is equivalent to the cytoplasmic Ca2+ in the case of the whole-cell system. In both cases of skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A) and cardiac muscle (Fig. 1B), the amount of ryanodine bound (in the absence of added peptides) decreased considerably upon decreasing the [Ca2+] (Fig. 1, A and B,upper panel) as is well known in the literature (25Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Google Scholar, 26Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Google Scholar). Presumably, this reflects the fact that the population of the Ca-bound RyR molecules (Ca-RyR), which is the species that binds ryanodine, decreases with the decrease in the [Ca2+]. In case of the skeletal muscle microsome preparation (Fig. 1A), 50 μm peptide A produced a significant (about 3-fold) enhancement of the ryanodine binding activity at all Ca2+concentrations examined. Interestingly, the relative magnitude of activation of the RyR by peptide A {(ryanodine bound in the presence of added peptide A)/(ryanodine bound in the absence of added peptide) in %} is essentially the same over the broad range of [Ca2+] from 0.01 to 1.0 μm, as shown in thelower part of Fig. 1A. In contrast to the above, the same concentration (50 μm) of peptide A produced virtually no effect on the ryanodine binding activity of the cardiac muscle microsome preparation at all Ca2+ concentrations examined as shown in Fig. 1B. These results indicate that peptide A activates the RyR1 (skeletal muscle isoform of the RyR) but not the RyR2 (cardiac muscle isoform of the RyR). As previously described (6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar), at a higher [Ca2+] (e.g. at 1.0 μm), peptide C produced no appreciable effect on the RyR, but if present together with peptide A, peptide C inhibited peptide A-induced activation of the RyR (i.e. peptide A-dependent enhancement of ryanodine binding, production of the active conformational state of the RyR and induction of SR Ca2+ release) in a concentration-dependent manner (6El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar). In the present study we carried out similar experiments in a broader range of the Ca2+ concentrations by using the skeletal muscle microsome preparation (Fig. 2A) and the cardiac muscle microsome preparation (Fig. 2B). In the experiments shown in Fig. 2A, we determined, at each of different [Ca2+]s (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 μm), the peptide C concentration dependence of the ryanodine binding activity of the RyR1 in the absence (left column) or in the presence of a maximally activating concentration (50 μm) peptide A (right column). To facilitate the comparison of the concentration-dependent activity patterns obtained at different [Ca2+]s, all data are expressed in the changes in the amount of ryanodine bound produced by the added peptide C at each [Ca2+] investigated. Peptide C alone (namely in the absence of added peptide A; see theleft column of Fig. 2A) produced no appreciable effect at [Ca2+] ≥0.1 μm, in agreement with our previous results. Interestingly, however, peptide C produced a small but statistically significant enhancement of ryanodine binding at 0.01 μm Ca2+. Thus, it appears that peptide C retains the ability to activate the RyR without requiring the Ca2+ (unlike peptide A; see above). When the data obtained in the presence of added peptide A are analyzed as a function of the [Ca2+] (Fig. 2A, right column), it reveals very interesting [Ca2+]-dependent dual (activation and inhibition) functions of peptide C. In agreement with our previous studies, at higher [Ca2+]s (0.3 and 1.0 μm), peptide C blocked peptide A activation in a concentration-dependent manner. At 0.1 μmCa2+ or at even lower [Ca2+]s (0.03 and 0.01 μm), peptide C produced an appreciable activation, in addition to peptide A activation (the maximally activating concentration of peptide C being 50–100 μm). Thus, it appears that at [Ca2+]s lower than 0.1 μm(i.e. sub-threshold Ca2+ concentrations for muscle contraction), either peptide A or peptide C works as an activator of the RyR, and if both work together they seem to produce additive activation effects. Fig. 2B shows the results of the same type of ryanodine binding experiments as shown in Fig. 2A except that the cardiac muscle microsome preparation was used in this case. Because the most prominent blocking and activation patterns of the RyR1 by peptide C were observed at the Ca2+ concentrations of 1.0 and 0.01 μm, respectively, we investigated the effects of peptide C on the RyR2 at these two Ca2+ concentrations. As seen in Fig. 2B, peptide C produced virtually no effects on the ryanodine binding activity of the RyR2 at both high and low Ca2+ concentrations (left column). Fig.2B also shows that even in the presence of 50 μm peptide A peptide C has no effect on the RyR2 at both Ca2+ concentrations (right column). Thus, it is concluded that the Ca2+-dependent dual functions of peptide C described here represent the events specific to the skeletal muscle isoform of the RyR. We previously reported that a chimeric peptide C, whose Gln726–Gly743 segment is a cardiac-type sequence, and the rest is a skeletal muscle-type sequence, showed much less blocking effect on peptide A activation at 1.0 μmCa2+ (13Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar). We found that the chimeric peptide C had virtually no activation effect at 0.03 and 0.01 μmCa2+ (data not shown). This indicates that the skeletal-type sequence in the Gln726–Gly743segment (approximately corresponding to the determinant region) is important for both activating (at low Ca2+) and blocking (at high Ca2+) functions of peptide C. The left panel of Fig.3A shows the time course of Ca2+ release from the skeletal muscle microsomes induced by various concentrations of peptide C alone at 0.035 μmCa2+ at weakly buffered conditions. 2Unlike the ryanodine binding assay, which permitted one to use strong BAPTA-Ca buffers, in the Ca2+release assay with fluo-3 we could use only a weak BAPTA-Ca buffer, but we calibrated the free Ca2+ concentration at the steady state of Ca2+ uptake (viz. at time 0 of the Ca2+ release reaction) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Importantly, peptide C induced Ca2+ release in a concentration-dependent manner. In agreement with the ryanodine binding data (see Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A), 100 μm peptide C produced about the same amount of Ca2+ release as produced by 10 μm peptide A. The addition of various concentrations of peptide C, together with 10 μm peptide A, produced additional Ca2+release again in a concentration-dependent manner (right panel of Fig. 3A). Fig. 3Bshows the time courses of Ca2+ release induced by various concentrations of peptide C"

We had previously prepared two sex-differential cDNA libraries and isolated male- and female-specific clones (3Domı́nguez P.

These are secretory organs from the orbital cavity related to the pineal gland and the gonads (38Olcese J. Wesche A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 93: 655-665Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Payne A.P. J.

Tech. 1996; 34: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The female harderian gland cDNA clone FHG22 was characterized in our laboratory and related to the UGB family as mentioned (3Domı́nguez P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The FHG22 mRNA was found to be expressed according to a tissue- and sex-specific pattern (3Domı́nguez P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) only in three hamster exocrine glands; the highest levels are observed in parotid glands from either sex, and FHG 22 mRNA is present in female but not in male harderian glands and presents higher expression levels in female than in male submaxillary glands. These sexual differences led us to develop studies on hormone regulation; estradiol stimulates FHG22 mRNA expression in harderian glands both in vivoand in vitro, whereas no effect is observed using other sex steroids (20Varriale B. Alvarez J. Prieto F. Domı́nguez P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 124: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the use of an antipeptide antiserum that specifically recognizes HGB.A, the product of the FHG22 mRNA, in monomeric or oligomeric form. HGB.A is the small subunit of a disulfide-bound heterodimer named heteroglobin (HGB), also formed by the large N-glycosylated subunit HGB.B. Sequencing of HGB.B enabled us to isolate two cDNAs corresponding to highly homologous isoforms (HGB.B1 and HGB.B2). HGB.A and HGB.B belong to different subfamilies of the SCGB family, and their mRNAs show a sex- and tissue-specific expression identical to that of HGB, but HGB.B2 is surprisingly absent in submaxillary glands. Male and female Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were obtained from Charles River (Kingston, NY) and maintained under controlled temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and photoperiodic conditions (14:10 h, light/dark cycle) with food and water ad libitum. The animals were sexually mature (about 4 months old) when used for experimentation. For preparation of tissue homogenates or RNA extraction, the animals were killed by suffocation with carbon dioxide, and the tissues were rapidly dissected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For the preparation of antipeptide antisera, outbred New Zealand male rabbits were maintained in controlled conditions for 40 days before the immunization protocol was started and bled when needed. Hamster saliva samples were obtained by inserting sterile cotton ear buds inside the animals' mouths and allowing them to chew for 2 min. The cotton plugs were removed, inserted into a bottom-cracked 0.5-ml tube placed inside a 1.5-ml tube, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Clarified saliva was collected, and the plugs were washed with one volume of buffer A (0.15m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of aprotinin in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and centrifuged. Finally, each sample of saliva and eluted buffer A was mixed and centrifuged again for 10 min to precipitate the remaining cells and debris. The protein concentration of each saliva sample (average value, 6 mg/ml) was measured by the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Cotton ear buds, bottom-cracked tubes, and buffer A were also used to collect samples of female hamster vaginal discharge. To obtain the homogenates from parotid, submaxillary, and harderian glands, the corresponding organs from at least 2 animals were dissected as mentioned, mixed, and homogenized with a Polytron in 2 volumes of an ice-cold solution containing freshly prepared buffer A. The preparations were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and each supernatant was collected and denominated parotid, submaxillary, or harderian homogenate. Protein concentration was measured as above (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), with average values of 19, 40, and 13 mg/ml for parotid, submaxillary, and harderian homogenates, respectively. These preparations were either used immediately or kept frozen at −70 °C until required. An identical preparation protocol was followed to obtain a thymus homogenate. The peptides CPAVLSVSKSFLFDKVEKFEC (FHG22-(24–55)), CEAVKAKVEVKKC (FHG22-(55–66)), and KMEMGKILAEVVGYCKGTEN (FHG22-(76–95)), corresponding to amino, central, and carboxyl sections of the FHG22 ORF (3Domı́nguez P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were synthesized with an AMS 422 automated multiple solid phase peptide synthesizer (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (44Atherton E. Sheppard R.D. Gross E. Meienhofer J. Peptides. 9. Academic Press, Inc., New York1987: 1-38Google Scholar). The peptides FHG22-(24–45) and FHG22-(55–66) contain an extra Cys with respect to the deduced sequence in the carboxyl and amino terminus, respectively, for coupling purposes. The three peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) via Cys using the linking agent Sulfo-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimido-methyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. These conjugates were used as antigens to induce production of antibodies against polypeptide HGB.A (see “Results”) by immunization of New Zealand rabbits. Animals were injected subcutaneously in multiple sites with a preparation containing 500 μg of the conjugate emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco) in a total volume of 1 ml. Two intramuscular boosts of 200 μg of the conjugated peptide emulsified with incomplete adjuvant were given 4 and 7 weeks later, and sera were collected 2 weeks after the last injection. For the preparation of sera, blood was extracted from each rabbit, left to coagulate, and centrifuged for 30 min at 2,000 × g. The antipeptide antisera were finally mixed with 1 volume of 87% glycerol, separated into aliquots, and stored at −20 °C. Denaturing protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to the method of Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For non-reducing SDS-PAGE, samples were mixed 3:1 with loading buffer containing 8% SDS, 8 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For reducing or semi-reducing SDS-PAGE, samples were mixed 3:1 with loading buffer and treated, respectively, with 1.4 or 0.14m β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were finally heated at 100 °C for 10 min, electrophoresed in 10% or 15% analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to nitrocellulose. The apparent molecular weight of protein bands was measured by interpolation from a linear semilogarithmic plot ofMr versus distance of migration using the MultiMark™ multi-colored mixture of protein standards (Novex, San Diego, CA). For Western blot analysis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gels to Duralose UV™ (Stratagene) essentially according to Towbin et al. (46Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and membranes were stained with 0.01% Ponceau S in 0.1% acetic acid to verify protein transference. Blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% fat-free milk powder for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated under the same conditions with antipeptide antiserum (1:2000) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After being found to be the only one able to detect polypeptide HGB.A (see “Results”), antiserum AF22P3 (anti-FHG22-(76–95)) was used for standard immunodetection. In the study of unpurified HGB deglycosylation, female hamster parotid, submaxillary, and harderian gland homogenates or saliva were digested with endoglycosidases to remove saccharides from the polypeptide chains, and the protein was then immunodetected with AF22P3. Briefly, the O-linked sugars were removed from proteins present in gland homogenates or saliva (40–80 μg of total protein/sample in adequate amounts to give similar band intensities) by incubating each of the samples in a total volume of 50 μl with 3 milliunits of neuraminidase plus 2 milliunits of O-glycosidase in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, for 18 h at 37 °C. Similarly,N-deglycosylation of the proteins was performed by incubating samples with 0.6 units of PNGase F and 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, in reaction volumes of 50 μl for 18 h at 37 °C. Control reactions were incubated under the same conditions but in the absence of enzymes. Samples were then analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by AF22P3 immunodetection. Complete removal of (N-linked) sugars from a purified parotid gland HGB preparation was achieved by incubating 10 μg of protein with PNGase F as described before but including 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol in the reaction mixture. The sample was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue as explained. The parotid glands from two female hamsters were extracted and treated as mentioned above to obtain the parotid homogenate from which the oligomer HGB was purified. The progress of purification was monitored by immunodetection of HGB.A with AF22P3 in the preparations and fractions obtained during the procedure. The parotid homogenate was first subjected to differential precipitation in ammonium sulfate at a temperature of 0 °C. The homogenate was brought up to 50% ammonium sulfate saturation, stirred for 1 h, and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min. The precipitate was discarded, and ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to reach 80% saturation, stirred, and centrifuged again as described. The precipitate was collected and resuspended in 3 volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and this preparation was called parotid 80–50 precipitate, with a protein concentration around 10 mg/ml. A precipitate sample (600 μl) was applied to an ion exchange chromatography DEAE-Sephacel (16/20) column coupled to a Gradifrac system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 18 ml/h, and the column was washed with 1 volume of equilibration buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 150 ml of a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions (3 ml each) containing immunodetected HGB.A were located at a protein peak eluting between 0.3 and 0.36 m NaCl and analyzed by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE; those showing contaminant proteins were discarded. Fractions of interest were pooled, dialyzed against 200 volumes of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, and finally resuspended in equilibration buffer to obtain a protein concentration around 5 mg/ml. Aliquots of this preparation were used for protein characterization by SDS-PAGE and amino acid sequencing of the subunits. Either 100 μg of parotid homogenate or 20 μg of purified HGB were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue as explained. Protein bands of interest were excised and in gel digestion with trypsin performed automatically in the Progest (Genomic Solutions) as explained (47Ploubidou A. Moreau V. Ashman K. Reckmann I. Gonzalez C. Way M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3932-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides (trim) were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (48Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G. Allescher H. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and sequenced in a 474 Procise peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To obtain a partial cDNA probe corresponding to the largest HGB subunit, two reactions of degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (49Lee C.C. Wu X. Gibbs R.A. Cook R.G. Muzuy D.M. Caskey C.T. Science. 1988; 239: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 50Girgis S.I. Alevizaki M. Denny P. Ferrier G.J.M. Legon S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 1610371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were prepared using a female hamster harderian gland cDNA library (37Domı́nguez P. Antolı́n I. Prieto F. Menéndez-Peláez A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 34: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) as template. The common sense primer was a 20-mer oligonucleotide mix (5′-GAYGAYGCNATHGCNAARAC-3′) including the codon choices for the internal heptapeptide DDAIAKT (see Table I), and the two antisense primers corresponded to sequences of the promoters SP6 (5′-TCAAGCTATGCATCAAGCTT-3′) or T7 (5′-ACGGCCAGTGAATTGTAATA-3′) flanking the multiple cloning site of the phagemid pcDNAII (Invitrogen). The amplification reactions were set at a final volume of 50 μl containing 1 μg of template DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and performed under the following conditions: an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min before the addition of the enzyme followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. The reaction corresponding to the SP6 primer produced a 350-base pair fragment that was isolated, subcloned into the plasmid pGEM-T (Promega), sequenced, and used as a probe in the screening of 5 × 103 colonies of the female hamster harderian gland cDNA library (37Domı́nguez P. Antolı́n I. Prieto F. Menéndez-Peláez A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 34: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Eight positive clones were isolated and completely sequenced from both ends, revealing the existence of two highly"
