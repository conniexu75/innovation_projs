Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been previously identified as a physiological target of Akt, which is inhibited by phosphorylation, so we have investigated the role of GSK-3 in cell survival. Overexpression of catalytically active GSK-3 induced apoptosis of both Rat-1 and PC12 cells, whereas dominant-negative GSK-3 prevented apoptosis following inhibition of PI 3-kinase. GSK-3 thus plays a critical role in regulation of apoptosis and represents a key downstream target of the PI 3-kinase/Akt survival signaling pathway.

The principal characterized physiological substrate of Akt is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (15Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar), which was initially identified as an enzyme that regulates glycogen synthesis in response to insulin (16Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is a ubiquitously expressed protein-serine/threonine kinase whose activity is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation. In addition to glycogen synthase, GSK-3 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, including several transcription factors and translation initiation factor eIF2B (16Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GSK-3 has also been implicated in the regulation of cell fate inDictyostelium (17Harwood A.J. Plyte S.E.

These studies suggest that GSK-3 is involved in multiple cellular processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and differentiation. Here we show that GSK-3 is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis, identifying it as a critical downstream element of the PI 3-kinase/Akt cell survival pathway. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. Rat-1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. PC12 cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes (3 × 105 cells/plate) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. On the next day the medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.5% horse serum. One day later, cells were stimulated by addition of 100 ng/ml of NGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5, 15, or 30 min with or without preincubation with 50 μm LY294002 (Biomol) or 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mg/ml glycogen, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 nm okadaic acid) for 20 min at 4 °C with constant rotation. The cell extracts were passed through a 27-gauge needle and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined, and 10 μg of protein were diluted to 150 μl by addition of immunprecipitation buffer (50 mmsodium glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 nm okadaic acid) and incubated with 0.375 μg of GSK-3β antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was added for 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose (60 μl of a 30% suspension) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed once with extraction buffer and twice with immunoprecipitation buffer. Kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated GSK-3 was assayed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 250 mm sodium glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 100 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 100 nm okadaic acid, 20 μm phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 (Upstate Biotechnology), and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi). After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 1 min, and 20 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. Filters were washed in four changes of 175 mm phosphoric acid for a total of 20 min, rinsed in acetone, dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. 3 × 105 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine treated coverslips in 35-mm plates 24 h before transfection. Transient transfections were performed with 1 μg of expression vectors using the LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type rat GSK-3 (pGSK3β) and catalytically inactive GSK-3 (pR85GSK3β) (21Dominguez I. Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Nalin, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals); dominant-negative PI 3-kinase (pΔp85) (24Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) is transcribed from the SRα promoter (provided by C. Rudd, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression construct (pEGFP-C1) (CLONTECH). After 2 days cells were fixed and nuclei were stained with the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258). Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence and scored for apoptosis by nuclear morphology. Previous studies have demonstrated that GSK-3 is inhibited as a result of growth factor stimulation and activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway in several cell types (15Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 25Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S.

We therefore sought to determine whether stimulation of cells with growth factors known to signal cell survival by suppression of apoptosis similarly resulted in inhibition of GSK-3 activity. Treatment of PC12 cells with NGF, which signals cell survival via the PI 3-kinase pathway (2Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), resulted in a 30–40% inhibition of GSK-3 activity (Fig. 1), which is similar to that reported in other cell systems (15Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 25Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S.

This inhibition of GSK-3 was prevented by preincubation with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 (28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and wortmannin (29Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 30Kanai F. Ito K. Todaka M. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Ishii K. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Ebina Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), indicating that NGF inhibition of GSK-3 was mediated by the PI 3-kinase pathway. Because GSK-3 was inhibited by PI 3-kinase signaling in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells, we investigated whether overexpression of active GSK-3 induced apoptosis. Both PC12 cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts, which are also dependent upon PI 3-kinase signaling for survival (3Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1995; 13: 343-351Google Scholar), were used as recipients in transient transfection assays. Cells were transfected with a construct expressing GFP and cotransfected with plasmids expressing either wild-type GSK-3β or catalytically inactive R85 GSK-3β cDNAs (21Dominguez I. Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) from the EF1α promoter (22Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy to detect GFP expression, and apoptotic cells were scored by nuclear morphology after staining with Hoechst dye. Fluorescence micrographs of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 2, and data from several experiments with both PC12 and Rat-1 cells are presented in Fig.3. Approximately 20% of either PC12 and Rat-1 cells were apoptotic in control cultures transfected either with the pEF1α vector alone or with catalytically inactive R85 GSK-3. In contrast, 60–70% of both cell types underwent apoptosis following transfection with wild-type GSK-3, similar to the percentage of cells that underwent apoptosis following transfection with wild-type p53. Thus, overexpression of active GSK-3 was sufficient to induce apoptosis.Figure 3Induction of apoptosis by overexpression of GSK-3. Cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Data are averaged from three experiments with PC12 cells and seven experiments with Rat-1 cells. Typically, 100–200 cells transfected with each vector were counted per experiment.

Cotransfection with a dominant-negative mutant of p53 (V143A) (23Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) protected cells from apoptosis induced by GSK-3, consistent with the involvement of p53 in apoptosis induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in both PC12 and Rat-1 cells (31Erhardt P. Tomaselli K.J. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15049-15052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis by GSK-3 was also blocked by a peptide inhibitor of CPP32-like caspases, which are effectors of cell death activated by diverse apoptotic stimuli (32Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar), including PI 3-kinase inhibition (4Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Erhardt P. Tomaselli K.J. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15049-15052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, apoptosis induced by GSK-3 was inhibited by cotransfection with plasmids expressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, which protect cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of agents, including inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (4Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by GSK-3 thus required caspase activity and was modulated by p53 and Bcl-2 family members, consistent with a role for GSK-3 as a downstream element in the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. We next sought to determine whether GSK-3 activity was required for apoptosis induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase. PC12 and Rat-1 cells were transfected with the catalytically inactive GSK-3 R85 mutant, which acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of GSK-3 activity (21Dominguez I. Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and then treated with the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 5). Treatment with LY294002 induced apoptosis of approximately 60% of control cells that had been transfected with the pEF1α vector alone. Transfection with the R85 GSK-3 mutant significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by LY294002 to levels of 30–40%, approaching the background level of 20% apoptosis observed in control cells that were not treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor. The activity of the R85 GSK-3 mutant in inhibiting apoptosis in these experiments was similar to that of dominant-negative p53. Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing dominant-negative PI 3-kinase (24Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) rather than being treated with LY294002 (Fig. 6). Expression of dominant-negative PI 3-kinase induced apoptosis in approximately 60% of transfected cells, and this was significantly inhibited by cotransfection with dominant-negative R85 GSK-3. Thus, GSK-3 activity was necessary for apoptosis resulting from PI 3-kinase inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that GSK-3 is a key target of PI 3-kinase signaling leading to prevention of apoptosis. Overexpression of active GSK-3 is sufficient to induce apoptosis, whereas expression of dominant-negative GSK-3 effectively protects cells from apoptosis resulting from inhibition of PI 3-kinase. Although other targets of the Akt protein kinase, including the Bcl-2 family member Bad (33Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 34Peso L.D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), may also be important in the regulation of cell survival, these findings implicate GSK-3 as a central element in the PI 3-kinase/Akt survival pathway, with phosphorylation of one or more targets of GSK-3 presumably serving to activate apoptotic cell death. Identification of the GSK-3 targets that regulate apoptosis thus poses a critical next step to understanding the signaling pathways by which growth factors control cell survival. We are grateful to I. Dominguez for GSK-3 plasmids, to C. E. Rudd for the dominant-negative PI 3-kinase plasmid, and to P. Erhardt for kind help and advice."
https://openalex.org/W1907919347,"The potent analgesic effects of cannabis-like drugs and the presence of CB1-type cannabinoid receptors in pain-processing areas of the brain and spinal cord indicate that endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide may contribute to the control of pain transmission within the central nervous system (CNS). Here we show that anandamide attenuates the pain behaviour produced by chemical damage to cutaneous tissue by interacting with CB1-like cannabinoid receptors located outside the CNS. Palmitylethanolamide (PEA), which is released together with anandamide from a common phospholipid precursor, exerts a similar effect by activating peripheral CB2-like receptors. When administered together, the two compounds act synergistically, reducing pain responses 100-fold more potently than does each compound alone. Gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry measurements indicate that the levels of anandamide and PEA in the skin are enough to cause a tonic activation of local cannabinoid receptors. In agreement with this possibility, the CB1 antagonist SR141716A and the CB2 antagonist SR144528 prolong and enhance the pain behaviour produced by tissue damage. These results indicate that peripheral CB1-like and CB2-like receptors participate in the intrinsic control of pain initiation and that locally generated anandamide and PEA may mediate this effect."

Individuals with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis, but not other forms of arthritis, generated responses to OspA, hLFA-1, and their highly related peptide epitopes.

https://openalex.org/W2029687074,"The hOGG1 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase that excises 8-hydroxyguanine (oh8Gua) from damaged DNA. Structural analyses of the hOGG1 gene and its transcripts were performed in normal and lung cancer cells. Due to a genetic polymorphism at codon 326, hOGG1-Ser326 and hOGG1-Cys326 proteins were produced in human cells. Activity in the repair of oh8Gua was greater in hOGG1-Ser326 protein than in hOGG1-Cys326 protein in the complementation assay of an E. coli mutant defective in the repair of oh8Gua. Two isoforms of hOGG1 transcripts produced by alternative splicing encoded distinct hOGG1 proteins: one with and the other without a putative nuclear localization signal. Loss of heterozygosity at the hOGG1 locus was frequently (15/23, 62.2%) detected in lung cancer cells, and a cell line NCI-H526 had a mutation leading to the formation of the transcripts encoding a truncated hOGG1 protein. However, the oh8Gua levels in nuclear DNA were similar among lung cancer cells and leukocytes irrespective of the type of hOGG1 proteins expressed. These results suggest that the oh8Gua levels are maintained at a steady level, even though multiple hOGG1 proteins are produced due to genetic polymorphisms, mutations and alternative splicing of the hOGG1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2075637141,"A human MSH2-human MSH3 (hMSH2·hMSH3) complex of approximately 1:1 stoichiometry (human MutSβ (hMutSβ)) has been demonstrated in several human tumor cell lines and purified to near homogeneity. <i>In vitro</i>, hMutSβ supports the efficient repair of insertion/deletion (I/D) heterologies of 2–8 nucleotides, is weakly active on a single-nucleotide I/D mispair, and is not detectably active on the eight base-base mismatches. Human MutSα (hMutSα), a heterodimer of hMSH2 and hMSH6, efficiently supports the repair of single-nucleotide I/D mismatches, base-base mispairs, and all substrates tested that were repaired by hMutSβ. Thus, the repair specificities of hMutSα and hMutSβ are redundant with respect to the repair of I/D heterologies of 2–8 nucleotides. The hMutSα level in repair-proficient HeLa cells (1.5 μg/mg nuclear extract) is approximately 10 times that of hMutSβ. In HCT-15 colorectal tumor cells, which do not contain hMSH6 and consequently lack hMutSα, the hMutSβ level is elevated severalfold relative to that in HeLa cells and is responsible for the repair of I/D mismatches that has been observed in this cell line. LoVo tumor cells, which are genetically deficient in hMSH2, lack both hMutSα and hMutSβ, and hMSH3 and hMSH6 levels are less than 4% of those found in repair-proficient cells. Coupled with previous findings (J. T. Drummond, J. Genschel, E. Wolf, and P. Modrich (1997) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i> 94, 10144–10149), these results suggest that hMSH2 partitions between available pools of hMSH3 and hMSH6 and indicate that hMSH2 positively modulates hMSH6 and hMSH3 levels, perhaps by stabilization of the polypeptides upon heterodimer formation."

Long-term research surveys on the continental shelf between the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and southern New England reveal that one of the largest skates in the northwest Atlantic, the barndoor skate (Raja laevis), is close to extinction. Forty-five years ago, research surveys on St. Pierre Bank (off southern Newfoundland) recorded barndoor skates in 10% of their tows; in the last 20 years, none has been caught, and this pattern of decline is similar throughout the range of the species."
https://openalex.org/W1995269929,"Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) are a heterogeneous class of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that are required for cellular differentiation and metabolism. Mutations in HNF-1alphaand HNF-4alpha genes impair insulin secretion and cause type 2 diabetes. Regulation of HNF-4/HNF-1 expression by HNF-3alpha and HNF-3beta was studied in embryoid bodies in which one or both HNF-3alpha or HNF-3beta alleles were inactivated. HNF-3beta positively regulated the expression of HNF-4alpha/HNF-1alpha and their downstream targets, implicating a role in diabetes. HNF-3beta was also necessary for expression of HNF-3alpha. In contrast, HNF-3alpha acts as a negative regulator of HNF-4alpha/HNF-1alpha demonstrating that HNF-3alpha and HNF-3beta have antagonistic transcriptional regulatory functions in vivo. HNF-3alpha does not appear to act as a classic biochemical repressor but rather exerts its negative effect by competing for HNF-3 binding sites with the more efficient activator HNF-3beta. In addition, the HNF-3alpha/HNF-3beta ratio is modulated by the presence of insulin, providing evidence that the HNF network may have important roles in mediating the action of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2018415306,"Protein trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus involves specific uptake into coat protein complex II (COPII)–coated vesicles of secretory and of vesicle targeting (v-SNARE) proteins. Here, two ER to Golgi v-SNAREs, Bet1p and Bos1p, were shown to interact specifically with Sar1p, Sec23p, and Sec24p, components of the COPII coat, in a guanine nucleotide–dependent fashion. Other v-SNAREs, Sec22p and Ykt6p, might interact more weakly with the COPII coat or interact indirectly by binding to Bet1p or Bos1p. The data suggest that transmembrane proteins can be taken up into COPII vesicles by direct interactions with the coat proteins and may play a structural role in the assembly of the COPII coat complex."

Lysin evolves rapidly by positive Darwinian selection. Evolution of the egg receptor for lysin provides the selective pressure for lysin's divergence. The egg receptor for lysin is a tandemly repeated sequence that evolves by concerted evolution. Concerted evolution in the egg receptor could explain the rapid, adaptive evolution in sperm lysin and may provide an underlying molecular mechanism that gives rise to species-specific fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2315523562,"Telomerase is the RNA-protein complex which elongates telomeric DNA (TTAGGG)n and appears to play an important role in cellular immortalization. The almost exclusive expression of telomerase in tumor cells, and not in most normal cells, offers an exciting opportunity for therapy by inhibiting its function. Here, we have investigated the effect of inhibition of telomerase on the growth and survival of human malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo by using a 19-mer antisense oligonucleotide against human telomerase RNA linked to a 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A). 2-5A antisense functions by activating the endoribonuclease, RNase L, resulting in the degradation of single stranded, targeted RNA. We have shown that the 2-5A antisense treatment effectively suppressed tumor cell growth and survival in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of tumors grown in nude mice with the antisense oligonucleotide inhibited survival of the tumor cells. TUNEL assays suggest that this effect is mediated through the induction of apoptosis. Targeting telomerase RNA with 2-5A antisense, therefore, may represent an effective and novel approach for treatment of a broad range of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2045362754,"Lizard and spider populations were censused immediately before and after Hurricane Lili on islands differentially affected by the storm surge. The results support three general propositions. First, the larger organisms, lizards, are more resistant to the immediate impact of moderate disturbance, whereas the more prolific spiders recover faster. Second, extinction risk is related to population size when disturbance is moderate but not when it is catastrophic. Third, after catastrophic disturbance, the recovery rate among different types of organisms is related to dispersal ability. The absence of the poorer dispersers, lizards, from many suitable islands is probably the result of long-lasting effects of catastrophes."
https://openalex.org/W2326870974,"Loss of normal p53 function was found frequently to interfere with response of cancer cells to conventional anticancer therapies. Since more than half of all human cancers possess p53 mutations, we decided to explore the involvement of mutant p53 in drug induced apoptosis. To further evaluate the relationship between the p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic pathways, and to elucidate the function of mutant p53 in modulating these processes, we investigated the role of a p53 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant in a number of apoptotic pathways induced by chemotherapeutic drugs that are currently used in cancer therapy. To that end, we studied the M1/2, myeloid p53 non-producer cells, and M1/2-derived temperature-sensitive mutant p53 expressing clones. Apoptosis caused by DNA damage induced with γ-irradiation, doxorubicin or cisplatin, was enhanced in cells expressing wild type p53 as compared to that seen in parental p53 non-producer cells; mutant p53 expressing clones were found to be more resistant to apoptosis induced by these factors. Actinomycin D, a potent inhibitor of transcription, as well as a DNA damaging agent, abrogated the restraint apoptosis mediated by mutant p53. These observations suggest that while loss of wild type p53 function clearly reduces the rate of apoptosis, p53 mutations may result in a gain of function which significantly interferes with chemotherapy induced apoptosis. Therefore, to achieve a successful cancer therapy, it is critical to consider the specific relationship between a given mutation in p53 and the chemotherapy selected."

https://openalex.org/W1604932745,"In lymphocytes, DNA recombinations that generate the antigen-receptor genes can sometimes be reinduced in receptor-bearing cells in a process called receptor editing, which modifies the specificity of the receptor for antigen. In immature B lymphocytes, B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signalling stimulates immune tolerance by receptor editing1,2,3,4,5. More mature splenic B cells can also be induced to undergo V(D)J recombination, which generates diversity in the immune system, either by immunization with foreign proteins6,7,8,9 or by stimulation in vitro with interleukin-4 and lipopolysaccharide8,9,10. Here we show that immune tolerance is unlikely to induce V(D)J recombination in mature B cells, because BCR ligation actively inhibits V(D)J recombination induced by interleukin-4 and lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, immunization of immunoglobulin transgenic mice with ligands of varying avidities for the BCR showed that low-avidity antigen could induce strong V(D)J recombination, whereas non-binding or high-avidity ligands could not. These data suggest that V(D)J recombination induced during the immune response modifies the antigen receptors of B cells with weak, but not strong, reactivity to antigen, potentially rescuing cells with improved receptor affinity and promoting their contribution to the immune response. Thus BCR signalling regulates V(D)J recombination in both tolerance and immunity, but in strikingly different ways."

https://openalex.org/W2111599730,"Measurements and theoretical calculations are reported for an interatomic multi-atom resonant photoemission (MARPE) effect that permits direct determination of near-neighbor atomic identities (atomic numbers). MARPE occurs when the photon energy is tuned to a core-level absorption edge of an atom neighboring the emitting atom, with the emitting level having a lower binding energy than the resonant level. Large peak-intensity enhancements of 33 to 105 percent and energy-integrated effects of 11 to 29 percent were seen in three metal oxides. MARPE should also be sensitive to bond distance, bonding type, and magnetic order, and be observable via the secondary processes of x-ray fluorescence and Auger decay."
https://openalex.org/W2334870905,"The ets genes family encodes a group of proteins which function as transcription factors under physiological conditions. We report here that the Erg proteins, members of the Ets family, form homo and heterodimeric complexes in vitro. We demonstrate that the Ergp55 protein isoform forms dimers with itself and with the two other isoforms, Ergp49 and Ergp38. Using a set of Erg protein deletion mutants, we define two distinct domains independently involved in dimerization. The first one is located in the amino-terminal part of the protein containing the pointed domain (PNT), conserved in a subset of Ets proteins. The second one resides within the ETS domain, the DNA-binding domain. We also show that the Erg protein central region behaves as an inhibitory domain of dimerization and its removal enhances the Ergp55 transactivation properties. Furthermore, Ergp55 forms heterodimers with some other Ets proteins. Among the latter, we show that Fli-1, Ets-2, Er81 and Pu-1 physically interact with Erg. Finally, we show that the formation of the previously described ternary complex Ergp55/Fos/jun is mediated by ETS domain and Jun protein, while the ternary complex Ergp49/Fos/Jun is mediated by Fos protein."

To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which RA alters cell growth, we analysed the expression and activity of components of the cell cycle machinery after culture in RA. Within 2 days of RA treatment and prior to the arrest of NB cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, there is a complete downregulation of G1 cyclin/Cdk activities. Protein levels for the G1 cyclin/Cdks were essentially unchanged during this time although there was a decrease in the steady-state levels of p67N-Myc and hyperphosphorylated Rb proteins. The Cdk inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were constitutively expressed in KCNR while p15INK4B and p16INK4A were not detected. RA induced an increase in the expression of p27Kip1 but not p21Cip1. Furthermore, coincident with the decrease in kinase activity there was an increase in G1 cyclin/Cdk bound p27Kip1. These results indicate that changes in the level of p27Kip1 and its binding to G1 cyclin/Cdks may play a key role in RA induced growth arrest of NB cells."

We further refined somatic mapping on 10q23-tel and simultaneously assessed the role of the candidate tumor suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC1 in glial neoplasms by sequence analysis of eight low-grade and 24 high-grade gliomas. These tumors were selected for partial or complete loss of chromosome 10 based on deletion mapping with increased microsatellite marker density at 10q23-tel. Three out of eight (38%) low-grade and 3/24 (13%) high-grade gliomas exclusively target 10q25-26. We did not find a tumor only targeting 10q23.3, and most tumors (23/32, 72%) showed large deletions on 10q including both regions. The sequence analysis of PTEN/MMAC1 revealed nucleotide alterations in 1/8 (12.5%) low-grade gliomas in a tumor with LOH at l0q21-qtel and in 5/21 (24%) high-grade gliomas displaying LOH that always included 10q23-26. Our refined mapping data point to the 10q25-26 region as the primary target on 10q, an area that also harbors the DMBT1 candidate tumor suppressor gene. The fact that we find hemizygous deletions at 10q25-qtel in low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas - two histologically distinct entities of gliomas - suggests the existence of a putative suppressor gene involved early in glial tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041419803,"Several melanomas, carcinomas, glioblastomas and leukemias showed coordinated expression of HOXB7 and bFGF with exception of the SkBr3 mammary carcinoma that was negative for both. Transduction of HOXB7 gene into SkBr3 cells, induced bFGF expression, increased growth rate, independence from serum withdrawal and ability to form colonies in semisolid medium. ELISA assay showed that most of bFGF was associated to cell lysate when cells were cultured at 1% serum whereas in cells kept to 10% serum bFGF was detected both within cell lysate or secreted into cell supernatants. Antisense oligos to bFGF inhibited the growth of cells cultured in 1%, indicating that beside the possible activation of additional genes other than bFGF by HOXB7 transduction, only bFGF induction accounts for the observed results. Moreover, since inhibition of cell proliferation occurred in cells kept in 1% but not 10% serum, a bFGF intracrine loop appears operative in serum starved SkBr3/HOXB7 cells. Also, these results further indicate bFGF as target of HOXB7."

It is likely that the functional diversity exhibited by the neuronal nACh receptor family results from the differential expression of these subunits which leads to incorporation of different subunits into mature receptors. Although the consequences of this diversity are beginning to be appreciated, an understanding of the molecular basis governing expression of neuronal nACh receptor subunits remains elusive. However, recent advances indicate that regulation of the receptor subunit genes at the level of transcription plays a critical role (see below). In situ hybridization studies have demonstrated that each of the nACh receptor subunit genes exhibits distinct temporally and spatially restricted patterns of expression in the peripheral and central nervous systems, suggesting that they are most likely regulated independently (although in some cases there is overlap in expression patterns which may indicate that such genes share certain regulatory features, as discussed below; Ref. 2Patrick J.

We would like to understand the molecular details of this regulated expression. We have focused upon characterizing the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the expression of a cluster of receptor subunit genes, those encoding the α3, α5, and β4 subunits. This cluster of genes spans approximately 60 kilobase pairs of the rat genome (see Fig. 1 and Ref.37Boulter J. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G. Wada E. Jensen A. Gardner P.D.

Because the α3, α5, and β4 subunits make up the predominant nACh receptor subtype expressed in the peripheral nervous system (38Conroy W.G. Berg D.K. J. Biol.

It is certainly plausible that these genes are expressed coordinately via a set of common regulatory mechanisms. On the other hand, neither the temporal nor the spatial patterns of expression of the α3, α5, and β4 subunit genes are completely identical. Although the developmental and functional implications of these temporal and spatial differences in gene expression are unclear, they underscore the conclusion that each gene of the cluster has unique aspects to its regulation. Previously we identified several regulatory elements within the promoter region of the β4 gene and demonstrated that these elements interact specifically with nuclear proteins present in extracts prepared from brain tissue and an established neuronal cell line, SN17 (22Hu M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Another element, E2, interacts with the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 (30Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A.

An intact E2 is required for transcriptional activation of the β4 promoter by Sp1 and Sp3 (31Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because E1 and E2 are immediately adjacent to one another and both are required for wild type β4 promoter activity, we postulated that the proteins that bind to the elements interact to regulate β4 gene expression (31Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification of the E1-binding protein NARP65 (34Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and demonstrate that it affects the transactivation of β4 promoter activity by Sp1 and Sp3 differentially. The E1-binding protein, NARP65, was purified from crude nuclear extracts prepared from bovine brains as described previously (34Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, after partial purification by P11 phosphocellulose chromatography, fractions containing E1 binding activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed for further purification by two rounds of DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography. Two 20-base complementary oligonucleotides containing the E1 sequence (5′-GACCCTCCCCTCCCCTGTAA-3′; see Fig. 1) were used to make the DNA affinity matrix. Annealed, concatenated oligonucleotides were coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) essentially as described by Kadonaga and Tjian (40Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). After the DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography, fractions containing E1 binding activity were pooled, precipitated with acetone, and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After staining with Brilliant Blue R-250 (Fisher Biotech) and destaining, NARP65 was excised, washed with 50% methanol, and subjected to amino acid microsequencing (Harvard Microsequencing Facility) as described previously (41Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The E1/E2 oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) used as probes and competitors in the EMSA were synthesized using an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman). Single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to either the coding or noncoding strand of E1/E2 were labeled radioactively with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). When double-stranded probes were used, equal amounts of E1/E2 complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and then labeled radioactively. The specific activities of these probes were typically between 5,000 and 15,000 cpm/fmol. A glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-hnRNP K fusion construct was generously provided by Dr. David Levens (National Cancer Institute). Expression and purification of GST and GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins were carried out as described previously (42Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from transfectedDrosophila cells were prepared by the method of Dignamet al. (43Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) as described previously (44Melnikova I.N. Christy B.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1067-1079PubMed Google Scholar) except that nuclear extracts were dialyzed against binding buffer of composition 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100 μmZnCl2. When using recombinant proteins, EMSAs were performed as described previously (22Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with radiolabeled double- or single-stranded oligonucleotides incubated with the indicated amounts of GST or GST-hnRNP K in the presence of 2 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC). For competition experiments, unlabeled double- or single-stranded oligonucleotides were preincubated with the recombinant proteins for 15 min before the addition of labeled oligonucleotides. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed through 6% native polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. When using nuclear extracts as protein sources, EMSAs were performed using a 32P-labeled double-stranded E1/E2 oligonucleotide (Fig.1) and 3.5 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from transfected SL2 cells. Reaction mixtures containing nuclear extracts, binding buffer, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of 5 fmol of the end-labeled probe. After addition of the probe, binding reactions were incubated further for 15 min at room temperature. Reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed through 6% native polyacrylamide gels. Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. The Sp1 expression construct pActSp1, containing the Sp1 coding sequence inserted downstream of theDrosophila melanogaster actin 5C promoter, was generously provided by Dr. Ed Seto (University of South Florida; Ref. 45Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The Sp3 expression construct pPacUSp3, containing the Sp3 coding sequence inserted downstream of the actin 5C promoter, was kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske (Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany; Ref.46Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The pAct-hnRNP K expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning the mouse hnRNP K coding sequence from pCRII-hnRNP K (the kind gift of Dr. Karol Bomsztyk, University of Washington) into the pAct vector. TheEcoRI fragment containing the mouse hnRNP K coding sequence was isolated from pCRII-hnRNP K, treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligated subsequently to EcoRV-digested pAct to generate the construct pAct-hnRNP K. SN17 cells (47Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (22Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). D. melanogasterSchneider SL2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained at room temperature in modified Schneider's Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were seeded at 2 × 106/35-mm culture well immediately before transfection. DNAs were introduced into the cells by liposome-mediated transfection using 9 μl of CellFECTIN/sample (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.75 μg of target DNA (pX1B4FHwt, see Fig. 1) in the absence or presence of 5, 10, or 50 fmol of effector DNA (pActSp1, pPacUSp3, or pAct-hnRNP K). The target DNA constructs were also transfected with the vectors pAct and pPacU devoid of Sp1 and Sp3 coding sequences, respectively, as negative controls for luciferase expression. All transfections included 0.23 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector, RSV-βGal, in which expression of the bacteriallacZ gene is driven by a Rous sarcoma viral promoter. After a 5-h incubation with the DNA-CellFECTIN complexes, the cells were overlaid with 0.5 ml of medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 24 h. The next day, the cells were overlaid with 2 ml of complete growth medium. After another 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available kit (Promega Corp.). Luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity, which was measured using a commercially available kit (Galacto-Light; Tropix, Inc.). For nuclear extract preparation, SL2 cells were transfected essentially as described above, except that transfections were carried out in 100-mm culture dishes, and only the effector DNAs were introduced into the cells (pActSp1, pPacUSp3, or pAct-hnRNP K). Western blotting was performed essentially as described before (31Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 1 μl of an SN17 cell extract and 10 μg of nuclear extracts isolated from untransfected or transfected SL2 cells were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%). Anti-hnRNP K antibody 3C2 (the kind gift of Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Ref. 48Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution in Blotto. Experiments utilizing anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were done as described previously (31Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies led to the identification of two regulatory elements, E1 and E2, located between nucleotides −54 and −81 relative to the β4 transcriptional initiation site (Fig. 1; Refs. 21Hu M. Whiting Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, E2 is a binding site for members of the Sp family of transcriptional regulatory factors (30Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Biochemical purification from bovine brain tissue of nuclear proteins that bind to E1 led to the identification, in the most highly purified fraction, of four polypeptides that interact specifically with E1 (34Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of these proteins, NARP43, was shown by amino acid sequence analysis to be the transcriptional regulator, Purα (34Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have now obtained amino acid sequences of two tryptic peptides of another E1-binding protein, NARP65. The sequences of these peptides are identical to two regions of the hnRNP K coding sequence (Fig. 2; Ref.48Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), thus establishing NARP65 as the bovine homolog of hnRNP K. Recently hnRNP K has been shown to be a transcriptional activator, a function that is dependent upon its binding to a CT element (42Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 49Tomonaga T. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4875-4881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). hnRNP K binds both single- and double-stranded nucleic acids, having a higher affinity for the former (for review, see Ref. 50Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, E1 is characterized by three repeats of 5′-CCCT-3′. To determine whether hnRNP K interacts with the E1/E2 region, EMSAs were carried out using a GST-hnRNP K fusion protein and both single- and double-stranded E1/E2 probes. As shown in Fig.3, hnRNP K interacts specifically with both the double-stranded E1/E2 probe and the upper strand (coding) E1/E2 probe, but not at all with the lower strand (noncoding) E1/E2 probe. As seen most clearly with the coding strand E1/E2 probe, two specific protein-DNA complexes are formed, with the most prominent complex migrating the fastest. The presence of two complexes is most likely a consequence of oligomerization of hnRNP K, as has been reported previously (62Denisenko O.N. O'Neill B. Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27701-27706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Competition experiments demonstrated that unlabeled double-stranded E1/E2 competed very little for binding to the single-stranded coding E1/E2 probe, whereas unlabeled single-stranded coding E1/E2 virtually eliminated hnRNP K binding to the double-stranded probe (Fig. 3). Unlabeled single-stranded noncoding E1/E2 did not compete for binding to either the single-stranded coding or double-stranded E1/E2 probes, consistent with the observation that the single-stranded noncoding E1/E2 probe did not form any specific complexes with hnRNP K (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that hnRNP K interacts specifically with the E1/E2 region and that the protein appears to have a higher affinity for the single-stranded CT-rich coding E1/E2 probe, as has been reported for hnRNP K binding sites in other genes (50Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test the potential functional significance of hnRNP K on β4 promoter activity, it was necessary to identify a suitable cell line in which to carry out transfection studies. Because high endogenous levels of hnRNP K may complicate interpretation of transfection results, it was desirable to identify a cell line that either does not express hnRNP K or expresses it at very low levels. Two cell lines that we have used extensively in the past to study β4 gene expression are the neuronal cell line SN17 and theDrosophila Schneider SL2 cell line (21Hu M. Whiting Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine the expression levels of hnRNP K in these cell lines, Western blot analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig.4, SN17 cells express relatively high levels of hnRNP K, but SL2 cells do not express any detectable hnRNP K protein. However, when transfected with an expression construct producing mouse hnRNP K under the control of the Drosophilaactin 5C promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”), SL2 cells expressed readily detectable levels of exogenous hnRNP K protein (Fig.4, lane 3). Therefore, we chose SL2 cells to perform functional analysis of hnRNP K effects on β4 promoter activity. To investigate whether hnRNP K has any effect on the transcriptional activity of the β4 promoter, SL2 cells were transfected with a wild type β4 promoter/luciferase expression construct (pX1B4FHwt; see Fig. 1) and with increasing amounts of an expression construct for hnRNP K (pActMK) or of the parental vector (pAct) as a control. Surprisingly, given that hnRNP K has been shown to function as a transcriptional activator by virtue of its interaction with a 5′-CCCT-3′ recognition site similar to that of E1 (50Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), hnRNP K had no effect on β4 promoter activity in this assay (Fig.5). Our earlier work demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 interact with the E2 element, which is immediately adjacent to E1 (Fig. 1) in the β4 promoter (see Fig. 1; Refs. 30Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardn"
https://openalex.org/W2168808627,"Optically pumped nuclear magnetic resonance (OPNMR) measurements were performed in two different electron-doped multiple quantum well samples near the fractional quantum Hall effect ground state ν = 1/3. Below 0.5 kelvin, the spectra provide evidence that spin-reversed charged excitations of the ν = 1/3 ground state are localized over the NMR time scale of about 40 microseconds. Furthermore, by varying NMR pulse parameters, the electron spin temperature (as measured by the Knight shift) could be driven above the lattice temperature, which shows that the value of the electron spin–lattice relaxation time τ 1s is between 100 microseconds and 500 milliseconds at ν = 1/3."

Combining these derivatives with the derivatives that were measured for the bulk modulus and thermal expansion of MgSiO3 perovskite provided data that suggest lower mantle compositions between pyrolite and C1 carbonaceous chondrite and a lower mantle potential temperature of 1500 +/- 200 kelvin."

In hopes of reconciling these findings, we compared the results obtained from cells disrupted by our method (nitrogen cavitation) with those obtained using the cell-disruption method employed by others (homogenization). We observed that at 2 h, cytochrome c levels in apoptotic cytosols from homogenized cells exceeded control levels, whereas cytochrome c levels in apoptotic cytosols fromcavitated cells were similar to control. Outer membranes of homogenized mitochondria appeared damaged because the mitochondria had become permeable to cytochrome c, whereas outer membranes of cavitated mitochondria excluded the cytochrome. 4 h after Fas ligation, both cavitated and homogenized mitochondria had released small amounts of cytochrome c into the cytosol, whereas after 6 h the cytochrome had disappeared from the cell lysate. We believe that the differences between our results and those reported by others were due to 1) our examining the cells after a short (2 h) incubation with the anti-Fas antibody, and 2) our use of nitrogen cavitation instead of homogenization to disrupt the cells.

Apoptosis comprises a series of events that occur in response to the activation of a program found in most cells whose purpose is to kill the cell without releasing its contents into the extracellular environment. The events of apoptosis usually include among other things the breakdown of the genome into nucleosomal fragments (i.e.fragments that are integral multiples of ∼200 base pairs); the activation of the caspases, a family of proteases that cleave a limited set of proteins (e.g. poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, lamin B, fodrin) on the C-terminal side of an aspartate residue; the cross-linking of actin, and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. Ultimately the apoptotic cell sheds its substance by blebbing, and the released fragments are taken up and degraded by mononuclear phagocytes. The involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis was first suggested by the discovery that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is found in the mitochondrial outer membrane (1Hockenberry D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar, 2Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A later report attributed apoptosis to the release of apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space because of the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in cells undergoing apoptosis (3Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). We ourselves found that cytoplasm from apoptotic cells contains cytochrome c inactivating factor of apoptosis, a substance that within minutes eliminates the ability of cytochromec to transfer electrons to cytochrome oxidase (4Krippner A. Matsuni-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Most recently it was shown that cytochrome c, in collaboration with APAF-1, the mammalian homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans death protein Ced-4, assists in the activation of the caspases (5Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 6Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). There is, however, an unsettled question concerning the participation of cytochrome c in apoptosis. Several laboratories have reported that during apoptosis, some of the cytochrome is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol where it exerts its effect on the caspases (7Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 8Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

For our study we measured cytochrome c spectrophotometrically, but others measured the cytochrome by immunoblotting. In hopes of reconciling these findings, we re-examined the distribution of cytochromec in apoptotic cells using immunoblotting to quantify the cytochrome. Anti-Fas antibody (clone CH-11) was purchased from Kamiya Biomedicals, Thousand Oaks, CA, anti-cytochrome c antibody from Pharmingen, San Diego, and F(ab′)2 anti-mouse and anti-rabbit (human-adsorbed) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Caltag, Burlingame CA. Jurkat cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamate to a density of 106 cells/ml. For use, they were pelleted and resuspended in serum-free medium at 4 × 107 cells/ml, then incubated at 37 °C with or without 0.5 μg/ml anti-Fas IgM for the indicated lengths of time. The cells were then washed in ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, then divided into 2 groups, one for disruption by N2 cavitation and the other for disruption by homogenization in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. For N2 cavitation, the cells were washed with MA buffer (100 mm sucrose, 1 mmEGTA, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), bovine serum albumin 1 g/liter) then resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in MB buffer (MA buffer plus 10 mm triethanolamine, 5% Percoll, and an antiproteinase mixture consisting of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, each at 10 μm, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were then disrupted by N2 cavitation as described elsewhere. For homogenization, the cells were pelleted and resuspended at 2 × 108cells/ml in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted by homogenization by the method of Yang et al. (8Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Lysates prepared by either method were centrifuged twice at 2500 ×g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells then at 25,000 × g for 30 min to isolate mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was spun at 100,000 × gfor 30 min to yield cytosol, which was saved, and membrane particles, which were discarded. The mitochondria were suspended in MC buffer (identical to MA buffer except that the sucrose concentration was 300 mm and an antiprotease mixture was included that consisted of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, each at 10 μm) and used for measuring oxygen consumption and cytochrome ccontent. In the preparation of mitochondria, all steps were carried out at 4 °C. To quantify apoptosis, cells were fixed with 4% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with acridine orange, and then evaluated for nuclear condensation and fragmentation under a fluorescent microscope as described previously (10Duke R.C.

Apoptosis was determined before the cells were divided into 2 groups for disruption. Integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane was determined by measuring cytochrome oxidase activity using reduced cytochromec as substrate as described elsewhere (4Krippner A. Matsuni-Yagi A.

Cytochrome c oxidation was followed for the first 3 min of the reaction, an interval during which the reaction rate was constant. The cytochrome c content of the supernatants and mitochondria was analyzed by immunoblotting. Cytosol (100 μg) and mitochondria (25 or 50 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gels, using Laemmli buffers) (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), blotted onto nitrocellulose, and blocked with BLOTTO. Blots were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-cytochrome c antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. The blots were then scanned using a Hewlett-Packard Scan-Jet 4C/T, and the cytochrome c bands on the scans quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI using ImageQuant software. We felt that it was important not only to try to repeat our own results, but also to see if we could reproduce the results obtained in other laboratories. One difference between our work and that of other groups was the method used for preparing mitochondria. Our method involved disrupting the cells by nitrogen cavitation in a buffer free of potassium, whereas the other groups used homogenization in a potassium-containing buffer to prepare their mitochondria. To see if these methodological differences might account for the differences in results among the various laboratories, we disrupted control and apoptotic cells by both methods and examined the cytochromec content of the particulate and cytosolic fractions by immunoblotting. The results (Fig. 1 and Table I) indicated that at 2 h, when almost half the anti-Fas-treated cells showed apoptotic nuclei, there was no significant difference between the cytochrome ccontent of control and apoptotic cytosols obtained by nitrogen cavitation, whereas apoptotic cytosols from homogenized cells consistently contained more cytochrome c than the corresponding control cytosols.Table ICytochrome c in cytosols from control and apoptotic cells disrupted by N2 cavitation or homogenizationApoptosisCytosolic cytochromecMitochondrial cytochrome cCavitateHomogenateCavitateHomogenate% control% controlAnti-Fas treated45.0 ± 5.078.4 ± 13.0191.4 ± 12.697.3 ± 6.575.6 ± 6.8(n = 3)(n = 6)(n = 3)(n = 3)Control2.8 ± 0.3100100100100SignificanceNSaNS, not significant.p < 0.002NSp < 0.05Apoptosis was measured in the cell populations before they were divided and subjected to disruption.

To determine whether the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria prepared from homogenized cells was a result of the homogenization procedure or of the relatively minor differences in the composition of our buffer versus the buffers used in the other studies, we examined cytochrome c release in cells homogenized in each of the two buffers. The results (TableII) showed that the amounts of cytochromec released into the cytosol of anti-Fas-treated cells were similar in the two buffers, suggesting that the difference in cytochrome c release between the cavitated and homogenized samples was because of the cell disruption procedure rather than the buffers.Table IICytochrome c in cytosols from control and apoptotic cells disrupted by homogenization in two different buffersCytochromec in cytosolK+-free bufferK+-containing buffer% controlAnti-Fas-treated179.5 ± 23.6158.4 ± 19.7Control100100The experiments were carried out as described above, and are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three separate determinations using cytosol from different cells.

At later times, the release of a small amount of cytochromec into the cytosol during apoptosis was seen even in cells disrupted by nitrogen cavitation. TableIII shows the amount of cytochromec in cavitated cytosols from cells treated for 2 and 4 h with anti-Fas, as compared with cytochrome c from control cells incubated for similar lengths of time. The results showed that cytochrome c levels were similar in the 2 h cytosols, but that at 4 h the amounts of cytochrome c in apoptotic cytosols exceeded that in the control cytosols. At 6 h, however, cytochrome c had largely disappeared from the mitochondria of apoptotic cells and was undetectable in their cytosol, though the cytochrome c distribution in the control cells was unchanged from earlier times (not shown).Table IIICytochrome c in cytosols in control and apoptotic cells as a function of timeCytochrome c in cytosols2 h4 h% controlAnti-Fas treated91 ± 24166 ± 7Control100100Experiments were carried out as described in the text and are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

Volumes of the control bands ranged from 235 to 1,178 PhosphorImager units. Finally, experiments were carried out to assess the integrity of the outer membrane in mitochondria prepared from nitrogen-cavitated or homogenized cells. This was accomplished by determining whether exogenous cytochrome c had access to cytochrome oxidase, as measured by the ability of the cytochrome to pass electrons to cytochrome oxidase. The results (TableIV) showed that the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c by mitochondria from nitrogen-cavitated cells was barely detectable in the absence of digitonin, a steroid that permeabilizes the outer mitochondrial membrane, but was brisk when digitonin was present in the assay mixture. In contrast, mitochondria from homogenized cells were able to oxidize cytochrome c in the absence of digitonin at more than 50% the rate seen in the presence of digitonin. These findings indicate that in the nitrogen-cavitated mitochondria the outer membranes were essentially intact, although they were extensively disrupted in the homogenized mitochondria.Table IVOxidation of cytochrome c by mitochondria in the absence and presence of digitoninNo digitoninDigitonin addedPermeabilitypmol/min/μg protein%N2-cavitated Control6.7 ± 3.974.2 ± 33.95.5 ± 1.1 Anti-Fas2.6 ± 1.592.1 ± 34.63.8 ± 2.1Homogenized, K+ absent Control62.3 ± 23.060.1 ± 13.7103.8 ± 16.4 Anti-Fas52.9 ± 7.350.5 ± 15.8104.6 ± 22.5Homogenized, K+ present Control27.9 ± 7.653.2 ± 9.252.5 ± 5.5 Anti-Fas35.9 ± 1.050.6 ± 1.070.9 ± 3.3Assay mixtures contained 2.3 to 21.5 mg of mitochondria protein, 25 nmol of reduced cytochrome c and MES buffer (0.1m MES, pH 6.0, 10 μm EDTA), plus or minus 5 μl of 10% (w/v) digitonin, in a total volume of 800 μl.

These means were determined by averaging the fractions calculated from each separate experiment. The foregoing results suggest that at least in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells, cytochrome c remains associated with the mitochondria during the first 2 h of apoptosis, by which time nearly 50% of the cells show the nuclear changes of apoptosis. Despite these results, our earlier findings and the findings from other laboratories clearly indicate that the interaction between cytochromec and the other mitochondrial components is altered in some fundamental way in apoptotic cells. This is shown both by the defunctionalization of the cytochrome in apoptotic mitochondria and by the greater ease with which the cytochrome is displaced from such mitochondria as compared with its behavior in control mitochondria, as indicated by the results obtained when the cells were homogenized instead of cavitated. Elucidating the basis for this alteration is likely to lead to novel insights into the mechanism of apoptosis. It is clear that in a cell-free system under appropriate conditions, cytochrome c is able to activate caspases, implying that it can perform this function in intact cells undergoing apoptosis. The results reported here are not in conflict with this idea. Our results do suggest, however, that in our system, cytochromec-dependent caspase activation has to take place in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. For this to occur, it is likely that an apoptosis-dependent change in the properties of the outer mitochondrial membrane must take place so that APAF-1 and the procaspases can gain access to the cytochrome. Consistent with this idea, we have reported an increase in the permeability of the outer membrane of mitochondria isolated from apoptotic cells, whereas Wang and co-workers found that during apoptosis, the serine-threonine kinase Raf is transferred to the outer mitochondrial membrane (13Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Blood. 1996; 88 (abstr.): 449Crossref Google Scholar). Further studies of the outer membrane of apoptotic mitochondria are currently in progress in our laboratory.

Deletion of the insert had no effect on either the activity of MEK1 or on its ability to bind to Raf-1. Both wild type and constitutively active MEK1 coimmunoprecipitated with Raf-1 whether or not the insert was present.

The proline-rich insert enhanced the ability of an otherwise equally active MEK1 protein to regulate endogenous ERKs in mammalian cells. Overexpression of either constitutively active MEK1 lacking the insert or ERK2 compensates for the weaker in vivo activity of the MEK1 deletion mutant. Expression of the insert in cells reduced activation of ERKs by EGF.

The upstream components include the isoforms of the protein kinase Raf and the MAP/ERK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. The three kinase cascade is regulated by GTP ligation of Ras. GTP-bound Ras binds to Raf with high affinity and causes Raf translocation to the membrane where it is activated. MEK activity was originally discovered by Ahn and Krebs by fractionating lysates of stimulated and unstimulated cells and mixed resulting fractions to identify ERK activators (3Ahn N.G. Robbins D.J.

Subsequently, MEKs were purified by this group and others, and the two isoforms that activate ERK1 and ERK2 were cloned and expressed (5Seger R. Seger D. Lozeman F.J. Ahn N.G. Graves L.M.

Reconstitution experiments using purified MEK1 and MEK2 and ERK1 and ERK2 have demonstrated the quantitative activation of these MAP kinases requires only MEKs (9Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H.

Similarly, in vitroactivation of MEK1 and MEK2 by Raf isoforms has been confirmed (11Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol.

When introduced into mammalian cells these activated MEK mutants increased ERK activity and induced effects associated with activation of the Ras/ERK pathway, such as transformation of fibroblasts, development of tumors in nude mice, and outgrowth of neurites in PC12 cells (14Mansour S.J.

The multienzyme MAP kinase cascade allows for amplification, because MEK1 and MEK2 are present in considerable excess of Raf. However, the MEKs and ERKs in this pathway are present at roughly equal concentrations and in some cells MEKs are in excess (16Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This suggests that the MEK to ERK step exists not for amplification but for kinetic regulation (17Chi-Ying F.H. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The presence of this step also provides additional mechanisms for sensing coincident and distinct regulatory inputs (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). MEK1 and MEK2 contain a proline-rich insert in the C-terminal domain of the kinase catalytic core that is not present in any other known MEK family members either in higher eukaryotes or in yeast. This insert contains phosphorylation sites for proline-directed and other protein kinases and is phosphorylated in intact cells (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In vitro, MEK1 is phosphorylated in this insert by ERKs, Cdk2, and the p21-activated kinase PAK1, among others (12Mansour S.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that a MEK1 point mutant lacking one of these phosphorylation sites no longer forms complexes with endogenous Raf. In a follow-up study they deleted the proline-rich insert from MEK1 and found that it was no longer efficiently activated in cells nor did it cause transformation (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the polyproline insert of MEK1 was involved in interaction with the Ras-Raf complex, presumably through direct binding to Raf. More recently, Frostet al. (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) found that mutation of other phosphorylation sites in this proline-rich insert also reduced Raf-MEK binding, further supporting the idea that changes in the MEK1 proline-rich insert modulate coupling to Raf. In this study we deleted the proline-rich insert of MEK1 and expressed it as a separate polypeptide with the aim of demonstrating that the insert directly binds to Raf. In addition, we examined its effects on activation of ERKs in vitro. Deletion of the proline-rich insert from a constitutively active form of MEK1, MEK1 R4F, had little effect on its in vitro protein kinase activity or its ability to coimmunoprecipitate with Raf-1, but significantly impaired its ability to activate ERKs in mammalian cells. Our findings are consistent with two conclusions. First, although phosphorylation within the proline-rich insert modulates binding of MEK to Raf, it is not the site of the interaction. Second, the polyproline insert of MEK1 is required for its efficient activation of downstream ERKs in cells. Recombinant His6-K52R ERK2 and active ERK2 were expressed and purified as described (9Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

To delete the proline-rich insert, residues 265–301, fragments encoding the N- and C-terminal sequence were created by PCR using pRSETA MEK1 R4F as template, digested, and ligated into pGEXKG to produce pGEXKG MEK1 R4FΔins. A similar approach was used to generate MEK1Δins. Restriction sites were incorporated during PCR to facilitate subcloning into other vectors. The MEK1 insert, corresponding to amino acids 265–301, was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEXKG and pEBG. All PCR products were sequenced to confirm correct amplification. Recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose followed by Mono Q. Amounts of recombinant MEK1 proteins were quantitated by immunoblotting with antibodies to the N and C termini of MEK1, followed by 125I-labeled secondary antibodies.

The beads were washed with 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) plus 0.1 mNaCl followed by 0.25 m Tris-HCl and resuspended for kinase assay. Immunoblots probed with the above antisera were developed with the Amersham ECL kit. MEK activity was measured in 50 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP (1–15 cpm/pmol) containing 50 μg/ml recombinant K52R ERK2 at 30 °C for 30 min using purified or immunoprecipitated kinase associated with 10 μl of protein-A-Sepharose beads. The reactions were stopped with sodium dodecyl sulfate-loading buffer. ERK activity was measured using myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate in 30 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP (1 cpm/fmol) at 30 °C for 30 min (24Xu S.

To examine the interactions mediated by the proline-rich insert, it was important to demonstrate that deletion of the insert did not influence MEK activity. Therefore, we determined the impact of the proline-rich insert on the in vitro kinase activity of MEK1. Because it had been reported that deletion of the insert prevented activation of MEK1 by Raf (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we initially studied the properties of a constitutively active form of MEK1 in the absence of this insert. We deleted 37 amino acids (residues 265–301 of human MEK1) from the constitutively active mutant MEK1R4F and expressed MEK1R4F and MEK1R4FΔins as histidine-tagged proteins in bacteria. MEK1R4FΔins displays a marked increase in electrophoretic mobility concomitant with deletion of the proline-rich domain. Recognition of MEK1R4FΔins with antibodies to both termini, along with sequencing of the mutant cDNA, confirms that the apparent size of the protein is correct and due neither to inadvertent mutations nor to proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 1 A). The activities of MEK1R4F and R4FΔins to phosphorylate and to activate ERK2 were compared using K52R ERK2 as substrate. The activities of MEK1R4F and the mutant lacking the proline-rich insert were consistently within 20% (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, deletion of the insert had little or no effect on the ability of MEK1 to activate ERK2 in vitro. Based on their in vitro activities, we expected that both MEK1R4F and MEK1R4FΔins would cause equal activation of ERKs in cells. Their expression in transfected cells was equivalent, based on immunoblotting lysates with antibodies to both the N terminus (not shown) and the C terminus of MEK1 (Fig.2 A). The absence of the proline-rich domain was confirmed by blotting the transfected lysates with an antibody that recognizes the MEK1 insert (A2227); a signal was detected only from MEK1R4F, not from MEK1R4FΔins (Fig.2 B). To assess the effects of these MEK mutants on activity of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2, the lysates were immunoblotted with an antiserum that recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2 and with an affinity purified antibody that selectively recognizes the doubly phosphorylated, high activity forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (23Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of ERK1 and ERK2 were present in aliquots from each lysate (Fig. 2 C). In lysates from cells transfected with MEK1R4F the anti-active ERK antibody recognized both ERK1 and ERK2, whereas in cells transfected with the control vector, neither band was visible. MEK1R4FΔins also caused a detectable enhancement of ERK1 and ERK2 activity, based on immunoreactivity; however, the activation was much reduced relative to that elicited by MEK1R4F (Fig. 2 D). Immunoblotting results were confirmed by measuring MAP kinase activity in lysates using MBP as substrate. MEK1R4F caused a 2.5-fold increase, whereas MEK1R4FΔins caused a 1.2-fold increase in the MBP kinase activity (data not shown). Immune complex kinase assays of ERK2 revealed similar changes in activity (Fig. 2 E), with effects of MEK1R4F and MEK1R4FΔins 5-fold and less than 1.5-fold, respectively. Because the transfection efficiency was ∼10%, the MBP kinase activity included a large contribution of basal activity from the untransfected cells; thus, changes in MBP kinase activity appeared smaller than those detected by immunoblotting. To determine whether greater expression of MEK1R4FΔins could achieve ERK activation equivalent to that produced by MEK1R4F, increasing amounts of the MEK1R4FΔins-encoding vector were transfected into cells. Expression of high levels of MEK1R4FΔins stimulated ERK activity to the same extent as did smaller amounts of MEK1R4F (not shown). These results suggested that the insert may increase the efficiency of coupling of MEK and ERK in cells. To test this possibility we cotransfected cells with MEK1R4F or MEK1R4FΔins, without or with ERK2, to determine whether ERK2 overexpression could overcome the reduced efficacy of MEK1R4FΔins. Transfected ERK2 was activated nearly as well by MEK1R4FΔins as by MEK1R4F (Fig.3 A). These findings support the notion that the efficiency of the activation reaction is increased in cells by the presence of the MEK1 proline-rich insert. The data further indicate that the reduced efficiency can be overcome by increasing the amount of either MEK or ERK. It is possible that the insert mediates direct binding of MEK to ERK or that it binds other proteins that affect MEK-ERK coupling. The latter is more likely, because an ERK binding site has been identified in another region of MEK1 (30Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments were performed to determine whether the proline-rich insert blocked activation of ERKs by ligands. A GST fusion protein containing the 37-amino acid insert reduced the peak activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by EGF in proportion to the transfection efficiency of the cells (Fig. 3 B). Because the MEK1 insert contains known phosphorylation sites, we tested its phosphorylationin vitro by several protein kinases (Fig.4). ERK2 and PAK1 phosphorylated the MEK1 insert, whereas MEKK1, MEK1, and MEK2 did not. This is consistent with phosphorylation of the intact protein on S298 by PAK1 and on T292 by ERK2 and other protein kinases (12Mansour S.J. Resing K.A. Candia J.M. Hermann A.S. Gloor J.W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MEK1 insert is phosphorylated in mammalian cells in a manner that alters MEK activity, MEK1R4F and MEK1R4FΔins were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells, and their activities were compared before and after treatment with phosphoprotein phosphatase 2a. The activities of these immunoprecipitated MEK mutants were within experimental error, despite the finding that ERK activity was always greater in cells transfected with MEK1R4F (Fig.2 F). Treatment with phosphatase 2a had no effect on the activity of either MEK1R4F or MEK1R4FΔins, consistent with the lack of an activity-modifying phosphorylation of the MEK1 insert in cells under the conditions examined. An original aim was to determine whether the MEK1 proline-rich insert binds to Raf. Therefore, we measured the ability of MEK1R4F with and without the insert to coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous Raf-1. HA-MEK1R4FΔins and HA-MEK1R4F were transiently expressed in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Antibodies against the C terminus of MEK1 were used to show that equivalent amounts of HA-MEK1R4F and HA-MEK1 R4FΔins were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5 A). Endogenous Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with both forms of MEK1R4F, as assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-Raf-1 antibody (Fig.5 B). To confirm that the enhanced activity of the MEK1Δins mutant did not account for its interaction with Raf, perhaps through a feedback phosphorylation by ERKs, we examined the ability of wild type MEK1 and MEK1Δins to coprecipitate with Raf-1. Again we found that Raf-1 was associated with MEK1 whether or not it contained the proline-rich insert (Fig. 5 C), although wild type MEK1 bound to Raf less well than did MEK1R4F. These data suggest that the proline-rich insert is not the Raf-1 binding site. To determine whether the proline-rich insert bound to Raf in the absence of the MEK1 catalytic core, the insert-GST fusion protein was overexpressed in 293 cells. Lysates were incubated with glutathione beads. Proteins associated with the beads were separated on gels and immunoblotted with antibodies against Raf-1. Under these conditions, Raf-1 binding to the insert could not be detected (not shown). Because MEK1 lacking the insert coimmunoprecipitated with Raf-1, we tested the ability of wild type MEK1 with and without the insert to be activated by growth factors and Raf. Previously published work suggested that without the insert MEK1 would be poorly activated (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Contrary to expectations, the time courses and extents of activation of wild type MEK1 and MEK1Δins by EGF were identical (Fig. 5 D). As confirmation that the cells were equally responsive to EGF, activation of endogenous ERKs was monitored. In cells transfected with MEK1 or MEK1Δins, ERKs were equally activated by EGF (not shown). We also tested the ability of a constitutively activated Raf-1 mutant S259D to activate MEK1 when they were cotransfected. Again, we found that both wild type MEK1 and MEK1Δins were activated to a similar extent (not shown). MEK1 and MEK2 contain a proline-rich insert that is not present in any of the other known MEK family members. This insert is phosphorylated in intact cells and mutation of at least two different insert phosphorylation sites diminishes the ability of MEK1 to associate with Raf-1 in cell lysates (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 19Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the insert is necessary for cell transformation (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To understand the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effect of removing the MEK1 polyproline insert on MEK activity, its binding to Raf, and its ability to activate ERKs in cells. We find that deletion of the insert has no effect on the activity of MEK1, either in vitro or isolated from cells, and, in contrast to earlier suggestions, removing the insert has no effect on the Raf-1 binding of MEK1. Both wild type and constitutively active MEK1 coimmunoprecipitate with Raf-1 whether or not the insert is present, indicating that the insert is not required for MEK-Raf binding. In support of this conclusion, the insert alone did not bind Raf in lysates. Apparently the phosphorylation or mutation of residues such as Thr292 and Ser298 within the insert can influence MEK1-Raf-1 binding either positively or negatively. Mutation of Thr292 to Ala inhibited the association of MEK1 with Ras-Raf complexes (19Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A decrease in Raf binding was noted for MEK1 mutants with both Ser298 and Thr292 mutated to Ala (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser298 by PAK1 enhances the activation of MEK1 by Raf and growth factors, indicating that the proline insert modulates MEK1 function in cells (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of effect of deleting the proline-rich insert on binding of MEK1 to Raf, deletion of the insert does not reduce activation of MEK1 by EGF or activated Raf in cells. Catling et al. (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that a similar MEK1 deletion protein was not activated by Raf or growth factors. Perhaps the difference in behavior of these MEK1 deletion mutants is because of the difference in the residues that were excised. The previously described MEK1 deletion mutant removed residues 270–307 (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We also found that the insert increases the efficiency of activation of downstream ERKs by MEK1. Factors in addition to the enzyme, MEK1, and the substrate, ERK2, apparently assist in the coupling of this kinase cascade in mammalian cells. Weber and colleagues reported that constitutively active MEK1 with the proline-rich sequence transformed fibroblasts, whereas constitutively active MEK1 without the proline insert did not (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In that study, however, the activity of the endogenous MAP kinase was not measured. Here we show directly that the proline-rich insert unique to MEK1 and MEK2 enhances the ability of an otherwise equally active MEK protein to regulate endogenous ERKs in mammalian cells. The finding that overexpression of either MEK1R4FΔins or ERK2 compensates for the weaker in vivoactivity of the proline-rich deletion mutant suggests that the intracellular process mediated by the proline-rich insert increases the effective concentration of the substrate ERK2. The reduced activation of ERKs in cells expressing the insert alone supports this interpretation. Perhaps the insert binds to Ste5p-like scaffolding proteins that affect MEK-ERK coupling (31Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 32Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7762-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). An alternative might be that the insert is modified or interacts with other factors in a manner that further increases MEK activity. In either case, the reduced ability of MEK1R4FΔins to activate ERKs is consistent with the reduced ability of a constitutively active MEK1 mutant with a similar but not identical deletion to transform cells (21Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2074613316,"Loss of function of the tumour suppressor gene p53 is a key event in most human cancers. Although usually occurring through mutation, in some tumour types this appears to be achieved via an indirect mechanism involving inappropriate expression of a functional inhibitor, mdm2, which binds to the transactivation domain of p53. This interaction offers an ideal potential target for novel cancer therapies. However, therapeutic specificity may depend on the extent to which this p53-inhibitory action of mdm2 is also required by normal cells. Transgenic data have already established that mdm2 is needed to prevent embryonic lethality, but the situation in adult cells is still unclear. Here we show that micro-injection of normal human fibroblasts with an antibody directed against the p53-binding domain of mdm2 induces expression of p53-responsive genes, and furthermore results in p53-dependent growth arrest. We conclude that normal cell proliferation can be dependent on negative regulation of p53 by mdm2, a finding which raises an important note of caution for mdm2-directed cancer therapies."

Excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain is predominantly mediated by members of the glutamate receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels, which have been grouped into three distinct subfamilies, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPAα-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionateNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartateNTAnitrilotriacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHOChinese hamster ovary. receptors, the kainate receptors, and the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (1Gasic G.P. Hollmann M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 507-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Among the glutamate receptors, the NMDA receptor has gained particular interest because of a number of unique properties that classify this ligand gated ion channel as a coincidence detecting molecule in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (2Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors are highly permeable to Ca2+ (3Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1987; 394: 501-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), they are regulated by a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block (4Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B. Nature. 1984; 309: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar), and simultaneous binding of both glutamate and the co-agonist glycine is required for efficient activation of NMDA receptors (5Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 6Kleckner N.W. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Prolonged stimulation resulting in high Ca2+ influx causes neuronal cell death, which has been implicated in anoxic-ischemic injury and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders (7Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding site for the co-agonist glycine is a target for site-specific NMDA receptor antagonists, which are proved to be neuroprotective in animal stroke models (8Hasegawa Y. Fischer M.

Structural analysis of the NMDA receptor was initiated by expression cloning of the NMDA receptor subunit NMDAR1 (NR1 or ζ). Subsequently, additional cDNAs including eight NR1 splice variants (NR1a to NR1h) and different isoforms of a second type of NMDA receptor subunits (NR2A-D, ε1–4) were identified (reviewed in Ref. 9Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). At the N terminus of both, the NR1 and NR2 subunits, a cleavable leader sequence is followed by a long extracellular domain and, in the second half of the polypeptides, four hydrophobic membrane domains (M1–M4). The M1, M3, and M4 segments are transmembrane spanning, whereas segment M2 is thought to form a reentrant loop that lines the ion channel (9Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). The NR1 subunit is expressed throughout the central nervous system, and immunohistochemistry has shown that the different NR2 subunits display more restricted, though overlapping, temporal and regional expression patterns (10Wenzel A. Scheurer R.K. Fritschy J.M. Möhler H. Benke D. NeuroReport. 1995; 7: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Functional and regional heterogeneity of NMDA receptors is therefore thought to result from differential assembly of the NR1 subunit with one or more members of the NR2 subunit family (11Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldan L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar,12Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Despite considerable progress in the molecular analysis of NMDA receptors, the structural basis for their properties is largely unknown, because the three-dimensional structure of these transmembrane proteins has not been solved. Therefore, mutational analysis combined with heterologous expression studies have been employed to identify channel-forming segments (13Kuner T. Wollmuth L.P. Karlin A. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

We and others have used site-directed mutagenesis to localize the glycine and glutamate binding sites of the NMDA receptor to a segment preceding M1 (S1) and a second region in between M3 and M4 (S2) of the NR1 and NR2 subunits, respectively (15Kuryatov A.

Upon expression, using the baculovirus system, this glycine-binding protein revealed properties resembling those of the native NMDA receptor glycine binding site. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that the NR1 subunit is sufficient for the formation of a glycine binding site and offer a potential strategy for determining the three-dimensional structure.

Benzonase was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemicals were of reagent grade, obtained primarily from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Sf9 cells were supplied by ATCC (Rockville, MD). High Five cells were from Invitrogen. Cell culture medium ingredients were either from Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc. Sf900II medium and ExCell405 medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or Biozol, respectively. Modified baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold) was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). For the construction of the recombinant transfer vector pVLMelFlagNR1S1S2H6, aBamHI/KpnI-DNA fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction encoding a His6-tagged NR1S1S2 receptor fragment was inserted into the vector pVLMelFlag (24Lenhard T. Maul G. Haase W. Reiländer H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The construct (see Fig. 1 A) was verified by restriction analysis as well as DNA sequencing. Details for recombinant baculoviruses production, insect cell culture, and immunoblot analysis are given in Refs.25Grünewald S. Haase W. Reiländer H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15149-15161Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H.

High Five cells were grown in suspension culture to a cell density of 3 × 106 cells/ml and infected with recombinant baculovirus VLMelFlagNR1S1S2H6. Four days after infection, cells were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed (1000 × volume) against of buffer 1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol). Subsequently, 90–125 ml of the dialyzed protein solution was loaded onto a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column (2–10 ml; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) that had been equilibrated with buffer 1. The column was washed with buffer 1 until theA280 base line was reached. Elution of the bound proteins were performed with a gradient of 0–300 mmimidazole in buffer 2 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Oligomeric S1S2 proteins were separated by size exclusion chromatography or sucrose density gradient centrifugation on a 9–41% (w/v) sucrose gradient. This gradient was generated by underlayering 3.6 ml of 15% sucrose in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, with 300 μl of 60% sucrose in a SW60 Ti tube followed by freezing (−70 °C) and thawing (4 °C), and the gradient was formed. After loading a sample of purified protein, the gradients were run in a SW60 Ti rotor at 48,000 rpm for 13.5 h. Fractions of 280 μl, each, were analyzed for S1S2 protein by immunoblot analysis with the anti-Flag M2 antibody. The positions of the following marker proteins run in parallel were determined by respective enzyme assays: β-galactosidase, 15.92 S; catalase, 11.3 S; lactate dehydrogenase, 6.95 S; malate dehydrogenase. 4.32 S; cytochrome c, 1.8 S. Gel filtration was performed on a Superose 12 PC column using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) under the following conditions: 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, at 4 °C with a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Samples (50 μl) were applied in flow buffer at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Binding assays were performed with volumes of 50–250 μl containing about 1.5 μg of protein of purified S1S2 protein. Saturation measurements with [3H]MDL105,519 were done at 22 °C for 60 min in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5. After incubation, free and bound ligand were separated by filtration through NC 45 membrane filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 mm glycine. All measurements were performed in duplicate and repeated two to three times. Ligand competition assays with glycine, d-serine, and 7-chlorokynurenic acid were performed in the presence of 10 nm[3H]MDL105,519 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands at 4 °C for 20 min using the same filtration conditions as above. Binding data were analyzed using a nonlinear curve fitting procedure (KaleidaGraph, Abelbeck Software). To examine whether the S1 and S2 domains of the NR1 subunit can generate a soluble glycine binding polypeptide, the expression vector pVL93MelFlagNR1S1S2H6 was constructed. As shown in Fig.1 A, the construct included amino acids Thr368 to Thr543 of the S1 domain and, interconnected via a 13-amino acid spanning linker (21Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), amino acids Asp640 to Asn794 of the S2 domain of the NR1 subunit. This S1S2 cassette was N-terminally fused to the prepromelittin signal peptide to ensure proper secretion through the endoplasmatic reticulum pathway. Additionally, the S1S2 construct was tagged with a Flag epitope at the N terminus, and with a His6-tag at the C terminus, for immunological detection and purification of the recombinant protein. After co-transfection of Sf9 insect cells with the BaculoGold virus and pVL93MelFlagNR1S1S2H6 plasmid DNA, recombinant baculoviruses were identified and analyzed as described (25Grünewald S. Haase W. Reiländer H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15149-15161Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The characterized virus was propagated, and infection of Sf9 cells with this recombinant baculovirus VLMelFlagNR1S1S2 resulted in efficient production of the fusion protein, as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.1 B). Five bands in the molecular mass range of 41–53 kDa were detected in infected cells with the monoclonal antibody M1, whereas only one prominent band of about 53 kDa was detected in the cell culture supernatant. In addition, a protein band of about 90–100 kDa, which might represent a dimer of the expressed protein, could be detected in the cell extracts (Fig. 1 B). The predicted molecular mass of the recombinant fusion protein is 41.4 kDa; to investigate whether the observed bands of 43–53 kDa might correspond to posttranslational modification products, we grew the infected insect cells in the presence of tunicamycin, which inhibitsN-linked glycosylation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, treatment with tunicamycin eliminated polypeptide species in the 43–53 kDa range; only a single band of 41–42 kDa and its putative dimer of about 90–100 kDa were detected by the anti-Flag M1 antibody. The size difference of about 11–12 kDa is in agreement with the expected presence of up to five oligosaccharide chains at the five potentialN-linked glycosylation sites predicted by the amino acid sequence. We therefore conclude that the higher molecular mass bands seen in the infected cells represent different glycosylation states of the recombinant protein and that the fully glycosylated protein was secreted more efficiently into the cell culture medium. For purification of the heterologously produced fusion protein, the cell culture supernatant of infected High Five cells was harvested 3 days after infection with baculovirus VLMelFlagNR1S1S2H6 and, after dialysis, loaded onto a nickel-NTA affinity column. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a linear imidazole gradient, and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with M2 antibody. As shown in Fig.2 the S1S2 fusion protein (53 kDa) was specifically enriched by the metal ion affinity chromatography. Immunoblot analysis disclosed the presence of multimerized S1S2 polypeptides and in particular putative SDS-resistant dimers in fractions with high S1S2 protein concentration. Further purification of the fusion protein was performed using a M1 antibody affinity column (data not shown). To further investigate the oligomerization of the S1S2 polypeptide indicated by the presence of SDS-resistant complex in SDS-PAGE, sucrose density gradient centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography was performed on the protein fractions eluted from the nickel-column. Sedimentation analysis on sucrose gradients (Fig.3 A) revealed different oligomerization states of the S1S2 protein. Besides a protein complex of high molecular mass (>450 kDa) sedimenting to the bottom of the gradient, an additional peak could be detected at gradient positions between the peak fractions of marker enzymes with S values of 4.32 S (malate dehydrogenase, 70 kDa) and 6.9 S (lactate dehydrogenase, 134 kDa). Interestingly, in fractions that corresponded to higher molecular masses, putative SDS-resistant S1S2 oligomers could be seen (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the results from sucrose gradient centrifugation, different oligomerization states were also found by size exclusion chromatography. Here, a high molecular mass fraction could be separated from a multiphasic peak fraction with a maximum at an elution volume corresponding to a molecular mass of about 100 kDa. The absorption spectra (280 nm) of fractions were nearly superimposable with column run in the presence or absence of 2 mmdithiothreitol (data not shown); thus intermolecular disulfide bridges seem not to be responsible for the oligomer formation by the S1S2 protein. To establish the functional integrity of the NR1 S1S2 fusion protein produced in insect cells, its binding affinity for the glycine site antagonist [3H]MDL105,519 (28Baron B.M. Siegel B.W. Harrison B.L. Gross R.S. Hawes C. Towers P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar, 29Siegel B.W. Sreekrishna K. Baron B.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was determined. For these assays, protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography as described above, and saturation analysis was performed using 0.78–50 nm [3H]MDL105,519 (Fig.4 A). Binding was saturable with a Kd of 5.22 ± 0.13 nm and aBmax of 100 pmol/mg protein as calculated by nonlinear regression (n = 2) (Fig. 4 A). Scatchard transformation of the data indicated that binding of the antagonist to the purified protein was best described by a model assuming a single class of equivalent and independent binding sites (Fig. 4 A). The dissociation constant determined is in good agreement with results obtained for the binding of this glycine antagonist to membrane-bound NMDA receptor (Kd = 3.77 nm) (28Baron B.M. Siegel B.W. Harrison B.L. Gross R.S. Hawes C. Towers P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of glycine, d-serine, l-glutamate, and 7-chlorokynurenic acid to compete for binding of [3H]MDL105,519 to the purified protein is shown in Fig.4 B. l-Glutamate (1 and 10 mm) had no effect on radioligand binding (data not shown); inhibition constants (Ki) of 27 ± 5.2 μm for glycine, of 10.7 ± 7.3 μm for d-serine, and of 0.71 ± 0.15 μm for 7-chlorokynurenic acid were calculated from the inhibition curves. The Ki values determined for glycine and d-serine for the S1S2 fusion protein resembles those obtained for homomeric NR1 receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells, i.e. Ki values of 2.6 and 1.2 μm for glycine and d-serine, respectively (29Siegel B.W. Sreekrishna K. Baron B.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the S1S2 protein displays specific binding of glycine, d-serine, MDL105,519, and 7-chlorokynurenic acid with affinities similar to those found with homomeric expressed NR1 receptors. In this study, we show that the S1 and S2 domains from the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit can be produced as a soluble and secreted fusion protein in insect cells. Biochemical analysis of the produced fusion protein revealed heterogeneity, because of N-linked glycosylation. Highly glycosylated protein was secreted into the medium and could be purified by affinity chromatography. Several reports indicate that both the expression levels and subcellular localization of receptor subunits are critically dependent on glycosylation (30Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, glycosylation of the S1S2 fusion protein in insect cells and of NMDA receptor subunits in neurons probably is essential for correct targeting and subsequent secretion. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration assays showed that the S1S2 polypeptide was eluted from a nickel-affinity column in different oligomerization states. Besides the monomeric form and a high molecular mass fraction, oligomers likely to contain two or more copies of the S1S2 polypeptide could be separated. This suggests that specific sequences involved in the oligomerization of receptor subunits might be localized within the S1 and/or S2 segments. However, Chen and Gouaux (23Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) recently reported that an S1S2 construct of an AMPA receptor subunit was eluted from a nickel-column as a monomer. Binding assays demonstrated that the fusion protein formed a saturable high affinity binding site for the glycine antagonists [3H]MDL105,519 and 7-chlorokynurenic acid. Affinities of the S1S2 protein for the specific agonists glycine andd-serine were found to be similar to those of NR1 homomeric receptors expressed in CHO cells. However, agonist affinities of both the S1S2 protein and NR1 homomeric receptors expressed in CHO cells are significantly lower than those of the native NMDA receptor of rat brain membranes (31Lodge D. Jones M. Fletcher E. Collingridge G.L. Watkins J.C. The NMDA Receptor. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 105-132Google Scholar). These data suggest that the reduced agonist binding affinities of the S1S2 fusion protein are not an indication of a misfolded protein but rather a property of homomeric glycine binding sites. This is consistent with the finding that the glycine binding affinities of different NR1/NR2 heteromeric NMDA receptors are significantly different. In other words, the NR2 subunits appear to importantly contribute to the conformation of the NR1 glycine binding site. In earlier studies, we proposed a model for the glycine binding site (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) that was based on the known three-dimensional structure of the bacterial lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein fromSalmonella tryphimurium (32Oh B.H. Pandit J. Kang C.H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.L. Kim S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the glycine binding site is formed by a deep cleft between two globular domains, which can be appositioned in either an “open” or a “closed” conformation. The presumed “opening-closing” movement of the two lobes around a connecting “hinge” region is thought to allow binding and dissociation of the ligated amino acid and has been described as the “Venus flytrap” model (33Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments have identified several amino acid residues of the S1 and S2 segments that determine apparent glycine affinities, whereas competition with the glycine antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid was affected only by mutations within the S1 sequence (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, high affinity glycine binding might implicate closure of the bilobate binding structure, whereas antagonistic binding seems to be restricted to domain S1, suggesting an open conformation of the binding pocket (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The reduced agonist affinity of the S1S2 protein could reflect an open conformation of the binding fold, which we propose to be characteristic for homomeric glycine binding sites. This interpretation is consistent with the low affinity for glycine andd-serine of heterologously expressed, nonfunctional homomeric NR1 receptors (29Siegel B.W. Sreekrishna K. Baron B.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose a model of receptor function in which the opening of the ion channel of NMDA receptors can only be achieved when the NR1 glycine binding site switches to a closed conformation because of allosteric interactions in the hetero-oligomeric, but not in NR1 homo-oligomeric, receptors. This model of the glycine binding pocket of the NR1 subunit is supported by experiments that revealed that the S1 and S2 segments of the homologous AMPA and kainate receptors form high affinity glutamate binding sites (34Uchino S. Sakimura K. Nagahari K. Mishina M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara J. Heinemann S.F.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, soluble fusion proteins have been produced from respective domains of AMPA receptor subunits (21Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Arvola M. Keinänen K. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that bind glutamate-specific ligands. The finding that both glutamate- and glycine-binding proteins can be engineered by fusing the corresponding S1 and S2 segments corroborates the view that the overall structures of these different binding sites have to be similar in three-dimensional structure. This interpretation is consistent with molecular modeling of the glycine and glutamate binding sites of the NR1 and NR2B NMDA receptor subunits, respectively (18Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study shows that the S1 and S2 domains of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit can be joined into a soluble fusion protein capable of binding glycine site specific agonists and antagonists. This approach should allow insight into the functional organization of the NMDA receptor and provide a novel approach to disclose the molecular structure of agonist binding sites. We thank Dr. S. Nakanishi for supplying the NR1 cDNA, G. Maul for excellent technical assistance, and H. Betz and J. Jacobsen for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2065389953,"Diazepam-binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA-binding protein (DBI/ACBP), a highly conserved 10-kDa polypeptide, has been implicated in various physiological processes including γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor binding, acyl-CoA binding and transport, steroidogenesis, and peptide hormone release. Both in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the expression of DBI/ACBP is stimulated under conditions that promote lipogenesis (treatment with androgens and insulin, respectively) and that involve the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Accordingly, we investigated whether DBI/ACBP expression is under the direct control of SREBPs. Analysis of the human and rat DBI/ACBP promoter revealed the presence of a conserved sterol regulatory element (SRE)-like sequence. Gel shift analysis confirmed that this sequence is able to bind SREBPs. In support of the functionality of SREBP binding, coexpression of SREBP-1a with a DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter gene resulted in a 50-fold increase in transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells. Disruption of the SRE decreased basal expression and abolished SREBP-1a-induced transcriptional activation. In agreement with the requirement of a co-regulator for SREBP function, transcriptional activation by SREBP-1a overexpression was severely diminished when a neighboring NF-Y site was mutated. Cholesterol depletion or androgen treatment, conditions that activate SREBP function in LNCaP cells, led to an increase in DBI/ACBP mRNA expression and SRE-dependent transcriptional activation. These findings indicate that the promoter for DBI/ACBP contains a functional SRE that allows DBI/ACBP to be coregulated with other genes involved in lipid metabolism.

It is found in various tissues and organs and was identified independently in various different experimental settings. DBI was first isolated from rat brain based on its ability to displace diazepam (Valium) from the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (1Guidotti A. Forchetti C. Corda M. Konkel D. Bennett C. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). When injected intraventricularly in rats, it produces conflict behavior, an action that can be blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (2Ferrero P. Guidotti A. Conti-Tronconi B. Costa E. Neuropharmacology. 1984; 23: 1359-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Ferrero P. Santi M. Conti-Tronconi B. Costa E. Guidotti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Independently, a 10-kDa peptide was isolated from bovine liver by virtue of its ability to bind and induce the synthesis of medium-chain acyl-CoA esters. This peptide was designated acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) (4Mogensen I.B. Schulenberg H. Hansen H.O. Spencer F. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed that it was the bovine homologue of rat DBI (5Mikkelsen J. Hojrup P. Nielsen P.F. Roepstorff P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Knudsen J. Hojrup P. Hansen H.E. Roepstorff P. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ACBP has been shown to bind acyl-CoA esters with high affinity, to protect them from hydrolysis and to attenuate acyl-CoA inhibition of enzymatic activities such as acetyl-CoA carboxylation (7Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, ACBP has been shown to extract acyl-CoA from phosphatidylcholine membranes and donate it for β oxidation or glycerolipid synthesis (8Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, together with the observation that overexpression of recombinant bovine ACBP in yeast leads to a substantial increase in cellular acyl-CoA content (9Mandrup S. Jepsen R. Skott H. Rosendal J. Hojrup P. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that ACBP functions as a pool former and transporter of acyl-CoA. In another experimental setting, a protein able to stimulate mitochondrial steroid synthesis was isolated from adrenal cortex and found to be identical to DBI (10Hall P.F. Papadopoulos V. Yanagibashi K. Imura H. Shizume K. Yoshida S. Progress in Endocrinology. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1988: 253-258Google Scholar, 11Yanagibashi K. Ohno Y. Kawamura M. Hall P.F.

Furthermore, in Leydig and in glial cells, DBI/ACBP has been shown to stimulate steroidogenesis by facilitating cholesterol translocation to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process is mediated by a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (see Refs. 13Papadopoulos V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

A protein with sequences identical to DBI was also isolated from porcine intestine and found to inhibit both early and late phases of glucose-induced insulin release from isolated perfused rat pancreas (15Chen Z.-W.

Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). In view of the postulated role of DBI/ACBP in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and its induction under conditions that involve SREBP activation, we explored whether DBI/ACBP is directly controlled by SREBPs. Both LNCaP and HepG2 cells were used as experimental paradigm. LNCaP and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and were cultured as described previously (32Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 47Guan G. Jiang G. Koch R.L. Shechter I. J. Biol.

To assess the impact of cholesterol on gene expression, cells were incubated in media supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (Perimmune, Rockville, MD) in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol added from stock solutions in ethanol. Control cultures received similar amounts of ethanol only. In experiments assessing the effects of steroids, fetal calf serum was pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal (CT-FCS) to reduce the background levels of steroids. The synthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone), purchased from DuPont New England Nuclear (Dreiech, Germany), was dissolved in absolute ethanol and added to the cultures. Final ethanol concentrations did not exceed 0.2%. All experiments involving LNCaP cells were carried out with cells of passages 30 to 75. Recombinant 6×His-tagged SREBP-la (amino acids 1–490) was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from plasmid pRSA (kindly provided by Dr. T. Osborne, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, USA) (37Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and was purified by means of TALON metal affinity chromatography (CLONTECH). Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides −137 to −113 of the published human DBI promoter sequence (25Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Rosseels J. Claessens F. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed. The probe (50,000 cpm) was incubated with recombinant SREBP-1a in a solution containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 8.5% glycerol, l mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 mg/ml nonfat milk for 20 min on ice. Unlabeled wild type or mutated double-stranded oligonucleotides were added as indicated in the figure legends. In the oligonucleotides designated “mutSRE,” the SRE-like sequence CTCGCCCGAG was replaced by CTACAAAATG. Oligonucleotides designated “delSRE” encompassed bases −145 to −105, but lacked the SRE-like sequence. Where indicated, antibody K-10 against SREBP-la (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added and incubation on ice was continued for another 20 min. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE and 0.02% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–460 of human SREBP-la was generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES1neo (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmid was designated pSREBP-la1–460. Plasmid pDBI-264luc encompassing bases −264 to −13 of the human DBI/ACBP gene linked to a luciferase reporter gene has been described previously (25Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Rosseels J. Claessens F. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is here referred to as “wt.” Mutations or deletions within the promoter were created using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The constructs mutSRE and delSRE contain the same mutation and deletion, respectively, as the oligonucleotides described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay.” In construct “mutNF-Y,” the A at position −142, which is part of a putative NF-Y site, was replaced by a C. In construct +4A, 4 A residues were inserted at position −131, which is located between the NF-Y and the SRE-like sequence. Plasmid pFASluc, a fatty acid synthase promoter-reporter construct, and plasmid pSV-AR0 expressing the androgen receptor, have been described previously (32Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G.

Plasmid pPA-7, a luciferase-based plasmid with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter (49Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol.

LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 7 × 105 cells. On the next day, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% CT-FCS. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter constructs, the indicated amounts of pIRES1neo or pSREBP-1a1–460, and a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. After 4 h of exposure to DNA, cells were subjected to a glycerol shock and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. To explore potential effects of androgens, cells were cotransfected with an androgen receptor expression vector (pSV-ARo) (48Brinkmann A.O. Faber P.W. van Rooij H.C.J. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Ris C.

In experiments assessing the effects of sterols, cells were incubated in medium containing 5% LPDS in the absence or in the presence of 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, or ethanol vehicle. One day after treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 500 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of 10 μl of cleared lysate were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase reporter assay kit from Promega and a Berthold Microlumat LB 96P luminometer. The activity of β-galactosidase was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies. Total RNA was prepared using a modified guanidinium/CsCl ultracentrifugation method as described previously (29Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of total RNA (20 μg) were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to Biotrans + membranes (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA), prehybridized and hybridized with DBI, FAS, PSA, and 18 S probes as described before (29Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Goossens K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1086-1090PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were autoradiographed by exposure to Amersham Hyperfilm-MP or to Kodak Biomax film (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK). Hybridization signals were quantitated using PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized for differences in RNA loading. Examination of the nucleotide sequences of the human DBI/ACBP promoter for potential SREBP sites revealed a sequence CTCGCCCGAG at positions −127 to −118 of the published sequence (25Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Rosseels J. Claessens F. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G.

This sequence is most homologous to the SRE of the farnesyl-diphosphate synthase gene (57Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, both SRE and NF-Y sites are perfectly conserved in the otherwise less homologous rat DBI/ACBP promoter (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether the putative SRE is able to bind SREBPs, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with recombinant SREBP-la and a radiolabeled wild type (wt) DNA fragment corresponding to a 25-base pair DBI/ACBP promoter region encompassing the putative SRE. A single-shifted DNA-protein complex was observed when recombinant SREBP-la was added to the binding reaction mixture (Fig.2). A 50-fold excess of unlabeled homologous competitor fragment displaced SREBP binding to the labeled DNA. Oligonucleotides lacking the SRE site (delSRE) or with a mutation in this site (mutSRE) were unable to compete for binding. In contrast, inclusion of an excess of DNA fragments encompassing the SRE sequence of the LDL receptor gene (50Bishop R.W. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 549-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) completely displaced binding. To verify that the observed shift was due to SREBP binding and not to binding of an unrelated contaminating protein in the SREBP preparation, we added antiserum against SREBP-1. A supershift was observed when both the antiserum and SREBP were present. In order to determine whether SREBP binding is functional, we transiently transfected LNCaP cells with a DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter construct harboring the SRE site (pDBI-264luc, here referred to as wt), together with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase and increasing amounts of pSREBP-1a1–460, a plasmid encoding transcriptionally active SREBP-1a. Two days after the transfection, the luciferase activity was measured and the values were corrected for any differences in transfection efficiency, as determined from the β-galactosidase assay. As Fig.3 A shows, the transcriptional activity of the DBI/ACBP promoter was elevated with increasing amounts of co-transfected pSREBP-1a1–460. Maximal effects were reached at 20 ng of pSREBP-1a1–460. In order to demonstrate that the stimulation of transcriptional activity by SREBP-la overexpression is mediated by the SRE-like site, we generated DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter constructs in which the SRE site is mutated (mutSRE) or deleted (delSRE) (Fig. 3 B). Transfection experiments were carried out as described above with maximally effective amounts of pSREBP-1a1–460 (20–50 ng). In support of the involvement of the SRE site in SREBP-induced transcriptional activation, stimulation of luciferase activity was severely decreased when the SRE was deleted or mutated (Fig.3 C). Additionally, the basal transcriptional activity of the mut and del constructs was 5–10-fold lower than that of the wild type construct, demonstrating the importance of the SRE site for the transcriptional activity of the DBI/ACBP gene (Fig. 3 D). SREBPs are weak activators of transcription in isolation and are known to function more efficiently when a co-regulatory factor (SP-1 or NF-Y) binds to a neighboring site (37Sanchez H.B. Yieh L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The SRE in the DBI/ACBP promoter is preceded by a potential NF-Y site. To test whether this latter site is important for SREBP-induced activation of DBI/ACBP transcription, we generated a DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter construct in which the NF-Y site is mutated (Fig. 4 A). In another construct, we increased the distance between the NF-Y and the SRE sites by insertion of four deoxyadenosine residues. Transient co-transfection of these constructs with pSREBPla1–460 revealed that the stimulatory effect of SREBP overexpression as observed with the wild type construct is severely diminished when the NF-Y site is mutated or when the distance between the NF-Y and the SRE sites is modified (Fig. 4 B). Basal transcriptional activities, however, remained high. Mutation of the NF-Y site even led to a 3–4-fold increase in basal transcription. Insertion of four bases between the NF-Y and the SRE site caused a 2-fold decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 4 C). Having demonstrated that overexpression of SREBPs leads to SRE-dependent activation of the transcriptional activity of DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter genes, we examined whether these constructs are also responsive to physiological changes in endogenous SREBP levels. One of the main and universal physiological signals that trigger SREBP processing resulting in increased nuclear levels of SREBPs is cholesterol depletion. Fig.5 A shows that the luciferase activity of LNCaP cells that were transiently transfected with DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter constructs was 2-fold higher in cells that were deprived of cholesterol as compared with sterol-treated cells.

The promoter activity of a reporter construct containing a promoter fragment of the PSA gene (a gene encoding a prostate-secreted protein that is not directly related to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism) (49Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), was not affected by sterols, indicating that the effects of cholesterol were specific. In support of the involvement of SREBPs in the effects of cholesterol depletion on DBI/ACBP gene transcription, no effects of sterols were observed when LNCaP cells were transfected with DBI/ACBP constructs in which the SRE-site was mutated or deleted (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether also the endogenous DBI/ACBP gene is under the control of cholesterol we cultured LNCaP cells for 24 h in media containing 5% LPDS either in the absence or in the presence of sterols, and analyzed the mRNA expression of DBI/ACBP by Northern blot analysis. As Fig. 5 B illustrates, DBI/ACBP mRNA expression was 2-fold higher in cells that were deprived of sterol as compared with sterol-treated cells. Similar results were obtained when the same blot was hybridized with a FAS probe. mRNA levels for PSA were only marginally affected. Similar results were obtained when HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor mevastatin and then incubated in the absence or in the presence of sterols (Fig. 5 C). Based on our recent findings that androgens coordinately stimulate the expression of lipogenic genes in LNCaP cells and that these effects are (at least in part) mediated by an androgen-induced increase in nuclear SREBP levels (32Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we determined whether the previously reported effects of androgens on DBI/ACBP expression (25Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Rosseels J. Claessens F. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,29Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are also mediated by SREBPs. To this end, we transfected LNCaP cells with DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter constructs together with a β-galactosidase encoding plasmid and a plasmid encoding the androgen receptor. This latter plasmid was included since the wild type DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter construct is poorly responsive to androgens in standard transient transfection experiments in LNCaP cells (25Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Rosseels J. Claessens F. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with an androgen receptor plasmid has been shown to improve the androgen responsiveness of promoter-reporter constructs from several other genes including prototypical androgen-responsive genes such as PSA (61Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van Eekelen C.C.E.M. van der Korput H.A.G.M.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Under these conditions androgens consistently stimulated the transcriptional activity of the wild type DBI/ACBP construct (Fig. 6). In support of the involvement of SREBPs in the effects of androgens, stimulatory effects of androgens were severely reduced when the SRE site was mutated or deleted. The current experiments provide evidence that DBI/ACBP is a SREBP-responsive gene. A SRE-like sequence was found in the human DBI/ACBP promoter by visually scanning the DNA sequence. This site resembles the SREs of other SREBP-responsive genes and is present also in the promoter of the rat homologue. The SRE-like site is functional; it binds purified SREBP-1a and mediates transcriptional activation by overexpressed SREBP-1a in cotransfection experiments. Like the genes encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase, HMG-CoA synthase, squalene synthase, SREBP-2, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (41Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, physiological conditions that are known to activate SREBP processing and stimulate their nuclear translocation (such as cholesterol depletion or androgen treatment of LNCaP cells) increase the expression of DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter genes and of the endogenous gene. Consistent with this finding is the report by Hansen et al. (27Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that DBI/ACBP expression is stimulated during insulin-induced lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, another physiological condition that involves changes in SREBP levels (35Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Together with our finding that a functional SRE is important also for basal DBI/ACBP gene transcription, the current experiments illustrate the importance of SREBPs in the regulation of DBI/ACBP gene expression. Regulation of DBI/ACBP by SREBPs is consistent with the postulated role for DBI/ACBP in fatty acid metabolism and allows DBI/ACBP to be coregulated with other proteins and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Our finding that DBI/ACBP is under the control of cholesterol may be of special interest in view of the role of DBI/ACBP in cholesterol translocation across mitochondrial membranes, a rate-limiting step in the biochemical synthesis of steroids. Our observation that the here identified SRE also plays a role in the androgen regulation of DBI/ACBP transcription is consistent with our previous finding that androgens enhance the nuclear accumulation of SREBP-l in LNCaP cells, and is reminiscent of the involvement of SREBPs in the androgen regulation of FAS gene expression (32Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the involvement of SREBPs in the androgen regulation of DBI/ACBP expression may fit with our previous observation that androgen regulation of DBI/ACBP expression may be indirect (29Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is unlikely, however, that the entire effect of androgens on DBI/ACBP expression is mediated by the SRE. (i) The effects of androgens on the −264 DBI/ACBP promoter-reporter construct are observed only under conditions (cotransfection with an androgen receptor-expressing vector) that enhance androgen responsiveness. (ii) The effects of androgens on steady state mRNA for DBI/ACBP are more pronounced than the effects on transcriptional activation of the DBI/ACBP luciferase reporter constructs in transient transfection experiments. (iii) Another androgen-responsive region was found in the DBI/ACBP promoter sequence upstream of the SRE site (25Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Rosseels J. Claessens F. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Issues that remain to be addressed include the question whether different SREBPs (SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2) are equally effective in regulating DBI/ACBP expression, and whether changes in SREBP-mediated DBI/ACBP expression may also affect other functions of DBI/ACBP not directly related to lipid metabolism. We thank Dr. T. Osborne of the University of California, Irvine for providing the pRSA plasmid encoding recombinant SREBP-1a, and Dr. J. Trapman and Dr. A. Brinkmann, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for providing the PSA promoter-reporter plasmid and the androgen receptor expression plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W2093045920,"ErbB-3 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family. In addition to the previously reported 6.2 kb full-length and 1.4 kb truncated c-erbB3 transcripts, we have observed a 1.7 kb c-erbB3 human transcript in Northern blots that specifically hybridizes to a probe of the extracellular domain of the receptor. Using 3′-RACE we have isolated four novel c-erbB3 cDNA clones of 1.6, 1.7, 2.1 and 2.3 kb from a human ovarian carcinoma-derived cell line. All four alternate transcripts are synthesized by readthrough of an intron and use of an alternative polyadenylation signal within this intron. Identical c-erbB3 transcripts are expressed in normal human placental tissues. Expression of these alternate transcripts is tissue-specific as indicated by Northern blot and RNase protection analyses. Fibroblasts transfected with expression vectors carrying these alternate c-erbB3 cDNA clones stably express truncated ErbB-3 products. Three of these four cDNA clones express a receptor product that is secreted. Immunoprecipitation analysis of primary cultures of human ovarian carcinomas also demonstrate the expression of a 90 kDa ErbB-3 related protein that is secreted. Furthermore, we demonstrate conservation of the exon-intron junctions between members of the erbB gene family in those regions of the gene encoding the extracellular domain. This gene structure is also conserved in the c-erbB1 homologues of Drosophila and C. elegans. Growth regulatory roles for related truncated ErbB products recently have been reported. It is, therefore, possible that the products of these four alternate c-erbB3 transcripts may also play important growth regulatory roles in normal and transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058564748,"We report an extensive Li-Fraumeni-like family in which there is an unusual spectrum of tumours at relatively late onset. A germline TP53 splice donor mutation in exon 4 is present in all affected family members available for testing. The mutation abolishes correct splicing of intron 4 and techniques of RT-PCR have identified three different aberrant transcripts from the mutant TP53 allele. Using the yeast functional assay to analyse transcripts in cells from a number of family members with the mutant allele, TP53 appears wild-type. Functional studies have been carried out on cells from patients with and without cancer who carry the germline mutation, and on cells from unaffected individuals from the same family who do not carry the mutation. Using a number of functional endpoints known to distinguish between cells carrying mutant or wild-type TP53 alleles, we were unable to discriminate normal (wt/wt) from heterozygous (wt/mut) cells by lymphocyte apoptosis and fibroblast survival following low dose rate ionising radiation exposure. However germline mutation carriers show increased sensitivity to radiation-induced chromosome damage in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and decreased transient and permanent G1 arrest. These studies demonstrate the importance of fully characterising the effects of TP53 germline mutations, and may explain some of the phenotypic features of this family."

Because the neurotrophins (NT) are important in the progression of melanoma to the brain-metastatic phenotype, we determined whether NT stimulate c-Yes activity in human MeWo melanoma cells and two variant sublines with opposite metastatic capabilities, 3 S 5 and 70W. The highly brain-metastatic 70W subline had an intrinsically higher c-Yes activity than parental MeWo or poorly metastatic 3 S 5 cells. c-Yes kinase was further induced by the prototypic human NT, nerve growth factor (NGF) in a dose and time-dependent manner. In contrast, c-Src activity (pp60c-Src) was similar in all these cells and unaffected by NGF exposure. Additionally, human NGF and neurotrophin-3 stimulated c-Yes in brain-metastatic 70W cells. The magnitude of c-Yes activation correlated with the degree of invasion of 70 W cells following incubation of these neurotrophins. To further examine NT stimulation of c-Yes in melanoma cells, three additional cell lines were examined. Metastatic TXM-13 and TXM-18 increased c-Yes activity in response to NGF. In contrast, no increase was observed in low-metastatic TXM-40 cells. Together, these data suggest that altered c-Yes expression may play a role in the malignant progression of the human melanocyte towards the brain-metastatic phenotype and that NT enhance the activity of c-Yes in signaling penetration into the matrix of NT-rich stromal microenvironments such as the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2014703631,"Membrane trafficking has heretofore been studied with intact organelles. Here, fusion-competent proteoliposomes were reconstituted from a yeast vacuole detergent extract. Homotypic vacuole fusion requires many membrane proteins, including the Ypt7p guanosine triphosphatase and a “SNARE complex” with Vam3p and Nyv1p. Proteoliposomes from extracts immunodepleted of either Vam3p or Ypt7p could not fuse, but vesicles reconstituted from a mixture of these depleted extracts had restored fusion activity. Purified preassembled vacuolar SNARE complex, when reconstituted with a SNARE-depleted extract, was fully functional for fusion. Thus, solubilized integral membrane components can be reconstituted for priming, docking, and fusion steps of organelle trafficking."

Stimulation of human peripheral blood T cells with mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is sufficient to induce interleukin-2 production and T cell proliferation in the absence of an antigen-specific signal through the T cell receptor. CD2 has been shown previously to associate physically with the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn . We now report that stimulation of T cells with mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs enhanced the association of the Fyn polypeptide with the CD2 complex, whereas stimulation with single anti-CD2 mAb had minimal effect. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, we found that CD2 bound to the Src homology (SH) 3 domain of Fyn. Interestingly, the CD2-Fyn association was negatively regulated by the Fyn SH2 domain; CD2 bound poorly to GST fusion proteins expressing both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn. However, the inhibitory effect of the Fyn SH2 domain on binding of the Fyn SH3 domain to CD2 was relieved by peptides containing a phosphorylated YEEI sequence that bound directly to the Fyn SH2 domain. In addition, we found that the ability of the Fyn SH2 domain to precipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including the CD3ζ chain, was enhanced after T cell stimulation with mitogenic pairs of CD2 mAbs. Finally, overexpression of a mutated Fyn molecule, in which the ability of the Fyn SH2 domain to bind phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was abrogated, inhibited CD2-induced transcriptional activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), suggesting a functional involvement of the Fyn SH2 domain in CD2-induced T cell signaling. We thus propose that stimulation through the CD2 receptor leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, including CD3ζ itself, which in turn bind to the Fyn-SH2 domain, allowing the direct association of the Fyn SH3 domain with CD2 and the initiation of downstream signaling events.

Moreover, coreceptor ligation may also initiate intracellular signaling pathways that regulate T cell activation (3Bierer B.E. Sleckman B.P. Ratnofsky S.E. Burakoff S.J. Annu. Rev.

The functional outcome and biological significance of these protein associations remain to be determined. The 116-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of CD2 contains no tyrosine that upon phosphorylation could mediate interaction with SH2 domain-containing signaling elements. Mutational and deletional analyses of human CD2 have shown that repeated proline-rich domains, potentially able to mediate binding to SH3-containing proteins, are important for CD2 signaling (29Hahn W.C.

We find that stimulation with mitogenic anti-CD2 mAbs increased the association of Fyn with CD2 and that it was the SH3 domain of Fyn that bound to the CD2 cytoplasmic domain. The Fyn SH2 domain was unable to bind to CD2 directly; nevertheless, it inhibited the binding of the Fyn SH3 domain to CD2. The inhibitory effect of the Fyn SH2 domain on Fyn SH3 binding to CD2 was able to be reversed by specific phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. In addition, the binding of the Fyn SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including CD3ζ chains, was enhanced after stimulation with mitogenic combinations of anti-CD2 mAbs. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of a Fyn loss-of-function SH2 domain mutant, but not wild-type Fyn or a Fyn loss-of-function SH3 domain mutant, inhibited CD2-induced NFAT transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggest that the SH2 domain of Fyn regulates the CD2-Fyn association in an activation-dependent manner; multimolecular complexes of CD2-CD3ζ-Fyn may thus quantitatively regulate the amount of Fyn polypeptide in the CD2 complex. The T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat clone J77 was a gift of K. Smith (Cornell University, New York, NY). Jurkat cells transformed with SV40 large tumor (T) antigen were also used in transient transfection experiments. Lymphocytes were grown in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), termed 10% fetal calf serum medium. Resting human peripheral blood T cells were isolated from normal volunteers by centrifugation through Ficoll (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC), plastic adherence, and nylon wool filtration. Contaminating red cells were lysed with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride. The purified human T cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum medium and used within 24 h of isolation.

Roberts, Dana Farber Cancer Institute), the anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3 (ATTC, Rockville, MD), the anti-CD43 antibody L10 (32Remold-O'Donnell E. Kenney D.M. Parkman R. Cairns L. Savage B. Rosen F.S. J. Exp.

The mAb 3G12, raised against the -ATSQHPPPPPGHRSQ- sequence derived from the human CD2 cytoplasmic tail, was generated in the laboratory of Dr. M Kamoun (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). The phosphotyrosyl peptide EPQpYEEIPIYL (here termed -pYEEI-) and its unphosphorylated analog EPQYEEIPIYL (here termed -YEEI-) were synthesized and purified as described (33Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The wild-type Fyn construct, a loss-of-function mutated Fyn construct in which the Arg was replaced with Lys at amino acid 176 in the Fyn SH2 domain (denoted Fyn SH2*), and a loss-of-function mutated Fyn construct in which the Pro was replaced with Val in at amino acid 134 in the Fyn SH3 domain (denoted Fyn SH3*) were the kind gift of R. Perlmutter (Merck-Research Institute, Rahway, NJ). Wild-type or mutated Fyn constructs were subcloned into pALTER vector (Promega, WI) and used for transfection into Jurkat cells. The GST fusion constructs containing different domains of Fyn have been described previously (33Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with PGEX2T.K containing the Fyn SH2 domain (termed GST-FynSH2), the Fyn SH3 domain (termed GST-FynSH3), the Fyn SH3 domain mutant (termed GST-FynSH3W119K) in which a tryptophan (W) at amino acid 119 was replaced by a lysine (K), and the Fyn SH3-SH2 domains (termed GST-FynSH3SH2). Transformed E. coli were induced with 0.4 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). The cells were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 and lysed by sonication. The GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immobilized proteins were aliquoted and stored as a 50% slurry (v/v) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 at −80 °C. In some experiments, fusion proteins were also eluted from the beads according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat cells or human purified T cells (1–2 × 107 as indicated) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3), incubated with 0.5 μl of T112 and 0.5 μl of T113 ascites on ice for 15 min, and then transferred to 37 °C for 5 min, unless otherwise indicated. The cells were lysed by addition of 0.5 ml of cold lysis buffer B (2% Brij 97, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 20 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of mAbs were added to unstimulated cells after lysis to normalize the final antibody concentrations. In CD2 immunoprecipitations, 20 μl of 1:1 ratio of protein A:protein G slurry and 0.5 μl of T112 and 0.5 μl of T113 ascites were added together to the clarified cell lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with washing buffer C (0.1% Brij 97, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmNa3VO4). In the in vitro kinase reaction, the washed beads were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer D (10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 15 min at room temperature. Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), and visualized by autoradiography. In reimmunoprecipitation experiments, co-immunoprecipitated proteins were dissociated by boiling in 50 μl of 2% SDS for 10 min, after which the beads were separated and removed by filtration through microspin tubes (Costar, MA). Dissociated proteins were renatured by the addition of 900 μl of Tris-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, reimmunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and then visualized by autoradiography or immunoblotted as indicated. In the experiments using immobilized GST fusion proteins, fusion proteins previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the clarified cell lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with washing buffer C and subjected to deglycosylation and Western blot analysis, as detailed below. In the peptide binding experiments, both GST fusion proteins and cell lysates were incubated separately with 50 μm -YEEI- or -pYEEI- peptides for 30 min at 4 °C, prior to GST precipitation. CD2 immunoprecipitates or GST fusion protein precipitates were boiled in 30 μl of denaturing buffer E (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol), renatured in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 50 μm Na3PO4and then incubated with 500 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2 h. Deglycosylated proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Polypeptides recognized in the Western blot were detected using the ECL method according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SV40 large tumor (T) antigen-transformed Jurkat cells (1 × 107) were incubated with 20 μg of vector, wild-type or mutated Fyn constructs as indicated, with 5 μg of a reporter plasmid p3xNFAT-luc (34Rooney J.W., Y., L.S. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6243-6299Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), carrying the luciferase gene driven by three tandem repeats of the distal NFAT sequences derived from the IL-2 promoter, for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then electroporated at 250 V, 800 microfarads (Life Technologies, Inc.). After electroporation, the cells were transferred to 10% fetal calf serum medium and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Transfected cells were stimulated for 6 h with 1:1,000 dilution of T112 and T113, a mitogenic pair of anti-CD2 mAbs, or with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (2 μm). Cells were washed with PBS, and samples were prepared using the Enhanced Luciferase Kit (Analytic Luminescent Laboratory, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative luciferase units are presented as the percentage of the maximal stimulation for each transfection condition induced by PMA plus ionomycin. The Src family tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn have been shown to associate with CD2 (21Bell G.M. Bolen J.B. Imboden J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5548-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), yet how these key proteins are regulated in CD2-dependent signaling events remains to be established. We examined whether extracellular ligation of CD2 altered the in vitro kinase activity of CD2-associated intracellular signaling proteins including Lck and Fyn. Different cell surface receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T cells. The immune complexes were then incubated in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP, and the resulting in vitrophosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig.1). Several phosphorylated proteins were present in CD2 immunoprecipitates prepared from resting Jurkat cells including prominent phosphoproteins in the 50–60-kDa size range (Fig.1, lane 4). A number of phosphoproteins were also found in CD3 immune complexes; no apparent kinase activity was detected in association with MHC class I molecules or CD43 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). Stimulation with a mitogenic combination of CD2 mAbs (T112 + T113) increased the total amount of CD2-associated kinase activity (Fig. 1, lane 5). There was enhanced phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including proteins migrating at 28, 40, 50–60, 120, and 150 kDa. When comparable studies were performed using purified human T cells, the phosphoprotein profiles from resting and anti-CD2 stimulated cells were somewhat different than those of Jurkat cells. Nevertheless, CD2 stimulation increased the phosphorylation of CD2-associated proteins in the range of 50–60 kDa (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). We performed reimmunoprecipitation experiments to determine if these phosphoproteins included Lck and Fyn, which migrate at a similar size range. Equivalent amounts of CD2 protein were immunoprecipitated from human purified T cells without or with pre-stimulation at 37 °C with the mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 mAbs T112 + T113. Afterin vitro phosphorylation (lanes 1 and2), the CD2 complexes were dissociated by boiling and then subjected to reimmunoprecipitation using antisera directed against either Fyn or Lck. Ligation of CD2 led to a modest increase in the amount of phosphorylated Lck and to a pronounced increase in the amount of phosphorylated Fyn associated with CD2 (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). We further characterized the latter interaction. We determined whether the increase in phosphorylated Fyn associated with CD2 was secondary to quantitative changes in the amount of Fyn polypeptide recruited to the CD2 complex. Human T cells were stimulated with mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 mAbs for varying times at 37 °C, after which CD2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. The Fyn associated with CD2 was detected by Western blot (Fig.3 A, upper panel). Although minimal Fyn was associated with CD2 in the resting cells (Fig.3 A, lane 1), the amount of Fyn associated with CD2 increased after stimulation of the cells with mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs (T112 + T113) in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–5). The amount of Fyn associated with CD2 was maximal at about 5 min after stimulation (Fig. 3 A, lane 4) and decreased by about 15 min (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). Similar results were observed in experiments performed in Jurkat cells (data not shown). In contrast to mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs stimulation, using either of the single anti-CD2 mAb T112or T113 alone only marginally altered the amount of CD2-Fyn association (Fig. 3 B). A trivial explanation for the above result could be that different amounts of CD2 were precipitated from resting versusstimulated cells, or at different time points, but that the stoichiometry of the Fyn association to CD2 was unchanged. We therefore developed a procedure to establish the amount of precipitated CD2. CD2 is a highly glycosylated protein that migrates as a diffuse band of approximate 50–60 kDa in SDS-PAGE and is indistinguishable from Ig heavy chains following Western blot (Fig. 3 C,lane 1). However, after treatment of the precipitated material with PNGase F to remove N-linked carbohydrates residues, CD2 migrated as a distinct band of 40 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The deglycosylated CD2 was then detected by the anti-CD2 mAb 3G12, which recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of CD2 (Fig. 3 C,lane 2). Quantitatively similar amounts of CD2 were precipitated at different time points following stimulation (Fig. 3,A and B, lower panel). Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation with mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs led to a time-dependent increase in the amount of Fyn polypeptide associated with CD2. The Fyn molecule contains an amino-terminal unique domain (termed NT), an SH2 domain, an SH3 domain, and a catalytic kinase domain. The NT, SH2. and SH3 domains of Fyn mediate protein-protein interactions and it is believed that these interactions regulate the subcellular localization and substrate-binding characteristics of Fyn (35Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing the NT (termed GST-FynNT), SH2 (termed GST-FynSH2) or SH3 (termed GST-FynSH3) domains of Fyn were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (33Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); their ability to bind to CD2 was tested (Fig. 4 A). Neither GST-FynNT nor GST-FynSH2 was able to precipitate CD2 from either resting or CD2 stimulated cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–5). In contrast, GST-FynSH3 was able to precipitate CD2 from T cell lysates in an activation-independent manner (Fig. 4 A,lanes 6 and 7). The binding of GST-FynSH3 to CD2 was demonstrated in unstimulated cells; binding was not increased after stimulating with mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs. Furthermore, the specific binding of GST-FynSH3 and CD2 was abrogated by a point mutation in the ligand-binding pocket of the SH3 domain in which a tryptophan is replaced by a lysine at position 119 (GST-FynSH3W119K) (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that the binding of CD2 to Fyn was mediated through the Fyn SH3 domain, and that binding required Fyn SH3 sequences essential for binding to proline-rich sequence motifs (36Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 37Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A. Brauer A.W. Seidel-Dugan C. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The association of CD2 with Fyn was increased in cells stimulated in vivo with mitogenic combinations of anti-CD2 mAbs (Fig. 3 B). However, the association of the SH3 domain of Fyn with CD2 appeared unchanged after stimulation (Fig.4 A, lanes 6 and 7). In vitro binding of Fyn SH2 domain to the Fyn SH3 domain has been demonstrated (33Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); it has been suggested that interaction of the SH2 and SH3 domains might interfere with binding to other ligands (33Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the binding of the Fyn SH3 domain to CD2 was regulated by other domains of Fyn, and, specifically, whether the Fyn SH2 domain inhibited the binding of the Fyn SH3 domain to CD2. GST fusion proteins containing both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn (termed GST-FynSH3SH2) were used (Fig.5 A). The Fyn SH3SH2 domain bound poorly to CD2 compared with the Fyn SH3 domain alone (Fig.5 A, lower panel, lane 2 and3). In contrast, GST-FynSH3SH2 and GST-FynSH3 bound to the phosphoprotein Cbl (Fig. 5 A, upper panel,lanes 2 and 3), demonstrating the ability of the GST-FynSH3SH2 protein to interact with target proteins. These data suggest that the presence of the Fyn SH2 domain was able to inhibit the binding of the Fyn SH3 domain to CD2. In addition, the inhibitory effect of the Fyn SH2 domain on Fyn SH3 was not universal because the Fyn SH3SH2 domain was able to precipitate other polypeptides such as Cbl. It has been suggested that the interaction of the Fyn SH2 and SH3 domains functionally interferes with binding to other ligands; an 11-mer phosphorylated peptide EPQpYEEIPIYL (termed -pYEEI-), a high affinity ligand of Fyn SH2 domain, has been shown to be able to abolish Fyn SH2-SH3 interactions (33Panchamo"
https://openalex.org/W2127440050,"Downregulation of MHC Class I antigens has been observed in many cancers and usually results from a decreased gene transcription. A reporter CAT gene dependent on the MHC Class I kappaB site or on a longer promoter is transactivated by NF-kappaB complexes containing p65 or RelB. p100 as well as IkappaB-alpha are potent inhibitors of this transcription and p100 sequesters RelB and p65 complexes in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells. However, although p100 is highly expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines, MHC Class I antigen expression was observed on all the cell lines we analysed and could be further induced by stimulation with the cytokines IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Stable transfection of a unresponsive mutated IkappaB-alpha Ser 32-36 expression vector showed that TNF-alpha induced MHC Cl I expression in an NF-kappaB-dependent way while IFN-gamma did it independently of any NF-kappaB activation."

https://openalex.org/W2042911010,"This study demonstrates that the transcriptional repressor sequence of the rat vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (VIPR) gene constitutes a 42-base pair core element that is the binding site for a nuclear protein. We showed that this element was able to confer transcriptional repression to a heterologous promoter and that deletion or point mutations within this element resulted in loss of transcriptional repression. Southwestern blot analysis indicated that the VIPR repressor element interacts specifically with a nuclear protein of about 72 kDa. By screening a rat lung expression library coupled with rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reactions, we isolated a cDNA clone (designated as VIPR-RP) that contains an open reading frame of 656 amino acids. VIPR-RP is 78% identical to a previously characterized protein, differentiation-specific element-binding protein, which is a member of a family of proteins including components of the DNA replication factor C complex. However, VIPR-RP cDNA encodes for a much smaller protein than differentiation-specific element-binding protein because of a frameshift. VIPR-RP mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, including lung, liver, brain, heart, kidney, spleen, and testis. VIPR-RP protein specifically interacts with the VIPR repressor element as demonstrated by gel shift assays.

Repressors bind DNA and inhibit transcription by interference with 1) activator DNA binding, 2) the activity of DNA-bound activators, and 3) the general transcription machinery. Eukaryotic repressors that work by competitive DNA binding have been uncovered in the regulation of genes involved in pattern formation in fly embryos (5Small S. Kraut R. Hoey T. Warrior R. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Examples of quenching include transcriptional repression of mouse proliferin gene, where AP-1 and glucocorticoid receptor bind DNA together in a manner that prevents transcriptional activation by either one of the proteins (6Diamond M. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Similarly, glucocorticoid receptor and NF-κB can cancel each other out in the regulation of cytokine transcription (7Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic repressors, however, seem to act directly on the general transcription machinery. For example, the fly even-skipped protein, the mouse MSX-1 protein, the unligand human thyroid receptor, and the adenovirus E1B-55K protein have all been shown to repress basal transcription (8Johnson F.B.

In this study, we identified a 42-bp element in the 5′-flanking region of the VIPR gene that is required for transcriptional repression of the VIPR gene and confers transcriptional repression to a heterologous promoter. We have isolated a cDNA clone (designated VIPR-RP) encoding a 72-kDa novel protein that interacts specifically with the VIPR repressor element. Expression of VIPR-RP led to transcriptional repression. These results indicate that positive and negative factors interact with VIPR promoter to regulate its expression. Construction of the VIPR promoter sequential deletions and luciferase fusion plasmids was described previously (13Pei L. Melmed S. Biochem.

To generate DNA constructs containing the VIP receptor repressor element linked to a heterologous promoter, an oligonucleotide containing DNA sequence between −815 and −773 bp of the VIP receptor promoter with BamHI restriction site attached to the end was synthesized. After annealing to the complementary strand, the double-stranded DNA was ligated, and a ligation product containing four copies of the oligonucleotide was isolated by electrophoresis and cloned in front of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter linked to luciferase reporter gene. This plasmid was designated 4FTKLUC. The point mutations within the repressor sequence were generated using the following primers: 5′-GATCCCGCAAAGGGCTACGAGTCtactgCCCGCGCGCCGC-3′ (upper strand sequence, lowercase letters indicate base substitutions). The double-stranded oligonucleotide was multimerized and cloned in front of TKLUC as described above. This plasmid was designated m4FTKLUC.

The resulting plasmid was designated as −859ΔLUC. Rat L2 and monkey kidney Cos-7 cell lines were grown in F-12K and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (13Pei L. Melmed S. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After 24 h incubation, cells were assayed for luciferase and CAT activities. Each construct was transfected using triplicate plates for each experiment, and each construct was tested in at least three independent experiments. In all experiments, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of TKCAT (thymidine kinase promoter and CAT fusion gene) to monitor transfection efficiency. A negative control plasmid containing a promoterless luciferase gene (pA3) and a positive control plasmid containing Rous sarcoma virus 3′ long terminal repeat promoter fused to luciferase were included in all experiments. Luciferase assays and CAT assays were performed as described previously (15Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract was prepared from cultured cell as described by Dignam (16Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Reoder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). To generate the probe, an oligonucleotide containing DNA sequence between −815 and −773 bp of the VIP receptor promoter was synthesized. After annealing to the complementary strand, the double-stranded DNA was end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 10,000 cpm of the probe was used in each reaction. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), with 15-μg nuclear extracts. Competitor DNA was mixed with the probe prior to receptor addition. Binding was for 20 min at room temperature. The anti-RXR antibody (1 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the binding was continued on ice for an additional 30 min. The reactions were electrophoresed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 3 h. Cell nuclear extracts (50 μg) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel next to rainbow protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, treated with decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl (6, 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.1875 m) and pre-bound in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 5% nonfat milk, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5% PVP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, at 4 °C for 1 h. Binding was performed at 4 °C overnight in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. 106 cpm/ml of the above probe used for gel shift analysis was used. The membrane was washed twice for 30 min in the binding buffer without salmon sperm DNA at 4 °C, and exposed to x-ray films for 2 h. A rat lung 5′-stretch plus cDNA λgt11 library was purchased fromCLONTECH. The library was screened using a end labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing DNA sequence between −773 and −815 bp of the VIP receptor promoter. An oligonucleotide containing point mutations within this region (see above) was used as a negative control. Approximately 106 plaque-forming units were screened using the protocol described by Singh et al. (17Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Clones encoding sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins were identified and plague-purified. Crude cell extracts from recombinant phage lysogens were prepared using the method by Singh et al. (17Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and were used in gel mobility shift assays to test the specific interaction between the fusion proteins and the DNA-binding sequence. The cDNA encoding the sequence-specific DNA binding was isolated by digesting phage DNA with EcoRI and was cloned into pGEM3Z plasmid vector for restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed on both strands using internal primers. The full-length cDNA was obtained by 5′ and 3′ RACE reactions using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's instructions. Rat lung poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was used for cDNA synthesis. The 5′ RACE gene-specific primer was: 5′-AGCTGCTTGGCGATGGCCTCATCA-3′, and the 3′ RACE gene-specific primer was: 5′-CAAAAAATCCAAGTACGAAATCGCTGC-3′. The PCR reactions include: 1) denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min; 2) 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 4 min; 3) 5 cycles or 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 4 min; and 4) 25 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 4 min in a total volume of 50 μl. After the cycling was completed, 10 μl of the PCR products was analyzed on agarose gel. The PCR products were clone into TA vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The entire coding region of the cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGCTGCGATGGACATTCGGAAATTCTTTGGG-3′ and 5′-TATCGCTCGCATTTAGTTCCACATAACTGT-3′. The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl using the following program: 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The PCR product was cloned into eukaryotic TA vector (Invitrogen) for further analysis, and cotransfection experiments were conducted. A rat multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH. Approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from eight different rat tissues was run on a denaturing formaldehyde 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and UV-cross-linked. The membrane was first hybridized to the full-length cDNA probe and then was stripped and rehybridized to a human β-actin cDNA control probe. Hybridization was performed at 60 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). Washing was twice for 15 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS and twice for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS. VIPR-RP was transcribed from T7 promoter and translated in reticulocyte lysate using transcription- and translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). A typical reaction contains 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2 μl of reaction buffer, 20 mm amino acid mixture, 1 μg of DNA template, 40 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, and 10 units of T7 RNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h. 5 μl of the reaction was used in gel shift assays. Previous transfection studies in rat lung cells indicated that a potential transcriptional repressor sequence is present between −488 and −859 bp in the VIPR 5′-flanking region. To characterize this repressor sequence further, we first sought to determine whether nuclear proteins in lung cells interact with a specific sequence in this region. As shown in Fig.1, when lung cell nuclear extracts were incubated with an oligonucleotide containing 42-bp VIPR 5′ sequence between −773 and −815, a mobility shifted band was observed (Fig. 1,lane 2). This band was not competed by an oligonucleotide with unrelated sequences (Fig. 1, lane 3) but was competed by the unlabeled oligonucleotide of the same sequence (Fig. 1,lane 4). Because a sequence similar to the half-site for RXR (GGTGA) is present within this 42-bp sequence, an anti-RXR antibody was included in the reaction to test whether the mobility shifted band was a result of RXR interaction with this sequence. Fig. 1, lane 5 shows that addition of anti-RXR antibody has no effect on the mobility shifted band. These results indicate that a nuclear protein in lung cells specifically interacts with VIPR 5′ sequence between −773 and −815 bp and that this protein is not RXR. The above results showed that RXR does not bind to the 42-bp sequence despite the presence of a half-site. To test whether the GGTGA motif is important for DNA-protein interaction, point mutations were made to change this sequence to tactg. As shown in Fig. 2, an oligonucleotide containing these mutations could not compete for binding of the lung nuclear protein with the wild-type sequence (Fig. 2, lanes 4and 5). When the mutant oligonucleotide was used as the probe, no mobility shifted band was present (Fig. 2, lanes 7–10). These results indicate that the GGTGA motif is required for interaction of the lung cell nuclear protein with the 42-bp sequence. To test whether the 42-bp nuclear protein-binding site mediates transcriptional repression of the VIP receptor gene, this sequence was deleted from the VIPR-luciferase fusion construct. As shown in Fig.3 A, luciferase activity of the fusion construct containing 859 bp of the VIPR 5′ sequence (−859LUC) is about 8-fold lower than that of −489LUC, whereas a construct containing deletion between −773 and −815 bp (−859ΔLUC) does not show significant reduction in luciferase activity compared with the luciferase activity of −489LUC. These results indicate that the 42-bp sequence is required for transcriptional repression of the VIPR gene. To test whether the 42-bp VIPR 5′-flanking sequence is able to repress transcription of a heterologous promoter, oligonucleotide containing either the wild-type or point mutation of this sequence was multimerized and cloned in front of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter linked to luciferase (TKLUC). Fig.3 B shows that the luciferase activity of the construct containing four copies of the wild-type sequence (4FTKLUC) is about 4-fold lower than that of TKLUC, whereas there is no significant difference in luciferase activity between the construct containing four copies of the mutant sequence (m4FTKLUC) and TKLUC. These results indicate that the 42-bp sequence is capable of conferring transcriptional repression to a heterologous promoter. To characterize further the nuclear protein that interacts with the VIPR repressor element, Southwestern blot analysis was performed. Fig. 4 shows that the VIPR repressor element detected a protein of about 72 kDa from lung cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 4, lane 1). To determine whether this protein was specific to lung cells, nuclear extracts from a neuroblastoma and pituitary tumor cell lines were also included. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 2 and 3), the 72-kDa protein is also present in nuclear extracts from both cell lines. When an oligonucleotide containing point mutations within the repressor element was used to probe the same blot, no specific protein band was detected. These results indicate that the VIPR repressor elements interact specifically with a 72-kDa nuclear protein that is not only expressed in lung cells but also in other cell types. To isolate the cDNA clones, a λgt11 cDNA expression library made from rat lung (CLONTECH) was screened using the end labeled 42-p VIP repressor element as the probe. About 106 plaques were screened according to Singhet al. (17Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and Vinson et al. (18Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). One positive clone was obtained, and lysogens prepared from this phage clone were used in gel shift assays to test its specific binding to the VIPR repressor element. As shown in Fig. 5, when the extracts of the phage lysogen were incubated with the 42-bp VIPR repressor oligonucleotide, a mobility shifted band was observed (Fig. 5, lane 2). This band was competed out by unlabeled wild-type VIPR repressor oligonucleotide (Fig. 5, lanes 3and 4) but not by the mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 5,lane 5). These results indicate that the cDNA in this phage clone encodes a protein that exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding to the VIPR repressor element. DNA sequencing showed that this clone contains an insert of 1 kilobase pair but does not contain either the 5′ or 3′ portion of the cDNA. RACE PCRs were performed to obtain the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA, and the entire cDNA clone was obtained by PCR using primers at both ends of the cDNA (see “Materials and Methods”). This cDNA (designated VIPR-RP) contains an open reading frame of 656 amino acids (Fig. 6 A) with a predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa.Figure 6A, nucleotide sequence of VIPR-RP cDNA. About 2.3 kilobase pairs of the VIPR-RP cDNA sequence is shown. The translation initiation and termination codons areunderlined. B, amino acid sequence of VIPR-RP and alignment to DSEB protein. The entire open reading frame for VIPR-RP is shown and aligned to amino acids 1–657 of DSEB protein. Regions of homology are shaded with the corresponding amino acid number shown on the left. C, alignment of VIPR-RP N-terminal 400 amino acids to β-MHC-binding factor. The entire open reading frame for β-MHC-binding factor is shown and aligned to amino acids 1–400 of VIPR-RP protein. Regions of homology are shaded with the corresponding amino acid number shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of VIPR-RP protein sequence with sequences reported to GenBankTM revealed that VIPR-RP is 78% identical to differentiation-specific element-binding protein (DSEB) (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). The highest level of homology is between amino acids 367 and 493 (97%), corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of DSEB (Fig. 6 B) (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence in this region also shares high identity to three bacterial ligases (20Shark K.B. Conway T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 96: 19-26Crossref Google Scholar, 21Lauer G. Rudd E.A. McKay D.L. Ally D. Backman K.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VIPR-RP sequence diverges from DSEB at amino acid 581 (Fig. 6 B), where a single nucleotide deletion in VIPR-RP cDNA results in a frameshift and a termination codon at amino acid 657. VIPR-RP cDNA therefore encodes for a much smaller protein than DSEB, which contains 1131 amino acids. The N-terminal portion of VIPR-RP also shares extremely high sequence identity with the human fetal β-myosin heavy chain (MHC)-binding factor (GenBankTM accession numberX75917). 2E. Morkin, unpublished observation. As shown in Fig.6 C, the N-terminal 375 amino acids of VIPR-RP are almost identical to β-MHC-binding factor, except in three amino acids. The sequence homology ends at residue 376, and translation of β-MHC-binding factor terminates at amino acid 399, resulting in a much smaller protein (Fig. 6 C). Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from several rat tissues was performed to determine the tissue distribution of VIPR-RP mRNA. A 4.6-kilobase pair mRNA band was observed in all tissues examined, including heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis (Fig. 7). A smaller mRNA band was present only in testis (Fig. 7). These results indicate that VIPR-RP mRNA is widely expressed and that it has a testis-specific transcript. Examination of the VIPR-RP sequence did not reveal any obvious homology with any DNA-binding motifs such as zinc fingers and homeodomains. To test whether VIPR-RP specifically interacts with the VIPR repressor element, VIPR-RP was transcribed and translated in vitro. As shown in Fig.8, when VIPR protein was incubated with the 42-bp VIPR repressor oligonucleotide, two mobility shifted bands were observed (Fig. 8, lane 2). The presence of the faster migrating band was likely to be the result of binding a partially transcribed and translated VIPR-RP protein to DNA. These bands were competed out by increasing amounts of the unlabeled wild-type VIPR repressor oligonucleotide (Fig. 8, lanes 3–6) but not by the mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 8, lanes 7–10). Unlabeled oligonucleotide containing consensus binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 or AP2 also did not compete for VIPR-RP binding (Fig. 8,lanes 11 and 12). These results indicate that VIPR-RP exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding to the VIPR repressor element. To assess the functional effect of VIPR-RP, VIPR-RP cDNA was inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter and cotransfected with reporter plasmids into Cos-7 cells. As shown in Fig.9, co-transfection with the VIPR-RP expression vector resulted in 6-fold reduction in luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid containing four copies of the wild-type VIPR repressor element (Fig. 9, 4FTKLUC), whereas expression of VIPR-RP did not significantly affect luciferase activity of reporter plasmid containing four copies of the mutant VIPR repressor element (Fig. 9, m4FTKLUC) or the plasmid without the repressor element (Fig. 9, TKLUC). These results demonstrate that VIPR-RP acts as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor in vivo. In previous work we demonstrated the presence of a negatively acting element that regulates VIPR gene expression in lung cells (13Pei L. Melmed S. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,15Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this report, we have restricted the biological activity of the negatively acting element to a 42-bp DNA sequence located between −773 and −815 bp that contributes importantly to transcriptional repression of the VIPR gene. We showed that deletion of this sequence results in loss of transcriptional repression and that this sequence can repress transcription of a heterologous promoter. The VIPR repressor element interacts with a nuclear protein in lung cells as demonstrated by gel shift assays. Although a GGTGA motif similar to RXR-binding half-site is present within the repressor element, RXR does not appear to be the protein that binds to this element, for addition of anti-RXR antibody in gel shift assays did not change the pattern of the mobility shifted band. This motif, however, is essential for the nuclear protein-binding and -mediating transcriptional repression. Base substitutions within this motif resulted in loss of protein binding and transcriptional repression. At least three categories of transcriptional regulation by negatively acting elements have been described (22Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar): 1) repression via competition between repressors and activators for the same or overlapping binding sites, 2) neutralization of activators by interactions with a repressor protein, and 3) silencing through direct interaction of a repressor with the target site, regardless of distance from the promoter. The nuclear protein that interacts with the VIPR repressor element was characterized further by Southwestern blot analysis. The results showed that the repressor element detected a single protein of about 72 kDa in nuclear extracts of not only lung cells but also neuroblastoma and pituitary tumor cell lines. These results indicate that the VIPR repressor element interacts with a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein and that transcriptional repression is likely mediated by direct interaction of the repressor protein with this element. Based on the specific interaction between VIPR repressor element and the 72-kDa nuclear protein, we isolated a cDNA clone that encodes for this protein (VIPR-RP). The deduced amino acid sequence of VIPR-RP shares high identity (78%) to DSEB (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar) and the large subunit of murine activator 1 complex, A1p145 (23Burbelo P.K. Utani A. Pan Z.Q. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11543-11547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is also known as replication factor C (RFC) (24Lucklow B. Bunz F. Stillman B. Lichter P. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DSEB and A1p145/RFC are nearly identical in amino acid sequence, except for the differences in three amino acids. DSEB binds to an enhancer element in angiotensinogen gene promoter that mediates the irreversible induction of transcriptional activation during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipoblasts to adipocytes (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). A1p145/RFC is part of a heteropentameric protein complex essential for DNA replication (25Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal 375 amino acids of VIPR-RP are almost identical to the human β-MHC-binding factor, which has unknown function. Our result also showed that the mRNA tissue distribution of VIPR-RP and DSEB is different. Although VIPR-RP mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, DSEB mRNA shows more selected expression pattern. DSEB mRNA was not detected in heart and skeletal muscle (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that although VIPR-RP is closely related to DSEB/RFC, it is a distinct gene. Like DSEB and A1p145, VIPR-RP does not contain the well characterized DNA-binding motifs such as zinc fingers or homeodomain. Sequence-specific binding of DSEB and A1p145 was demonstrated by gel shift experiments in which recombinant DSEB and A1p145 preferentially bind sequences within the promoter of angiotensinogen (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar) or collagen IV (23Burbelo P.K. Utani A. Pan Z.Q. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11543-11547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), respectively. Our results showed that in vitrotranslated VIPR-RP protein binds to the VIPR repressor element specifically and that a GGTGA motif within the repressor element is essential for VIPR-RP binding. A similar motif GGTAA is present within the binding site for DSEB (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar), but the functional importance of this motif has not been tested. VIPR-RP differs from DSEB and A1p145 in that it encodes a much smaller protein. A single base deletion at amino acid 581 in VIPR-RP results in a frameshift and a termination codon at amino acid 657. As a consequence, the C-terminal 75 amino acids of VIPR-RP show very little similarity to DSEB and A1p145. The precise functions of DSEB and A1p145 in DNA replication and transcriptional activation remain to be elucidated. DSEB was unable to transactivate reporter genes containing its binding sites when co-transfected into Cos-1 and NIH3T3 cells (19McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that VIPR-RP repressed transcription of a reporter plasmid containing four copies of its binding sequence when co-transfected into Cos-7 cells, suggesting that VIPR-RP not only binds to DNA but also mediates transcriptional repression. It is possible the C-terminal portion of VIPR-RP may possess functions that are distinct from DSEB and A1p145. In summary, we have identified a negatively acting element in the VIPR promoter that is the binding site for a novel transcriptional repressor, VIPR-RP. Interaction of VIPR-RP with its target site results in transcriptional repression of the VIP receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2326545525,"Appropriate expression of HTLV-1 genes requires transcriptional transactivation by Tax and post-transcriptional regulation by Rex, both mediated by LTR encoded RNA sequences. Using a combination of deletion mutagenesis, Rex-reporter CAT assays, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy it was established that in the absence of Rex, CAT mRNAs harboring HTLV-1 LTR sequences were unable to leave the nucleus. Deletion of the known U5 encoded cis-acting repressing sequence (CRS) led to a partial release of nuclear retention. A novel regulatory element overlapping the 3′ Rex responsive element (RxRE) region was shown to prevent export and expression of these transcripts. Deletion of both the 5′ LTR encoded CRS and 3′ LTR encoded downstream repressive sequence (3′ CRS) led to constitutive mRNA nuclear export and gene expression, independently of Rex. The locations of the two regulatory elements indicate that while the 5′ CRS selectively acts to hinder export of unspliced transcripts, the 3′ CRS has the capacity to induce nuclear retention of all HTLV-1 transcripts, and therefore could potentially contribute to viral latency in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075407612,"In this report we describe studies which utilized yeast strains bearing gain and loss of function alleles ofABF1 in order to attempt to directly implicate Abf1p in modulating transcription of the TBP-encoding gene, SPT15, in vivo. We found that overexpression of Abf1p in a yeast cell increased transcription of the TBP-encoding gene and that this stimulation depended upon the exact sequence of the Abf1p binding site (ABF1) present in the gene. Further, in a yeast strain expressing a temperature sensitive form of Abf1p, occupancy of the chromosomal ABF1 site in the TBP-encoding gene was immediately lost following a temperature shift. Both results suggest that Abf1p drives transcription of the TBP-encoding gene. Surprisingly though we found that continuous ABF1 cis-element occupancy by Abf1p was not acutely required for normal levels of transcription of either the TBP-encoding gene or other “Abf1p-driven” genes tested. We propose a model to explain these results and suggest mechanisms by which Abf1p could activate gene transcription.

We previously described the characterization and purification of a protein which binds with high affinity to the nonconsensus ABF1 1The abbreviations used are: ABF1, the DNA binding site for Abf1p; Abf1p, ARS binding factor I protein; TBP, the TATA box binding protein; PED, positive element distal, a variant form of ABF1 site; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; WT, wild type; ts, temperature-sensitive; ORF, open reading frame; UASGAL, the enhancer conferring galactose inducibility to transcription; GTF, general transcription factors, TFIIA, B, D, E, F, and H. site termed PED present in the TBP-encoding gene. 2S. C. Schroeder and P. A. Weil, submitted for publication. A variety of biochemical and immunological tests and finally amino acid sequencing identified this polypeptide as Abf1p. We demonstrated that the integrity of the PED variant ABF1 element was critical for DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo and that the patterns of Abf1p binding to DNA exactly mirrored the ability of the WT and mutant forms of this ABF1 site to drive transcription of the TBP encoding gene in vivo. Finally, we showed that in vitro, the non-consensus TBP gene ABF1 sequence is able to bind Abf1p in a fashion indistinguishable from a consensus ABF1 binding site. Though compelling, this body of evidence does not actually prove that it is Abf1p that drives TBP gene expression inside the yeast cell. In order to more directly implicate Abf1p in controlling TBP gene expression we performed the series of genetic experiments described herein. In this study we describe genetic gain and loss of function experiments where we modulated the intracellular levels of (functional) Abf1p in order to assess the impact of these acute changes in activator protein concentration upon the transcription of the TBP-encoding gene. Parallel experiments were performed with a battery of other previously characterized “Abf1p-driven” genes which served as controls for our TBP studies. We utilized genomic footprinting and primer extension to monitor ABF1 occupancy and transcription in vivo in yeast strains carrying temperature sensitive (ts) ABF1 alleles while we used SPT15:lacZ fusion reporter constructs to assess the effects of Abf1p overexpression on transcription of the TBP-encoding gene. Use of these sensitive assay methodologies, coupled with the yeast strains over- and underexpressing Abf1p, allowed us not only to strongly implicate Abf1p in driving TBP gene transcriptionin vivo but also allowed us to ask whether continuous cis-element occupancy is required for sustained high level gene transcription.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2540-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) this hypothesis have appeared and only a handful of published studies using in vivomethodologies have addressed this question. One of the in vivo studies shows that continuous cis-element occupancy by a “functional” trans-acting factor is absolutely necessary for ongoing activated transcription (5Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) while three other reports indicate that in fact this may not be the case at least when cis-element occupancy/function and transcription are monitored acutely (i.e. minute to hours) (6Mirkovitch J. Decker T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Walters M.C. Magis W. Fiering S. Eidemiller J. Scalzo D. Groudine M. Martin D.I.

In our studies, continuous cis-element occupancy by Abf1p, the dominant trans-acting factor for the TBP-encoding gene, was not required for sustained transcription. This behavior was observed not only for the gene encoding TBP but for the entire collection of Abf1p-driven genes which we examined. These results have prompted us to propose a model for Abf1p-mediated gene activation and to speculate on possible molecular mechanisms of Abf1p-driven gene expression based on this paradigm. The possible implications of this model for gene activation events are discussed. These assays were performed as detailed previously (9Schroeder S.C. Wang C.K. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28335-28346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To ensure the quickest shift possible from permissive temperature (25 °C) to nonpermissive temperature (37 °C), overnight cultures of JCA30 (ABF1) and JCA31 (abf1-1) were grown at 25 °C in SC-His medium (11Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.2, the culture was then split and filtered through separate 500-ml 0.8-μmfilter units (Nalgene). Cells from one of the filter units were resuspended in 500 ml of SC-His medium prewarmed to 25 °C while cells from the other were resuspended in 500 ml of the same medium prewarmed to 37 °C. These cultures were then incubated at either 25 or 37 °C, and at intervals (0, 1, 2, and 4 h) cell number was determined and an appropriate volume of cells was harvested for RNA preparation and/or DMS footprinting analysis. For DMS modification at 37 °C, cells were harvested, resuspended in 2 ml of prewarmed media, and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. 1 μl of DMS (Sigma) was added and the reaction stopped after 1 min at 37 °C . Therefore time = 0* at 37 °C as shown in the figures represents a time of approximately 0.06 h. At each time point, cells from both 37 °C (i.e. JCA30 and JCA31) cultures were counted and plated onto YPAD plates and incubated at room temperature to measure cell viability after the shift to 37 °C. Plasmid pMHOBF1 (12Francesconi S.C. Eisenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4089-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) contains a 2μ origin of replication, a URA3 gene, and theABF1 ORF under the transcriptional control of the UASGAL and GAL1 promoter. This plasmid, or as a control the 2μ URA3-marked plasmid pRS426 (13Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), was transformed into yeast strain YPH499, MAT a ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 (14Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) along with one of two TBP promoter::lacZfusion plasmids (see Fig. 1; PED WT or mutant 3). These cells were grown overnight in selective medium containing 2% raffinose to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.2. The cultures were then split (this represents zero time or t = 0) and to one-half of the cells, 20% galactose was added to a final concentration (v/v) of 2% while to the other half of the cells was added an identical volume of water. Beginning at t = 0 and continuing every 4 h until 20 h, cells were removed from each culture and assayed for β-galactosidase activity and Abf1p protein levels. Crude protein extracts were prepared from these cells as described previously (10Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from yeast cells using hot phenol (11Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and quantitated both by UV spectrophotometry and by gel electrophoresis. Equivalent amounts of RNA were analyzed for either total mRNA levels using the slot blotting method of Choder (15Choder M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2315-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or for specific mRNA 5′-ends using primer extension methods as detailed previously (9Schroeder S.C. Wang C.K. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28335-28346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Extension products were fractionated on sequencing gels which were dried and exposed to x-ray film and then imaged (Molecular Dynamics) to quantitate signals. mRNA half-lives were measured both using temperature shifts with a yeast strain carrying the rpb1-1 mutation and by using the antibiotic thiolutin (Pfizer) as detailed by Herrick et al. (17Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Our first set of experiments examined the effect that overexpression of Abf1p had on TBP gene expression. We reasoned that if Abf1p actually controls transcription of the TBP-encoding gene through its PED variant ABF1 element, then by increasing occupancy of this DNA element, via mass action through Abf1p overexpression, we should effect an increase in TBP gene transcription. Complicating this approach was the fact that cells containing just normal amounts of Abf1p exhibit full occupancy of ABF1 sites.2 Fortunately however, we had a partial loss-of-function mutant allele of the TBP gene ABF1 element, termed mutant 32 (Fig.1 B). This mutant supports ∼50% of WT levels of transcription, and importantly for this experiment, shows only about half of the WT level of ABF1 element occupancy. Thus mutant 3 was an ideal strain for testing the effects of Abf1p overexpression since Abf1p-dependent changes (increases) in transcription should readily be measurable in yeast cells both overexpressing Abf1p and carrying this mutant ABF1 binding site. Conversely overexpression of Abf1p in cells carrying the WT PED variant ABF1 element should be without effect on transcription. We generated yeast strains containing a high copy (2μ) expression plasmid where ABF1 sequences were driven by the UASGAL enhancer (or pRS426 plasmid control) as well as either of two SPT15::lacZ reporter gene constructs. One reporter plasmid contained TBP gene WT sequences (−1076 to +198) driving lacZ transcription while the second carried TBP gene ABF1 mutant 3 sequences in the same −1076 to +198 backbone, driving lacZ. Cells were initially grown in the nonrepressing sugar raffinose then each culture was split and either maintained in raffinose or supplemented with galactose in order to induce overexpression of Abf1p from the UASGAL enhancer. Abf1p and β-galactosidase levels were then monitored in these cells as a function of time. As shown by the Abf1p-immunoblot presented in Fig. 1 A we were able to effect a dramatic (≥40 times) overexpression of Abf1p in a galactose- and ABF1 ORF-dependent fashion in these cells. In cells carrying WT TBP gene sequences fused tolacZ, β-galactosidase reporter levels (at ∼100 units) were essentially unchanged over the 20-h time course of this experiment regardless of carbon source or Abf1p expression levels (Fig.1 B, top set of four solid curves,circles, and squares). In contrast, in cells carrying the mutant 3 form of ABF1 element driving lacZ, β-galactosidase levels slowly rose from 50% WT level (∼50 units of β-galactosidase) to almost WT PED-driven levels (∼80 units of β-galactosidase) by 15 h of post-galactose induction (Fig.1 B, bottom set of four dashed curves). β-Galactosidase levels rose significantly compared with control cultures beginning 8 h after galactose addition. Induction of Abf1p, first observed at 4 h, preceded the kinetics of induction of β-galactosidase. These results strongly support the hypothesis that Abf1p, working through the PED variant ABF1 element, directly drives transcription of the gene encoding TBP in yeast cells. Our second set of in vivo analyses examined the effect of ABF1 loss of function mutants on TBP gene ABF1 element occupancy and transcription. For these experiments we utilized yeast strains bearing temperature sensitive conditional lethal mutations in the ABF1 gene as well as the isogenic wild-type control strains (18Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Loo S. Laurenson P. Foss M. Dillin A. Rine J. Genetics. 1995; 141: 889-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mutant,abf1-1, contains a mutation in the portion of theABF1 gene which encodes the putative zinc finger motif in the DNA binding domain of Abf1p (20Diffley J.F.X. Stillman B. Science. 1989; 246: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Abf1p produced fromabf1-1 cells completely fails to bind DNA in vitro indicating that its activity is severely compromised (18Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Using the abf1-1 ts strain JCA31 and the WT control strain JCA30, at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, we performed parallel sets of time course experiments where we simultaneously measured both ABF1 site occupancy and mRNA 5′-end production from the TBP gene and other “Abf1p-driven” genes in the same cells. Upon shifting cells to the nonpermissive temperature, thereby reducing the concentration of functional Abf1p in theabf1-1 cells, we expected to observe dramatic decreases in both ABF1 element occupancy and gene transcription in a strain-specific fashion. The results of the genomic footprinting analyses to assess cis-element occupancy are presented in Fig. 2. DMS footprints were performed on yeast cells expressing either WT or mutant Abf1p at various times after cultures were shifted from permissive (25 °C) to nonpermissive (37 °C) temperatures (Fig. 2 A; ABF1 cells labeled WT and 25 or 37 °C; abf1-1 cells labeledabf1-1 and 25 or 37 °C, respectively). It is important to note that the in vitro half-time for Abf1p dissociation from either a consensus ABF1 element or variant PED element (t1/2 about 30 min at 25 °C and 15 min at 37 °C; (data not shown)2 is long relative to the 1 min of DMS treatment performed during the footprinting procedure therefore allowing an accurate assessment of in vivo occupancy to be obtained using this method. Isolated naked yeast genomic DNA was also reacted with DMS and served as DMS reactivity control for each gene (lanes marked N). The positive control genes used here either contained consensus (RPL2A (21Della Seta F.D. Ciafre S. Marck C. Santoro B. Presutti C. Sentenac A. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2437-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TCM1 (22Hamil K. Nan H. Fried H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4328-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), QCR8 (23De Winde J.H. Van Leeuwen H.C. Grivell L.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) or a nonconsensus Abf1p binding sites (RPL2B) (21Della Seta F.D. Ciafre S. Marck C. Santoro B. Presutti C. Sentenac A. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2437-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Abf1p has been implicated as a key transcription factor, one required for high level expression for all of these genes. Simultaneously analyzing all of these genes allowed us to calibrate our assay with bona fide positive and negative signals for comparison to the results we obtained with the TBP-encoding gene. Abf1p produced from the WT ABF1allele binds the ABF1 cis-elements in all of these genes quite avidly in a temperature independent fashion (occupancy ≥ 90%; Fig. 2A and B). In some of these genes, there are two highly DMS-reactive residues (all marked by arrowheads; Fig. 2A) such as TCM1and the TBP-encoding gene while in other genes, such asRPL2A and RPL2B, there is but a single DMS-reactive residue. In the ABF1 site of the QCR8 gene there is a single DMS hyperreactive residue (Fig. 2 A). The DMS reactivity patterns of these autoradiograms were quantitated following scanning densitometry and the resulting scans and graphs are presented in Fig. 2 B. In contrast, Abf1p produced from the abf1-1 mutant allele binds the PED/ABF1 element found in the TBP-encoding gene somewhat less efficiently, even at permissive temperatures. Importantly, as predicted, the occupancy of all of the ABF1 cis-elements is lost in cells expressing the mutant Abf1p when they are shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 2, A and B). In fact, loss of occupancy of the ABF1 cis-element sites is apparent at the earliest time point measured (labeled 0*) approximately 3–4 min after the temperature shift on all of these genes. Occupancy of other, non-ABF1 cis-elements in each of these promoters is not affected by the temperature shift at least over the 4 h time course examined here (data not shown). Because of this very rapid and element-selective loss of DNA occupancy observed only in theabf1-1 strain, and only at high temperatures, we conclude that it is Abf1p which is bound to the ABF1 sites on all of these genesin vivo. We next wanted to analyze the kinetics of mRNA 5′-end production from both the TBP-encoding gene and from our positive (RPL2A, RPL2B, TCM1, andQCR8) and negative (TAF25) control genes. We chose TAF25 as a non-Abf1p-regulated gene since there are no ABF1 sites within the 1000 base pairs of DNA either upstream or downstream of the TAF25 ORF. Our goal was to perform these analyses on RNA extracted from the exact same cultures of cells which were probed for cis-element occupancy by DMS footprinting (Fig. 2). Before these experiments could be performed, however, we first needed to define the parameters of mRNA metabolism in the yeast strains that we were using for our experiments. First we needed to show that the half-lives of the relevant mRNAs were significantly shorter than the time course of our temperature shift experiment. Second, we needed to demonstrate that total mRNA synthesis and degradation was not deranged in abf1-1 cells at either permissive or nonpermissive temperatures. If both of these criteria were met then we could in fact use primer extension quantitation of mRNA 5′-end production as a valid metric of transcription. The half-lives of each of the relevant mRNAs were measured using a yeast strain expressing the rpb1-1 mutation (24Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This mutant gene encodes for a thermosensitive form of the largest subunit of RNAP II, Rpb1p. mRNA synthesis in yeast cells carrying this mutant gene abruptly and specifically ceases when these cells are shifted to nonpermissive temperatures. Utilization of the rpb1-1carrying strain is a facile method for measuring mRNA half-lives in yeast (17Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment are presented in Fig.3. From these data we estimate the half-lives of mRNAs transcribed from the TBP-encoding gene andTAF25, TCM1, RPL2A, RPL2B,PGK, and QCR8 genes to be approximately 15, 2, 10, 20, 6, 30, and 10 min, respectively. It is interesting that the half-lives of mRNATBP and mRNATAF25 are so different. The mRNAPGK t1/2 value determined by Herrick et al. (17Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) agrees well with the 30-min value that we have obtained validating our measurements. Even the half-life of mRNAPGK , at 30 min, is short relative to the 4-h time course of our temperature shift experiment. To show that a shift of culture temperature per se did not generally alter bulk mRNA metabolism, we prepared total RNA from abf1-1 and ABF1 strains and examined these RNA preparations for total mRNA levels. Using slot blot hybridization of total RNA, and probing these blots with32P-labeled oligo(dT), we quantitated total mRNA levels at hourly intervals in both WT and abf1-1 cells at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. The cells used for this analysis were taken from the exact same cultures analyzed for ABF1 element occupancy (cf. Fig. 2). This method has been used extensively by others for the measurement of total mRNA synthesis rates (15Choder M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2315-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Kim S. Na J.G. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, there is no dramatic change in mRNA content in either strain regardless of temperature since steady state mRNA levels remain roughly constant over the entire 4-h time period. Clearly for us to observe this result neither mRNA synthesis nor mRNA degradation rates can vary significantly in these cells. We also performed direct measurements of bulk mRNA half-lives using the slot blot method using RNA prepared from abf1-1 andABF1 containing cells that had been treated with the antibiotic thiolutin, a potent in vivo and in vitro inhibitor of fungal DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (data not shown). The results of this experiment support the conclusion that bulk mRNA synthesis and degradation rates are constant in both cell types at both temperatures since total mRNA half-lives were not much different between the two cells types (abf1-1 cells ∼10–15 min; ABF1 cells 15–20 min). Such results (i.e. that bulk mRNAs are not globally stabilized in abf1-1 cells at nonpermissive temperatures) is consistent with RNA pulse labeling studies reported by Rhode et al. (18Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), who showed that total RNA synthesis inabf1-1 cells was lower than WT cells at elevated temperatures. Taken together then, the in vivo footprinting (Fig. 2), the mRNA half-life (Fig. 3), and the mRNA stability data (Fig. 4) clearly indicate that we can confidently perform and interpret ourabf1-1/ABF1 temperature shift loss of function experiment since shifting cells bearing the abf1-1 mutation to high temperatures, although clearly causing dramatic alterations in ABF1 element occupancy, induces no artifacts in total mRNA metabolism. The results of our temperature shift-ABF1 loss of function-specific transcription assays are shown in Fig. 5 A and graphically in Fig. 5 B. Only the specific extended products are shown in Fig. 5 A; however, for all mRNAs measured we were in primer excess (data not shown). In this experiment we monitored mRNATBP 5′-end production in yeast cells expressing WT and ts mutant Abf1p at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Even after 4 h at the nonpermissive temperature there was no significant decrease in mRNA 5′- end production from any of the genes analyzed, except for mRNATCM1 . This result is in stark contrast with the observation that ABF1 occupancy by Abf1p was lost within minutes after the temperature shift in these same cells. In the case ofTCM1, transcription was affected by the shift to 37 °C, but this decrease was observed in both the wild-type (JCA30) and mutant strain (JCA31). We measured the effect of the temperature shift upon the viability of JCA31 cells. Viability drops to ∼75% at 2 h and to ∼50% at 4 h after a shift of the abf1-1 cells to the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5 B, dashed line). We have also performed these in vivofootprinting/transcriptional analyses with three other temperature-sensitive, loss of function mutant alleles ofABF1, abf1-5 (18Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and abf1-102 andabf1-104 (19Loo S. Laurenson P. Foss M. Dillin A. Rine J. Genetics. 1995; 141: 889-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these threeabfts mutants shows temperature-sensitive ABF1 DNA binding in vivo, nor did they show defects in transcription of the TBP-encoding gene at the nonpermissive temperature. We hypothesize on the basis of the data of Fig. 5 and the results of the genomic ABF1 element occupancy analyses (Fig. 2) that transcription of all of these “Abf1p-driven” genes (i.e. SPT15, RPL2A, RPL2B, TCM1, or QCR8) apparently does not require Abf1p occupancy of the ABF1 cis-element for continuous high level transcription. The implications of this striking result vis-à-vistranscription are discussed below. In the present study we attempted to take a direct genetic approach to demonstrate that Abf1p actually drives transcription of the yeast TBP-encoding gene inside the cell. To accomplish this objective we coupled genetic gain and loss of function experiments with in vivo analyses of ABF1 occupancy, SPT15::lacZexpression and assays of TBP gene transcription. The salient features of our approach to analyze the function of Abf1p in TBP gene transcription are worthy of note. First, our two metrics of transcriptional activity, β-galactosidase enzyme levels and mRNATBP 5′-end production actually measure “transcription” in two distinct yet complementary ways. One is a “chronic” measure (β-galactosidase) while the other is an “acute” measure of transcription (mRNATBP 5′-end production) at least in yeast cells. This is due to the fact that the half-lives of the molecules being measured are so dramatically different. β-Galactosidase has a reported half-life of ≥20 h in yeast cells (27Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) while, as measured here, mRNATBP has a half-life of ≤15 min. Clearly measurement of β-galactosidase levels can readily be used to chronically assess the requirement(s) for the integrity and/or function of distinct TBP gene cis/trans-elements2 (9Schroeder S.C. Wang C.K. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28335-28346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although perfectly appropriate for the ABF1 gain of function experiments presented in Fig. 1 where we were expecting to observe an increase in reporter gene expression, analysis of β-galactosidase levels would be wholly inappropriate for our ABF1 loss of function studies because we would be looking for short term rapid (i.e. min) decreases in the level of a very long lived (i.e. hours) reporter. Fortunately both mRNATBP 5′-end analyses and genomic DMS footprinting represent appropriate analytical tools to acutely measure transcription and ABF1 element occupancy, particularly over the four hour time course of our temperature-shift experiments which utilize the mutant abf1-1-containing yeast strain. Use of these two biochemical analyses (mRNA 5′-end analysis/genomic footprinting) allowed us to take accurate molecular “snapshots” of both TBP gene transcription and PED occupancy as a function of time after inactivation of the ability of Abf1p to bind DNA as induced by shifting cells carrying the abf1-1 allele to the nonpermissive temperature. Quite surprisingly, as shown in the data of Figs. 2 and 5, Abf1p occupancy of the TBP gene ABF1 element is not required for continuous transcription in vivo. In fact as shown above, ABF1 element occupancy is apparently not required for transcription of other ostensibly “known” Abf1p-driven genes such as RPL2A andRPL2B (21Della Seta F.D. Ciafre S. Marck C. Santoro B. Presutti C. Sentenac A. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2437-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TCM1 (22Hamil K. Nan H. Fried H. Mol. Cell.
