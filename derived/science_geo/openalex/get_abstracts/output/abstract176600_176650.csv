We subjected populations of an exploited fish (Menidia menidia) to large, small, or random size-selective harvest of adults over four generations. Harvested biomass evolved rapidly in directions counter to the size-dependent force of fishing mortality. Large-harvested populations initially produced the highest catch but quickly evolved a lower yield than controls. Small-harvested populations did the reverse. These shifts were caused by selection of genotypes with slower or faster rates of growth. Management tools that preserve natural genetic variation are necessary for long-term sustainable yield."

A., and Yuan, J. (2000) Nature 403, 98–103), yet the functional consequences of caspase-12 activation have been unclear. We have shown that recombinant caspase-12 specifically cleaves and activates procaspase-9 in cytosolic extracts. The activated caspase-9 catalyzes cleavage of procaspase-3, which is inhibitable by a caspase-9-specific inhibitor.

These results suggest that caspase-12 can activate caspase-9 without involvement of cytochrome c. To examine the role of caspase-12 in the activation of downstream caspases, we used a caspase-12-binding protein, which we identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, for regulation of caspase-12 activation. The binding protein protects procaspase-12 from processing in vitro. Stable expression of the binding protein renders procaspase-12 insensitive to ER stress, thereby suppressing apoptosis and the activation of caspase-9 and -3. These data suggest that procaspase-9 is a substrate of caspase-12 and that ER stress triggers a specific cascade involving caspase-12, -9, and -3 in a cytochromec-independent manner. Activation of caspase-12 from procaspase-12 is specifically induced by insult to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Nakagawa, T., Zhu, H., Morishima, N., Li, E., Xu, J., Yankner, B. A., and Yuan, J.

Lazebnik Y. Science (Wash. D. C.). 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar, 5Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Caspases are constitutively expressed in healthy cells, where they are synthesized as precursor proteins (procaspases). Caspases are activated upon processing of procaspases into ∼20-kDa (p20) and 10-kDa (p10) mature fragments, in addition to the N-terminal prodomain. The caspase family is broadly divided into two groups: initiator caspases (caspase-8, -9, and -12) and effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). Initiator caspases undergo autoprocessing for activation in response to apoptotic stimuli. Active initiator caspases in turn process precursors of the effector caspases responsible for dismantling cellular structures. Recent studies have suggested the existence of a novel apoptotic pathway in which caspase-12 functions as the initiator caspase in response to a toxic insult to the ER,1 such as by treatment with tunicamycin (an inhibitor of glycosylation), thapsigargin (an inhibitor of the ER-specific calcium ATPase), or calcium ionophores (1Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Caspase-12 is specifically activated in cells subjected to ER stress. Furthermore, caspase-12-deficient cells are resistant to inducers of ER stress, suggesting that caspase-12 is significant in ER stress-induced apoptosis (1Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). ER stress has received growing attention because it is considered a cause of pathologically relevant apoptosis, and it is particularly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (6Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of caspase-12-mediated apoptosis has been unknown, mainly due to the lack of identification of caspase-12 substrates. In this study, we have examined the susceptibility of procaspases to active caspase-12 and have shown that procaspase-9 can specifically be cleaved by caspase-12 in vitro. Recent studies show that multiple death signals converge on the mitochondrion (7Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B.

Damaged mitochondria release cytochromec, which facilitates conformational changes in Apaf-1, the specific activator of procaspase-9 (2Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Active caspase-9 then activates caspase-3, the major effector caspase that is responsible for destruction of various substrates (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science (Wash. D. C.). 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar, 5Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Cytochromec release from mitochondria has also been observed in ER stress-induced apoptosis of several cell lines, including mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (10Ito Y. Mishra N. Kumar S. Narula N. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6233-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Ha¨cki J. Egger L. Monney L. Conus S., T., R. Fellay I. Borner C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The in vitro cleavage of procaspase-9 by caspase-12 described above can be achieved in the absence of cytochrome c, suggesting the presence of the ER stress-specific caspase cascade, which comprises caspase-12, -9, and -3 in this order. For examination of the role of caspase-12 in activation of the caspase cascade in vivo, however, it would be desirable to use conditions in which cytochrome c is not released from mitochondria; otherwise, caspase-9 could be activated by the cytochrome c·Apaf-1 mechanism, independent of caspase-12. We thus used a murine myoblast cell line, C2C12, to study caspase-12, because our preliminary data showed that ER stress induces the activation of caspase-12 and apoptosis in the cell line without the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This result suggests that cytochrome c release is not essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis. We took advantage of the fact that cytochromec is not released to examine the mechanism of caspase cascade activation in the absence of mitochondrial damage, focusing on events that occur downstream of caspase-12 activation. C2C12 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Apoptosis was induced in cultured cells by adding the following reagents in culture medium unless otherwise stated: 2 μg/ml tunicamycin, 1 μm thapsigargin, and 10 μg/ml etoposide. Apoptosis was induced in C2C12 cells, and then the cells were stained with the MitoSensor reagent (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The C2C12 cell 100,000 × g supernatant was prepared according to the method described in Liu and Wang (12Liu X. Wang X. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 177-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were disrupted in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose by a Dounce homogenizer. The supernatant was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and subsequently at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Anti-MAGE-3 (melanoma-associated antigen-3) polyclonal antibody was generated by immunization of rabbit with a synthetic peptide (CHISYPPLHEWVLREGEE) as described previously (13Nakanishi K. Maruyama M. Shibata T. Morishima N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41237-41244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies for Western blot analysis were used at the following dilutions: anti-MAGE-3 polyclonal antibody, 1:400; anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:1,000; anti-hexahistidine tag monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH), 1:5,000; anti-caspase-12 rat monoclonal antibody (1Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar), 1:100; anti-MAGE-3 monoclonal antibody (14Kocher T. Schultz-Thater E.

Primary antibodies on Western blots were detected as described previously (15Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The split LexA protein system was used for two-hybrid screening according to the method of Brent as described by Gyuris et al. (16Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The caspase-12 p10 fragment (Thr319-Asn419) was used as the bait for the screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library. From ∼2 × 107 transformants, we obtained 15 positive clones, all of which contained sequences derived from the MAGE-3 mRNA. The 5′ ends of the cDNAs were located between codons 81 and 94. We cloned the full-length coding region of MAGE-3 (314 amino acids) for further analysis by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). Immunoprecipitation was performed after COS-1 cells (1.8 × 105 seed cells) were transfected with 5 μg of DNA. At 2 days post-transfection, cells were lysed at 0 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, and a COMPLETE protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG (M2) affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4–5 h at 0 °C. Proteins that bound the affinity resin were analyzed by Western blotting. Caspase-12- or MAGE-3 cDNA was cloned into the vector pRSET (Invitrogen) and used for transformation of BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. The histidine-tagged proteins synthesized inEscherichia coli were purified on a Probond Ni-column resin (Invitrogen). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MAGE-3 fusion was generated by inserting MAGE-3 cDNA into a pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-MAGE-3 was purified from E. coli lysates by batch-chromatography with glutathione Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST-MAGE-3 protein (1 μg) and histidine-tagged caspase-12 (0.1 μg) were incubated with 10 μl of glutathione Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature in 150 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.02% Triton X-100. Anti-hexahistidine monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) was used for the detection of caspase-12 p20. Proteins that bound glutathione resin were analyzed by Western blotting. In vitro synthesis of 35S-labeled proteins and their detection by autoradiography were achieved as described previously (15Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For mutant analysis, mutations at specific aspartic acid residues in procaspases were introduced by the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Introduction of mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 35S-labeled procaspase (0.2 μl of the labeled protein solution) was incubated for a cleavage assay at 37 °C with caspase-12 (0.28 μg) for 4 h. Resistance of procaspase-12 to cleavage by active caspase-12 was examined by addition of recombinant MAGE-3 to the procaspase-12 cleavage assay solution. Procaspase-12 whose active site Cys residue had been replaced with Ser was synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. 35S-Labeled mutant procaspase-12 (0.2 μl of the labeled protein solution) was incubated with active caspase-12 (0.28 μg) for 45 min in the presence or absence of MAGE-3. Cytochrome c-free cytosol from C2C12 cells (10 μg of proteins) was treated with recombinant caspase-12 p30 (0.8 μg) at 37 °C for 4 h. Activation of caspase-9 and -3 was examined by Western blot analysis. Five micrograms of proteins were loaded on each lane. As a positive control for caspase-9 activation, the cytochrome c-free cytosol was incubated with 10 μm bovine cytochrome c (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mm dATP for 60 min at 37 °C. For inhibition of caspase-9 activity, LEHD-fluoromethylketone (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA) was added to the cytosol before the addition of caspase-12. MAGE-3 stable cell lines of C2C12 were generated as follows. MAGE-3 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid DNA was linearized by ScaI digestion before transfection. Transfection was performed with a Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MAGE-3 cDNA cloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen) was used for stable transfection. Stable transfectants were grown in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks before cloning. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with either anti-caspase-12 monoclonal (1Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar) or anti-MAGE-3 polyclonal antibody (this study). Primary antibodies were detected with either Alexa594-coujugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500) or a combination of biotin-labeled anti-rat IgG antibodies (1:500) and Alexa488-coujugated avidin (1:1,000). These reagents were obtained from Molecular Probes. Images were captured with a cooled charge-coupled device camera mounted on an Olympus IX70 microscope. We examined how caspase-12 processing is linked to the activation of other caspases. For an in vitro cleavage assay, we produced recombinant caspase-12 (p30) whose N-terminal prodomain had been removed and replaced with a hexahistidine tag. The p30 protein undergoes efficient autoprocessing into p20 and p10 peptides when overexpressed in E. coli (p30* in Fig. 1A). A mutant p30 (p30C/S), whose active site Cys is substituted with Ser, is not processed in E. coli (Fig. 1A). The mature caspase-12 (p30*) exhibits proteolytic activity and cleaves procaspase-12 into 35- and 12-kDa fragments (Fig. 1B,lane 16). The cleavage site was located at Asp318, because a procaspase-12 mutant in which Asp318 was replaced with Ser was resistant to caspase-12 digestion (data not shown). Asp318 is also the cleavage site for autoprocessing in E. coli (Fig.1A), as revealed by amino acid sequencing of p10 by the Edman degradation method (data not shown). p30* cleaves caspase-9 (Fig.1, B and C) but not other caspase precursors (murine caspase-1 and -2, and human caspase-3, -6, and -8) under the experimental conditions. Note that processing site sequences between p20 and p10 are highly conserved between murine and human caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8. Mutation analysis of caspase-9 (Fig. 1C) indicates that caspase-12 cleaves at specific Asp residues in the linker region between p20 and p10 in the procaspase-9 polypeptide (LDSD349 and SEPD353 in the murine caspase-9, PEPD315 in the human caspase-9). Asp353 of the murine caspase-9 and Asp315 of human caspase-9 have been reported to be the cleavage sites for the activation of procaspase-9 (17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 18Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The caspase-9 cleavage observed in vitro thus suggests the possibility that caspase-9 can be activated by caspase-12 during ER stress-induced apoptosis. Under the experimental conditions used, murine caspase-9 contains another cleavage site(s) for caspase-12in vitro, cleavage at which generates 27- and 20-kDa fragments. We did not further analyze these additional cleavage site(s) because we could detect neither 27- nor 20-kDa caspase-9 fragments in apoptotic cells (described below; data not shown). Procaspase-7 seems to be only slightly processed by active caspase-12 (Fig. 1B,lane 10). The in vitro cleavage of procaspase-7 was not studied further because processing of procaspase-7 is undetectable in C2C12 cells subjected to ER stress (Fig.1D). Several reports have demonstrated that ER stress causes mitochondrial damage, which results in cytochrome crelease from mitochondria (e.g., Refs. 10Ito Y. Mishra N. Kumar S. Narula N. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6233-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Ha¨cki J. Egger L. Monney L. Conus S., T., R. Fellay I. Borner C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cytochromec in cytosol and Apaf-1 can induce activation of caspase-9 (2Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar, 3Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). To examine whether there is an ER stress-specific caspase cascade that is initiated by caspase-12, we used a murine myoblast cell line, C2C12, because this cell line undergoes ER stress-induced apoptosis without cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Cytosolic extracts (S-100) of tunicamycin- or thapsigargin-treated C2C12 cells contain cytochrome c at the same level as that detected in S-100 fractions prepared from untreated cells (Fig.2A). Nevertheless, more than 50% of the cells undergo apoptosis (see below). Cytochromec release per se, however, is functional in C2C12 cells, because treatment of C2C12 cells with etoposide or serum deprivation induces apoptosis at a similar level of lethality and with a significant release of cytochrome c. After apoptosis was induced by ER stress inducers, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was maintained in apoptotic cells (small cells with condensed nuclei), as in the case of untreated cells, which was exhibited by mitochondrial accumulation of fluorochromes and their conversion to emit the orange color (Fig. 2B). Etoposide-treatment of C2C12 cells resulted in decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which was monitored by the green color of the fluorochromes in the cytosol (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that mitochondria in C2C12 cells do not suffer severe damages from ER stress, thus releasing little cytochrome c into cytosol. Treatment of C2C12 cells with ER stress inducers, either tunicamycin or thapsigargin, results in the processing of procaspase-12 (48 kDa, Fig.2C) and apoptosis. A 35-kDa fragment was detected by antibodies specific to the p20 region (1Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 and caspase-3 are also activated in C2C12 cells treated with ER stress inducers (Fig.2C). The activation of caspase-3, one of the most downstream caspases, suggests that the ER stress-specific caspase cascade comprises caspase-12, -9, and -3. It has been suggested that calpain is involved in activation of caspases in cultured glial cells after deprivation of oxygen and glucose (19Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). In the apoptotic C2C12 cells, however, cleavage of a calpain substrate, Bcl-XL, was not detected (Fig. 2C), suggesting that caspase activation in C2C12 cells treated with ER stress inducers is independent of calpain. We then examined whether caspase-9 activation occurs by the cleavage of procaspase-9 by active caspase-12 without the release of cytochrome c in cell extracts. Incubation of the S-100 fraction of untreated C2C12 cells with active caspase-12 results in a pattern of cleavage of procaspase-9 that is similar to that observed in S-100 of apoptotic C2C12 cells, the cleavage products being a doublet of 35-kDa fragments (Fig. 3A, lanes 2and 4). A control experiment showed that addition of cytochrome c and dATP to S-100 of untreated cells also caused processing of procaspase-9 into 35-kDa fragments that appeared as a doublet on the blot (Fig. 3B, lane 3). The lower band was less intense than the upper band in the case of caspase-12-induced processing (Fig. 3B, lane 2) and the apoptotic S-100 fractions (lane 4). The ratio of these 35-kDa fragments was different from that observed in the cytochrome c-treated S-100 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). It remains to be revealed whether the difference in the ratio of these fragments reflects a difference in mechanism of processing. The cleavage of procaspase-9 is not suppressed in the presence of a caspase-9-specific inhibitor LEHD-fluoromethylketone (20Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar), indicating that procaspase-9 is cleaved by active caspase-12, independent of the inherent autoprocessing activity of procaspase-9 (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 4). We then examined caspase-9 activation through detection of specific cleavage at Asp175 within the procaspase-3 polypeptide, the downstream target of caspase-9 (3Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Incubation of the S-100 fraction with caspase-12 causes processing of caspase-3 at Asp175 of ITED175 (Fig.3B, lower panel, lane 3), suggesting that the activated caspase-9 in the S-100 fraction cleaved procaspase-3. The specific cleavage of procaspase-3, but not procaspase-9, can be inhibited by LEHD-fluoromethylketone, (Fig.3B, lane 4). This result indicates that cleavage of procaspase-3 is dependent on caspase-9, as already observed for apoptosis induced by various stimuli other than ER stress (3Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

We have recently isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening from a HeLa cell cDNA library a human cancer antigen, MAGE-3, as a protein that specifically binds the caspase-12 p10 fragment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because MAGE-3 can suppress the activity of procaspase-12, as described below, we used the protein to examine the significance of caspase-12 activation in ER stress-induced apoptosis in C2C12 cells. MAGE-3 is a member of theMAGE gene family and is expressed in various types of tumor but not in normal tissues except for the testis (24Van Pel A. van der Bruggen P. Coulie P.G. Brichard V.G. Lethe B. van den Eynde B. Uyttenhove C. Renauld J.C. Boon T. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 145: 229-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the specific interaction between caspase-12 and MAGE-3 is intriguing, it remains unclear whether MAGE-3 plays any role in caspase regulation in human cells (see “Discussion”). MAGE-3 does not bind to other caspases, such as caspase-9 (of either murine or human origin), as tested by the two-hybrid assay (results of murine caspase-1, -9, and -11 and human caspase-3, -6, and -7 are shown in Fig.4A). The MAGE-3 protein can also bind both the caspase-12 p10 fragment and procaspase-12 in mammalian cells. When MAGE-3 is expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection it can be co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged p10 (Fig. 4B, lane 3) or FLAG-tagged procaspase-12 (lane 7) using an anti-FLAG antibody. MAGE-3 was not co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged p10 fragments of murine caspase-2 and human caspase-8, whose binding ability could not be examined by the two-hybrid assay because of significant background activity (data not shown). Fig. 4C shows that p30C/S (unprocessed p30) co-precipitates with GST-tagged MAGE-3 (lanes 3 and 4). Under the same conditions, however, p30* (processed) is not efficiently co-precipitated by GST-MAGE-3 (Fig.4C, lanes 1and 2), suggesting that MAGE-3 does not efficiently bind the p10 fragment in active caspase-12. It is possible that the p10 fragment within mature caspase-12 is not fully accessible to MAGE-3 because of steric hindrance by the p20 portion. X-ray crystallographic analyses of caspase-1 and caspase-3 have suggested that they undergo a conformational change upon maturation (25Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This conformational change may occur in caspase-12 and result in the p10 fragment being less exposed for binding to MAGE-3. Consistent with the binding of MAGE-3 to unprocessed caspase-12, MAGE-3 protects procaspase-12 from cleavage by active p30* in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D, lanes 2–7). Substitution of MAGE-3 with bovine serum albumin fails to inhibit cleavage (Fig. 4D, lane 9). It is less likely that MAGE-3 blocks active caspase-12 by acting as a competitive inhibitor. In Fig. 4D, lane 7, small amounts of the 35- and 12-kDa fragments can be detected, indicating the presence of caspase-12 activity. Under such conditions, excessive levels of active caspase-12 are expected to be protected from inhibition by MAGE-3. However, an enhancement of cleavage was not detected in the presence of 4-fold higher levels of caspase-12 (lane 8). In contrast, when twice as much substrate is added to the reaction mixture in the presence of MAGE-3, both p35 and p12 cleavage products are produced at the same levels as in the absence of MAGE-3 (Fig.4E, lane 2). It is more likely that MAGE-3 protects procaspase-12 from processing by specifically binding the p10 portion of the precursor. This result is consistent with our observation that the affinity of MAGE-3 for p30C/S is muc"

We demonstrated sequence-specific molecular lithography on substrate DNA molecules by harnessing homologous recombination by RecA protein. In a sequence-specific manner, we patterned the coating of DNA with metal, localized labeled molecular objects and grew metal islands on specific sites along the DNA substrate, and generated molecularly accurate stable DNA junctions for patterning the DNA substrate connectivity. In our molecular lithography, the information encoded in the DNA molecules replaces the masks used in conventional microelectronics, and the RecA protein serves as the resist. The molecular lithography works with high resolution over a broad range of length scales from nanometers to many micrometers."

We show that the feedback de-excitation is important for plant fitness in the field and in fluctuating light in a controlled environment but that it does not affect plant performance under constant light conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the feedback de-excitation confers a strong fitness advantage under field conditions and suggest that this advantage is due to the increase in plant tolerance to variation in light intensity rather than tolerance to high-intensity light itself."
https://openalex.org/W2119343066,"The oxysterol-activated liver X receptor (LXR) provides a link between sterol and fatty acid metabolism; activation of LXR induces transcription of lipogenic genes. This study shows that induction of the lipogenic genes Srebp-1c, Fas, and Acc1 upon administration of the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 to C57BL/6J mice (10 mg/kg/day, 4 days) is associated with massive hepatic steatosis along the entire liver lobule and a 2.5-fold increase in very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) secretion. The increased VLDL-TG secretion was fully accounted for by formation of larger (129 +/- 9 nm versus 94 +/- 12 nm, a 2.5-fold increase of particle volume) TG-rich particles. Stimulation of VLDL-TG secretion did not lead to elevated plasma TG levels in C57BL/6J mice, indicating efficient particle metabolism and clearance. However, T0901317 treatment did lead to severe hypertriglyceridemia in mouse models of defective TG-rich lipoprotein clearance, i.e. APOE*3-Leiden transgenic mice (3.2-fold increase) and apoE-/- LDLr-/- double knockouts (12-fold increase). Incubation of rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells with T0901317 also resulted in intracellular TG accumulation and enhanced TG secretion. We conclude that, in addition to raising high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, pharmacological LXR activation in mice leads to development of hepatic steatosis and secretion of atherogenic, large TG-rich VLDL particles."

We report a method to obtain stable mutants of a gene based on knowledge of the gene sequence only. Parental fish were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea; in 2679 F1 fish, the rag1 gene was analyzed for heterozygous mutations by resequencing. In total, we found 15 mutations: 9 resulted in amino acid substitutions and 1 resulted in a premature stop codon. This truncation mutant was found to be homozygous viable and defective in V(D)J joining. Although presumably immune deficient, these homozygous rag1 mutant fish are able to reach adulthood and are fertile. As sperm samples from all 2679 F1 fish were collected and cryopreserved, we have in principle generated a mutant library from which mutants of most zebrafish genes can be isolated."

Although there are certain anatomical differences among the Dmanisi specimens, the hominids do not clearly represent more than one taxon. We assign the new skull provisionally to Homo erectus (=ergaster). The Dmanisi specimens are the most primitive and small-brained fossils to be grouped with this species or any taxon linked unequivocally with genus Homo and also the ones most similar to the presumed habilis-like stem. We suggest that the ancestors of the Dmanisi population dispersed from Africa before the emergence of humans identified broadly with the H. erectus grade."
https://openalex.org/W2089926531,"Information in neurons flows from synapses, through the dendrites and cell body (soma), and, finally, along the axon as spikes of electrical activity that will ultimately release neurotransmitters from the nerve terminals. However, the dendrites of many neurons also have a secretory role, transmitting information back to afferent nerve terminals. In some central nervous system neurons, spikes that originate at the soma can travel along dendrites as well as axons, and may thus elicit secretion from both compartments. Here, we show that in hypothalamic oxytocin neurons, agents that mobilize intracellular Ca(2+) induce oxytocin release from dendrites without increasing the electrical activity of the cell body, and without inducing secretion from the nerve terminals. Conversely, electrical activity in the cell bodies can cause the secretion of oxytocin from nerve terminals with little or no release from the dendrites. Finally, mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) can also prime the releasable pool of oxytocin in the dendrites. This priming action makes dendritic oxytocin available for release in response to subsequent spike activity. Priming persists for a prolonged period, changing the nature of interactions between oxytocin neurons and their neighbours."

KK/San mice show low plasma lipid levels compared with wild-type KK mice despite showing signs of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

In most cases, the mutated genes have not yet been identified, but elucidating the mutations could lead to the identification of the relevant genes. KK obese mice have a multigenic syndrome of moderate obesity and a diabetic phenotype that resembles human hereditary type 2 diabetes; they show signs of hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia (8Kondo K. Nozawa K. Tomita T. Ezaki K. Bull. Exp. Anim. 1957; 6: 107-112Crossref Google Scholar, 9Nakamura M. Yamada K. Diabetologia. 1967; 3: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Nakamura M. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1962; 38: 348-352Crossref Google Scholar). We have found that KK mice in our laboratory (KK/San) have significantly low plasma lipid levels despite showing signs of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia (11Shiraki T. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Diabetes Frontier. 1993; 4: 641Google Scholar). Genetic analysis shows that the mutant phenotype of KK/San mice is inherited recessively as a Mendelian trait. We therefore named this locus hypl (for hypolipidemia). We observed the autosomal recessive hyplphenotype in the progeny of the KK/San strain and mapped the locus to the middle of chromosome 4. We identified a mutation in the gene encoding angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3) as the cause of the hypl trait (12Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The mRNA of Angptl3is predominantly localized in the liver. The expression ofAngptl3 in KK/San mice was found to be 1/30 to 1/40 that of wild-type mice. Overexpression of Angptl3 using adenoviruses or by an intravenous injection of the recombinant protein in KK/San mice elicited a marked increase in circulating plasma total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs),1 and especially triglyceride levels (12Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Angptl3 is ∼7 kb long and is composed of seven exons, the last four of which located at the carboxyl terminus end of the protein and encode the fibrinogen-like domain. The amino terminus contains a putative signal sequence and a coiled-coil domain. COS-1 and CHO-K1 cells transfected with SRα promoter-driven mammalian cell expression vectors containing ANGPTL3 cDNA secreted a major ANGPTL3 protein of ∼70 kDa. Deglycosylation reduced the apparent molecular mass of the recombinant ANGPTL3 to 53 kDa as predicted by sequence analysis. Angiopoietins are members of the vascular endothelial growth factor family (13Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C.

They have fibrinogen-like domains that are conserved and are predicted to come into direct contact with receptors (15Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In contrast with other members of the angiopoietin family, however, ANGPTL3 lacks this motif, and preliminary data obtained from a BIAcore assay indicate that ANGPTL3 does not bind Tie2, an angiopoietin receptor. ANGPTL3 is involved primarily in the regulation of lipid metabolism rather than in mediating the growth of vascular epithelium. Although ANGPTL3 regulates lipid metabolism, the direct effect of ANGPTL3 on VLDL triglyceride metabolism has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of a mutation in a gene encoding Angptl3 on VLDL metabolism was investigated by performing VLDL turnover studies in KK/San and wild-type KK mice. We found that KK/San mice showed enhanced VLDL clearance compared with wild-type KK mice due to enhanced lipolysis of VLDL triglycerides, whereas VLDL triglyceride production was not affected. We also found that recombinant ANGPTL3 protein directly inhibited LPL activity. Our results suggest that AGNPTL3 affects VLDL triglyceride clearance by interfering with LPL activity. KK mice were obtained from Nagoya University and BALB/c mice from Charles River. The KK mice used were males between 3 and 5 months old, which were housed in a room under controlled temperature (23 ± 1 °C) with free access to water and mouse chow (Oriental Yeast). Total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured enzymatically using assay kits from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The distribution of cholesterol within the plasma lipoproteins was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (17Okazaki M. Komoriya N. Tomoike H. Inoue N. Usui S. Itoh S. Hosaki S. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 709: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Samples of 40 μl of the diluted plasma were applied onto two columns of TSKgel Lipopropak XL (Tosoh). The elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min for the TSK eluent LP-2 (Tosoh) and 0.35 ml/min for the enzyme solution (Determiner LTC, Kyowa Medex Co., Tokyo). The detection of cholesterol in the eluted fractions was carried out at a wavelength of 550 nm following the enzymatic reaction using a computerized system. We isolated full-length mouse Angptl3 cDNA from a KK mouse liver λ-ZAP cDNA library constructed using the ZAP Express cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene). We used a 200-bp PCR-amplified fragment of Angptl3 cDNA (nucleotides 62–260 from the GenBankTM library) as a probe. We obtained full-length human ANGPTL3 cDNA from a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) by plaque hybridization. We digested this cDNA with EcoRI andXbaI and subcloned the resulting fragment into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pME18S (pMEh55-1). We determined the nucleotide sequences of these cloned fragments for both strands using the ABI BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems). We generated recombinant adenoviruses as previously described (18Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) using an Adenovirus Expression Vector Kit (Takara Shuzo). We prepared Ad/lacZ and Ad/Angptl3 by inserting the β-galactosidase and Angptl3 cDNAs, respectively, into the Ad E1-deleted region under the control of the CAG promoter. Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated and purified as described previously (19Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We injected 2 ×109 plaque-forming units of each recombinant adenovirus intravenously to KK/San mice via the tail vein. We obtained blood from the retro-orbital plexus 3 days after injection. Fasted KK/San and wild-type KK mice were injected intravenously with Triton WR1339 (400 mg/kg body weight) using 20% (w/v) Triton solution in 0.9% NaCl (20Otway S. Robinson D.S. J. Physiol. 1967; 190: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Blood samples were drawn from the tail vein at 0, 60, 120, and 180 min after the Triton injection and analyzed for triglycerides as described above. Plasma samples (1 μl/lane) were separated on 2–15% gradient gels (Daiichi Pure Chemicals), and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse apoB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-goat IgG (Chemicon) was used as a secondary antibody, and apoB bands were detected by ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the bands was estimated using an imaging analyzer. In vivo[3H]triglyceride-labeled VLDL turnover studies were based on a previously described method (21Jong M.C. Dahlmans V.E. van Gorp P.J. van Dijk K.W. Breuer M.L. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences) in toluene was evaporated under nitrogen and redissolved in 0.9% NaCl containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml. BALB/c mice were injected intravenously via the tail vein with 100 μCi of the prepared [3H]palmitate and bled from the abdominal aorta 25 min after injection. Radiolabeled VLDL for use in the clearance studies was isolated from the plasma of 20 mice by ultracentrifugation (d < 1.006 g/ml). To study the in vivoclearance of labeled VLDL triglycerides, KK/San and wild-type KK mice were injected intravenously with 500,000 dpm of [3H]triglyceride-labeled VLDL. The clearance rate of the radiolabeled VLDL was determined from 70-μl blood samples from mice, drawn at the specified time points after the injection. Total plasma radioactivity was used to represent VLDL triglyceride radioactivity. Blood was collected from 16 BALB/c mice. Plasma samples were pooled, and VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was obtained by ultracentrifugation. VLDL was labeled with 125I by the ICl method (22Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of 125I-VLDL was ∼300 cpm/ng of protein. Thereafter, the VLDL samples were dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. KK/San and wild-type KK mice were injected into the tail vein with 125I-labeled VLDL (10 μg of tracer in 200 μl of 0.9% NaCl containing 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin). Blood samples of 70 μl were collected from the retro-orbital plexus at the specified time points after the injection. The plasma content of 125I-labeled apoB was determined by measuring the 125I content in the pellet obtained after propan-2-ol precipitation (23Holmquist L. Carlson K. Carlson L.A. Anal.

We digested full-length human ANGPTL3 cDNA with EcoRI andXbaI and subcloned the resulting fragment into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pME18S (pMEh55-1). We transfected the expression vector pMEh55-1 into CHO-K1 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The serum-free culture medium of CHO-K1 cells transfected with the pMEh55-1 expression plasmid DNA was concentrated from 10 to 1 liters. We applied it to a Sephadex 25 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted it with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. We then applied the sample to a Q Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted it with 0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. We next applied the sample to a Cibacron 3GA column (Bio-Rad) and eluted it with 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. The eluate was diluted to 0.5 m NaCl with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. We applied the diluted sample to a lentil-lectin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted it with 0.5 m NaCl, 0.3 mmethylmannopyranoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. Thereafter, we dialyzed the sample against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. Finally, we applied the sample to a Poros Q column (Perspective Biosystems) and eluted it with 0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. Purified bovine milk LPL was obtained from Sigma. The post-heparin medium containing rat LPL was obtained from rat adipocytes. Rat white adipose precursor cells were purchased from Hokudo. The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 17 μmpantothenic acid, 33 μm (+)-biotin, 100 μmascorbic acid, 1 μm octanoic acid, 50 nmtriiodothyronine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (this medium is subsequently referred to as complete DMEM). After the cells had reached confluence, the medium was replaced with the adipocyte induction medium (complete DMEM containing 10 μg/ml insulin and 2.5 μm dexamethasone). Two days after adipocyte induction, the medium was replaced with the maintenance medium (complete DMEM containing 10 μg/ml insulin). After 2 days of incubation, the cells were further incubated for 60 min with 10 units/ml of heparin, and the supernatant (post-heparin medium) was collected for LPL activity assays. LPL activity assays were based on a previously described method (25Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays were carried out in a total volume of 0.2 ml with 0.1 ml of assay substrate and 0.1 ml of enzyme source. The assay substrate solution contained 2 mmglycerol-tri[9,10-3H]oleate, 189 ng/mll-α-phosphatidylcholine, 14 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 140 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 15% glycerol, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 120 min with recombinant ANGPTL3 at a dose of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 μg/ml. The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 mpotassium carbonate-borate buffer (pH 10.5) and 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/hexane 1.41:1.25:1 (v/v/v). The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 15 s and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 15 min. Then, radioactivity in 1 ml of the supernatant was counted using a scintillation counter. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the release of 1 μmol of oleic acid/min at 37 °C. To elucidate the relationship between apoCII and ANGPTL3, human apoCII (Calbiochem) was added instead of fetal bovine serum as the LPL activator. For the HL assay, mouse plasma was used as the source of HL, and the reaction was performed in the same manner as in the LPL assay except that the NaCl concentration used was 1m. We previously reported (12Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) that KK/San mice exhibit extremely low plasma triglyceride levels compared with wild-type KK mice and also that a low level expression of Angptl3 causes hypolipidemia. To investigate the mechanism responsible for the decreased triglyceride levels in KK/San mice, we first analyzed lipoprotein profiles in detail. As shown in Table I, plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in KK/San mice were lower than in wild-type KK mice at the age of 5 months. No significant differences in body weights were observed between the wild-type KK and KK/San mice. To investigate the lipoprotein profile among lipoprotein subclasses, plasma samples of wild-type KK mice and KK/San mice were subjected to HPLC analysis (Fig.1). The lower levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol in KK/San mice were mainly due to a decrease in the fractions of VLDL.Table IPlasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in KK/San and wild-type KK miceStrainAgeBody weightTriglycerideCholesterolmonthsgmg/dlmg/dlKK/San536.8 ± 0.925.8 ± 4.31-ap < 0.001; significantly different from wild-type KK mice, using Student’st test.60.9 ± 3.71-ap < 0.001; significantly different from wild-type KK mice, using Student’st test.Wild-type KK536.6 ± 1.2273.9 ± 38.5114.4 ± 4.6Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured in the plasma of non-fasted KK/San and wild-type KK mice.

Table II shows the plasma lipid levels after the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Angptl3 in KK/San mice. Overexpression of Angptl3 in KK/San mice resulted in a marked increase in plasma triglyceride levels as compared with Ad/lacZ-injected KK/San mice. Although cholesterol levels were only slightly elevated, Ad/Angptl3-injected KK/San mice showed a marked increase in the VLDL fraction (Fig. 1).Table IIPlasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels KK/San mice in after adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ANGPTL3StrainAdenovirusnImmediately after adenovirus injectionDay 3 after adenovirus injectionTriglycerideCholesterolTriglycerideCholesterolmg/dlmg/dlKK/SanAd/lacZ156.0ND65.648.0KK/SanAd/Angptl3349.5 ± 4.9ND700.5 ± 94.590.7 ± 24.4KK/San mice were injected intravenously with 2 ×109plaque-forming units of ad/lacZ or Ad/Angptl3.

Open table in a new tab KK/San mice were injected intravenously with 2 ×109plaque-forming units of ad/lacZ or Ad/Angptl3. Before and 3 days after adenovirus injection, plasma was obtained and analyzed for cholesterol and triglycerides. The values represent means ± S.D. ND, values that were not determined. We also compared the apoB levels of KK/San and wild-type KK mice. No significant differences were observed between the KK/San and wild-type KK mice for plasma apoB100 and apoB48 levels (Fig.2). The predominant decrease in plasma triglycerides rather than cholesterol levels in KK/San mice suggests that ANGPTL3 may interfere with triglyceride metabolism. ANGPTL3 may influence either the VLDL triglyceride secretion or VLDL triglyceride clearance. First, to determine whether the low plasma triglyceride levels in KK/San mice were due to decreased VLDL triglyceride production, we measured the VLDL triglyceride secretion rate by the Triton WR1339 method. As shown in Fig. 3, the increase in plasma triglycerides was equal for wild-type KK and KK/San mice. The VLDL triglyceride secretion rate, calculated based on the experimental data, was not found to be significantly different between KK/San and wild-type KK mice. We next investigated whether the low plasma triglyceride levels in KK/San mice were due to enhanced triglyceride clearance. To study triglyceride clearance, KK/San and wild-type KK mice were injected with [3H]triglyceride-labeled VLDL. As shown in Fig.4a, triglycerides were more rapidly cleared from the circulation in KK/San mice. To examine whether this enhanced clearance of triglycerides in KK/San mice was due to enhanced lipolysis or hepatic particle uptake, VLDL apoB turnover studies were performed as a marker for whole particle clearance. After the injection of 125I-labeled-VLDL,125I-labeled VLDL apoB was seen to be cleared at a slightly faster rate in KK/San mice (Fig. 4b). Thus, the low plasma triglyceride levels in KK/San mice compared with wild-type KK mice were primarily due to enhanced lipolysis rather than to enhanced whole particle uptake. We next examined whether the effect of ANGPTL3 on VLDL triglyceride clearance resulted from a direct effect of ANGPTL3 on the activities of LPL and HL. Recombinant ANGPTL3 protein was added to purified bovine milk LPL or to a post-heparin medium of rat adipocytes, and the inhibitory effect on LPL activity was measured. As shown in Fig.5, ANGPTL3 inhibited not only crude rat adipocyte LPL but also purified bovine LPL. The percent inhibition of rat adipocyte LPL by ANGPTL3 was ∼70% at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. HL activity was also measured using plasma from mice because mouse HL is found in free circulation. As shown in Fig.6, the inhibition of HL by ANGPTL3 was very weak compared with that of LPL. ANGPTL3 inhibited HL by only 16% even at a concentration of 10 μg/ml.Figure 6Effect of ANGPTL3 on HL enzyme activityin vitro. HL activity in mouse plasma was determined in the presence of recombinant ANGPTL3 at the indicated doses. The values represent means ± S.D. expressed as a percentage of the control activity determined in the absence of recombinant ANGPTL3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we examined the relationship between ANGPTL3 and apoCII, a coactivator of LPL. Purified human apoCII was used as a coactivator instead of fetal bovine serum, and the addition of 0.07 μm apoCII was enough to elicit the maximal activation of purified LPL. As shown in Fig.7a, ANGPTL3 inhibited purified LPL in a similar manner both in the presence and absence of apoCII. However, the LPL inhibition by ANGPTL3 was attenuated at higher concentrations of apoCII in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7b). In the present study, we have demonstrated that ANGPTL3 is involved in the metabolism of VLDL. This is illustrated by the fact that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ANGPTL3 in KK/San mice increased plasma total cholesterol, NEFAs, and especially plasma triglycerides. This increase in plasma lipids was mainly confined to the VLDL fraction. Plasma VLDL triglyceride levels are thought to be regulated by the balance between its secretion and clearance. As shown in Fig. 3, the hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion rate was not significantly different between KK/San and wild-type KK mice. Previously, using another lot of KK/San mice, we observed a slight decrease (15%) in the hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion rate compared with wild-type KK mice (11Shiraki T. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Diabetes Frontier. 1993; 4: 641Google Scholar). As the difference between the two mice lots was very small, the low triglyceride levels in KK/San mice is not due to a lower secretion rate. Therefore, we concluded that ANGPTL3 does not affect VLDL triglyceride secretion. Next, we analyzed VLDL triglyceride clearance, using two different types of labeled VLDL ([3H]triglyceride-labeled VLDL and125I-labeled VLDL) to distinguish VLDL triglyceride clearance and VLDL whole particle uptake by the liver. Based on the rapid clearance of [3H]triglyceride-labeled VLDL and only a slight enhancement of the particle clearance rate in KK/San mice, it is strongly suggested that the low plasma triglyceride levels in KK/San mice were primarily due to enhanced lipolysis of VLDL triglycerides rather than to enhanced whole particle uptake. This notion is also supported by the fact that plasma apoB100 and apoB48 levels of KK/San mice were similar to those of wild-type KK mice. Maeda et al. (26Maeda N., Li, H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously reported that apoCIII deficiency reduces plasma VLDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These effects on VLDL metabolism in apoCIII-deficient mice appear to be due to increased triglyceride hydrolysis in the circulation, whereas intestinal lipid absorption and hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion were not affected. Thus, apoCIII deficiency leads to a very similar phenotype in KK/San mice with respect to VLDL metabolism. ApoCIII is thought to be one of the physiological modulators of VLDL triglyceride metabolism through the inhibition of both LPL- and HL-mediated hydrolysis of VLDL triglycerides (27Wang C.S. McConathy W.J. Kloer H.U. Alaupovic P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 28McConathy W.J. Gesquiere J.C. Bass H. Tartar A. Fruchart J.C. Wang C.S. J.

Our in vitrostudies revealed that ANGPTL3 inhibited LPL activity in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, ANGPTL3 probably regulates VLDL metabolism via the inhibition of lipases in a manner similar to apoCIII. This notion is also supported by the rapid increase (within 1–3 h) in plasma triglyceride levels after administration of recombinant ANGPTL3 (12Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30Rossetti L. Goldberg I.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Naoumova R.P. Betteridge D.J. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2215-2216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The determination of plasma concentrations of ANGPTL3 is very important in clarifying the relationship between the in vivo effects and in vitro inhibition of ANGPTL3. We detected the ANGPTL3 protein in the circulating blood of Ad/ANGPTL3- injected KK/San mice by Western blot analysis. A rough estimate of plasma ANGPTL3 levels in the mice was ∼100–500 μg/ml (data not shown). As ANGPTL3 inhibited LPL activity at doses of 1–10 μg/ml, we believe that lipase inhibition is the main mechanism by which ANGPTL3 regulates VLDL in vivo. To further understand the mechanism of LPL inhibition by ANGPTL3, we have examined the relationship between a cofactor (apoCII) and ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 seems to inhibit LPL directly because purified LPL was inhibited by ANGPTL3 even in the absence of apoCII (Fig.7a). As both apoCII-inactivated and -activated LPL showed very similar inhibitory profiles by ANGPTL3 (Fig. 7a), ANGPTL3 probably binds to a different site on the LPL molecule from the apoCII-binding site and inhibits LPL activity independently of apoCII activation. However, ANGPTL3 may have some interactions with apoCII or may bind to a site on LPL near the apoCII-binding site, because high concentrations of apoCII decreased the inhibition by ANGPTL3 (Fig. 7b). Further investigations are needed to clarify the precise mechanism of the inhibition by ANGPTL3. We also found a slight increase in total cholesterol and NEFA levels by the overexpression of ANGPTL3 in KK/San mice. It is known that HL facilitates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from remnant lipoproteins (32Amar M.J. Dugi K.A. Haudenschild C.C. Shamburek R.D. Foger B. Chase M. Bensadoun A. Hoyt R.F., Jr. Brewer H.B., Jr. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2436-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of HL by ANGPTL3 is not strong but is statistically significant. ANGPTL3 may inhibit the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from remnant lipoproteins. In transgenic mice overexpressing LPL specifically in both the skeletal and cardiac muscle, Levak-Frank et al. (33Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that LPL augments NEFA uptake in the muscles. Therefore, the increase in plasma NEFA levels by the overexpression of ANGPTL3 may really have been due to inhibition of NEFA uptake in the peripheral tissues. The main question of the current study is whether ANGPTL3 induces physiological or pathological changes. Our preliminary study showed that the plasma ANGPTL3 concentrations of normal human subjects were about 500 ng/ml (data not shown). This concentration is very close to the ANGPTL3 dose required to inhibit LPL in vitro. Therefore, ANGPTL3 may regulate VLDL triglyceride metabolism physiologically. On the other hand, there are several reports concerning LPL inhibitory factors in pathologically abnormal patients. The plasma from uremic patients has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on LPL (34Crawford G.A. Mahony J.F. Stewart J.H. Clin Sci (Lond.). 1981; 60: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Murase T. Cattran D.C. Rubenstein B. Steiner G. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Murase et al. (35Murase T. Cattran D.C. Rubenstein B. Steiner G. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have reported that an inhibitory factor was observed in the d > 1.21 bottom fraction separated by ultracentrifugation. Our preliminary data suggest that ANGPTL3 is present in the lipoprotein-free fraction as were the above inhibitory factors (data not shown). Therefore, ANGPTL3 might be one of the LPL inhibitory factors reported previously. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological significance of ANGPTL3. In this paper, we propose that ANGPTL3 is a new class of lipid metabolism modulator that regulates VLDL triglyceride levels through the inhibition of LPL activity both physiologically and pathologically. Overproduction of VLDL, or a decrease in VLDL catabolism, is the apparent reason for the triglyceride elevation in mild type IV hyperlipoproteinemia and the absence of LPL for the increased triglyceride levels in type I hyperlipoproteinemia. These findings raise the possibility that ANGPTL3 affects the triglyceride levels in some types of hyperlipoproteinemia. Thus, ANGPTL3 may be a useful target in the development of new treatments for atherosclerosis and other human diseases involving hyperlipidemia. We thank N. Terasaka for help with the HPLC assay, T.

K., Izumi, T., Boldogh, I., Imhoff, B., Kow, Y. W., Jaruga, P., and Dizdaroglu, M. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 3523–3528). Here we report characterization of the second protein, originally named NEH2 and now renamed NEIL2 (Nei-like). The 37-kDa wild-type NEIL2 expressed in and purified from E. coli has DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity, primarily for excising oxidative products of cytosine, with highest activity for 5-hydroxyuracil, one of the most abundant and mutagenic lesions induced by reactive oxygen species, and with lower activity for 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5-hydroxycytosine. It has negligible or undetectable activity with 8-oxoguanine, thymine glycol, 2-hydroxyadenine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. NEIL2 is similar to NEIL1 in having N-terminal Pro as the active site. However, unlike NEIL1, its expression was independent of the cell cycle stage in fibroblasts, and its highest expression was observed in the testes and skeletal muscle. Despite the absence of a putative nuclear localization signal, NEIL2 was predominantly localized in the nucleus. These results suggest that NEIL2 is involved in global genome repair mainly for removing oxidative products of cytosine.

ROS are critically genotoxic because their reaction with DNA produces a plethora of mutagenic and toxic base lesions as well as DNA strand breaks (4Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Most of these lesions, except double strand breaks, are repaired primarily via the base excision repair (BER) pathway in a series of enzymatic steps initiated with the excision of oxidatively damaged bases by several DNA glycosylases. These enzymes have broad substrate range although with preference for specific substrates. Until recently only two DNA glycosylases, NTH1 and OGG1, had been identified in mammals for repair of oxidized base lesions (5Ikeda S. Biswas T. Roy R. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Kurosky A. Sarker A.H.

Biol. 1997; 7: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Both of these are of the Escherichia coli Nth type and utilize a specific, internal Lys residue as the active site nucleophile to carry out β-elimination after base removal. Consequently, DNA strand breaks containing 3′-phospho-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde groups are generated (7Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr.

However, E. coli possesses two other oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases, namely MutM and Nei, which form a distinct class because they utilize N-terminal Pro as the active site to carry out βδ-elimination and generate 3′-phosphate at the DNA cleavage site (8Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We recently identified two orthologs of MutM/Nei in the human genome database and named them Nei homologs NEH1 or NEH2 (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). NEH1 has since been renamed NEIL1 (Nei-like) as suggested by the Human Genome Organization. We showed that NEIL1 functions as a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase with broad substrate specificity, behaves more like Nei in its substrate preference, and carries out βδ-elimination like MutM and Nei (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In this communication, we show that NEIL2 (originally named NEH2) is also active as a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase with the N-terminal Pro as the active site for carrying out βδ-elimination on DNA abasic sites. However, NEIL2 is distinct from NEIL1 in that ROS-generated cytosine derivatives are its preferred substrates. Identification of two human cDNA clones of NEIL1 (NEH1) and NEIL2 (NEH2), along with their mouse homologs, in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Celera Genomic Databases using the BLASTP program was described previously (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The cDNA containing the complete coding sequence of human NEIL2, obtained from Research Genetics (accession no. BC013964), was inserted between the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pRSETB plasmid, and its identity was verified by sequence analysis. Predicting that the N-terminal Pro is the catalytic site (after cleavage of the initiator Met residue), we also constructed expression plasmids encoding the N-terminal His tag fusion of NEIL2 in which this Pro became an internal residue. Recombinant, wild-type (WT) NEIL2 was purified as described for NEIL1 in a series of chromatographic steps with some modification (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzymatically active fractions eluted from SP-Sepharose at 300 mm NaCl were chromatographed on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column and eluted at 0.5 m NaCl. After chromatography on Mono S, the final step involved gel filtration in a 25-ml Superdex 75 column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol (buffer A) containing 200 mm NaCl. The active fractions were stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 50% glycerol at −20 °C. The final yield of the purified enzyme was about 2 mg/liter of culture. His-tagged NEIL2 was purified from the extract of plasmid-bearingE. coli by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). After elution with 150 mm imidazole, the enzyme was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl and digested with thrombin to remove the His tag sequence except for 3 terminal residues. The enzyme was finally purified by chromatography on Mono S as in the case of WT NEIL2. NEIL2 is highly unstable and loses activity nearly completely after storage at −80 °C or after 15-min incubation at 37 °C. The purified enzyme is therefore never frozen, and the enzyme retains full activity when assayed in the presence of 1 m trimethylamineN-oxide, a natural osmolyte that is present in marine organisms and known to stabilize proteins (11Seibel B.A. Walsh P.J.

DNA strand cleavage at the site of the lesion by the intrinsic AP lyase activity of NEIL2 after excision was used for its assay using32P-labeled duplex oligo substrates containing various base lesions (10Hazra T.K.

A 51-mer oligo containing 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) (Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, IA) or 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU) (Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX) in the sequence 5′-GCT TAG CTT GGA ATC GTA TCA TGT AXA CTC GTG TGC CGT GTA GAC CGT GCC-3′, where X is 5-OHU or DHU, and the complementary strand containing G or A opposite DHU or G, A, or T opposite 5-OHU were used. The duplex oligo, 32P-labeled at the 5′ terminus of the lesion-containing strand, was incubated with NEIL2 at 37 °C for 15 min (unless stated otherwise) in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mtrimethylamine N-oxide. After the reaction was stopped with 80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, cleaved oligos were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide containing 7m urea in 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, and the radioactivity was quantitated by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. NEIL2-cleaved products were identified by comparison with the reference products of human NTH1 and NEIL1. The abasic (AP) site-containing 32P-labeled duplex oligo was incubated with enzymes in 15 μl of assay buffer in the presence of 25 mmNaCNBH3 at 37 °C for 30 min, and the trapped complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) as described previously (10Hazra T.K.

Primary human diploid MRC5 fibroblasts were synchronized by serum starvation for 120 h and then stimulated to proliferate by adding fetal bovine serum (10%) to the Eagle's minimal essential medium. Aliquots of cells, harvested at various times, were used for cell cycle analysis and for preparing lysates for blot analysis of NEIL2 mRNA (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope tag was fused to the 3′ terminus of the NEIL2 cDNA as follows. Two oligonucleotides, 5′-A ATT C TC GACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG TAAC-3′ and 5′-T CG AGTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTG TAGTCGA G-3′, were annealed and inserted into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.0Zeo(+) vector (Invitrogen), which was then used to clone the NEIL2 cDNA into itsHindIII-EcoRI sites, in-frame with the FLAG tag. The NEIL2-FLAG plasmid (0.5 μg) was transiently transfected into mouse BALB/c 3T3 A31-1-1 fibroblasts (13Tatsuka M. Ibeanu G.C. Izumi T. Narayan S. Ramana C.V. Kim N.K. Kang W. Roy G. Mitra S. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were fixed and treated with M3 anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma) for 1 h. Then the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) or MitoTracker Red (MT) (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturers' instructions and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM510) in the University of Texas Medical Branch Optical Imaging Laboratory. FITC was imaged using 488 nm excitation and 505–545 nm emission, while PI and MT were imaged using 543 nm excitation and 560 nm long pass emission. The overall identity between human NEIL2 and MutM and Nei is 32 and 27%, respectively (Pairwise BLAST analysis), and the key residues of the E. coli enzymes, in particular the N-terminal PE(L/G)P(E/L) motif, are completely conserved in NEIL2 (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This suggests that, as in NEIL1, the N-terminal Pro of NEIL2 is the active site. Furthermore, NEIL2 shares potential helix-2-turn-helix and zinc finger motifs with both MutM and Nei. We expressed WT NEIL2 and a fusion protein with an N-terminal His tag in which Pro-1 becomes an internal residue and purified these to apparent homogeneity (Fig.1A). Surprisingly, 36.7-kDa NEIL2 migrated abnormally to the position of 42 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal sequence of the WT protein (Pro-Glu-Gly-Pro-Leu-Val-Arg-Lys-Phe, as determined by automated Edman degradation) matched exactly with the predicted sequence (after cleavage of the initiator Met residue). The molecular weight of WT NEIL2 of 36,691, as determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was close to the predicted value of 36,695. Similarly the N-terminal sequence of the His-tagged fusion protein after thrombin cleavage (Gly-Ser-His-Met-Pro-Glu-Gly) also matched perfectly with the predicted sequence. All DNA glycosylase/AP lyases, regardless of preference for the substrate base, form transient Schiff bases with free abasic sites in DNA which could be reduced with NaCNBH3 (or NaBH4) to form stable “trapped complexes” (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The MutM/Nei-type enzyme is inactivated if the N-terminal Pro, the active site nucleophile, is blocked or eliminated (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Fig. 1Bshows SDS-PAGE of 32P-labeled trapped complexes of NEIL2 (lane 2) and NEIL1 (lane 4) along with the N terminus-tagged NEIL2 mutant (lane 3) with AP site-containing oligo. WT NEIL2 formed a trapped complex indicating that recombinant NEIL2 is active as an AP lyase. However, lack of such a trapped complex with the N-terminal fusion mutant of NEIL2 strongly suggests that Pro-1 is its active site. NEIL2 was active in excising several cytosine-derived lesions with robust activity for 5-OHU and lower activity on DHU (Fig.2A) when the same oligo sequence was used. Fig. 2B shows the ability of NEIL2 to excise 5-OHU nearly to completion in a dose-dependent fashion. NEIL2 had low activity for 5-OHC, very weak activity for thymine glycol and 8-oxoguanine, and none for U, 2-hydroxy-A, hypoxanthine, or xanthine. As expected, NEIL2 was highly active on an AP site (data not shown). A comparison of the mobility of NEIL2 incision products (lanes 2 and 3) with those of NTH1 (lane 4) and NEIL1 (lane 5) shows that NEIL2 carries out βδ-elimination like NEIL1, while all three are active in excising 5′-OHU (Fig. 2A). Thus both NEIL1 and NEIL2 are human orthologs of E. coli MutM/Nei because of their common reaction mechanism and conserved active site. However, the substrate preference of NEIL2 was distinct from that of NEIL1 or of the bacterial enzymes. We compared the effect of the opposite base, G, A, or T, which are known to mispair with 5-OHU, on NEIL2 and NEIL1 activity (Fig.2C). NEIL1 was more active with 5′-OHU when paired with A or T (lanes 5 and 6) and had weak activity with the 5-OHU·G pair (lane 7). In contrast, NEIL2 had significantly higher activity with the 5-OHU·G pair (lane 4) relative to other 5-OHU pairs (lanes 2 and 3). Northern analysis indicated strong tissue specificity of NEIL2 expression (Fig. 3A). Its highest expression was found in the skeletal muscle and testis with moderate expression levels in the brain and heart. Surprisingly a very low level of NEIL2 was expressed in the other tissues tested. The cell cycle dependence of NEIL2 expression was also examined by Northern analysis with total RNA isolated from synchronized human diploid fibroblasts. It is evident from Fig. 3B that the NEIL2 mRNA level did not significantly change through the cell cycle. PSORT II analysis of the sequence of NEIL2 predicted that NEIL2 could be mitochondrial rather than nuclear (34.8%, mitochondrial; 26.1%, cytoplasmic; 17.4%, nuclear; based on k-nearest neighbor algorithm, psort.nibb.ac.jp/). We, therefore, experimentally determined the intracellular distribution of this enzyme by using transiently expressed FLAG-tagged NEIL2 in mouse fibroblasts (Fig.4). Contrary to the PSORT II prediction, the majority of NEIL2-FLAG protein was, however, found to be present in the nuclei of transfected cells, although a small fraction was also observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). In the absence of complete colocalization of mitochondria-specific MitoTracker and FLAG in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B), it is evident that the ectopically expressed protein was not exclusively mitochondrial. However, it could still be present in mitochondria to carry out repair of mitochondrial DNA damage. Characterization of DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity in NEIL2 confirmed our prediction that both NEIL1 and NEIL2 are members of the MutM/Nei type in the mammals and utilize N-terminal Pro as the active site. However, we are surprised by the unusual specificity of NEIL2 in excising ROS-generated products of C. The rationale for the need of such a repair glycosylase may be predictable. The most frequently observed point mutation, presumably due to ROS, in aerobic organisms is GC → AT transition (16Schaaper R.M. Dunn R.L. Glickman B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which could arise from mispairing of cytosine-derived lesions with adenine. Oxidation of cytosine gives rise to cytosine glycol, an unstable DNA lesion that can either be dehydrated to 5-OHC or be deaminated to uracil glycol. 5-OHU arises from either deamination of 5-OHC or dehydration of uracil glycol (17Dizdaroglu M. Holwitt E. Hagan M.P. Blakeley W.F. Biochem. J. 1985; 235: 531-536Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar,18Kreutzer D.A. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3578-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). DHU, another C-derived product, is generated by ionizing radiation under anoxic condition (19Vaisman A. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6520-6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In any case, 5-OHU is quite abundant, and its level in DNA from mammalian tissues and human cells is comparable to that of 8-oxoguanine (20Wagner J.R., Hu, C.C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 5-OHU pairs with A during DNA replication by Klenow polymerase, which will cause GC → AT transition (21Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mammalian bypass DNA polymerase Polι preferentially incorporates T and to a lesser extent G opposite 5-OHU (19Vaisman A. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6520-6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The T·5-OHU pair would result in GC → TA transversion as frequently observed in vivo (22McBride T.J. Preston B.D. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast, only the correct nucleotide G is inserted opposite 5-OHC (19Vaisman A. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6520-6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidatively modified deoxynucleotides could be incorporated into DNA from the nucleotide pool, and 5-OHdUTP is an efficient substrate for Klenow polymerase (21Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, while 5-OHU is the preferred substrate of NEIL2, three other human enzymes, namely NEIL1, NTH1, and uracil-DNA glycosylase, are also able to excise this lesion from DNA (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 23Dizdaroglu M. Karakaya A. Jaruga P.

This raises the possibility that 5-OHU, an important mutagenic lesion generated in significant amount in the genome, requires several back-up enzymes for its repair. Furthermore, the patterns of tissue-specific expression of NEIL1, NEIL2, and NTH1 are distinct. For example, NEIL1 expression is high in the liver, thymus, and pancreas and low in the muscle and testis (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), whereas NEIL2 mRNA level was high in the skeletal muscle and testis (Fig. 3A). NTH1 expression is also high in the liver and low in the muscle (25Imai K. Sarker A.H. Akiyama K. Ikeda S. Yao M. Tsutsui K. Shohmori T. Seki S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NEIL2 complements NEIL1 and other proteins in repair of 5-OHU in a tissue-specific manner. The lack of cell cycle dependence of NEIL2 mRNA, at least in human fibroblasts, shows that NEIL2 is very different from NEIL1 whose expression is significantly enhanced during the S phase (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This suggests that NEIL2 is active on nonreplicating genomes for global repair. If the NEIL2 polypeptide turns out to parallel its mRNA level in a tissue-specific fashion (Fig.3A), it will be interesting to explore the in vivo function of this enzyme in various tissues by examining the phenotype of the NEIL2-null mouse. The physiological implications of our observation that NEIL1 was more active with the 5-OHU·A(T) pair and had weak activity with the 5-OHU·G pair, while the opposite was true for NEIL2, is not clear. It is possible that these enzymes have distinct strand specificity. NEIL2 may act on 5-OHU, derived from C in the nonreplicative genome, which is always paired with G. In contrast, NEIL1 with S phase-specific expression may be active on 5-OHU in the nascent strand when paired with A (10Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Finally, the discovery of NEIL1 and NEIL2, which generate 3′-phosphate residues at the lesion site, raises the possibility of a novel process in the BER pathway. Because human APE1, unlike its E. coliortholog Xth, has extremely weak activity for removing 3′-phosphate (26Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), while polynucleotide kinase, present in mammalian cells but not in E. coli, is an efficient 3′-phosphatase (27Habraken Y. Verly W.G. J. Biochem. 1987; 171: 59-66Google Scholar). We have argued that NEIL1 utilizes a base excision repair subpathway, which is independent of APE1 (28Mitra S. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Bhakat K. Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It now appears that NEIL2 shares the APE1-independent BER process with NEIL1.

https://openalex.org/W2021363994,"The enzymatic conjugation of arginine to the N-termini of proteins is a part of the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway of protein degradation. In mammals, three N-terminal residues—aspartate, glutamate, and cysteine—are substrates for arginylation. The mouse ATE1 gene encodes a family of Arg-tRNA-protein transferases (R-transferases) that mediate N-terminal arginylation. We constructed ATE1-lacking mouse strains and found that ATE1 −/− embryos die with defects in heart development and in angiogenic remodeling of the early vascular plexus. Through biochemical analyses, we show that N-terminal cysteine, in contrast to N-terminal aspartate and glutamate, is oxidized before its arginylation by R-transferase, suggesting that the arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway functions as an oxygen sensor."

In recent years, numerous studies have identified enzymes responsible for acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation of histone N-terminal tails. While these enzymes are often part of multisubunit complexes directly involved in the control of gene expression, they target very specific residues, which, in turn, can modulate the subsequent action of other histone-modifying enzymes (2Zhang Y.

For example, human PRMT1 is responsible for in vivo dimethylation of histone H4 on arginine 3, which in turn can modulate subsequent H4 acetylation by p300 in vitro and coactivates nuclear receptor-driven transcription (5Wang H.

https://openalex.org/W2086652137,"There is a growing body of evidence that G protein-coupled receptors function in the context of plasma membrane signaling compartments. These compartments may facilitate interaction between receptors and specific downstream signaling components while restricting access to other signaling molecules. We recently reported that beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (AR) regulate the intrinsic contraction rate in neonatal mouse myocytes through distinct signaling pathways. By studying neonatal myocytes isolated from beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR knockout mice, we found that stimulation of the beta(1)AR leads to a protein kinase A-dependent increase in the contraction rate. In contrast, stimulation of the beta(2)AR has a biphasic effect on the contraction rate. The biphasic effect includes an initial protein kinase A-independent increase in the contraction rate followed by a sustained decrease in the contraction rate that can be blocked by pertussis toxin. Here we present evidence that caveolar localization is required for physiologic signaling by the beta(2)AR but not the beta(1)AR in neonatal cardiac myocytes. Evidence for beta(2)AR localization to caveolae includes co-localization by confocal imaging, co-immunoprecipitation of the beta(2)AR and caveolin 3, and co-migration of the beta(2)AR with a caveolin-3-enriched membrane fraction. The beta(2)AR-stimulated increase in the myocyte contraction rate is increased by approximately 2-fold and markedly prolonged by filipin, an agent that disrupts lipid rafts such as caveolae and significantly reduces co-immunoprecipitation of beta(2)AR and caveolin 3 and co-migration of beta(2)AR and caveolin-3 enriched membranes. In contrast, filipin has no effect on beta(1)AR signaling. These observations suggest that beta(2)ARs are normally restricted to caveolae in myocyte membranes and that this localization is essential for physiologic signaling of this receptor subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2070195161,"We demonstrate how molecular quantum states of coupled semiconductor quantum dots are coherently probed and manipulated in transport experiments. The applied method probes quantum states by the virtual cotunneling of two electrons and hence resolves the sequences of molecular states simultaneously. This result is achieved by weakly probing the quantum system through parallel contacts to its constituting quantum dots. The overlap of the dots' wave functions and, in turn, the splitting of molecular states are adjusted by the direct influence of coupling electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W2149250742,"Resistance to the stimulatory effects of insulin on glucose utilization is a key feature of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. Recent studies suggest that insulin resistance is primarily caused by a defect in glucose transport. GLUT4 is the main insulin-responsive glucose transporter and is expressed predominantly in muscle and adipose tissues. Whereas GLUT4 has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis, the mechanisms regulating its expression are incompletely understood. We have cloned the murine homologue of KLF15, a member of the Kru¨ppel-like family of transcription factors. KLF15 is highly expressed in adipocytes and myocytes in vivo and is induced when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are differentiated into adipocytes. Overexpression of KLF15 in adipose and muscle cell lines potently induces GLUT4 expression. This effect is specific to KLF15 as overexpression of two other Kru¨ppel-like factors, KLF2/LKLF and KLF4/GKLF, did not induce GLUT4 expression. Both basal (3.3-fold, p"

Although aromatic residues contribute to the binding, three experiments suggest the binding is driven mainly by nonspecific local electrostatic interactions. First, peptides with 13 basic residues, Lys-13 and Arg-13, bind to PIP2-containing vesicles with the same high affinity as the effector domain peptide. Second, removing basic residues from the effector domain peptide reduces the binding energy by an amount that correlates with the number of charges removed. Third, peptides corresponding to a basic region in GAP43 and MARCKS effector domain-like regions in other proteins (e.g. MacMARCKS, adducin, Drosophila A kinase anchor protein 200, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) also bind with an energy that correlates with the number of basic residues. Kinetic measurements suggest the effector domain binds to several PIP2. Theoretical calculations show the effector domain produces a local positive potential, even when bound to a bilayer with 33% monovalent acidic lipids, and should thus sequester PIP2 laterally. This electrostatic sequestration was observed experimentally using a phospholipase C assay. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that MARCKS could reversibly sequester much of the PIP2 in the plasma membrane.

One hypothesis is that proteins act as reversible buffers to bind much of the PIP2 and then release it locally in response to specific signals (8McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev.

These proteins would have to be present at a concentration comparable with PIP2, be localized to the plasma membrane, bind PIP2 with high affinity, and release it in response to physiological stimuli. Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) satisfies these criteria. MARCKS (reviewed in Refs. 26Aderem A.

The binding of MARCKS to plasma membranes requires both hydrophobic insertion of its N-terminal myristate into the bilayer and electrostatic interactions between its effector domain and monovalent acidic lipids in the membrane (28McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound basic effector domain produces a significant positive electrostatic potential that can act as a basin of attraction for multivalent acidic lipids such as PIP2 (8McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The electrostatic sequestration of PIP2 can be reversed either by the binding of calcium/calmodulin to the effector domain or by the PKC phosphorylation of the effector domain, which decreases the positive electrostatic potential (33Murray D. Arbuzova A. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Curr. Top. Membr. 2002; 52: 271-302Google Scholar). MARCKS has an extended conformation in solution (34Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Hayashi N. Taniguchi H.

MARCKS-(151–175), a peptide corresponding to the basic effector domain, is also in an extended form both in solution (38Bubb M.R. Lenox R.H. Edison A.S. J. Biol.

In the work reported here, we investigated whether the binding of MARCKS-(151–175) to PIP2 is due to nonspecific electrostatic interactions. We used three approaches to determine whether the binding depends on specific residues or just on the number of basic residues. We measured the binding of truncated versions of MARCKS-(151–175) (i.e. peptides missing basic residues from the N- and/or C-terminal regions) to PC/PIP2 vesicles. We also measured the binding of peptides corresponding to basic regions in other proteins (macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MacMARCKS), adducin, Drosophila A kinase anchor protein 200 (DAKAP200), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and growth-associated protein ofMr 43,000 (GAP43)) to PC/PIP2vesicles to determine whether the binding correlates with the number of basic residues. We compared the binding of peptides with 13 Lys or 13 Arg residues to investigate whether the chemical nature of the basic residues affects the interaction with PIP2. We further tested the hypothesis that several PIP2 diffuse together to form a binding site for MARCKS-(151–175) (8McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Finally, we determined the relative ability of MARCKS-(151–175) and other basic peptides to sequester PIP2 laterally in membranes containing physiological concentration of PS by examining the ability of these peptides to decrease the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

The exception is that the N terminus of SCAMP2-(201–211) is unblocked, introducing an extra positive charge. The sequences of the basic regions in these proteins are documented in the references indicated. In the binding and kinetic measurements, we used peptides with an extra Cys at the N terminus, which permitted covalent attachment of either a radioactive ([3H]NEM) or a fluorescent (acrylodan) label. In the ζ potential measurements, we used MARCKS-(151–175) and Lys-13 without the extra N-terminal Cys. In the PLC assays, we used MARCKS-(151–175) and a peptide corresponding to a basic region in phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D 2 (PLD2-(554–575)) without the extra N-terminal Cys, but GAP43-(30–56), ΔNΔC-MARCKS, Lys-7, and SCAMP2-(201–211) had the extra N-terminal Cys. We added 1 mm dithiothreitol to the buffer to avoid the formation of disulfide bonds when the peptides contain the extra Cys. MARCKS-(151–175) with or without the extra Cys had the same effect on the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2. We used a protocol modified from Molecular Probes (Conjugation with Thiol-reactive Probes) to label peptides with a thiol-reactive fluorescent acrylodan probe, as described in detail elsewhere (44Arbuzova A. Wang J. Murray D. Jacob J. Cafiso D.S. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27167-27177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, we mixed 1 ml of ∼1 mm peptide in 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, with acrylodan probe dissolved in DMF (mole ratio of 1.5:1 acrylodan/peptide) for 1 h, purified the labeled peptide using high pressure liquid chromatography, and checked its purity with MALDI mass spectrometry (CASM, State University of New York, Stony Brook). We labeled peptides with radioactive [3H]NEM as described previously (45Arbuzova A. Wang L. Wang J. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Murray D. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10330-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, we placed 250 μCi of [3H]NEM in pentane on top of 20 μl of DMF, evaporated the pentane with argon gas, and then mixed the [3H]NEM in DMF with 1 ml of an ∼1 mm peptide solution; this procedure labeled ∼1% of the peptide. We added to the solution containing the labeled peptide an excess of non-radioactive NEM (mole ratio of 1.5:1 NEM/peptide) to block the unlabeled Cys. We used multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) for ζ potential measurements, 100 nm diameter large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) for fluorescence measurements, and sucrose-loaded LUVs for centrifugation experiments as described in detail elsewhere (25Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,46Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). In our experience, the protocol for preparing MLVs must be followed carefully to ensure a uniform distribution of PIP2in PC/PIP2 (99:1) vesicles (either LUV or MLV). We measure the ζ potential of several individual vesicles to assess the uniformity of the MLV preparations. The protocol described below consistently produces a population of vesicles that move with similar velocity in an electric field, i.e. the ζ potentials due to the negatively charged PIP2 are similar. The critical step is to produce a dried lipid film in which PC and PIP2 are mixed uniformly. We add solutions of PIP2 (it is important to use the ammonium salt, which is more soluble in chloroform than the sodium salt (47Toner M. Vaio G. McLaughlin A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7435-7443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and PC in chloroform (typically 500 μl total volume) to a 50-ml round-bottom flask, which is then well immersed in a 30–35 °C water bath and attached to a rotary evaporator. The flask is rotated without vacuum for 5 min to warm the solution and speed the subsequent evaporation under vacuum. Deleting this warming step can produce a strikingly nonuniform distribution of PIP2 in the MLVs (as indicated by ζ potential measurements), presumably because PIP2 is less soluble in chloroform than PC and, if the chloroform does not evaporate rapidly, forms a layer on the bottom of the flask. We next applied the maximum vacuum that does not boil the chloroform to evaporate most of the solvent (∼1 min) and then applied full vacuum for 30 min to remove all traces of chloroform. Electrophoresis measurements indicated that most of the MLVs produced using this protocol do indeed contain 1% PIP2; specifically, the ζ potentials of the PC/PIP2 MLVs made in this way had low standard deviation (see e.g. Fig. 7 for 98:2 PC/PIP2 MLVs). The PC/PIP2 LUVs, which are made by extrusion of MLVs, presumably also have a uniform fraction of PIP2. We measured the binding of [3H]NEM-labeled peptides (Table I) to sucrose-loaded PC/PIP2 LUVs using the centrifugation technique described previously (25Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 46Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sucrose-loaded PC/PIP2 LUVs were mixed with trace concentrations of [3H]NEM-labeled peptides (typically 2–10 nm). The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. We calculated the percentage of peptide bound from the radioactivity of the peptide in the supernatant and in the pellet. We use a molar partition coefficient K (49, 50) to describe the binding of the peptide to lipid vesicles without making assumptions about the absorption mechanism. The molar partition coefficientK is defined by the equation: [P]m/[L] = K[P], where [P]m is the molar concentration of peptide partitioned onto the membrane, [P] is the molar concentration of free peptide in the bulk aqueous phase, and [L] is the molar concentration of lipid accessible to the peptide. Under our conditions, [L] ≫ [P]m. Thus [L] does not change significantly after the peptide binds and is approximately one-half of the total lipid concentration for the LUVs because the peptide interacts only with the outer leaflet of the bilayer (the peptides are added to a solution of preformed vesicles). Combining the definition ofK with the equation [P]tot = [P]m + [P], we get Equation 1.[P]m[P]tot=K[L]1+K[L]Equation 1 Note that this equation for the molar partition coefficientK has the same form as the equation for the association constant if we assume (incorrectly) that the peptide forms a 1:1 complex with a lipid (51Ben-Tal N.

Freeman & Co., New York1995Google Scholar) to define the binding free energy ΔG0 = −RTlnK where the standard state is one in which all reactants have a concentration of 1 m. As discussed in detail elsewhere (49Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 52White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), the relationship between the partition coefficient and the binding energy depends on the units used for the concentration and the definition of the standard state. To facilitate comparison with other studies where different standard states may be used and the free energy may differ by a cratic term (e.g. see Refs. 49Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S.

These diseases are associated with intraneuronal protein aggregates. Heat-inducible chaperones like HSP70 and HSP27 suppress poly(Q) aggregation and/or toxicity/cell death. Heat shock transcription factors, including HSF-1, regulate HSP70 and HSP27 expression. HSF-1 activity is reduced by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and enhanced by GSK-3 inhibitors, like lithium. Thus, we hypothesized that lithium treatment may partially rescue death in Huntington’s disease cell models. LiCl reduced poly(Q) toxicity in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines, but this was not associated with elevation of HSP70 or HSP27. The protective effect of lithium involved GSK-3β inhibition, since poly(Q) toxicity was also reduced by SB216763, a GSK-3β inhibitor, and by overexpression of a dominant-negative GSK-3β mutant. LiCl and SB216763 increased β-catenin-dependent T-cell factor-mediated transcription. Since β-catenin overexpression protected cells from poly(Q) toxicity, we tested whether this pathway was impaired by a poly(Q) expansion mutation. Cells expressing expanded repeats had reduced β-catenin levels associated with a parallel decrease in T-cell factor-mediated transcription, compared with cells expressing wild type constructs. Since LiCl can protect against polyglutamine toxicity in cell lines, it is an excellent candidate for further in vivo therapeutic trials.

Huntington's disease heat shock protein glycogen synthase kinase T-cell factor enhanced green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline Huntington's disease (HD)1 is a member of a family of neurodegenerative diseases caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in the coding region of the affected gene. Other members of this group include spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The CAG repeats code for an expanded polyglutamine (poly(Q)) tract that causes disease by conferring a novel gain of function on the mutant protein (1Ho L. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Wyttenbach A. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Psychol. Med. 2001; 31: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HD is characterized by expansions of a poly(Q) stretch in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene to more than 37 glutamines, and a short N-terminal fragment encoding the poly(Q) stretch is sufficient to cause aggregates and toxicity in mice (2Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsk T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol.

Indeed, many believe that the mutant protein acquires its toxicity and its propensity to aggregate after cleavage, forming a short (so far, incompletely defined) N-terminal fragment containing the polyglutamine stretch (5Martindale D.

A pathological hallmark of HD is the formation of intracellular aggregates in specific parts of the brain in affected individuals. The exact role of these aggregates in the pathogenesis of HD is unclear; some studies have suggested that the formation of intracellular aggregates might be directly pathogenic (6Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiriani L. Bates G.P.

Although it is controversial whether the intraneuronal aggregates are directly pathogenic, it is more widely accepted that polyglutamine diseases are caused by misfolded, aggregate-prone proteins (13Paulson H.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 339-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells control the levels of aggregate-prone proteins by a number of mechanisms, including molecular chaperones of the HSP40/HSP70 families. Indeed, we and others have shown that overexpression of HSP70 and HSP40 family members reduces both aggregation and cell death in cell models of HD and related conditions (reviewed in Ref. 14Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.-P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We recently found that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) also suppressed poly(Q)-mediated cell death. In contrast to HSP40/70 chaperones, we showed that HSP27 suppressed poly(Q) death without suppressing poly(Q) aggregation; our results suggested that the poly(Q) mutation induced reactive oxygen species that directly contributed to cell death and that HSP27 acted by reducing reactive oxygen species levels (14Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.-P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The expression of certain heat shock proteins (like HSP27 and HSP70) is induced by various stressors like heat, oxidants, and heavy metals. This heat shock response is mediated by heat shock transcription factors, including heat shock transcription factor 1. Recently, Bijuret al. (15Bijur G.N. DeSarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) reduced the activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 and production of HSP70 in response to heat shock; these effects of GSK-3 were partially reversed by treatment with lithium, which is known to inhibit GSK-3. Thus, we hypothesized that lithium treatment may enhance heat shock protein levels and partially rescue death in our HD cell models. GSK-3β is a highly conserved, constitutively active, serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in many fundamental cellular functions, such as the cell cycle, gene transcription, cytoskeletal integrity, and apoptosis, as a result of its ability to phosphorylate key proteins that modulate these processes (16Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is ubiquitously expressed, including abundant expression in the brain (17Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Some of the proposed target substrates of GSK-3β include transcription factors such as heat shock transcription factor 1, c-Jun, and c-Myc; enzymes that regulate metabolism such as glycogen synthase; and microtubule-associated proteins such as tau. The activity of GSK-3β is subject to regulation by two different types of mechanisms (16Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). GSK-3β activity can be regulated by phosphorylation, which can be modulated by diverse pathways including insulin signaling, growth factors, and amino acids. GSK-3β is active in its nonphosphorylated form, and site-specific phosphorylation at Ser9 inhibits its activity. The second mechanism for GSK-3β regulation is independent of phosphorylation at Ser9 and involves the highly conserved Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway, which specifies cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation in Drosophila, Xenopus, and mammals. In the absence of a Wnt signal, unphosphorylated active GSK-3 is present in a multiprotein complex (together with axin and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, APC) in which GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, thereby targeting it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kelmer R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). In the absence of nuclear β-catenin, transcription factors of the T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 family occupy target gene promoters in a complex with various co-repressors to mediate transcriptional repression (19Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). When Wnt proteins bind to the frizzled receptor on the cell surface, the dishevelled protein is activated via a signaling pathway that has yet to be fully elucidated. This inhibits GSK-3 activity by disrupting the multiprotein complex, which allows β-catenin to be freed, preventing its phosphorylation and degradation (20Farr III, G.H. Ferkey D.M. Yost C. Pierce S.B. Weaver C. Kimelman D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The free accumulated cytosolic β-catenin can translocate into the nucleus, where it enhances the transcription of Wnt target genes by binding to transcription factors of the Tcf/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 family (21Nusse R. Cell. 1997; 89: 321-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The target genes whose increased transcription is responsible for enhancing resistance to apoptosis have yet to be identified. Recent work using relatively specific GSK-3β inhibitors, such as lithium or a selective small molecule inhibitor called SB216763, has supported the hypothesis that GSK-3β is proapoptotic. Overexpression of GSK-3β in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells potentiated apoptosis, whereas lithium and SB216763 were reported to protect SH-SY5Y cells against staurosporine or heat shock-induced apoptosis (15Bijur G.N. DeSarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Part of lithium’s antiapoptotic properties may be mediated by down-regulation of p53 and up-regulation of Bcl-2 (23Chen R.W. Chuang D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6039-6042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Lithium is a safe, well established drug, which is the mainstay of treatment of unipolar and bipolar disorders and is used both in the acute phase and as prophylaxis for recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Since GSK-3β may be able to regulate poly(Q) pathogenesis, lithium was an obvious choice to test as a possible pharmacological modulator of polyglutamine induced toxicity, since it inhibits GSK-3β. African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and human neuroblastoma cells (SKNSH) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For experiments, the cells were pretreated for 3 days with 2.5 or 5 mm LiCl (Sigma) or for 24 h with SB216763 (Glaxo Smith Kline) prior to transfection. Treatment was maintained throughout the experimental period after transfection. For transfection, cells were seeded in six-well plates on coverslips and grown to 60–80% confluence for 24 h. COS-7 cells were exposed to a mixture of 10 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent™ (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of plasmid DNA for 5 h in serum-free medium, after which full culture medium was added. For efficient transfection, SKNSH cells required LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent™ (Invitrogen); otherwise, the protocol was the same as for COS-7 cells. In co-transfection experiments, we used HD exon 1 constructs in pEGFP-C1 (described previously in Ref. 4Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2898-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar); pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as an empty vector control; pcDNA 3.1 constructs expressing wild type β-catenin and β-catenin containing a missense mutation of tyrosine for serine at codon 33 (S33Y), which makes it resistant to degradation (kind gifts from Hans Clevers); and a dominant negative GSK-3 β mutant (kind gift from Geoffrey Cooper). We used a 3:1 ratio of the test construct to HD exon 1 construct DNA to ensure that all cells expressing HD exon 1 constructs also expressed the appropriate test constructs. In all such experiments, we used a total of 2 μg of DNA/3.5-cm dish. To determine whether LiCl or SB216763 affected levels of EGFP-HDpoly(Q) expression, COS-7 cells were pretreated with LiCl or SB216763 as described above, and cells were transfected with EGFP-HDQ23. Quantitative flow cytometry was performed using a FACSort flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). 10,000–20,000 cells/sample were examined, and the data were analyzed using WinMDI software. We analyzed 300–400 EGFP-expressing cells with similar fluorescent signals per slide in multiple randomly chosen fields, blinded to the treatment condition. The proportion of EGFP-expressing cells with one or more intracellular inclusions was used as a measure of inclusion formation (14Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.-P.

To assess cell viability, we looked at nuclear morphology, and EGFP-expressing cells with fragmented or condensed nuclei were counted as dead. Nuclear fragmentation was detected by nucleus staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described previously (4Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2898-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that these criteria are specific for cell death, since they show a very high correlation with propidium iodide staining in live cells (14Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J.

Furthermore, these nuclear abnormalities are reversed with caspase inhibitors (4Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis was performed with the observer blinded to the identity of the slides, and all experiments reported in the figures were done in triplicate at least twice. At 48 h post-transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min, and mounted in antifadent supplemented with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at 3 μg/ml to allow visualization of nuclear morphology using fluorescent light microscopy. Pooled estimates for the changes in inclusion formation or cell death, resulting from perturbations assessed in multiple experiments, were calculated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals ((percentage of cells expressing construct with inclusions in perturbation conditions/percentage of cells expressing construct without inclusions in perturbation conditions)/(percentage of cells expressing construct with inclusions in control conditions/percentage of cells expressing construct without inclusions in control conditions)). Odds ratios and p values were determined by unconditional logistical regression analysis, using the general log-linear analysis option of SPSS 9 software (SPSS, Chicago). Odds ratios were considered to be the most appropriate summary statistic for reporting multiple independent replicate experiments of this type (4Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Furlong R.A.

Samples were trypsinized and lysed with 1× SDS-PAGE Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The proteins were resolved in 12.5% denaturing gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) with a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies against HSP27 and HSP70 (Stressgen Biotechnologies), Bcl-2 and p53 (Diaclon Research), a mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco), and a rabbit monoclonal antibody against actin (Sigma). All primary antibodies were used in a concentration of 1:1000 except the anti-β-catenin antibody, which was used in a concentration of 1:500. Blots were probed with sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) in a concentration of 1:2000, and bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips for 16–24 h and transfected with GFP-Q74 construct or co-transfected with GFP-Q74 and the β-catenin construct. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (5% fetal bovine serum) for 30 min. Antibodies were mouse anti-β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and rabbit anti-GSK-3β (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada). Antibodies were used at 1:600 for 1 h at room temperature and washed in 1× PBS three times. Then cells were incubated with either goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h in the dark at room temperature (1:1000). After being washed three times in PBS, the cells were mounted in antifadent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Samples were observed using a confocal microscope. The pTopflash (wild type) and pFopflash (mutant) constructs (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) contain a luciferase reporter under the control of two repeats each containing three copies of the Tcf binding site (wild type) upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter. pFopflash contains the mutated Tcf binding sites and was used as a negative control. COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells were pretreated with LiCl or SB216763 as described, seeded in 24-well plates, and transfected with 750 ng of pTopflash or pFopflash using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen or LipofectAMINE PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen), respectively. 300 ng of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid under the control of a constitutively active human elongation factor 1α promoter was cotransfected in each well to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Cell lysates were harvested ∼24 h after transfection, and levels of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined (25Wyttenbach A. Swartz J.E. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J.

The luciferase activity from each well was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To measure and normalize the amount of luciferase activity specifically due to the presence of Tcf binding at different doses of LiCl or SB216763, we divided the luciferase activity in cells expressing pFopflash from those expressing pTopflash. Each experiment was conducted twice in triplicate, and the results were analyzed using linear regression analysis. Stably inducible PC12 HD-Q74 (lines 1b and 10) and PC12 HD-Q23 (lines 14 and 20) (25Wyttenbach A. Swartz J.E. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F.

Cells were left uninduced or induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline after the initial 5-h transfection period. Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection, and reporter assays were done as described above. We have previously shown that transient or stable induced expression of an EGFP-tagged HD exon 1 fragment with 74 glutamines (EGFP-HDQ74) in different cell lines is associated with the formation of intracellular aggregates in a proportion of cells. EGFP-HDQ74 causes significantly more cell death, compared with the corresponding “wild type” EGFP-HDQ23, which does not form aggregates (4Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Furlong R.A.

We tested the effect of chronic treatment with 2.5 or 5 mmLiCl on polyglutamine aggregation and cell death in COS-7 (nonneuronal) and SK-N-SH (neuronal) cell lines (Fig.1). These LiCl concentrations mimic the extracellular fluid levels that would be seen in vivo with doses used to treat patients with bipolar affective disorder (26Nonaka S. Hough C.J. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We pretreated cells with LiCl for 3 days prior to transfection and continued treatment after transfection, since a number of studies (27Nonaka S. Chuang D.M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2081-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar,28Chaleka-Franaszek E. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8745-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) have suggested that acute treatment does not have a protective effect against cell death. Cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection, when 40–50% of EGFP-positive untreated/control COS-7 cells expressing EGFP-HDQ74 had inclusions and 40–45% showed nuclear fragmentation. At this time point, 40–47% of control SK-N-SH cells expressing EGFP-HDQ74 contained inclusions, and the same proportion of cells had fragmented/condensed nuclei. LiCl treatment showed a consistent and significant protective effect against polyglutamine-induced cell death in both cell lines (Fig. 1,a and b). LiCl also significantly reduced aggregate formation by EGFP-HDQ74 in both cell lines (Fig. 1,c and d). Odds ratios (see “Experimental Procedures”) were considered to be the most appropriate summary statistic for multiple independent experiments of this type, because the percentage of cells with nuclear abnormalities under specified conditions varied between experiments on different days, whereas the relative change in the proportion of cells nuclear abnormalities induced by a perturbation is expected to be more constant (4Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J.E. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2898-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Wyttenbach A.

Whereas LiCl is believed to be a relatively specific inhibitor of GSK-3β, it is likely to have other effects (29Ikonomov O.C. Manji H.K. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1999; 156: 1506-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the protective effect of LiCl against polyglutamine-induced cell death was mimicked by the apparently specific GSK-3β inhibitor, SB216763 (30Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In both COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells, SB216763 treatment was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in polyglutamine-induced cell death compared with controls (Fig. 2,a and b). However, in contrast to LiCl, SB216763 was associated with an increase in the proportion of cells with aggregates (Fig. 2, c and d). To further confirm that GSK-3β inhibition could reduce polyglutamine-induced cell death, we used a dominant negative GSK-3β mutant (31Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (955) Google Scholar) in a co-transfection experiment together with EGFP-HDQ74 in SK-N-SH cells. As shown in Fig.3, the dominant negative mutant had the same effect as SB216763 and decreased polyglutamine-induced cell death but increased the proportion of cells with aggregates (compared with an empty vector control).Figure 3A dominant negative GSK-3β mutant reduces poly(Q)-induced cell death. In SK-N-SH cells transfected with EGFP-Q74, overexpression of a dominant negative GSK-3β mutant significantly reduced cell death as evidenced by nuclear fragmentation (a) and increased inclusion formation (b). The figure represents the odds ratios for two independent experiments each done in triplicate. Theerror bars represent the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio. ***, p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Compared with untreated control cells, neither LiCl nor SB216763 (at the highest concentrations used) were toxic to the cells, and neither compound modulated the low background levels of cell death in the cells expressing EGFP-HDQ23, as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). We examined levels of protein expression by flow cytometry using EGFP-HDQ23, since transient transfection with this construct gives uniform cytoplasmic EGFP expression and does not interfere with the fluorescence read-out signal. In contrast, a proportion of cells expressing the mutant EGFP-HDQ74 constructs form intracellular aggregates, which tend to sequester all the cytoplasmic EGFP and result in a spuriously low fluorescence read-out signal. Neither LiCl nor SB216763 (at the highest concentrations used) modulated EGFP-HDQ23 expression. To test whether LiCl and SB216763 protected against polyglutamine-induced toxicity by up-regulating the levels of stress-inducible heat shock proteins, we analyzed Western blots on COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells, which had been treated with LiCl or with SB216763 according to the protocol that had been used for the EGFP-HDQ74-transfected cells. Neither compound induced any significant changes in the expression levels of HSP70 or HSP27 (Fig.4, a and b). Since LiCl may mediate antiapoptotic effects by up-regulating Bcl-2, we tested whether overexpression of a Bcl-2 construct together with EGPF-HDQ74 could rescue polyglutamine-induced toxicity. We found that Bcl-2 overexpression significantly reduced polyglutamine-induced death in SK-N-SH cells (Fig.5). However, this mechanism is unlikely to be responsible for the protection mediated by LiCl or SB216763 in our HD model, since neither compound induced detectable changes in the levels of protein expression of Bcl-2 or p53 (which negatively regulates Bcl-2 expression) (Fig. 4, c andd). To determine whether LiCl had an effect on GSK-3-mediated β-catenin signaling, we used the pTopflash or pFopflash luciferase reporter plasmids. The pTopflash (wild type) and pFopflash (mutant) constructs contain a luciferase reporter under the control of two repeats, each containing three copies of the Tcf binding site (wild type) upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter. pFopflash contains mutated Tcf binding sites and was used to control for the transcriptional activity of the reporter that was independent of Tcf elements. We co-transfected COS-7 cells, pretreated with LiCl or SB216763, with pTopflash or pFopflash and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid under the control of a constitutively active human elongation factor 1α promoter in a 3:1 ratio. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified to control for transfection efficiency in each well. In each condition, we compared the wild type with mutant Tcf-containing vectors to determine the extent of transcriptional activation specifically due to the Tcf elements. LiCl treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in β-catenin-mediated transcription (p = 0.05,r2 = 0.77), and this effect was even more pronounced with SB216763 treatment (p = 0.0004,r2 = 0.89) (Fig.6). To confirm that the protective effect of LiCl against polyglutamine-induced toxicity could be mediated through activation of Tcf transcription, we overexpressed either wild type β-catenin or the S33Y β-catenin mutant, which is resistant to degradation (32Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar), together with EGFP-HDQ74 in COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells. As shown in Fig.7, overexpression of either wild type β-catenin or the S33Y β-catenin mutant in COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells decreased polyglutamine-mediated cell death (compared with an empty vector control) but increased the proportion of EGFP-positive cells with inclusions. The trend toward an enhanced protective effect of the S33Y mutant in SK-N-SH cells is compatible with its greater stability. The above data suggest that GSK-3β inhibition rescues polyglutamine-mediated cell death by increasing levels of Tcf-mediated transcription, which is mediated by β-catenin. Thus, we tested whether this component of the Wnt signaling pathway was impaired by the HD mutation. To avoid the confounds of triple transfection and cell death in reporter gene studies of promoter activity, we studied this pathway in our PC12-stable doxycycline-inducible cell lines (25Wyttenbach A. Swartz J.E. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These lines, which we have previously characterized, show minimal cell death for the first 3 days after induction (25Wyttenbach A. Swartz J.E. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allow us to analyze promoter activity using conventional double transfection with the luciferase reporter gene of interest and β-galactosidase-expressing vector to control for transfection efficiency. We studied two independent mutant and two independent wild type lines induced to express either EGFP-HDQ74 or EGFP-HDQ23 constructs. Cells were transfected with pTopflash or pFopflash vectors 5 h before induction and analyzed 48 h after induction. Fig 8 shows that Tcf-mediated transcription was significantly reduced in the HDQ74 lines, compared with the HD-Q23 lines. This reduction was associated with a parallel reduction in β-catenin levels (Fig.9).Figure 9β-Catenin levels are reduced in cells expressing expanded poly(Q) repeats. Western blot showing down-regulation of endogenous β-catenin in PC 12 cells expressing EGFP-HDQ74 (lanes 1 and 2) as compared with cells expressing EGFP-HDQ23 (lanes 3 and4). Data are shown for two independent clonal lines for both EGFP-HDQ74 and EGFP-HDQ23, each induced for 48 h. The blot was reprobed with anti-actin antibody as a control for loading. This result was consistently reproducible.

However, neither endogenous nor exogenously transfected β-catenin was associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions formed by EGFP-HDQ74 in COS-7 cells (data not shown). We also observed no association of GSK-3β with inclusions (data not shown). Our data show that inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl, SB216763, or a dominant negative GSK-3β construct protects against polyglutamine-induced death in SK-N-SH and COS-7 cells. These protective effects are mediated, at least in part, by β-catenin, since LiCl and SB216763 enhance the β-catenin-dependent Tcf transcription pathway and β-catenin overexpression protects against polyglutamine-induced death. The protective effect of LiCl at concentrations mimicking what would be seen at therapeutic dosesin vivo suggests that this drug needs serious consideration for therapeutic trials in HD mouse models, which we are planning. However, such trials will need to be carefully conducted, given the narrow therapeutic range of this drug. Whereas all of the compounds with GSK-3β-inhibitory activity reduced cell death caused by the HD mutation, it was interesting that LiCl reduced the proportion of cells with aggregates but SB216763, the dominant-negative GSK-3β, and β-catenin increased the proportions of cells with aggregates. It is possible that LiCl may perturb other pathways unrelated to GSK-3β (29Ikonomov O.C. Manji H.K. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1999; 156: 1506-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). If GSK-3β inhibition modulated cell death but not aggregation, then the apparent dissociation between aggregation and cell death seen with SB216763, the dominant-negative GSK-3β, and β-catenin would occur if aggregates were protective, epiphenomena, or deleterious; aggregate formation will be more likely in cells that remain attached to a coverslip for longer times due to the reduced rate of cell death. The protective effects of GSK-3β inhibition in our model did not appear to be associated with a heat shock response or due to elevated levels of Bcl-2 and decreased p53. Whereas some studies have suggested that GSK-3β modulates these pathways, Cohen and Frame (33Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 10: 769-776Crossref Scopus (1304) Google Scholar) have argued that many of the putative GSK-3β substrates have not yet been shown to fulfill series of criteria that are needed for them to be considered as true physiological targets. Since overexpression of β-catenin rescued polyglutamine-induced cell death, we tested whether this pathway was impaired in our HD cell model. In cells expressing expanded repeats, there was a reduction in β-catenin levels that was associated with a parallel reduction in Tcf-mediated transcription, as compared with cells expressing wild type constructs. It is unclear how the polyglutamine expansion mutation exerts this effect. Neither β-catenin nor GSK-3β was associated with aggregates. It may be difficult to elucidate how the HD mutation affects β-catenin levels, since many of the details of the Wnt signaling pathway upstream of GSK-3β have yet to be elucidated. In conclusion, we find that GSK-3β inhibition rescues polyglutamine-induced cell death in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines. This protection is mediated by increases in β-catenin and its associated transcriptional pathway. This pathway is likely to be relevant to the polyglutamine-induced cell death in our models, since we demonstrated decreased levels of β-catenin and Tcf-mediated transcription in cells expressing expanded repeats. Since LiCl, a commonly used drug, can protect against polyglutamine toxicity via this pathway in both neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines, it is an excellent candidate for further in vivo therapeutic trials.

In these studies, we investigated signaling mechanisms governing p75-mediated death of hippocampal neurons, specifically the role of caspases. Although p75 is structurally a member of the Fas/TNFR1 receptor family, caspase-8 was not required for p75-mediated death, unlike other members of this receptor family. In contrast, p75-mediated neuronal death was associated with mitochondrial loss of cytochrome c and required Apaf-1 and caspase-9, -6, and -3. In particular, caspase-6 plays a central role in mediating neurotrophin-induced death, illuminating a novel role for this caspase. Inhibition of DIABLO/Smac, which blocks inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, protected cells from death, whereas simultaneous inhibition of both DIABLO/Smac and MIAP3 allowed trophin-induced death to proceed. In vivo, pilocarpine-induced seizures, previously shown to up-regulate p75 expression and increase neurotrophin production, caused activation of caspase-6 and -3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in p75-expressing hippocampal neurons. In p75−/− mice, no activated caspase-3 was detected, and there was a marked reduction in the number of dying neurons after pilocarpine treatment compared with wild type mice.

The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF),1 brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4 clearly play a role in determining developmental survival of neurons but also can cause neuronal death, depending on the receptors that are activated. Neurotrophin effects on survival and differentiation are mediated by activation of Trk receptors (1Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 2Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), whereas effects on cell death are mediated by activation of the p75 receptor in the absence of Trk signaling (3Rabizadeh S. Bredesen D.E. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V.

The pathways by which neurotrophins signal cell survival have been studied extensively, whereas little is known concerning the mechanisms by which neurotrophins signal neuronal death. It is increasingly apparent that neurotrophins play important roles in signaling neuronal death during development and after brain injury. We have previously demonstrated that all neurotrophins can elicit death of hippocampal neurons that express p75 in the absence of the cognate Trk receptor (6Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the mechanisms governing p75-mediated death of hippocampal neurons, specifically the role of caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as zymogens and can be activated by cleavage, by oligomerization, or by interacting with an adapter molecule to form an apoptosome (7Salvesen G.S. Apmis. 1999; 107: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar). Two different pathways of caspase activation leading to cell death have been identified, an intrinsic and an extrinsic pathway (9Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The intrinsic death pathway involves mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which interacts with Apaf-1, an adapter protein, to form an apoptosome that activates caspase-9 (10Liu X. Kim C.N. Pohl J. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-9 can then cleave and activate downstream effector caspases. This apoptotic pathway can be regulated at a variety of checkpoints. Activation of caspase-9 by cytochromec/Apaf-1 can be prevented by cytosolic inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). IAPs can themselves be inhibited by a recently identified protein released from the mitochondria, Smac (11Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar), also called DIABLO (12Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Thus, IAPs have antiapoptotic activity, whereas Smac/DIABLO facilitates apoptosis by inhibiting the IAPs. The extrinsic pathway involves activation of death receptors, such as Fas, and recruitment of caspase-8 via interaction of adapter proteins with the receptor's death domain (9Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 then activates effector caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7. Caspase-8 can also activate the intrinsic pathway by cleavage of BID, which induces mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (13Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Due to characteristic structural features, including the presence of a cytoplasmic death domain, p75 has been classified as a member of the Fas receptor family (14Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In these studies, we have investigated the role of specific caspases in p75-mediated death of hippocampal neurons in vitro andin vivo. By defining the caspase cascade activated in p75-mediated death, we will gain more insight into the mechanism of p75 signaling and how it compares with other tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members and gain a broader understanding of neurotrophin actions in the brain. Neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (6Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5112-5123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 18 rat fetuses, dissociated by trituration in serum-free medium, plated on poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml)-coated tissue culture wells or plastic Lab-Tek slide wells, and maintained in a serum-free environment. Medium consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Eagle’s minimal essential medium and Ham’s F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with glucose (6 mg/ml), putrescine (60 μm), progesterone (20 nm), transferrin (100 μg/ml), selenium (30 nm), penicillin (0.5 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.5 μg/ml) (Sigma). In all experiments, neurons were cultured for 4–5 days before treatment. Cultures contained <2% glial cells, confirmed by staining for glial markers. The absence of glia is critical, since astrocytes in culture produce high levels of NGF. Survival of cultured hippocampal neurons was assayed by a method we adapted (6Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5112-5123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Friedman W.J. Frappier T.F. Brown K. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has been used routinely to assess PC12 cell viability (17Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of the medium, cultured cells were lysed, and intact nuclei were counted using a hemacytometer. Nuclei of dead cells either disintegrate, or, if in the process of dying, appear pyknotic and irregularly shaped. In contrast, nuclei of healthy cells are phase-bright and have clearly defined limiting membranes. Cell counts were performed in triplicate wells. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc analysis. Antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized with a thiol linker at the 5′ terminus and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Oligonucleotides were resuspended in deionized water, treated with an equimolar mixture of tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride buffer. An equimolar ratio of penetratin 1 (Oncor) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The yield of the reaction was estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining for the penetratin peptide. For antisense down-regulation studies, hippocampal cultures were treated with various antisense constructs for 5 h and harvested in sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 15% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunostained as described (18Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Hohl J.B. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5007-5016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that there was no cross-reactivity of each antisense with other nontargeted caspase family members, the effect of each antisense construct (240 nm) on the other caspase family members was determined. Anti-caspase-1 was used at 1:1000 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-caspase-2 (19Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:330, anti-caspase-3 (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1:500, anti-caspase-6 (BD PharMingen) at 1:1000, anti-caspase-7 (R & D Systems) at 1:1000, anti-caspase-8 (Oncogene) at 1:500, and anti-caspase-9 (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Co., Ltd.) at 1:1000. For analysis of caspase activation, cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of Tris-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate. Total protein was quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were run on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S to control for equal loading and transfer of samples. The filters were then probed with anti-caspase-6 (BD PharMingen) or anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) used at 1:1000 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Films were scanned into Adobe Photoshop. Male Wistar rats (250–275 g) were pretreated for 0.5 h with methyl-scopolamine (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously; Sigma) and then treated with pilocarpine hydrochloride (380 mg/kg, intraperitoneally; Sigma). After 1 h of status epilepticus, rats were treated with diazepam (10 mg/kg; Teva) and phenytoin (50 mg/kg; Sigma) to stop seizure activity. Additional diazepam was administered as necessary to prevent further seizures. Adult mice (24–30 g) were also pretreated for 0.5 h with methyl-scopolomine and in addition were pretreated with phenytoin (50 mg/kg; Sigma) to prevent mortality associated with tonic seizure, and then injected with 320 mg/kg pilocarpine and scored for generalized clonus with loss of righting reflex. The p75−/− mice are available on two different genetic backgrounds, the original 129/Balb/c mixed strain and those that have been backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6 background. Certain genetic mouse strains are more resistant to neuronal loss induced by seizure activity than others, with the C57BL/6 strain being among the most resistant (20Schauwecker P.E. Steward O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4103-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 21Schauwecker P.E. Brain Res. 2000; 884: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, p75−/− mice on the 129/Balb/c background were used and compared with wild type 129 and Balb/c mice as controls. Five mice of each genetic background (129, Balb/c, p75−/−) were injected with pilocarpine. Since mice are more resistant to neuronal loss after seizures than rats, status epilepticus was allowed to proceed for 2 h prior to treatment with diazepam (10 mg/kg; Teva). Additional diazepam was administered as necessary to prevent further seizures. Control animals received all the same treatments except they were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. During recovery, the animals were treated with Hartman’s solution (130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl, 28 mm lactate; 1 ml/100 g) injected subcutaneously twice daily until capable of eating and drinking freely. All animal studies were conducted using the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight. Sections (12 μm) were cut on a cryostat (Leica) and mounted onto coated slides. Sections were blocked in PBS plus 5% goat serum and permeabilized with PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 and then exposed to anti-p75 (192 IgG; Chemicon; 1:500) and anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-cleaved caspase-6, or anti-cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:500) overnight at 4 °C in PBS plus 0.3% Triton. Slides were then washed three times in PBS, exposed for 1 h at room temp to secondary antibodies coupled to the Alexa 488 or 594 fluorophores (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and washed again in PBS in the presence of Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml; Sigma) to identify apoptotic neurons. No immunostaining was seen in controls with omission of the primary antibodies. Sections were coverslipped with anti-fading medium (Biomeda) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). At least 15 sections were analyzed per animal. Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, exposed to primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature for 1.5 h, washed with PBS, exposed to the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and analyzed with a Perkin-Elmer Spinning Disc confocal imaging system mounted on a Nikon inverted microscope. Epifluorescent (Zeiss) or confocal (Nikon) images were captured digitally and assembled in Adobe Photoshop. The number of dying neurons in wild type and p75−/− mice after pilocarpine-induced seizures was assessed by labeling with Fluoro-Jade B (22Schmued L.C. Albertson C. Slikker W., Jr. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 23Schmued L.C. Hopkins K.J. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) according to the published protocol (23Schmued L.C. Hopkins K.J. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Labeled neurons were counted in three fields from each of three different sections in both the hippocampus and cortex. Epifluorescent (Nikon) images were captured digitally and assembled in Adobe Photoshop. We have previously demonstrated that neurotrophins elicit death of ∼30% of cultured hippocampal neurons, which corresponds to the population expressing p75 without a Trk receptor (6Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since this death pathway may play a critical role in neuronal death during development and after injury, we investigated the mechanisms governing p75-mediated death of hippocampal neurons. To determine whether caspases were necessary for p75-mediated death, we examined whether inhibitors of caspase activity could protect the neurons from neurotrophin-induced death. Pseudosubstrate inhibitors have been widely used to block caspase activity. Although these inhibitors have different affinities for distinct caspases, they are not completely specific. However, at low concentrations they provide an indication of which class of caspases may be involved in the death pathway. The concentrations used for each inhibitor are those that have been found to distinguish among different families of caspases. These experiments demonstrated that DEVD-FMK at 10 μm, a concentration that blocks caspase-3-like caspases, partially protected the hippocampal neurons from neurotrophin-induced death, providing about 50% protection, whereas VEID-FMK (25 μm) and IETD-FMK (25 μm), inhibitors that block both caspase-6 and caspase-8, among other caspases (24Talanian R.

In contrast, YVAD-FMK (25 μm), which blocks caspase-1-like family members, did not protect the neurons from NGF-induced death (not shown). Since VEID-FMK and IETD-FMK can block the activity of both caspase-6 and -8, these inhibitors do not permit discrimination between activation of these caspases. Distinct caspases are activated by different death-inducing stimuli (27Troy C.M. Mattson M.P. Estus S. Programmed Cell Death: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms. 1. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2000: 67-92Google Scholar, 28Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). To identify the specific caspases necessary for p75-mediated death, antisense oligonucleotides to individual caspases were used to determine whether down-regulation of specific caspases could prevent neurotrophin-induced neuronal death. The oligonucleotides were linked to penetratin-1 as a vector to facilitate entry into cells. We have previously demonstrated the specificity and efficacy of these constructs (16Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Friedman W.J. Frappier T.F. Brown K. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Hohl J.B. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A.

Each oligonucleotide down-regulates the targeted caspase by 70–90%, shown for V-ACasp6 in Fig.2b and does not down-regulate the nontargeted caspases (Fig. 2c). The p75 receptor is related to several known death receptors such as Fas and TNFR1. These receptors, when bound to ligand, directly initiate a cascade of caspase cleavages via interaction with adapter proteins. Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase activated by Fas (29Bertin J. Armstrong R.C. Ottilie S. Martin D.A. Wang Y. Banks S. Wang G.H. Senkevich T.G. Alnemri E.S. Moss B. Lenardo M.J. Tomaselli K.J. Cohen J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To assess whether this pathway mediates p75-induced death, cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides to caspase-8 together with overnight exposure to NGF or BDNF. Down-regulation of caspase-8 did not prevent neurotrophin-induced death (Fig. 2a). However, down-regulation of caspase-6 (Fig. 2b) provided about 90% inhibition of p75-mediated death (Fig. 2a). In addition, down-regulation of caspase-3 partially protected the neurons from NGF and BDNF-induced death, providing about 50% protection, suggesting a role for caspase-3 as well as caspase-6 in this death pathway. In contrast, down-regulation of caspase-7, which protects caspase-2 null sympathetic neurons from trophic factor deprivation-induced death (18Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Hohl J.B. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5007-5016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had no protective effect in this paradigm. Antisense oligonucleotides provided to the cultures in the absence of neurotrophins had no effect on neuronal survival. The use of peptide inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides suggested that caspase-6 and -3 were involved in mediating neurotrophin-induced death of hippocampal neurons. Both of these effector caspases require cleavage for activation. To determine whether these caspases were cleaved and activated in the hippocampal neurons, neurotrophin-treated or control cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis for caspase cleavage. NGF and BDNF elicited an increase in the cleaved forms of caspase-6 and caspase-3 in the cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3). There is also an increase in the caspase-6 zymogen after trophin treatment, suggesting increased caspase-6 synthesis in response to the death stimulus. Down-regulation of caspase-8 with antisense oligonucleotides did not prevent neurotrophin-induced death of hippocampal neurons, suggesting involvement of a pathway distinct from that of Fas-mediated death. An alternative signaling pathway leading to activation of caspase-3 and -6 involves the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which interacts with Apaf-1 to activate caspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates downstream effector caspases including caspase-3 and -6 (30Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar, 31Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway mediated p75-activated neuronal death, cultured hippocampal neurons were treated overnight with NGF or BDNF in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides to Apaf-1 or caspase-9. Down-regulation of either Apaf-1 or caspase-9 prevented neurotrophin-induced neuronal loss (Fig.4), providing more than 80% protection from death. The activity of caspase-9 and -3 can be inhibited by IAPs, which thereby suppress apoptosis. The inhibitory activity of IAPs is opposed by a protein released from the mitochondria, Smac/DIABLO, which therefore promotes apoptosis by disinhibiting caspases. Down-regulation of Smac/DIABLO may thus permit the IAPs to block activity of caspase-9 and -3 and protect the neurons from neurotrophin-induced death. To test this possibility, hippocampal neurons were treated with an antisense oligonucleotide to Smac/DIABLO and exposed to NGF or BDNF overnight. The antisense oligonucleotide to Smac/DIABLO prevented neurotrophin-induced neuronal loss by more than 80% (Fig. 4). Simultaneous down-regulation of Smac/DIABLO and MIAP-3, the rodent homologue of XIAP that blocks caspase-9, -3, and -7, restored the ability of NGF and BDNF to induce neuronal death (Fig. 4), whereas down-regulation of MIAP-3 alone had no effect. The hippocampal cultures contain a heterogenous group of neurons, of which 30–40% express p75 in the absence of a Trk receptor (6Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the neurons showing activation of caspase-3 in response to neurotrophin treatment were those expressing p75, we used the antibody to activated caspase-3 together with anti-p75 for double label immunofluorescence. This caspase-3 antibody, used for Western blot analysis in Fig. 3, recognizes only the cleaved p18 fragment and not the p32 zymogen and can therefore be used for immunostaining to detect activation of caspase-3 in situ. Cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with NGF or BDNF for 5 h and then fixed and double-labeled for p75 and activated caspase-3. Analysis by confocal microscopy demonstrated an induction of activated caspase-3 in p75+ neurons after NGF or BDNF treatment (Fig.5). Nearly 40% of the neurons showed activated caspase-3 after neurotrophin treatment, which corresponds to the percentage of p75+ neurons that lack a Trk receptor and die in response to neurotrophins, as we have previously shown (6Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The labeling for activated caspase-3 was prevented by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to caspase-6 but not by a control (scrambled) oligonucleotide (Fig. 5f), indicating the requirement for caspase-6 in the activation of caspase-3 in this apoptotic pathway. The protective effects of the caspase-9 and Apaf-1 antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated that the activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway mediated neurotrophin-induced death of hippocampal neurons. To confirm the role of the mitochondrial pathway, hippocampal neurons were treated with NGF for 5 h and double-labeled with antibodies to cytochrome c and activated caspase-3. In untreated neurons, punctate labeling for cytochrome c was detected throughout the cells, consistent with mitochondrial labeling, and no immunostaining for activated caspase-3 was detected (Fig.6a). When cytochromec is released from the mitochondria, the protein is diffusely distributed in the cell and undetectable by immunostaining (32Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After NGF treatment, all the neurons with activated caspase-3 immunostaining no longer showed the punctate cytochrome clabeling, whereas neurons that still showed punctate cytochromec labeling did not have activated caspase-3 labeling (Fig.6b), showing that loss of mitochondrial cytochromec was associated with activation of caspase-3. To determine whether caspases are involved in p75-mediated death of hippocampal neurons in vivo, rats were treated with pilocarpine to induce seizures leading to neuronal degeneration (33Turski W.A. Cavalheiro E.A. Schwarz M. Czuczwar S.J. Kleinrok Z. Turski L. Behav. Brain Res. 1983; 9: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). A previous study demonstrated expression of p75 on apoptotic neurons in this paradigm (34Roux P.P. Colicos M.A. Barker P.A. Kennedy T.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6887-6896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether caspases were activated in the p75+ apoptotic neurons, rats were analyzed by double label immunofluorescence for p75 and cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved caspase-6 1 day after pilocarpine-induced seizures. Sections through the hippocampus demonstrated that both caspase-6 and caspase-3 were activated in p75+ neurons (Fig.7). No labeling for either p75 or activated caspase-3 or -6 was detected in the hippocampal neurons of control rats (shown for caspase-3). Additional sections demonstrated staining for cleaved PARP, a substrate for caspase-3, in p75+ hippocampal neurons (not shown), indicating that this pathway of neuronal death is activated in p75+ neuronsin vivo as well as in culture. To confirm that expression of p75 was necessary for pilocarpine to induce caspase-3 activation in hippocampal neurons, p75−/− mice were compared with wild type mice. Since the C57Bl/6 strain of mice are extremely resistant to neuronal death induced by seizures (20Schauwecker P.E. Steward O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4103-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), we used the original p75−/− mice produced on a mixed 129/Balb/c background and compared the knockout mice with both 129 and Balb/c wild type mice. All animals displayed generalized clonus with loss of righting reflex in response to pilocarpine. In mice, seizures were allowed to proceed for 2 h from the onset of clonus before diazepam was administered. In wild type mice of both strains, p75 expression was detected on scattered hippocampal neurons by 2 h after pilocarpine treatment; however, no activated caspase-3 was detected yet at this early time point (not shown).

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9224-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas the delayed appearance of pol V, ∼30–45 min post-SOS induction (10Sommer S. Bailone A. Devoret R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), allows mutation-free repair processes to occur prior to error-prone translesion synthesis (8Rangarajan S. Woodgate R.

Microbiol. 2002; 43: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In contrast to pol V, less is known about the cellular functions of pol IV (3Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Although pol IV is not required for SOS lesion-targeted UV mutagenesis, it does cause untargeted mutations on bacteriophage λ, and its overexpression results in an increase of untargeted frameshift and transversion mutations on F′ and chromosomal DNA (11Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Wagner J. Nohmi T.

Genomics. 2001; 266: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). pols II and V are present in the cell at ∼50 (16Qiu Z. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8611-8617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and ≤15 (17Woodgate R. Ennis D.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) molecules/cell, respectively, in the absence of SOS induction. In contrast, constitutive levels of pol IV are ∼250 molecules/cell (15Kim S.R. Matsui K. Yamada M. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).The elevated level of expression in the absence of DNA damage implies a role for pol IV during normal DNA synthesis. For example, pol IV might help in rescuing stalled replication forks. Replication forks are thought to collapse in the absence of DNA damage perhaps as often as once per round of replication (18Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherattt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) and might result from mismatched or misaligned primer ends refractory to proofreading by pol III (19Bloom L.B. Chen X.

By interacting with the β-processivity clamp (7Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 20Wagner J. Fujii S. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Fuchs R.P. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), pol IV might displace pol III core to extend aberrant primer ends (21Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S.R. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Another role for pol IV was revealed by genetic assays showing that it is primarily responsible for increased mutability in starving non-dividing cells (22Foster P.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23McKenzie G.J. Lee P.L. Lombardo M.J. Hastings P.J. Rosenberg S.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a phenomenon referred to as “adaptive mutation.” It has recently been shown that stationary phase E. coli lacking in one or more of the SOS polymerases are less fit when grown in the presence of wild type cells (24Yeiser B. Pepper E.D. Goodman M.F. Finkel S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Given the paucity of information regarding the roles of pol IV in vivo, it is important to investigate the biochemical properties of this atypical polymerase. In this paper, we have investigated the following: (i) the mutational spectrum for pol IV in the absence or presence of β/γ processivity complex; (ii) nucleotide incorporation fidelity and mismatch extension efficiency of pol IV on undamaged DNA; (iii) the biochemical mechanism responsible for the favored generation of −1 frameshift mutations. To examine the mechanism governing pol IV-generated −1 frameshifts, we have measured the change in fluorescence intensity of a template 2-aminopurine while undergoing replication. Based on a crystal structure of Sulfolubus solfataricus Dpo4, a Y family homolog of E. coli pol IV, it has been suggested that −1 frameshifts occur when an incoming dNTP bound at the polymerase-active site is incorporated opposite a complementary downstream template base on a misaligned p/t DNA (25Ling H.

Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 43Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 467-470Google Scholar). pol IV, on the other hand, is believed responsible for generating untargeted mutations (11Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 22Foster P.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), has been found to play a pivotal role during error-free replication restart (8Rangarajan S. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9224-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Rangarajan S. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This paper is focused on determining the fidelity properties of pol IV when copying undamaged DNA and comparing the biochemical properties determined in vitro with mutation spectra. We have investigated the mechanism of pol IV-generated −1 frameshifts with relation to unusual structural features of a pol IV homolog (Dpo4 from the archeon S. solfataricus), which also makes −1 frameshifts avidly (25Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 26Kokoska R.J. Bebenek K. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19633-19638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).A dNTP-stabilized Misalignment Model to Account for −1 FrameshiftsA characteristic property of pol IV is its ability to generate small deletion mutations on presumably undamaged DNA in vivo (42Brotcorne-Lannoye A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3904-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In non-dividing cells, pol IV is responsible for causing about 80% of the adaptive frameshift mutations concentrated within homopolymeric runs (22Foster P.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23McKenzie G.J. Lee P.L. Lombardo M.J. Hastings P.J. Rosenberg S.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). There are numerous different types of slipped p/t DNA structures that can in principal lead to −1 frameshift mutations (36Kunkel T. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously provided kinetic evidence supporting a particular type of misaligned DNA structure to explain single base deletions on damaged (27Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and undamaged (19Bloom L.B. Chen X. Kuchnir Fygenson D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) DNA. This aberrant structure is characterized by having an incoming dNTP bound at the polymerase active site but which is not paired opposite the next available template position. Instead, the bound dNTP is misaligned opposite a template base immediately downstream from next template base (Fig.3A,upper panel). We have coined the term dNTP-stabilized misalignment (27Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) to describe this particular molecular model, which can generate −1 frameshifts in either the presence or absence of homopolymeric template runs (19Bloom L.B. Chen X. Kuchnir Fygenson D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Kunkel T. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Direct evidence supporting the dNTP-stabilized misalignment model as a molecular mechanism for pol IV-catalyzed −1 frameshifts is provided by the observation of a “flipped out” template 2AP occurring when dGMP is incorporated opposite a downstream template C (Fig. 3B). There is a substantial increase in 2AP fluorescence intensity when the analog is no longer stacked within a helix (Fig. 3B,upper trace) (40Law S.M. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12329-12337Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 41Beechem J.M. Otto M.R. Bloom L.B. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10144-10155Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to the increase in fluorescence when C is located to the 5′-side of 2AP, there is no change in fluorescence when the G replaces C downstream from 2AP (Fig.3B,inset). As expected, the fluorescence intensity decreases when dTMP is incorporated directly opposite 2AP on a normally aligned p/t DNA (Fig. 3B,lower trace). The fluorescence intensity remains unchanged when dCMP fails to be incorporated (Fig. 3B,middle trace).We have shown previously that the apparentKm,dNTP values that characterize “correct” nucleotide incorporation on misaligned p/t DNA ends (e.g. incorporation of dGMP opposite C, Fig.3A,upper panel) tend to be much closer to those corresponding to formation of standard W-C base pairs than to the typically much higher values for direct misincorporations (e.g. misincorporation of dGMP opposite 2AP, followed by slippage to align dGMP opposite C, Fig. 3A,middle panel). In agreement with our earlier observations, an apparentKm ∼750 μm for incorporation of dGMP opposite C on a misaligned p/t DNA is closer to the value for the correct incorporation of dTMP opposite 2AP on a properly aligned p/t DNA (Km ∼250 μm), compared with the misincorporation of dGMP opposite 2AP on a properly aligned DNA molecule, which has a Km value exceeding 3 mm.The structure of the S. solfataricus Dpo4 (a homolog of pol IV) ternary complex reveals limited and nonspecific contacts with the replicating bases in the active site (25Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Water might not be effectively excluded from the active site of these polymerases, thus excluding an important source of discrimination against mismatched base pairs (44Petruska J. Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 45Ellenberger T. Silvian L.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 827-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The type II crystals (25Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) of the Dpo4 ternary complex show that two template bases occupy the active site simultaneously with the incoming nucleotide (ddGTP) bypassing an extrahelical template base (G), aligning instead directly opposite thesecond template base (C). The structural data are supported mechanistically by our spectroscopic data showing an extrahelical 2AP when pol IV incorporates dGMP opposite template C located immediately downstream of 2AP (Fig. 3B,upper trace; Fig.3A,upper panel).Relating pol IV Mutation Spectra to FidelityBefore it became known that dinB encoded a DNA polymerase (21Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S.R. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), there was considerable evidence that the generation of small deletion mutations coincided with the overexpression of DinB protein (11Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The biochemical data using a gap-filling lacZα forward mutational assay clearly illustrate the point that small deletions dominate the mutational spectrum by about a 4:1 margin over base substitutions (Fig.2B and Table II). Single base deletions account for about 80% of the frameshifts observed, accompanied by a substantial number of −2 deletions (∼15%).According to the well documented Streisinger model (35Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), slippage of primer and template strands relative to each other in homopolymeric runs can result in frameshifts (Fig. 3A,bottom panel). A defining feature of the Streisinger slippage model is that the mutation frequency at homopolymeric runs increases with the length of the run, because larger runs produce increasingly more stable misaligned intermediates. The rates of pol IV-generated −1 frameshifts are as follows: 0.62 × 10−4 in a non-run, 2.9 × 10−4 in a 2-base run, 0.75 × 10−4 in a 3-base run, and 11 × 10−4 in runs of 4 or more bases (Table I and Fig. 2A). The error rate for the deletion of a base in a run of 4 or more identical bases is highest. However, the error rate for a −1 frameshift in a run of 3 bases is roughly equal to a non-run and is about 4 times lower than observed for a run of 2 bases. Thus, whereas the Streisinger template slippage mechanism might account for a subset of −1 frameshifts, it is unlikely to account for all of them. Instead, a sizable number of −1 deletions could be occurring by dNTP-stabilized misalignment or misinsertion misalignment mechanisms (Fig. 3A,top andmiddle panels). The dNTP-stabilized misalignment mechanism appears to explain a −1 deletion occurring when pol IV copies an abasic template lesion in vitro (Fig. 5). Similar properties have been observed with eukaryotic pol β, but not with pol α (27Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).A potentially significant point is that whereas several deletions of two or more bases occur in short 2–3-base homopolymeric runs, others decidedly do not (Fig. 2B). Given the surprisingly large fraction of −2-base deletions (15% of all frameshifts) that appear in the spectrum, we speculate that the active site of pol IV might also accommodate “looped out” template structures exceeding a single nucleotide, e.g. a slightly more elaborate version of the dNTP-stabilized misalignment mechanism.The lacZα in vitro mutational spectrum (Fig. 2) is generally consistent with measurements performed in vivo for mutations in the cII gene of λ-phage when pol IV is overexpressed (12Wagner J. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4587-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Single base deletions constitute a large majority of the mutations observed in vivo (11Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Wagner J. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4587-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and in vitro (21Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S.R. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar); (Fig. 2A and Table II); however, 2-base deletions (Fig. 2B and Table II) have not been observedin vivo. Perhaps the large distortion introduced by 2-base deletions favor their excision by one of the three proofreading-proficient polymerases in E. coli prior to extension by proofreading-deficient pol IV. Although decidedly in the minority, base substitutions nevertheless compose roughly 18% of the pol IV-generated mutations in vitro (Table II). T → G transversions and T → C transitions are the most frequent base substitutions found in vitro (Table II and Fig.2A), in agreement with in vivo mutational data when pol IV is overexpressed (12Wagner J. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4587-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A → G and C → G mutations are also favored in vitro, as mirrored by in vivodata, suggesting that pol IV may tend to favor changes toward G:C pairs.The obvious limitation when trying to compare in vitrofidelity data with in vivo mutational spectra stems from uncertainty surrounding the individual contributions made by the five polymerases in vivo. For example, an unknown number of untargeted mutations in vivo could result from pol IV replacing pol III core at stalled replication forks (18Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherattt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) and perhaps extending mismatched ends that are refractory to proofreading. The mutator effect emanating from overproduction of pol IV is dependent on its interaction with the β processivity clamp (46Lenne-Samuel N. Wagner J. Etienne H. Fuchs R.P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) which suggests that switching between the two pols can take place at the replication fork (3Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Thus, pol III core-generated errors could be extended by pol IV. Our data suggest that pol IV is reasonably proficient at mismatch extension ( fext0∼10−3–10−5, see Table IV and Fig. 4). However, pol IV appears to catalyze mismatch extension far less efficiently than its human counterpart, pol κ (47Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), by factors of 10–1000-fold.pol IV is regulated as part of the SOS response to DNA damage. However, it is nevertheless expressed at high constitutive levels because the LexA repressor binds poorly to the dinB/dinP operator consensus sequence (48Fernandez De Henestrosa A.R. Ogi T. Aoyagi S. Chafin D. Hayes J.J. Ohmori H. Woodgate R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1560-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The uninduced level of expression of pol IV of about 250 molecules per cell (15Kim S.R. Matsui K. Yamada M. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) exceeds pol II, ∼40–60 per cell (16Qiu Z. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8611-8617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and pol V <15 per cell (17Woodgate R. Ennis D.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Following SOS induction the levels of pols IV, II, and V are increased to about 2500, 350, and 200 molecules per cell, respectively (15Kim S.R. Matsui K. Yamada M. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Qiu Z. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Genet. 1991; 229: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Although geared to function when DNA is damaged, there is evidence supporting SOS polymerase function in the cell in the absence of overt SOS induction (22Foster P.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23McKenzie G.J. Lee P.L. Lombardo M.J. Hastings P.J. Rosenberg S.M. Mol.

A. 2002; 99: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that replication forks are likely to stall at least once per round of replication when cells are growing normally, in the absence of exogenous DNA damage (18Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherattt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Perhaps pol IV is present at a high constitutive level for the express purpose of rescuing stalled replication forks on undamaged DNA, and in so doing may even be responsible for a generating a significant fraction of the spontaneous chromosomal mutations “blamed on” pol III. pol II, also present at an elevated constitutive level, may be engaged in rescuing replication forks that encounter an occasional spontaneously generated lesion, a so-called “cryptic” lesion (8Rangarajan S. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9224-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,9Rangarajan S. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cell could, as a last resort, turn to pol V, whose constitutive level is barely detectable, to copy heavily damaged DNA requiring the induction of SOS.Therefore, a degree of redundancy appears to be present permitting each SOS pol to play either a primary or back-up role when copying damaged or undamaged DNA in place of pol III (3Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The elimination of one or any combination of the SOS pols results an inability of mutant cells to compete with wild type cells when growing in stationary cultures in theabsence of exogenous DNA damage (24Yeiser B.

Expression of PKCδCF contributes to the induction of apoptosis by mechanisms that are presently unknown. Here we demonstrate that PKCδCF associates with p73β, a structural and functional homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor. The results show that PKCδCF phosphorylates the p73β transactivation and DNA-binding domains. One PKCδCF-phosphorylation site has been mapped to Ser-289 in the p73β DNA-binding domain. PKCδCF-mediated phosphorylation of p73β is associated with accumulation of p73β and induction of p73β-mediated transactivation. By contrast, PKCδCF-induced activation of p73β is attenuated by mutating Ser-289 to Ala (S289A). The results also demonstrate that PKCδCF stimulates p73β-mediated apoptosis and that this response is attenuated with the p73β(S289A) mutant. These findings demonstrate that cleavage of PKCδ to PKCδCF induces apoptosis by a mechanism in part dependent on PKCδCF-mediated phosphorylation of the p73β Ser-289 site.

Activation of p53-mediated growth arrest or apoptosis prevents the replication of damaged DNA and thereby maintains integrity of the genome (2Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar). Two p53 homologs, designated p73 and p63, have been identified that activate transcription from p53-responsive promoters and induce apoptosis (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C.

In contrast to p53, p73 and p63 are expressed as multiple isoforms (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F.

The p73 and p63 isoforms can fold into stable homotetramers through interactions of their oligomerization domains (6Davison T.S. Vagner C. Kaghad M. Ayed A. Caput D. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18709-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The available findings further indicate that the oligomerization domain of wild-type p53 does not interact with those of p73 or p63 (6Davison T.S. Vagner C. Kaghad M. Ayed A. Caput D. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18709-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that p73 and p63 can activate p53-responsive genes by mechanisms independent of p53. Several studies have indicated that p73 is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. Initial reports showed that, unlike p53, p73 is not subject to accumulation in cells treated with genotoxic agents (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Other work has shown that the α and β isoforms of p73 interact with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in the genotoxic stress response. c-Abl is activated by DNA damaging agents and contributes to the induction of apoptosis by p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (7Kharbanda S.

Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The findings demonstrate that c-Abl also stimulates p73-mediated transactivation and that p73 participates in the apoptotic response to DNA damage (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies have indicated that p73 is transcriptionally regulated by DNA damage and that a binding site in the p73 promoter is activated by p53 and p73 (12Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These findings have provided support for involvement of p73 in response to genotoxic stress. The protein kinase C (PKC)1family of serine/threonine kinases consists of multiple isoforms with conserved catalytic domains (13Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Differences in their regulatory domains have resulted in classification of the PKC isoforms into conventional, novel, and atypical subgroups. The ubiquitously expressed PKCδ isoform is a member of the novel PKC subgroup and is activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters in a calcium-independent manner (14Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarahsi K. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6927-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ogita K. Miyamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Kikkawa U. Sahara S.

J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PKCδ is also activated by c-Abl in the cellular response to stress (17Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this regard, treatment of cells with ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of PKCδ and translocation of PKCδ to the nucleus (17Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that PKCδ is activated by caspase-3-mediated cleavage at the third variable region (V3) to a 38-kDa regulatory domain and a 40-kDa constitutively active catalytic fragment (CF) (19Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that expression of PKCδCF results in DNA fragmentation has supported a role for PKCδ cleavage in the induction of apoptosis (21Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C.

The present studies demonstrate that PKCδCF associates with p73β. The results show that PKCδCF phosphorylates p73β in part on Ser-289. The results also demonstrate that PKCδCF-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-289 contributes to p73β-dependent activation and apoptosis. HCT 116-3 (22Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I. Lipford J.R. Kane M.

SAOS-2 cells and HeLa cells were grown as described earlier (23Endo K. Oki E. Biedermann V. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Johannes F. Kufe D. Datta R. J. Biol.

Cells were treated with 40 μmcisplatin (Sigma), 20 gray IR using a Gammacell 1000 (2.98 gray/min; Atomic Energy of Canada) or 20 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; Promega, Madison, WI) and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cell lysates were prepared as described (25Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell.

Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-p73 (Neomarkers Inc., Fremont, CA), anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-c-Abl (Santa Cruz) for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were washed in lysis buffer, separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The residual binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters with 5% dry milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-p73, anti-PKCδ, anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-c-Abl (Calbiochem), or anti-p21 (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA). Plasmids expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p73β transactivation domain (TAD; amino acids 1–135), DNA-binding domain (DBD; amino acids 128–313), and oligomerization domain (OD; amino acids 311–499) were prepared by cloning the appropriate PCR product of human p73β into pGEX-2T (Promega). GST-PKCδCF and GST-PKCδCF(K-R) were prepared as described (17Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Plasmids expressing histidine (His)-PKCδCF and His-PKCδCF(K-R) were prepared by cloning PCR products obtained from pKV-PKCδ (21Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y.

For fusion protein-binding assays, purified His proteins were incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting protein complexes were washed 4 times. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-p73 or anti-PKCδ. Gels were also analyzed after staining with Coomassie Blue (Sigma). Purified GST, GST-p73βTAD, GST-p73βDBD, GST-p73βOD, or myelin basic protein (Invitrogen) were incubated in kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm dithiothreitol) containing [γ-32P]ATP or cold ATP. Kinase-active recombinant PKCδFL (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI), His-PKCδCF, or kinase-inactive His-PKCδCF(K-R) was added for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Purified GST-p73βTAD, GST-p73βDBD, and GST-p73βOD was incubated with GST-PKCδCF and [γ-32P]ATP or ATP. The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The p73β band was identified by Coomassie Blue staining and excised from the gel. In-gel digestion with trypsin was performed as described (26Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 27Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). For32P-labeled p73β, the trypsin-digested peptides were fractionated by reverse transcriptase-high performance liquid chromatography. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for [32P]. Positive fractions were subjected to Edman sequencing. For unlabeled p73β, masses of the trypsin-digested peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectroscopy using a Voyager DE-PRO (Perceptive Biosystem Inc., Framingham, MA). p73β(S289A) was generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to change Ser-289 to Ala. Cells were transfected with FLAG-p73β, GFP-p73β, pKV, pKV-PKCδCF, pKV-PKCδCF(K-R), pGFP-PKCδFL, pGFP-PKCδCF, or pGFP-PKCδCF(K-R) (21Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y.

Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulsar, Bio-Rad; 0.22 version, 960 μF; efficiency ∼10–20%). 293T cells were transfected in the presence of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen; efficiency ∼70–80%). SAOS-2 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate (Invitrogen; efficiency ∼15–20%). The cells were harvested at 30–36 h after transfection. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (7Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.015% Brij 35) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and 5 μg of GST-Crk-(120–225) or GST-Crk-(120–212) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. SAOS-2 cells were transfected with p21-Luc (29El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar), β-galactosidase, wild-type p73β, mutant p73β(S289A), PKCδCF, and/or PKCδCF(K-R). Cells were harvested at 36 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were performed as described (Luciferase assay system; Promega). Relative luciferase activity was determined by normalizing luciferase activity with β-galactosidase activity. Analysis of DNA content was performed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (BD PharMingen). The number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content were determined with a MODFIT LT program (Verity software house, Topsham, ME). To define proteins that associate with p73, HCT116 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p73. Analysis of the precipitates by SDS-PAGE and staining demonstrated a coprecipitating protein of 78 kDa. Further analysis of the protein by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectroscopy demonstrated identity with PKCδ (data not shown). To extend these findings, anti-p73 immunoprecipitates from HCT116 cells were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ. The results confirmed the association of p73 and full-length PKCδ (PKCδFL) (Fig. 1). PKCδFL is cleaved by caspase-3 to a constitutively active catalytic fragment (PKCδCF) in the apoptotic response of cells to genotoxic stress (19Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In concert with these findings, treatment of HCT116 cells with cisplatin was associated with cleavage of PKCδFL to PKCδCF (Fig. 1, second lane). Moreover, analysis of anti-p73 immunoprecipitates from cisplatin-treated HCT116 cells demonstrated coprecipitation of p73 with both PKCδFL and PKCδCF (Fig. 1, third and fourth lanes). To assess regions of p73 involved in the association with PKCδ, GST-p73β fusion proteins (Fig. 2A) containing the TAD (amino acids 1–135), DBD (amino acids 128–313), or OD (amino acids 311–499) were incubated with His-PKCδFL or His-PKCδCF. Immunoblot analysis of the adsorbents with anti-PKCδ demonstrated binding of PKCδFL to each of the three domains (Fig.2B). By contrast, binding of PKCδCF was detectable with p73β TAD and DBD, but not the OD (Fig. 2C). These findings demonstrate that p73β binds to both PKCδFL and PKCδCF. To determine whether p73 is a substrate for PKCδ, the GST-p73β fusion proteins were incubated with PKCδFL and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products demonstrated a low level of p73β TAD and DBD phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). As a control, PKCδFL-mediated phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was readily detectable (Fig. 3A). In addition, PKCδFL autophosphorylation was detectable in each of the reactions (Fig.3A). Similar studies performed with PKCδCF demonstrated clearly detectable phosphorylation of p73β TAD and DBD, but not OD (Fig. 3B). By contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation of p73β in reactions containing the kinase-inactive PKCδCF(K-R) mutant (Fig. 3B). To define sites of phosphorylation, p73β was incubated with PKCδCF and [γ-32P]ATP, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The results showed that p73β is phosphorylated, at least in part, on Ser-289 in the DBD (data not shown). To confirm these findings, Ser-289 was mutated to Ala. Incubation of the p73βDBD(S289A) mutant with PKCδCF showed decreased phosphorylation compared with that obtained with wild-type p73βDBD, but not complete abrogation of the signal (Fig.3C). In concert with these findings, PKCδCF-mediated phosphorylation of p73β(S289A) was decreased compared with that found with wild-type p73β (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that PKCδCF phosphorylates the p73β DBD on Ser-289 and that there are additional sites for PKCδCF phosphorylation in the DBD and TAD. To extend the finding that endogenous PKCδFL and PKCδCF associate with p73β in HCT116 cells, we expressed GFP-p73β and PKCδFL or PKCδCF in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A,first to fourth lanes). Immunoblot analysis of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates with anti-PKCδ demonstrated binding of GFP-p73β to endogenous PKCδFL and that the formation of GFP-p73β-PKCδFL complexes is increased by overexpression of PKCδFL (Fig. 4A, fifth to seventh lanes). The results also demonstrate binding of GFP-p73β and PKCδCF (Fig. 4A, eighth lane). Similar results were obtained when FLAG-tagged p73β was expressed with PKCδFL or PKCδCF (data not shown). To determine whether PKCδ affects p73β expression, cells were transfected with FLAG-p73 and GFP-PKCδFL or GFP-PKCδCF. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates demonstrated that PKCδFL has little if any effect on p73β expression (Fig.4B). By contrast, transfection of PKCδCF was associated with an increase in p73β levels (Fig. 4B). Previous studies have demonstrated that PKCδ activates c-Abl (18Sun X., Wu, F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and that c-Abl interacts with p73 (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of PKCδCF on c-Abl, cells were transfected with PKCδCF or PKCδCF(K-R). Analysis of anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of Crk-(120–225) demonstrated that expression of PKCδCF, but not PKCδCF(K-R), is associated with c-Abl activation (Fig. 4C). As a control, there was no detectable phosphorylation of Crk-(120–212) which lacks the c-Abl phosphorylation site (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that PKCδCF-induced activation of c-Abl could function as a second signal in the interaction with p73b. To extend the analysis, HCT116 cells treated with cisplatin were assayed for effects on endogenous p73 expression. The results demonstrate increases in levels of both p73α and p73β (Fig.5A). Moreover, in concert with the finding that PKCδCF and not PKCδFL regulates accumulation of p73, the kinetics of changes in p73 expression corresponded with cleavage of PKCδFL to PKCδCF (Fig. 5B). Similar findings were obtained in irradiated cells (Fig. 5C). IR treatment was associated with cleavage of PKCδFL to PKCδCF, increases in p73β expression, and little if any effect on p73α (Fig.5C). By contrast, there was no increase in p73β expression in cell treatment with TNF-α/cycloheximide (30Johnson B.W. Cepero E. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31546-31553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to induce cleavage of PKCδFL by a mechanism independent of DNA damage (Fig. 5D). These findings indicate that p73β is regulated by PKCδCF in the response of cells to DNA damage and not by pro-apoptotic signaling through the TNF-α death receptor. To determine whether PKCδCF affects p73 function, we transfected SAOS2 cells, which are deficient in both p53 (31Diller L. Kassel J. Nelson C. Gryba M. Litwatz G. Gebhardt M. Bressac B. Ozturk M.

Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection of p21-Luc with vectors expressing FLAG-p73β and PKCδCF was associated with a 5.1-fold increase in p73 levels as compared with that obtained in the absence of PKCδCF (Fig. 6A). As a control, cotransfection of FLAG-p73β and kinase-inactive PKCδCF(K-R) had no effect on p73β expression (Fig. 6A). To confirm these findings, similar transfection studies were performed with the p73β(S289A) mutant. The results demonstrate that, whereas PKCδCF increases expression of p73β, this response was attenuated with p73β(S289A) (Fig. 6B). In concert with these results, PKCδCF, and not PKCδCF(K-R), stimulated p73β-mediated activation of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 6C). In addition, the effects of PKCδCF were attenuated in part when coexpressed with the p73β(S289A) mutant (Fig. 6C). To further assess the role of PKCδCF in p73β-mediated transactivation, we assayed transfectants for induction of p21. As shown previously (11Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Huang Y., Lu, H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), transfection of p73β was associated with increased expression of p21 protein (Fig.7A). Notably, cotransfection of p73β and PKCδCF, and not PKCδFL or PKCδCF(K-R), induced p21 compared with that in cells transfected with p73β alone (Fig.7A). Analysis at different intervals after transfection demonstrated that induction of p21 corresponds with levels of p73β and PKCδCF expression (Fig. 7B). These results collectively demonstrate that PKCδCF induces p73β-mediated transactivation by a kinase-dependent mechanism. To extend the functional significance of the interaction between PKCδCF and p73β, studies were performed to assess whether PKCδCF affects p73β-induced apoptosis. As shown previously (32Ghayur T. Banerjee S. Hugunin M. Butler D. Herzog L. Carter A. Quintal L. Sekut L. Talanian R. Paskind M. Wong W. Kamen R. Tracey D. Allen H. Nature. 1997; 386: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), expression of PKCδCF induces an apoptotic response (Fig.8). Notably, coexpression of GFP-p73β and PKCδCF caused a greater increase in the number of apoptotic cells than that achieved collectively with either alone (Fig. 8). Co-transfection of GFP-p73β and PKCδFL was associated with an increase in apoptosis compared with that found with GFP-p73β alone, but not to the extent observed with PKCδCF (Fig. 8). By contrast, cotransfection of GFP-p73β and PKCδ(K-R) had little effect compared with the percentage of apoptotic cells resulting from expression of GFP-p73β alone (Fig. 8). Diverse substrates are subject to caspase-3-mediated cleavage in cells induced to undergo apoptosis. Whereas most substrates of caspase-3 are inactivated, certain proteins, such as PKCδ (19Emoto Y.

Loss of the N-terminal regulatory sequences results in a catalytic fragment that is constitutively active in the absence of diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (19Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G.

Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration that overexpression of the PKCδ catalytic fragment (PKCδCF) is associated with chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, appearance of sub-G1 DNA, and lethality has supported a role for PKCδ cleavage in the induction of apoptosis (32Ghayur T. Banerjee S. Hugunin M. Butler D. Herzog L. Carter A. Quintal L. Sekut L. Talanian R. Paskind M. Wong W. Kamen R. Tracey D. Allen H. Nature. 1997; 386: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for PKCδCF-induced apoptosis are, however, largely unknown. Certain insights regarding the role of PKCδCF in apoptosis have been derived from the finding that PKCδCF phosphorylates the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (25Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interaction of PKCδCF and DNA-PK inhibits the function of DNA-PK to associate with Ku-DNA complexes and to phosphorylate its downstream target, p53 (25Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Notably, cells deficient in DNA-PK exhibit partial resistance to apoptosis induced by overexpression of PKCδCF (25Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These findings have provided support for involvement of PKCδCF in the regulation of an effector of the DNA damage response. The present studies extend the functional role of PKCδCF by demonstrating an interaction with p73. As found previously for DNA-PK (25Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), p73 associates constitutively with both PKCδFL and PKCδCF. The significance of the association between p73 and PKCδFL is unclear, but conceivably represents a mechanism in which p73 is regulated by signals that activate PKCδFL in the absence of caspase-3-mediated cleavage. Like other members of the p53 family, the p73α and p73β isoforms contain transactivation DNA-binding and oligomerization domains (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A.

The two isoforms differ at their C termini as a result of differential splicing of the p73 mRNA (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Both isoforms activate p53-responsive promoters and induce apoptosis (4Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 36Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar). The homology between p53 and p73 suggested that p73 might function in the cellular stress response. Indeed, recent studies showed that p73 is activated by IR- and cisplatin-induced DNA damage and that this response is regulated in part by the c-Abl kinase (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The findings demonstrate that c-Abl stimulates p73-mediated transactivation (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Moreover, p73-mediated apoptosis is regulated by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated that transcription of the p73 gene is activated by DNA damage (12Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These findings have supported a role for p73 in the genotoxic stress response. The present studies demonstrate that, in addition to c-Abl, p73 is regulated by PKCδ. In this regard, it is noteworthy that c-Abl and PKCδ have been found to interact by cross-activating their kinase functions in the cellular responses to genotoxic and oxidative stress (17Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Sun X., Wu, F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The present results show that both PKCδFL and PKCδCF associate with p73. The results also show that activation by cleavage to PKCδCF is necessary for the detection of p73 phosphorylation. These findings do not exclude the possibility that activation of PKCδ by other mechanisms, such as through interactions with c-Abl, could similarly result in PKCδFL-mediated phosphorylation of p73. Our results further show that PKCδCF phosphorylates p73β, at least in part, on Ser-289 in the DBD. Thus, mutation of Ser-289 to Ala was associated with a decrease in, but not complete abrogation of, p73 phosphorylation. The p73 Ser-289 phosphorylation site (VLGRRSFECRI) is conserved in p53 (LLGRNS269FEVRV) and, based on the p53 structure, is likely to participate in DNA recognition (37Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that, whereas PKCδCF phosphorylates other sites on p73, Ser-289 phosphorylation can regulate the p73 transactivation function. The functional significance of the interaction between PKCδCF and p73 is supported by the finding that PKCδCF contributes to the accumulation of p73 protein. Cotransfection of PKCδCF, but not PKCδFL, with p73β was associated with an increase in p73β levels. As the generation of endogenous PKCδCF requires a pro-apoptotic signal that activates caspase-3, we treated cells with cisplatin. The results show that cisplatin increases p73α and p73β levels and that the kinetics of the accumulation of these proteins corresponds with cleavage of PKCδFL to PKCδCF. Similar findings were obtained after exposure to IR, but not as a result of TNF-α/cycloheximide-induced cleavage of PKCδFL to PKCδCF. These results indicate that PKCδCF regulates p73 in the response of cells to genotoxic stress and not death receptor signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that nuclear c-Abl is activated by DNA damaging agents (cisplatin and IR), but not by TNF-α (7Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Activation of nuclear c-Abl in the response to genotoxic stress is mediated, at least in part, by the protein mutated in ataxia telangiectasia and the DNA-PK (38Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S.

Previous work has also demonstrated that c-Abl contributes to the activation of PKCδ in response of cells to DNA damage (17Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and that PKCδ activates c-Abl (18Sun X., Wu, F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Importantly, nuclear c-Abl also interacts with p73 and stimulates p73-mediated transactivation (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These findings and the results of the present study indicate that a second signal involving c-Abl is likely to contribute to PKCδCF-mediated regulation of p73β in the genotoxic stress response. In concert with this TNF-α-induced model, our findings show that, in the absence of nuclear c-Abl activation (7Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), TNF-α-induced generation of PKCδCF is insufficient to result in the induction of p73β. The results obtained by overexpression of PKCδCF suggest that generation of the catalytic fragment is sufficient to increase p73β expression. Thus, overexpression of PKCδCF was associated with induction of p73β-mediated activation of the p21-Luc reporter and p21 gene. Moreover, PKCδCF-mediated accumulation and activation of p73β were attenuated by expression of the p73β(S289A) mutant. The interpretation that PKCδCF is sufficient to activate p73β, however, is contradicted by the finding that TNF-α induces PKCδ cleavage in the absence of p73β activation. This discrepancy can be explained by the observation that overexpression of PKCδCF, but not PKCδCF(K-R), is associated with the activation of nuclear c-Abl, presumably as a result of the nonphysiologically high levels of PKCδCF that are achieved by this approach. These findings and those obtained with genotoxic agents support a model in which p73β activation is in part dependent on PKCδCF-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-289 and that a second signal mediated by c-Abl may be necessary to fully activate p73β. Previous work has shown that p73α and p73β can induce apoptosis (4Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and that c-Abl contributes to p73-mediated apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (9Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W., Jr. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that E2F-1 induces transcription of the p73 gene and that p73 is functional in mediating E2F-1-induced apoptosis (41Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In concert with these findings and the demonstration that PKCδCF also induces apoptosis (32Ghayur T. Banerjee S. Hugunin M. Butler D. Herzog L. Carter A. Quintal L. Sekut L. Talanian R. Paskind M. Wong W. Kamen R. Tracey D. Allen H. Nature. 1997; 386: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), the present results demonstrate that the interaction between PKCδCF and p73 contributes to the apoptotic response. As the generation of PKCδCF is conferred by activation of caspase-3, the interaction between PKCδCF and p73 would serve to amplify, rather than initiate, the induction of apoptosis. Thus, cleavage of PKCδFL to the constitutively activated PKCδCF would appear to function as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that once a cell has committed to undergo apoptosis then pro-apoptotic effectors (i.e. p73) are subject to potentially irreversible induction by PKCδCF-dependent signaling.

It has been shown that stimulation of β1ARs leads to a protein kinase A-dependent increase in contraction rate. In contrast, stimulation of β2ARs has a biphasic effect on contraction rate, with an initial protein kinase A-independent increase followed by a sustained decrease that is blocked by pertussis toxin. The β2AR undergoes agonist-induced endocytosis in cardiac myocytes while the β1AR remains on the cell surface. It has been shown that a PDZ domain binding motif at the carboxyl terminus of β1AR interacts with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 when both are expressed in HEK293 cells. We found that mutation of this PDZ binding motif in the β1AR (β1AR-PDZ) enabled agonist-induced internalization in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, stimulation of β1AR-PDZ had a biphasic effect on the myocyte contraction rate similar to that observed following stimulation of the β2AR. The secondary decrease in the contraction rate was mediated by Gi and could be blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, a non-selective endocytosis inhibitor, concanavalin A, inhibited the internalization of wild type β2AR and the mutated β1AR-PDZ, and blocked the coupling of both receptors to Gi. Finally, treating myocytes with a membrane-permeable peptide representing β1AR PDZ motif caused the endogenous β1AR to behave like β1AR-PDZ. These studies suggest that association of the β1AR with PSD-95 or a related protein dictates signaling specificity by retaining the receptor at the cell surface and preventing interaction with Gi. β1 and β2adrenergic receptors (AR) regulate the intrinsic contraction rate in neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes through distinct signaling pathways.

Both β1 and β2ARs are expressed in the heart and play critical roles in regulating cardiac function in animals (1Koch W.J. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies show that β1 and β1ARs have very similar signaling properties when expressed in undifferentiated cell lines (2Green S.A. Holt B.D. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 889-893PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence also suggests that they have different signaling properties in differentiated cells in vivo (3Aprigliano O. Rybin V.O. Pak E.

Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Activated β1AR couples only to Gs and leads to a PKA-dependent increase in contraction rate. Activated β2AR undergoes sequential coupling to Gs and Gi and has a biphasic effect on contraction rate, with an initial PKA-independent increase followed by a sustained decrease that can be blocked by pertussis toxin (8Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical evidence suggests that the functional differences between β1 and β2AR in cardiac myocytes may be mediated in part by subtype-specific targeting in the myocyte plasma membrane. Fractionation studies show that β2ARs are concentrated in caveolae structures, whereas β1ARs are mainly distributed in non-caveolar membrane on the cardiac myocyte plasma membrane (9Rybin V.O., Xu, X.

GPCRs can also be recruited into the signaling complexes through the receptor carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain binding motifs, which directly interact with PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins. It has been shown that the β2AR carboxyl-terminal PDZ motif interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF, also known as EBP50) (17Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T.

Recent reports show that the β1AR PDZ motif can interact with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 (SAP90) and MAGI-2 in HEK293 cells (19Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G.

A homologue of PSD-95, SAP97, is expressed in the heart and associates with potassium channels in cardiac myocytes (21Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W. Wingerd K. Clegg D. Vandenberg C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Murata M. Buckett P.D. Zhou J. Brunner M. Folco E. Koren G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2575-H2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the functional role of an interaction between the β1AR and a PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins in cardiac myocytes has not been reported.To investigate the functional role of the PDZ binding motif in subtype-specific signaling by the β1AR, we expressed wild type and a PDZ mutant (β1AR-PDZ) in neonatal myocytes from β1/β2AR knockout mice. In comparison to wild type β1AR, β1AR-PDZ undergoes significant internalization upon agonist stimulation. Moreover, like the β2AR, the β1AR-PDZ couples to both Gs and Gi in cardiac myocytes. Coupling of both β2AR and β1AR-PDZ to Gi is dependent on receptor internalization and can be blocked by concanavalin A. These results demonstrate that association of β1AR with PSD-95 or a related protein dictates signaling specificity by retaining the receptor at the cell surface and preventing interaction with Gi.DISCUSSIONβ adrenergic receptors play critical roles in mediating physiologic responses to the hormone epinephrine and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in animal hearts. Although both β1 and β2ARs are expressed in the hearts and respond to the same physiologic agonists, they show distinct functions in vivo. We have previously shown that β1 and β2ARs display distinct signaling properties in controlling neonatal myocyte contraction rate. Activated β1ARs couple to Gs, leading to a large increase in contraction rate (8Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that the PDZ motif on β1AR is required to restrict coupling of this receptor to Gs in mouse neonatal cardiac myocytes (Figs. 2, 7, and 8). Mutation of the PDZ motif on β1AR or inhibiting the interaction between the β1AR and the PDZ domain protein with a cell-permeable peptide enables the receptor to couple to both Gs and Gi, resulting in a biphasic effect on myocyte contraction rate (Figs. 2 and 8). Thus, β1AR appears to have the structural motifs necessary for efficient coupling to Giin vitro; however, this coupling is inhibited in cardiac myocytes by the association between the β1AR PDZ motif and its binding partner. Based on the observed effect of the PDZ mutation on contraction rate in vitro (Fig. 2), we might expect that a similar mutant expressedin vivo would have a significant and possibly detrimental effect on cardiac function. Therefore, preventing β1ARs from coupling to Gi may be essential for the physiologic function of this receptor.Of interest, the effect of the PDZ mutation on contraction rate is not associated with detectable changes in whole cell cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3). The apparent discrepancy between the results of the contraction rate and the cAMP accumulation assays may be due to technical differences in the assays. To detect cAMP accumulation in myocytes, cultures must be preincubated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutylmethylxanthine) to prevent hydrolysis of cAMP. Thus, the cAMP assay conditions will not fully replicate the more physiologic conditions of the myocyte contraction rate assay. Moreover, a recent report demonstrates that discrete microdomains of cAMP accumulation can be detected in neonatal myocytes following adrenergic stimulation (26Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the whole-cell cAMP accumulation assay may not be sensitive enough to detect small, but functionally significant focal increases in cAMP adjacent to effector molecules.In contrast to β1ARs, native β2ARs undergo sequential coupling to both Gs and Gi, resulting in a biphasic effect on contraction rate with an initial small increase followed by a sustained decrease. Notably, activated β2AR has only a moderate effect on myocyte contraction rate in comparison to activated β1AR (Figs. 1 and 5, and Ref. 8Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that Gs activity may be involved in myocyte apoptosis, whereas activated Giconfers a protective effect against myocyte apoptosis (27Zhu W.Z. Zheng M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Xiao R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 28Xiao R.P. Sci STKE. 2001; 2001: RE15PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, although β2AR/Gi coupling only generates a small negative effect on heart rate (8Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar), its main function may be to activate the anti-apoptosis pathway to protect against the damage induced by chronic β1AR activation during prolonged periods of stress. Indeed, moderate overexpression of β2AR in the heart of transgenic mice leads to an enhanced cardiac contractility without developing cardiomyopathy, suggesting that β2AR can provide contractile support without significant a cardiotoxic consequence (29Dorn 2nd, G.W. Tepe N.M. Lorenz J.N. Koch W.J. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6400-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The dual regulation mediated by both β1 and β2ARs in cardiac myocytes represents a sophisticated mechanism critical for the ability of the hearts to respond to, but not be damaged by catecholamines.There is a growing body of evidence that subtype-specific signaling of GPCRs involves organization of membrane receptors, G proteins, effectors, and regulatory proteins in discrete signaling complexes in the plasma membrane. These complexes are organized by scaffold proteins such as AKAPs (30Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and MAGUKs (31Ponting C.P. Phillips C.

Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), which contain multiple protein-protein interaction domains that can bind to GPCRs, PKA, protein kinase C, PP2A/PP1, and/or ion channels (11Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the PDZ motif on β1AR can directly interact with two postsynaptic MAGUK proteins, PSD-95 (SAP90) (19Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and MAGI-2 (20Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Overexpressing PSD-95 inhibits β1AR internalization and promotes the receptor clustering withN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in HEK293 cells (19Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, overexpressing MAGI-2 enhances β1AR internalization and promotes association of the receptor with a cytoskeleton component β-catenin but not receptor oligomerization in HEK293 cells (20Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the β1AR PDZ motif can bind to proteins within distinct signaling complexes that determine the functional properties of the receptor in different cells. Interestingly, β2AR also has a carboxyl-terminal PDZ motif that does not interact with SAP or MAGI proteins. Instead, it selectively associates with the Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor NHERF/EBP50, a distinct PDZ domain-containing protein (17Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This interaction is critical for the receptor recycling after internalization from the cell surface and affects Na+/H+ exchange in HEK293 cells (17Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar,18Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The observed differences in the β1AR and β2AR PDZ domain-binding proteins may play a role in the functional differences these receptors exhibit in neonatal cardiac myocytes. In agreement with this hypothesis, the β2AR undergoes significant internalization while the β1AR remains on the cell surface following agonist stimulation in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, the β1AR-PDZ, like β2AR, undergoes significant internalization after agonist stimulation in cardiac myocytes. Therefore, the β1AR PDZ motif is critical in determining both the trafficking and the signaling properties of β1AR in neonatal cardiac myocytes (Figs. 2and 4).SAP proteins include SAP90 (PSD-95), SAP93, SAP97, and SAP102, whereas MAGI proteins consist of three close relatives, MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3. Sequence analysis predicts that all SAPs and MAGIs can act as binding partners for β1AR (19Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAGI-1 and SAP97 are also expressed in the hearts, and SAP97 associates with cardiac sodium (33Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and potassium (21Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W. Wingerd K. Clegg D. Vandenberg C. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: H2575-H2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) channels. Studies show that both MAGI-1 and SAP97 also associate with cytoskeleton proteins including β-catenin, α-actinin-2 and E-cadherin (20Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Maruoka N.D. Steele D.F., Au, B.P. Dan P. Zhang X. Moore E.D. Fedida D.

Thus, SAP97, MAGI-1, or similar proteins may recruit β1ARs and ion channels into cytoskeleton-associated signaling complexes in cardiac myocytes. These complexes may not only facilitate the signaling from the bound receptors to downstream ion channels but also tether the receptors on the cell surface by associating with cytoskeleton. Moreover, the cell surface-tethered β1ARs signaling complexes could also prevent the receptor from coupling to Gi.Membrane-permeable peptides have recently been used in cell culture and animals to interfere with protein-protein interactions (36Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). A membrane-permeable peptide containing the β1AR PDZ motif facilitated coupling of endogenous β1AR to Giin cardiac myocytes (Fig. 8) confirming the conclusions based on studies of the β1AR-PDZ mutant expressed by recombinant adenovirus in β1/β2AR-KO myocytes. This data suggests that the peptide can compete with the binding of endogenous β1AR to other cellular components. As a result, β1AR is free to couple to more abundant Gi in addition to Gs in cardiac myocytes. These peptide studies raise the possibility of pharmacologic modulation of GPCR-mediated signaling by disrupting interactions between receptors and scaffolding proteins.In conclusion, we present evidence that the β1AR PDZ motif is essential for the physiologic signaling of this receptor subtype in cardiac myocytes. Disruption of the β1AR PDZ motif enabled the receptor to couple to both Gs and Gi and to enhance receptor internalization after isoproterenol stimulation in neonatal cardiac myocytes. Our observation provides the first clue to the structural basis for the functional differences between β1AR and β2ARs in neonatal cardiac myocytes. β adrenergic receptors (β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR)1 are heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate physiological responses to the hormone epinephrine and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Both β1 and β2ARs are expressed in the heart and play critical roles in regulating cardiac function in animals (1Koch W.J. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies show that β1 and β1ARs have very similar signaling properties when expressed in undifferentiated cell lines (2Green S.A. Holt B.D. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 889-893PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence also suggests that they have different signaling properties in differentiated cells in vivo (3Aprigliano O. Rybin V.O. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2726-H2735PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Bogdanov K.Y. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1611-H1618PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these receptors may differ in other functional parameters such as desensitization (5Michel M.C. Maisel A.S. Brodde O.E. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1990; 30: 37S-42SCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). β1AR knockout mice lack the normal inotropic and chronotropic response to the adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (6Rohrer D.K. Desai K.H. Jasper J.R. Stevens M.E. Regula D.P., Jr. Barsh G.S. Bernstein D. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16694-16700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We recently reported that β1 and β2ARs regulate contraction rate in mouse neonatal myocytes through different signal transduction pathways (8Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Activated β1AR couples only to Gs and leads to a PKA-dependent increase in contraction rate. Activated β2AR undergoes sequential coupling to Gs and Gi and has a biphasic effect on contraction rate, with an initial PKA-independent increase followed by a sustained decrease that can be blocked by pertussis toxin (8Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical evidence suggests that the functional differences between β1 and β2AR in cardiac myocytes may be mediated in part by subtype-specific targeting in the myocyte plasma membrane.

Because many human HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines are resistant to the growth inhibitory activity of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), we examined the possibility that the HTVL-1-Tax oncoprotein regulates TGF-β signaling. We show that Tax significantly decreases transcriptional activity and growth inhibition in response to TGF-β. Tax inhibits TGF-β-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and Smad2 phosphorylation. Competitive interaction studies show that Tax inhibits TGF-β signaling, in part, by disrupting the interaction of the Smads with the transcriptional co-activator p300. Tax directly interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4; the Smad MH2 domain binds to Tax. Furthermore, Tax inhibits Smad3·Smad4 complex formation and its DNA binding. These results suggest that suppression of Smad-mediated signaling by Tax may contribute to HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis. The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax is implicated in various clinical manifestations associated with infection by HTLV-1, including an aggressive and fatal T-cell malignancy. Because many human HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines are resistant to the growth inhibitory activity of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), we examined the possibility that the HTVL-1-Tax oncoprotein regulates TGF-β signaling. We show that Tax significantly decreases transcriptional activity and growth inhibition in response to TGF-β. Tax inhibits TGF-β-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and Smad2 phosphorylation. Competitive interaction studies show that Tax inhibits TGF-β signaling, in part, by disrupting the interaction of the Smads with the transcriptional co-activator p300. Tax directly interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4; the Smad MH2 domain binds to Tax. Furthermore, Tax inhibits Smad3·Smad4 complex formation and its DNA binding. These results suggest that suppression of Smad-mediated signaling by Tax may contribute to HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis. human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 adult T-cell leukemia cAMP-response element-binding protein CREB-binding protein transforming growth factor-β glutathioneS-transferase Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)1 is a human retrovirus that causes both adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and the degenerative neuromuscular disease tropical spastic paraparesis, or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (1Poiesz B.J.

The mechanism of HTLV-1 pathogenesis is still unclear, but it has been postulated that a 40-kDa Tax protein, which HTLV-1 pro-viral DNA encodes, is involved in the hyper-proliferation and transformation of T-cells in ATL.

Through these interactions, Tax enhances the expression of a variety of target genes related to cellular activation and growth.

Aberrant expression of these proteins may be involved in the dysregulated proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells. Tax also induces cell cycle progression through direct interaction with cell cycle regulators. Tax binds and inactivates p16INK4a, a negative regulatory molecule of the cell cycle (25Low K.G. Dorner L.F. Fernando D.B. Grossman J. Jeang K.T. Comb M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1956-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tax may also directly associate with cyclin D, which is important in cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase (26Neuveut C. Low K.G. Maldarelli F. Schmitt I. Majone F. Grassmann R. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3620-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the mechanism of Tax-mediated cellular transformation is a failure to repair DNA damage. As a consequence, Tax-expressing cells accumulate aneuploidogenic and clastogenic lesions which are postulated to lead to a transformed phenotype (27Jin D.-Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 28Majone F. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32906-32910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TGF-β inhibits the growth of most epithelial and lymphoid cells, and this negative regulation of cellular proliferation by TGF-β has been shown to constitute a tumor suppressor pathway (29Markowitz S.D. Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 30Kim S.-J., Im, Y.-H. Markowitz S.D. Bang Y.-J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 have been identified as direct downstream mediators of TGF-β signaling (31Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of these Smads induces their association with the shared partner Smad4 followed by translocation into the nucleus where these complexes activate transcription of specific genes (32Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 33Massagueá J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad proteins contain a conserved amino-terminal domain (MH1) that binds DNA (34Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagueá J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain (MH2) that binds receptors, partner Smads, and transcriptional coactivators (35Shi Y. Hata A., Lo, R.S. Massagueá J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These two domains are separated by a more divergent linker region. A previous report demonstrated that HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines became resistant to TGF-β growth inhibitory activity (2Hollsberg P. Hafler D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 22: 1173-1182Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this TGF-β resistance results from the HTLV-1 Tax protein, and we examined whether Tax alters TGF-β signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that Tax inhibits the transcriptional activation and growth inhibition responses to TGF-β. Tax inhibits TGF-β signaling, in part, by competitive interactions with both Smad proteins and p300. We also show that Tax binds to Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 directly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tax prevents binding of the Smad complex to its target sequence, and thereafter inhibits TGF-β signal transduction. These results suggest that the inhibition of TGF-β signaling by Tax may lead to the HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis. FLAG-tagged Smad2, -3, and -4 deletion constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using a proofreading polymerase and subcloned EF-FLAG vector. All polymerase chain reaction-generated products were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide method. The Tax of a human T-cell lymphoma virus was PCR amplified, restriction-digested, and purified to be subcloned into the MFG vector (36Ohashi T. Boggs S. Robbins P. Bahnson A. Patrene K. Wei F.S., Li, J. Lucht L. Fei Y. Clark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11332-11336Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A IRES-NEO cassette was also subcloned into the constructs to obtain stable transfectants. The control vector, MFG-CAT, was described previously (37Chang J. Park K. Bang Y.-J. Kim W.S. Kim D. Kim S.-J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2856-2859PubMed Google Scholar). For cell proliferation assay, Tax-expressing cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 0.5 ml of assay medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 0.2% fetal bovine serum). After incubating for 22 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β, cells were pulse-labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed, trypsinized, solubilized, and transferred to scintillation vials to measure radioactivity as described previously (18Kim S.-J. Winokur T.S. Lee H.-D. Danielpour D. Kim K.Y. Geiser A.G. Chen L.-S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Jay G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5222-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, minimal essential medium, or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 and Mv1Lu stable cells were transfected with 3TP-Lux (38Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), 4xSBE-luc (39Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol.

After transfection, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h in media. All assays were performed in triplicate, and are represented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent transfections. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 24 h, cells were switched to 0.2% serum overnight, and treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2 h and then whole cell extracts were prepared as described (40Lee D.K. Park S.H., Yi, Y. Choi S.H. Lee C. Parks W.T. Cho H. de Caestecker M.P. Shaul Y. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with polyclonal or monoclonal antisera followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgG, respectively, and visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubation with antibody for 1 h. After immunoprecipitates were washed with the buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 75 mm KCl, Western blots were prepared. C81 and Jurkat cells were treated using the same method as HepG2 cells. The coding region for Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp.). These plasmids were used as templates for RNA synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase followed by translation in rabbit reticulocyte extracts (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The GST-Tax fusion protein expressed inEscherichia coli was grown and partially purified by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads in the presence of the detergents N-laurylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) and Triton X-100. Samples of each protein (0.5–1.0 μg) bound to Sepharose were preincubated with ethidium bromide (40 μg/ml) for 30 min. Then the samples were shaken for 1 h at room temperature with 5–10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated Smad proteins. The beads were washed four times in NETN buffer and boiled for 3 min in 2× SDS-electrophoresis loading buffer before fractionation on 4–20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen). The gels were rinsed in 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. DNA binding using biotinylated oligonucleotides was performed as described (41Tada K. Inoue H. Ebisawa T. Makuuchi M. Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 2 h. After preclearing with streptavidin-agarose for 1 h, cell lysates were incubated with 30 pmol of biotinylated double stranded 3xCAGA oligonucleotides and 12 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 1 h. Proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose for 30 min, washed, and detected by immunoblotting. Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (42Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.-B. Sausville E.A. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Lee B.I. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5168-5174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To prepare the nuclear extracts from CV-1-neo and CV-1-Tax cells, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 for 24 h and lysed and used in a gel shift assay. Briefly, the cells were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 2 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per ml, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4 °C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation (15 s), rinsed once in buffer A, and resuspended in 2/3 packed cell volume of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per ml). Nuclei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin per ml). Nuclear extracts were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. The extract (30 μg) was incubated with the oligonucleotide probe (41Tada K. Inoue H. Ebisawa T. Makuuchi M. Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) labeled with [32P] (2 × 105 cpm) in 20 μl of reaction buffer at room temperature for 20 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed. To examine the role of Tax in TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with a Tax expression construct and either the TGF-β-responsive 3TP-lux reporter construct or SBE4-luc, which contains four SBE (Smad-binding element) sites in tandem (39Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Introduction of Tax repressed the TGF-β-dependent activities of these reporter gene constructs (Fig. 1, A andB) suggesting that Tax represses TGF-β-induced transactivation. The repression of the SBE4-luc reporter activity by Tax suggests that it may directly inhibit the transcriptional activation of Smad complexes. To confirm that Tax is directly involved in Smad-mediated transcriptional activation, we used a heterologous reporter assay in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was fused to various Smad proteins. Gal4-Smad2, Gal4-Smad3, or Gal4-Smad4 expression constructs were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct (G5E1b-lux), which contained five Gal4-binding sites upstream of the AdE1b TATA box. As expected, TGF-β treatment did not induce transcription by the minimal Gal4-DNA binding domain, and Tax did not have any effect on its transcription. However, cotransfection of a Tax expression vector with Gal4-Smad2, Gal4-Smad3, or Gal4-Smad4 decreased the TGF-β-dependent activation of these constructs (Fig.1C), demonstrating that Tax can directly diminish Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. To examine whether Tax renders resistance to the TGF-β growth inhibitory activity, we generated Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells stably expressing Tax. TGF-β inhibited the proliferation of control Mv1Lu cell, whereas overexpression of Tax abrogated TGF-β growth inhibitory activity (Fig. 2A). We also examined the inhibitory effect of Tax on the TGF-β-induced induction of the endogenous target gene. An asynchronous population of either control CV-1 or Tax-expressing CV-1 cells (Fig. 2C) was treated with TGF-β1 for 20 h, and Western blot analysis of p21 was performed. TGF-β1 treatment resulted in an ∼9–10-fold increase in the level of p21 protein in control CV-1 cells, whereas the induction of the p21 protein level by TGF-β1 was markedly decreased in CV-1-Tax cells (Fig. 2D). We next examined whether Tax inhibits phosphorylation of Smad2 in response to TGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 2E, TGF-β1 treatment increased phosphorylation of Smad2 in control CV-1 cells, but the level of Smad2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in CV-1-Tax cells. To address the mechanism whereby Tax suppresses the transcriptional activation of the TGF-β signal transduction pathway, cells were co-transfected with Tax and an increasing dose of either p300 or p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) (Fig.3A). A previous study has demonstrated that Tax inhibits the ability of the Smads to mediate TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation by interfering with the recruitment of CBP/p300 (43Mori N. Morishita M. Tsukazaki T. Giam C-Z. Kumatori A. Tanaka Y. Yamamoto N. Blood. 2001; 97: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We confirmed this observation as well. As shown in Fig. 3A, Tax inhibited the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity, but p300 restored the suppression of the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation by Tax in a dose-dependent manner. PCAF, however, failed to restore the suppressed activity. Tax also suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, the potentiation of the TGF-β transcriptional activity by p300 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Tax may block the interaction between the Smads and p300. To confirm this hypothesis, we assessed the interaction between transfected Smad2 and endogenous p300 in HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of Tax. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous p300, followed by Western blotting with FLAG antibody to detect Smad2, showed that overexpression of Tax interferes with the interaction of p300 with Smad2. Increasing the amount of transfected Smad2 overcame the Tax-mediated inhibition and restored the Smad2/p300 association (Fig.3C). These data suggest that Tax inhibits Smad signaling by competing with Smad2 for binding to p300. To examine the possibility that Tax interacts directly with Smad proteins, we used HepG2 cells transfected with a Tax expression vector and FLAG/Myc-tagged Smad expression constructs. There was a ligand-independent interaction between Tax and Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 (Fig. 4,A–C). Immunoprecipitation assays were also performed using SW480 cell extracts. We had the same results as in HepG2 cells (data not shown). The interaction between these Smad proteins and Tax was also studied by GST pull-down assays in vitro using35S-labeled Smad2, -3, and -4 proteins. Tax interacted with35S-labeled Smad2, -3, or -4 (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrated that Tax binds to Smad2, -3, or -4 directly. To demonstrate that Tax interacts with Smad2, -3, and -4 in vivo, C81 cells, an HTLV-1-transformed T-cell line that constitutively expresses Tax, were used (44Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanarama V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from C81 cells and from Jurkat cells for control. Expression of endogenous Smad2, -3, and -4 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against these proteins (Fig. 4). Tax was only detected in C81 cells (Fig.5A, the bottom panel of lane 2). Total cell extracts were prepared from Jurkat and C81 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Tax antibody or Smad3 antibody. The resulting Western blots demonstrate that Tax was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Smad2, -3, or -4 (Fig. 5B). Immunoprecipitation assays were performed using various FLAG-tagged Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 expression constructs along with a full-length Tax to determine the domain of Smad2, -3, or -4 interacting with Tax. Tax was found to associate with the carboxyl-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2, -3, or -4, but not with the amino-terminal MH1 or middle linker domain of this molecule (Fig. 6,B,D, andF), demonstrating that the MH2 domain contained the Tax interaction domain. Because Tax interacts with the MH2 domains of the Smads, which are the R-Smad/Smad4 interaction domains, we examined whether Tax inhibits this complex formation. The Myc-tagged Smad4 expression construct was co-transfected with the FLAG-tagged Smad3 expression construct together with or without the Tax expression construct into HepG2 cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 for 30 min and whole cell extracts were prepared. To investigate Smad3·Smad4 complex formation, total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and FLAG-Smad3 bound to Myc-Smad4 was examined using anti-FLAG antibody by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, Tax expression markedly decreased the level of Smad3 bound to Smad4, demonstrating that Tax inhibits R-Smad·Smad4 complex formation. To confirm the mechanism of Tax blocking on TGF-β signaling, we examined the effect of Tax mutants M22 and M47 on TGF-β-induced transcription. M22 (T130A,L131S) is a mutant that is partially defective in dimerization (45Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 46Tie F. Adya N. Greene W.C. Giam C-Z. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8368-8374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, M47 (L319R,L329S) is a COOH-terminal mutant that retains the ability to form dimers and bind CREB (45Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 46Tie F. Adya N. Greene W.C. Giam C-Z. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8368-8374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the luciferase assays using 3TP-Lux, a TGF-β responsive reporter plasmid, both wild-type Tax and M22 were able to significantly repress the TGF-β-dependent activities of this reporter gene construct. However, Tax mutant M47 failed to repress TGF-β-induced transactivation (Fig. 8A). Using these Tax mutant constructs together with a wild-type Tax, we performed immunoprecipitation assays with anti-FLAG antibody for Smad3. As shown in Fig. 8B, wild-type Tax and M22 showed interaction with Smad3, however, the ability of M47 to interact with Smad3 was markedly decreased (Fig. 8B). This result suggests that M47 cannot repress TGF-β transcription activity because of its inability to interact with Smad3. Using M22 and M47 Tax mutants together with a wild-type Tax, we performed the CAGA binding assay (41Tada K. Inoue H. Ebisawa T. Makuuchi M. Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) after transient transfection into HepG2 cells. In Fig.9A, TGF-β treatment showed Smad3 binding to the CAGA element (upper panel, lane 2), and this binding is significantly diminished in the wild-type Tax-transfected HepG2 cells (lane 3). However, Tax mutant M47 failed to block this binding (Fig. 9A, lane 4). In contrast, M22 showed the inhibitory activity on this binding as much as wild-type Tax (Fig. 9A, lane 5). To examine whether Tax inhibits the formation of the Smad-containing complex, we also performed a gel shift assay using an oligonucleotide encompassing a TGF-β-responsive element in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (−586 ∼ −551). Previous studies have shown that co-transfection of a constitutively active TGF-β type 1 receptor (TβRI-T204D) together with Smad3 and Smad4 generates a Smad-containing complex visualized in a gel-shift assay and this complex can be supershifted with either Smad3 or Smad4 antibodies (31Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from the CV-1-neo and CV-1-Tax cells after TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the formation of the Smad-containing complex in CV-1-neo cells, whereas expression of Tax in CV-1-Tax cells prevented the formation of the Smad-containing complex (Fig. 9B). These data strongly indicate a direct inhibitory role of Tax on the formation of the Smad-containing complex. The pathogenesis of ATL is still not understood, but it has been postulated that the viral Tax protein is involved in the proliferation and transformation of T cells in ATL. Tax is known to modulate cellular proliferative responses through two broad mechanisms. First, Tax directly targets specific transcriptional regulators including E2F, CREB, NFκB, SRF, Iκb, and CBP/P300. The regulation of E2F is a key target for oncoviruses. Binding of pRB and the other pocket proteins to viral proteins, such as adenovirus E1A, simian virus large T antigen, and papillomavirus E7, leads to a stimulation of E2F-dependent transcription. The induction of the E2F DNA binding activity in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and in leukemic cells obtained from ATL patients suggests that the activation of E2F-dependent transcription by HTLV-1 could be involved in the proliferative response during HTLV-1 infection (44Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanarama V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Second, in addition to transcriptional regulation, Tax modifies cell cycle regulators, primarily by affecting inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases. Tax binds to and inactivates the p16INK4a protein, which belongs to the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (25Low K.G. Dorner L.F. Fernando D.B. Grossman J. Jeang K.T. Comb M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1956-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus resulting in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4. This effect of Tax relieves cells from p16INK4a-induced growth arrest and may also contribute to the cellular immortalization and transformation induced by HTLV-1 infection. Our studies have suggested yet another mechanism by which Tax may promote cellular proliferation and transformation. Hollsberget al. (47Hollsberg P. Ausubel L.J. Hafler D.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 566-573PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines become resistant to TGF-β-induced growth arrest. We suspected that the source of this TGF-β resistance resides in the HTLV-1 Tax protein, and that, given the numerous studies that have documented that loss of TGF-β signaling promotes tumor formation, this TGF-β resistance may provide an important means by which these cells become oncogenic. Therefore, to investigate the carcinogenic mechanism of HTLV-1, we explored the influence of Tax on TGF-β signaling. 3TP-Lux and SBE reporter assays, which test the integrity of the entire TGF-β signaling pathway, were substantially inhibited by Tax, clearly indicating that Tax affects some portion of the TGF-β signal transduction cascade. We next localized the point within the pathway at which this blockade occurs by demonstrating that Tax associates with Smad proteins, directly for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. During the preparation of this manuscript, Mori et al. (43Mori N. Morishita M. Tsukazaki T. Giam C-Z. Kumatori A. Tanaka Y. Yamamoto N. Blood. 2001; 97: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that Tax inhibits TGF-β signaling, but does not bind to Smad proteins, a conclusion that is contrary to the results of the present study. The precise reason for this discrepancy is not clear at the present time. Interaction between Tax and Smad proteins may be cell-type specific. One potential argument is that the observed interaction between Tax and Smad in HepG2 cells is an artifact of overexpression of these proteins. However, the results obtained from C81 cells, a cell line that was established from a patient with HTLV-1-induced acute T-cell leukemia (44Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanarama V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), unequivocally demonstrate that Tax binds to Smads proteins (Fig. 5). We have also shown the direct interaction between Smads and Tax by in vitro GST pull-down assays using 35S-labeled Smad2, -3, and -4 proteins (Fig. 4D). To confirm our findings, we examined the effect of Tax mutants, M22 and M47, on TGF-β-induced transcription. In luciferase assays using 3TP-lux, M47 failed to show inhibitory activity on the TGF-β-induced transcription. In contrast, M22 showed significant inhibition (Fig. 8A). This result confirms the finding by Mori et al. (43Mori N. Morishita M. Tsukazaki T. Giam C-Z. Kumatori A. Tanaka Y. Yamamoto N. Blood. 2001; 97: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). They concluded that the differential effect of M22 and M47 on TGF-β transcription might be because of their ability to interact with CBP. However, in another study, it has been shown that M47, defective in the COOH-terminal transactivation domain, continued to interact with CBP/p300 (48Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C., Lu, H. Vassilev A. Nakatami Y. Giam C-Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). They also used a Tax mutant (K88A) defective for the CBP/p300-binding domain, and a KID-like domain in Tax is responsible for the recruitment of CBP/p300 (48Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C., Lu, H. Vassilev A. Nakatami Y. Giam C-Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Tax K88A failed to repress transcription from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (43Mori N. Morishita M. Tsukazaki T. Giam C-Z. Kumatori A. Tanaka Y. Yamamoto N. Blood. 2001; 97: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). They suggested that the CBP/p300-binding domain of Tax is involved in the suppression of Smad transactivation function. Because it is known that Smad2, -3, and -4 bind to CBP/p300, and these interactions are promoted by treatment with TGF-β (49Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 50Nishihara A. Hanai J. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), Tax may inhibit TGF-β signaling by competing for Smad-CBP/p300 interaction as suggested by Mori et al.(43Mori N. Morishita M. Tsukazaki T. Giam C-Z. Kumatori A. Tanaka Y. Yamamoto N. Blood. 2001; 97: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the competition for Smad-CBP/p300 by Tax cannot explain why Tax M47 fails to repress the Smad transactivation activity even though it still interacts with CBP/p300. In this study, we have shown that M47 does not interact with Smad3 and could not block binding of the Smad complex to its target sequence (Figs. 8 and 9). These results may explain why M47 failed to repress TGF-β transcription activity. Taken together, our observations clearly demonstrate that Tax interacts with Smads directly and specifically. Our present study and the published literature suggest that Tax may inhibit TGF-β transcription activity through two different mechanisms, competing for Smad-CBP/p300 interaction and binding to Smads directly. This study demonstrates that HTLV-1 Tax inhibits TGF-β signaling, in part, by interaction with Smad proteins and through blocking binding of the Smad complex to its target DNA sequence. Tax inhibits TGF-β signaling by competitive interactions with both Smad proteins and p300. This decrease in TGF-β signaling likely provides the optimal conditions for tumorigenesis in a way that complete abrogation of signaling could not. Significantly, we have shown that inhibition is sufficient to disrupt the growth inhibitory control that TGF-β normally exercises over T lymphocytes. Without one of the most important brakes on their proliferation, these infected cells can then multiply at high rates. But this inhibition of TGF-β signaling is not complete. In particular, our group has previously shown that cell lines overexpressing Tax still respond to TGF-β1 stimulation (18Kim S.-J. Winokur T.S. Lee H.-D. Danielpour D. Kim K.Y. Geiser A.G. Chen L.-S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Jay G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5222-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Treated cells show increased mRNA production for both Tax and, through an autoregulatory loop, TGF-β1 itself. This excess serum TGF-β1, which has been documented in HTLV-1-infected patients (17Kim S.-J. Kehrl J.H. Burton J. Tendler C.L. Jeang K.-T. Danielpour D. Thevenin C. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), then has the potential to significantly alter the function of the remaining normal lymphocytes, most pertinently by diminishing tumor surveillance. With the immune system hampered in its ability to recognize and destroy emerging malignant clones, the increased serum TGF-β1 can enhance tumorigenesis. This considerable inhibition of TGF-β signaling by Tax thus provides a uniquely favorable environment for the development of T-cell leukemia. Inhibition of Smad-mediated signaling has been suggested as one of the critical mechanisms for leukemogenesis induced by oncoproteins. An oncoprotein Evi-1 has been shown to interact with Smad3 through its first zinc finger motif and to antagonize the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (53Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Evi-1 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes by chromosomal rearrangements involving 3p26, to which Evi-1 is mapped (54Ogawa S. Mitani K. Kurokawa M. Matsuo Y. Minowada J. Inazawa J. Kamada N. Tsubota T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Hum. Cell. 1996; 9: 323-332PubMed Google Scholar, 55Ogawa S. Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Inazawa J. Hangaishi A. Tanaka K. Matsuo Y. Minowada J. Tsubota T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, together with our finding, suggest a new paradigm that suppression of Smad-mediated signaling may contribute to leukemogenesis associated with oncoproteins.

https://openalex.org/W2073983610,"To test the hypothesis that human concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hCNT1 and hENT1) are present on the apical and basolateral membrane, respectively, we constructed a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line that simultaneously and stably expresses recombinant hCNT1 and hENT1 gene products tagged with CFP and YFP fluorescent proteins, respectively. Using a confocal microscope, both hCNT1-CFP and hENT1-YFP were found to be distributed uniformly on the plasma membrane of undifferentiated MDCK cells. Upon differentiation of the MDCK cells on Transwell filter inserts, hCNT1-CFP was visualized exclusively on the apical membrane, whereas hENT1-YFP appeared predominantly on the basolateral membrane. As differentiation proceeded, there was an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, and activity of hENT1 in the apical compartment decreased while hCNT1 activity remained constant. These results suggest that, on differentiation, hENT1 is sorted to the basolateral membrane. This was confirmed when the hCNT1-mediated uptake of [3H]uridine from the apical compartment of the differentiated cells was found to be ∼20-fold higher and that for hENT1 was ∼4-fold lower than the corresponding uptake from the basal compartment. As observed in vivo, the net transport of [3H]adenosine was from the apical to the basal compartment, whereas that for 14C-deoxyadenosine was from the basal to the apical compartment. In summary, we have shown for the first time that hCNT1 and hENT1 are expressed in polarized MDCK cells on the apical and basolateral membrane, respectively, allowing vectorial transport in both directions depending on the relative activity (ratio of maximal transporter activity to affinity) of each transporter for their substrates.

Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the sodium-dependent concentrative nucleoside transporters mediate the influx of nucleosides. Human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hCNT1) is pyrimidine-specific, whereas hCNT2 is purine-specific. Both hCNT1 and hCNT2 transport uridine and adenosine (2Vijayalakshmi D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19419-19423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are insensitive to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). hCNT1 and hCNT2 are expressed on specialized cells such as intestine and kidney epithelia (3Patil S.D. Unadkat J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1314-G1320PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ward J.L. Tse C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1419: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The equilibrative transporters mediate both the influx and efflux of nucleosides and exhibit broad substrate specificity, accepting both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides as permeants. Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1 or es) is inhibited by NBMPR concentrations as low as 0.1 nm (IC50 ∼0.4 nm), whereas hENT2 (ei) transporter is insensitive to inhibition as high as 1 μm(IC50 ∼2.8 μm) (1Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 4Ward J.L. Tse C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). One or both of the equilibrative transporters are expressed in most, if not all, cell types. Although functional measurement of transporter activity has helped elucidate the tissue expression of the concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside transporters, because of the lack of antibodies little information is available on the cellular localization of these transporters. Functional studies using membrane vesicles have shown that the concentrative transporters are found only on the apical membrane of the polarized epithelial cells (3Patil S.D. Unadkat J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1314-G1320PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gutierrez M.M. Brett C.M. Ott R.J. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Franco R. Centelles J.J. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, such studies have resulted in controversial findings regarding the membrane localization of the equilibrative transporters. For example, we have shown that the equilibrative nucleoside transporters, hENT1 and hENT2, are absent from the apical membrane of the human enterocytes (3Patil S.D. Unadkat J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1314-G1320PubMed Google Scholar) and we have hypothesized that they are present on the basolateral membranes (8Chandrasena G. Giltay R. Patil S.D. Bakken A. Unadkat J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1909-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, others have found ENT1 (but not ENT2) to be present on the apical membrane (9Trimble M.E. Coulson R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F794-F803PubMed Google Scholar) or on both membranes (10Doherty A.J. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of the polarized epithelial cells. Because of the lack of availability of antibodies for immunolocalization of the equilibrative transporters, it has been difficult to resolve this controversy. To test the hypothesis that the concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside transporters are present on different faces of the polarized epithelial cells, we have used the model epithelial cell line derived from the kidney, namely the MDCK cells. We constructed a stable MDCK cell line that simultaneously expresses recombinant hCNT1 and hENT1 gene products tagged with CFP and YFP fluorescent proteins, respectively. These cells were then used to test the localization of these two transporters in both the nonpolarized and polarized MDCK cells. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the directionality of vectorial transport of nucleosides across polarized cells will depend on the localization and activity (V max/K m) of these nucleoside transporters for their substrates. Specifically, we asked whether differential localization of hCNT1 and hENT1 could explain the paradoxical observation in vivo that adenosine is actively reabsorbed by the human kidney, whereas deoxyadenosine is secreted. A 1.4-kb human intestinal ENT1 (hENT1) and a 2.0-kb CNT1 (hCNT1) fragment was amplified from the plasmid constructed previously (11Lum P.Y. Ngo L.Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2000; 45: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using primer pairs overlapping the start or end codons. BglII and KpnI sites were added as follows: hENT1, sense (TGATGAAGATCTATGACAACCAGTCACCAGC) and antisense (TAGTAGGGTACCTCACACAATTGCCCGGAACA); hCNT1, sense (TGATGAAGATCTATGGAGAACGACCCCTCGAG) and antisense (TAGTAGGGTACCTCACTGTGCACAGATCGTGT). The fragment was subcloned intoBglII and KpnI sites of the yellow fluorescence vector pEYFP-C1 or cyan fluorescence vector pECFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting constructs, hENT1-YFP and hCNT1-CFP, were used to produce a stable MDCK cell line expressing hENT1 and hCNT1. All constructs were confirmed by automated sequence analysis using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To construct expression plasmids without tagged fluorescence protein, hENT1-YFP and hCNT1-CFP constructs were double-digested withAgeI and BglII. A 5.4- (hENT1) or 6.0-kb (hCNT1) fragment was isolated and ligated after blunting the cutting end to yield hENT1-pE and hCNT1-pE expression cassettes. MDCK cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium with Earle's salts and l-glutamine containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 with 95% humidity. To generate stable hCNT1 and hENT1 transfectants, ∼7 × 105 cells/well were seeded in six-well plates in minimum Eagle's medium 1 day before transfection. The expression cassettes were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.5 μg of the hENT1-YFP and 2.5 μg of the hCNT1-CFP constructs were diluted in 0.25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and mixed with 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent diluted in 0.25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. Then the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was applied to MDCK cells maintained in a six-well plate at ∼90% confluence. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were transferred to a 100-mm dish and cultured in growth medium containing G418 (Invitrogen). The medium was changed every 3 days, and the G418 concentration was varied from 200 to 1000 μg/ml depending on the status of the cells. After selection for 2 to 3 weeks, cell colonies were isolated using cloning cylinders by checking their fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Cells highly expressing both CFP and YFP were subsequently cloned on 96-well plates using limited cell dilution. All uptake experiments were carried out in triplicate in sodium-containing transport buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mm, K2HPO4 3 mm, MgCl2.6 H2O 1 mm, CaCl2 2 mm, glucose 5 mm, NaCl 130 mm, pH 7.4) or sodium-free transport buffer in which NaCl was replaced by N-methy-d-glucamine 130 mm (pH 7.4). The uptake experiments were conducted 3 days after seeding in 24-well plates. To measure sodium-dependent uptake, the cells were washed three times with sodium-free buffer and preincubated with sodium-free buffer with 10 μm NBMPR (in 0.1% Me2SO) for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 0.5 ml of sodium transport buffer or sodium-free buffer containing 1 μm [3H]uridine (1 μCi/ml, 17.7 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) and 10 μm NBMPR were added to each well. To measure Na+-independent facilitative uptake, the cells were washed three times with sodium-free buffer and preincubated with sodium-free buffer with or without 10 μm NBMPR for 15 min. Then 0.5 ml of sodium-free buffer containing 1 μm[3H]uridine with or without 10 μm NBMPR was added to the wells. To control for any solvent effect, an equal amount of Me2SO was included in all experiments. After incubating at 37 °C for 5, 10, or 15 min, the wells were washed rapidly three times with ice-cold Na+-free buffer containing 10 μm NBMPR. The cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH and then neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1n HCl. Then 0.8 ml of the cell lysate was counted on the scintillation counter. Protein in the cell homogenate was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin was used to generate a standard curve to determine the protein concentration. Nucleoside transporter-mediated uridine uptake was calculated as the difference between the uptake by the MDCK cell transfected with hCNT1 and hENT1 cDNAs and the uptake by mock-transfected cells. 1 × 105stable coexpressing cells were seeded on six-well polycarbonate Transwell filter inserts (Corning Costar Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD) and cultured with regular changes of medium for 10–12 days after reaching confluence. To ensure that the cells had polarized and formed tight junctions, transport experiments were conducted when the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values (measured by millicell-ERS; Millipore, Bedford, MA) reached 300–500 ohms/cm2 in representative wells. The Transwell filter inserts were washed three times with Na+-free buffer, and then 1 μm [3H]uridine was added to either the apical or the basal side. At various times, 50 μl of buffer was collected from the opposite compartment, either apical or basal. The transport experiments were terminated by aspirating the buffer, and filters were washed with chilled Na+-free buffer containing 10 μm NBMPR. The whole filter was wiped with tissue to remove any excess buffer, the filter was removed from the plastic support, and the filter was counted on a scintillation counter. 1 × 106 stable coexpressing cells were grown in either two-well Lab-Tek borosilicated coverglass chambers (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL) or six-well Corning Costar polycarbonate Transwell filter inserts for 10–12 days after reaching confluence. The filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, excised, then loaded on a glass slide and covered with a coverslip. Between the slide and the coverslip, an ∼1-mm gap was filled with medium to keep the cells alive. Images were obtained using a Leica TCS NT laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser as the light source. Images were captured by excitation at 458 nm and emission at 470–480 nm (CFP) or excitation at 488 nm and emission at 610–640 nm (YFP). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at 410 nm in 75 mm alkaline buffer solution (pH 10.3, Sigma). The confluent monolayers in 24-well plates were washed twice with buffer solution. Then a buffer containing 6 mm4-nitrophenylphosphate was added to the confluent monolayers. The buffer was then removed from the culture wells after 15 min to measure the liberated 4-nitrophenol at 410 nm using a spectrophotometer. p-Nitrophenol (Sigma) was used to generate a standard curve. The data were expressed as μmol/p-nitrophenol/min/cm2 filter. hENT1-YFP and hCNT1-CFP coexpressing and mock cells were seeded on six-well polycarbonate Transwell filter inserts and cultured for 10–12 days with a regular change of medium. Transport experiments were conducted when the transepithelial electrical resistance reached 300–500 ohms/cm2 in a representative well. The filter inserts were washed three times and preincubated with 500 μm adenosine deaminase inhibitor erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride for 30 min. Then 8 μm [3H]adenosine (32.1 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals) and 8 μm[14C]deoxyadenosine (56 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) were loaded in the basal or apical compartment of the Transwell filter inserts. Transport experiments were conducted with buffer (1.0 ml in the apical compartment and 1.5 ml in the basal compartment) containing sodium but not NBMPR on both sides of the Transwell filters. Fifty μl of buffer from the compartment opposite the loading side were sampled at various times (up to 60 min), and the buffer was replenished immediately. At the end of the experiments, the filters were washed and removed from plastic supports to measure the cell contents of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. The cells on the filters were solubilized by 0.3 ml of 1 n NaOH and then neutralized by 0.3 ml of 1 nHCl. Radioactivity was counted using a dual channel scintillation counter. To determine the maximum possible metabolism of [3H]adenosine and [14C]deoxyadenosine under the above described transport conditions, the above experiment was repeated for 60 min on a separate batch of cells. Buffer samples from the loading and the contralateral compartments were collected, and cells on the filters were sonicated in the presence of 1 ml of methanol and then centrifuged at 700 × g for 15 min. The cell lysates were diluted twice with water. Fifty-μl samples were injected onto a C18 HPLC column (Econosil, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μ, Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL). The column was eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 20% methanol and 80% water (0.8 ml/min). The HPLC effluent was collected every 30–60 s for 30 min and counted using a dual channel scintillation counter. Elution times of adenosine and deoxyadenosine were confirmed by injection of cold standards and detection at 254 nm. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of uptake values obtained in three wells or filter inserts. Data are representative of a minimum of two experiments carried out on different days on different batches of cell. We chose to use MDCK cells for expression of human nucleoside transporters for several reasons. First, they readily express heterologous proteins. Second, the cells can be readily differentiated into polarized cells, allowing the study of localization of nucleoside transporters in the undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Third, these cells have been studied extensively in the past to determine localization and mechanisms of sorting of numerous other membrane proteins. To conveniently and simultaneously detect the localization of both hCNT1 and hENT1 in polarized MDCK cells, we constructed cyan and yellow fluorescence fusion proteins of these gene products. Cells expressing individual proteins were used to confirm that there was no overlap in the emission signal between YFP and CFP (data not shown). Localization of hCNT1 and hENT1 in undifferentiated MDCK cells was visualized by confocal microscopy. CFP-tagged hCNT1 and YFP-tagged hENT1 exhibited an even distribution on the plasma membrane of the cell (Fig. 1,A and B). In cells expressing both proteins, their areas of localization overlapped (Fig 1 C). In contrast, expression of the empty YFP vector showed diffuse localization in the entire cell (Fig.1 D). Because uridine is a substrate for both hCNT1 and hENT1, we used it in our studies to quantify the functional activity of hCNT1 and hENT1 coexpressed in MDCK cells. When the cells are incubated in Na+-free medium and 3H-labeled uridine, only the equilibrative nucleoside transporter activity can be observed (Fig.2 A). At 15 min, hENT1 shows an almost 30-fold greater uptake of [3H]uridine in the coexpressing cells than in the mock (vector only) cells. In the presence of NBMPR (10 μm), which specifically inhibits hENT1 (but not hCNT1), almost all of the hENT1-mediated uptake of [3H]uridine is inhibited, thus showing very clearly the functional activity of hENT1 in these coexpressing cells. Similarly, when the cells are incubated with Na+-containing buffer and 10 μm NBMPR, only hCNT1-mediated uptake of [3H]uridine is observed (Fig. 2 B). At 15 min, hCNT1-mediated uptake of [3H]uridine by the coexpressing cells is ∼60-fold greater than that by mock cells. Mock cells demonstrated low hENT-type activity, whereas hCNT1 activity was absent. As previously shown by Mangravite et al. (12Mangravite L.M. Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F879-F885PubMed Google Scholar), we found that [3H]uridine uptake by hCNT1 was comparable with that by hCNT1-CFP. Likewise, [3H]uridine uptake by hENT1 was similar to that by hENT1-YFP (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both hENT1-YFP and hCNT1-CFP are functional when simultaneously expressed in undifferentiated MDCK cells. We used the doubly transfected MDCK cells to test the hypothesis that hCNT1 and hENT1 are expressed on the apical and basolateral membrane, respectively, of polarized epithelial cells, allowing vectorial transport of nucleosides and nucleoside drugs from the apical compartment to the basal compartment or vice versa. As described below, our data show that this hypothesis is correct. Unlike in undifferentiated cells, in the differentiated polarized MDCK cells the localization of hCNT1 and hENT1 on the plasma membrane did not overlap. In the x-y plane, hCNT1 is localized predominately on the apical layer and hENT1 is localized mostly on the layer adjacent to the filter (Fig.3, A and B). Indeed, vertical cross-sections of the images (zplane) showed that hCNT1-CFP was found exclusively on the apical membrane (Fig. 3 D), whereas hENT1-YFP was distributed predominantly around the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3 E). The merged images of CFP and YFP confirmed this localization (Fig.3 F). As a control, MDCK cells transfected with the YFP empty vector showed diffuse localization in the cell in both thex-y and the z planes (Fig. 3, C andG). To confirm this differential localization functionally, we measured both hCNT1 and hENT1 activity in the apical and basal compartment of differentiated cells grown on Transwell filters. [3H]Uridine (1 μCi/ml, 0.2 μm) was loaded on either the apical or the basal compartment. As measured by cellular accumulation of uridine radioactivity, hENT1 activity in the apical compartment was ∼4-fold lower than in the basal compartment, whereas hCNT1 activity in the apical compartment was ∼20-fold greater than in the basal compartment (Fig. 4,A and B). In contrast, in the mock cells, no difference was observed in cellular accumulation of radioactivity whether uridine was loaded on the apical or the basal compartment. As the localization of hENT1 and hCNT1 in differentiated and undifferentiated MDCK cells was different, we tested the hypothesis that differentiation of MDCK cells results in sorting of hENT1 to the basolateral compartment. To test this hypothesis, we measured the time course of uptake of [3H]uridine by hENT1 and hCNT1 when loaded in the apical compartment of MDCK cells grown on 24-well plates. To measure the time course of differentiation of these cells, alkaline phosphatase activity in the apical compartment, a marker of differentiation, was also measured. The cells began to differentiate at about 6–8 days from confluence and reached complete differentiation at about 13 days from confluence. As cells began to differentiate, the activity of hENT1 in the apical compartment began to decrease and reached a minimum at about 13 days after confluence (Fig. 5). Meanwhile the apical uptake by hCNT1 remained relatively constant throughout the entire experimental period. These results suggest that upon differentiation, hENT1 is sorted to the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells. Somewhat different results have been obtained with the OK cells (epithelium cells from the opossum kidney) (10Doherty A.J. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At day 10 from confluence, both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent endogenous transporter activity are observed in the apical compartment, whereas only Na+-independent activity is observed in the basal compartment of these polarized cells. In contrast, at day 1 from confluence (presumably nonpolarized cells), the majority of transporter activity is Na+-independent (10Doherty A.J. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data suggest that in OK cells, on differentiation the concentrative transporter(s) sort to the apical membrane, whereas the equilibrative transporter(s) are present on both the apical and basolateral membrane. We hypothesized that the differential localization of hCNT1 and hENT1 transporters and their activities in the polarized cells should affect the directionality of vectorial transport of various nucleoside and nucleoside drugs across these cells. At subsaturating concentrations, this directionality of transport will be determined by the relative ratio of the maximal transport activity (V max) and the affinity (K m) of the transporters for the nucleosides, provided the nucleoside is not completely metabolized within the cells. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that this differential localization of nucleoside transporters explains the paradoxical observation that adenosine and deoxyadenosine are handled quite differently in vivo by the kidney. In the presence of adenosine deaminase deficiency or an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, adenosine is actively absorbed, whereas deoxyadenosine is secreted (13Kuttesch Jr., J.F. Nelson J.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1982; 8: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Nelson J.A. Vidale E. Enigbokan M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1988; 16: 789-792PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nelson J.A. Kuttesch Jr., J.R. Herbert B.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Kuttesch Jr., J.F. Robins M.J. Nelson J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 3387-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, as observed in vivo, in the presence of an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, adenosine is preferentially transported from the apical to the basal compartment by the coexpressing polarized MDCK cells (Fig.6, A and B), whereas deoxyadenosine is preferentially transported from the basal to the apical compartment (Fig. 6, A and B). At 60 min, there is a net A → B transport of adenosine and a net B → A transport of deoxyadenosine (Fig. 6 B). This preferential transport of adenosine is confirmed by its greater uptake from the apical compartment when compared with deoxyadenosine (Fig.6 C). hCNT1 has a high affinity (K m, ∼50 and 46 μm, respectively) for adenosine and deoxyadenosine (17Ritzel M.W.L. Yao S.Y.M. Huang M.Y. Elliott J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C707-C714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, transport of deoxyadenosine by hCNT1 is slower than that of adenosine. The hCNT1-mediated adenosine-to-deoxyadenosine flux ratio is 4:1 (17Ritzel M.W.L. Yao S.Y.M. Huang M.Y. Elliott J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C707-C714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ritzel M.W. Yao S.Y. Huang M.Y. Elliott J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C707-C714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, adenosine and deoxyadenosine are transported by hENT1 with about equal affinity (K m60 and 71 μm respectively) (1Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, in coexpressing MDCK cells, when adenosine and deoxyadenosine are placed in the apical compartment, hCNT1 transports adenosine into the cells more efficiently than deoxyadenosine. At 60 min the majority of adenosine is trapped in the cells by metabolism (∼95%; this and subsequent values of percent metabolism were determined by HPLC), but a small percentage escapes into the basal compartment (Fig. 6 D). Of that which escape, ∼65% is unchanged adenosine presumably transported by hENT1 (Fig.6 D) and 35% is metabolites (perhaps transported by nucleotide efflux pumps). In contrast, at 60 min very little of the deoxyadenosine radioactivity in the cells is metabolized (∼10%) (Fig. 6 C), and the radioactivity of that which escapes to the basal compartment (Fig. 6 D) is predominately unchanged deoxyadenosine (∼90%). When these two nucleosides are introduced into the basal compartment, both adenosine and deoxyadenosine are transported into the MDCK cells by hENT1 (Fig.6 C). Again, at 60 min, the greater part of the adenosine is trapped intracellularly by metabolism (∼95%) (Fig. 6 C), and a smaller portion, which escapes into the apical compartment by diffusion or via the low level of hENT1 transporter present there, is reabsorbed by hCNT1 present on the apical membrane (Fig.6 D). In contrast, at 60 min only a small amount of the deoxyadenosine transported into the cells is trapped intracellularly by metabolism (∼15%) (Fig. 6 C), whereas most of it is eliminated (∼85% deoxyadenosine) into the apical compartment either by the low level of hENT1 transporter activity present there or by diffusion (Fig. 6 D). This differential localization of hCNT1 and hENT1 (Fig. 6 E), with differing capacities to transport adenosine and deoxyadenosine, appears to explain the paradoxical observation that adenosine is reabsorbed, whereas deoxyadenosine is secreted by the kidney in vivo. Although the level of expression of hCNT1 and hENT1 in the human kidney may differ from that in our doubly transfected MDCK cells, such a difference will not change our general conclusions. This is because our results are dependent primarily on the expression of both transporters in series and on the relative transport (V max/K m) of adenosine and deoxyadenosine by each of the transporters, hCNT1 and hENT1. Only if one or both of the transporters are saturated (or if one of the transporters is absent) would our observed results change and differ from those obtained in vivo. Indeed, the transporter on the apical membrane of the kidney (presumably CNT1) can be saturated in the perfused rat kidney by high concentrations of adenosine. In this event, adenosine is secreted by the kidney and not actively reabsorbed (9Trimble M.E. Coulson R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F794-F803PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of adenosine and deoxyadenosine used in our experiments (8 μm), are well below theK m of adenosine and deoxyadenosine for hCNT1 (∼50 and ∼46 μm, respectively) or hENT1 (60 and 71 μm, respectively). At the physiological concentrations of adenosine (<1 μm) (15Nelson J.A. Kuttesch Jr., J.R. Herbert B.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), both hENT1 and hCNT1 are unlikely to be saturated. The reabsorption of adenosine by the kidney is an important mechanism for regulation of the pharmacological activity of adenosine in the kidney. As reviewed by Jackson and Dubey (19Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), adenosine regulates preglomerular and postglomerular vascular resistances, glomerular filtration rate, rennin release, epithelial transport, and intrarenal inflammation. If other nucleoside transporters are present in the kidney epithelial cells, they too may influence the renal disposition of this and other nucleosides. Transport experiments with kidney apical and basolateral membrane vesicles or with kidney cell lines have demonstrated only an ENT1 type of activity on the apical (9Trimble M.E. Coulson R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F794-F803PubMed Google Scholar), basolateral (20Williams T. Doherty A. Griffith D. Jarvis S. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or both faces (10Doherty A.J. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of these epithelial cells. However, there is no evidence that an ENT2-type transporter is present in the kidney epithelial cells. Although hCNT2 was originally cloned from the human kidney, functional studies with brush border membrane vesicles from the human kidney have not detected hCNT2 activity, but these studies did find hCNT1-type activity that is inhibited by guanosine (6Gutierrez M.M. Brett C.M. Ott R.J. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies to determine the localization of hCNTs in the kidney epithelium have not been performed because of a lack of antibodies for such studies. However, even if hCNT2 is present on the brush border membrane of the kidney epithelium, the above findings will likely stand and possibly exaggerate the reabsorption and secretion of adenosine and deoxyadenosine, respectively. This is because adenosine is efficiently transported by hCNT2, whereas deoxyadenosine appears to be a poor permeant of hCNT2 (21Schaner M.E. Wang J. Zhang L., Su, S.F. Gerstin K.M. Giacomini K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1487-1491PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown for the first time, using fluorescent-labeled proteins, that the concentrative and equilibrative transporters are localized on the different faces of the polarized kidney epithelium cell. This differential localization appears to be triggered by differentiation and may explain the vectorial transport of nucleosides and nucleoside drugs across the cell membrane. The directionality of the vectorial transport will depend on the relative affinity and maximal transport activity of the two transporters for the nucleosides and nucleoside drugs and likely explains why some nucleosides and nucleoside analogs are absorbed, whereas others are secreted.

https://openalex.org/W2331316755,"Fas (Apo-1/CD95) is a cell-surface receptor involved in cell death signaling through binding of Fas ligand. Mutation of Fas gene in lymphoid cells results in accumulation of these cells, which might thus contribute to lymphomagenesis. We examined the open reading frame of Fas cDNA in 14 cases of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Mutations of Fas gene were detected in seven (50%) of 14 cases which comprised four frameshift, two missense, and one silent mutations. Frameshift mutations were caused by insertion of 1 bp (A) at nucleotide 1095 in two cases and by deletion of 1 bp at nucleotide 597 and at 704, respectively, in one each. Mouse T-cell lymphoma cells transfected with two missense mutated genes and frameshift mutations caused by insertion of 1 bp (A) at nucleotide 1095 were resistant to apoptosis induced by the anti-Fas antibody. These findings suggested that accumulation of lymphoid cells with Fas mutations provides a basis for the development of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma."

It has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular part composed of a 75-residue long spacer domain, a 270-residue collagenous domain, and a 99-residue long scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain. Previous studies have indicated a role for this receptor in anti-microbial host defense functions. In this work we have produced the extracellular part of MARCO as a recombinant protein, and analyzed its binding properties. The production of this protein, soluble MARCO (sMARCO), has made it possible for the first time to study MARCO and its binding properties in a cell-free system. Using circular dichroism analyses, a protease-sensitive assay, and rotary shadowing electron microscopy, sMARCO was shown to have a triple-helical collagenous structure. Rotary shadowing also demonstrated that the molecules often associate with each other via the globes. sMARCO was found to bind avidly both heat-killed and living bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide, an important component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, was shown to be a ligand of MARCO. Studies with different bacterial strains indicated that the O-side chain of lipopolysaccharide is not needed for the bacterial recognition. Finally, the C-terminal SRCR domain was also produced as a recombinant protein, and its bacteria-binding capability was studied. Although the transfection experiments with transmembrane MARCO variants have indicated a crucial role for this domain in bacterial binding, the monomeric domain exhibited low, barely detectable bacteria-binding activity. Thus, it is possible that cooperation between the SRCR domain and the collagenous domain is needed for high-affinity bacterial binding, or that the SRCR domain has to be in a trimeric form to effectively bind to bacteria.

Innate immunity relies on specialized cells such as macrophages that are the first to encounter pathogens during infection (1Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A., Jr. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 2Mushegian A. Medzhitov R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Macrophages have a major role in host defense, but they also function in normal physiological processes, such as in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Macrophages are found in many tissues, but particularly in those that function in the filtration of blood or lymph fluids, such as liver, spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. They recognize, internalize, and destroy harmful endogenous and foreign substances, thus functioning as scavengers. Macrophages have been shown to be able to bind pathogens directly, or they recognize them as foreign after being coated with antibodies or complement (3Gordon S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Macrophages contain a set of nonclonal receptors that can directly recognize pathogen-associated common structures. These receptors, known as pattern-recognition receptors, include the mannose receptor, CD14, Toll-like receptors, and scavenger receptors (SRs)1 (4Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). A wide variety of pathogen-associated structures are recognized by the pattern-recognition receptors. These include mannans and zymosan in the yeast cell wall, and various bacterial cell-wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopeptides, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycans (4Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Many of these components are able to stimulate the innate immune system. The best known example is LPS, the major outer membrane component of all Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is composed of a lipophilic component, lipid A, and a poly- or oligosaccharide portion covalently linked to this membrane anchor domain (5Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar). LPS is a very potent activator of innate immune responses, and thus it is the major inducer of septic shock during infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Of the several classes of SRs, primarily the class A SRs are considered to be of importance for the anti-microbial host defense. This class contains three members, SR-A (scavenger receptor A), MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous domain), and a recently identified protein SRCL (scavenger receptor with C-type lectin) (6Nakamura K. Funakoshi H. Miyamoto K. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SR-A, which is expressed in most macrophage populations, is a trimeric membrane protein containing an N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular portion composed of a short spacer domain, an α-helical coiled-coil domain, a triple-helical collagenous domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (7Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 8Platt N. Gordon S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R193-R203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a result of alternative splicing of the primary transcript, SR-A exists in two forms, SR-AI and SR-AII, of which the latter lacks the SRCR domain (9Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Both receptors bind a large number of polyanionic molecules, including the prototypic SR ligand, modified low density lipoprotein, as well as LPS and lipoteichoic acid. Studies with SR-A-deficient mice have indicated a role for SR-A in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions (10Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H.

Kodama T. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In addition, the SR-A-deficient mice were found to have increased susceptibility to infections caused by Listeriamonocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (10Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N.

Med. 2000; 191: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the data that SR-A binds bacterial cell-wall components, clearly indicates a role for SR-A in the innate immune system. MARCO differs structurally from SR-A in that it lacks the α-helical coiled-coil domain, but has, instead, a long collagenous domain (12Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Thus, MARCO has a short N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular part comprised of a spacer domain, the long collagenous domain, and an SRCR domain (domain V). The SRCR domain contains six cysteine residues that form three intrachain disulfide bridges (13Elomaa O. Sankala M. Pikkarainen T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Raatikainen-Ahokas A. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4530-4538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this domain has 46% identity with that of the SRCR domain of the Mac-2-binding protein, whose crystal structure has been solved (14Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In normal mice, MARCO is expressed only on marginal zone macrophages of the spleen and on macrophages of the medullary cord in lymph nodes (12Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R.

Studies with MARCO variants have shown that the SRCR domain, domain V, is the predominant bacteria-binding domain of MARCO (13Elomaa O. Sankala M. Pikkarainen T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A.

Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because the collagenous domain has been shown to be the ligand-binding domain of SR-A, MARCO and SR-A have different ligand-binding properties. No function has yet been found for the SRCR domain of SR-A. Even if the MARCO-expressing transfected cells bind bacteria, it is possible that the cell-bacteria interactions are not directly mediated by MARCO, but result from some secondary changes in the transfected cells. This possibility has to be taken into consideration, especially because MARCO expression induces dramatic phenotypic changes in the transfected cells (19Pikkarainen T. Brannstrom A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10975-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, to unequivocally demonstrate that MARCO binds bacteria, one needs to assay the bacteria-binding activity of isolated MARCO molecules. This is one reason why we have undertaken the approach of producing “soluble MARCO” (called hereafter sMARCO),i.e. a recombinant MARCO protein composed of the entire extracellular part, but lacking the N-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The His-tagged sMARCO was purified to homogeneity from 293/EBNA cell-conditioned medium, and its structure was studied. sMARCO was found to form stable elongated triple-helical molecules. Functional analyses showed that sMARCO indeed binds bacteria with high affinity. Additional studies indicated that MARCO is able to bind LPS. In light of this finding, it will be of interest to compare the responses of wild-type and MARCO-deficient mice to the LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Finally, we have also produced and purified recombinant domain V (called hereafter recV), and studied whether a surface coated with this protein supports binding of bacteria. This study indicated that compared with sMARCO, the monomeric recV protein has low, barely detectable bacteria-binding activity. Mammalian episomal expression vectors pCEP-Pu and pCEP-Pu/AC7 were kind gifts from Drs. T. Sasaki and R. Timpl (Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). The rat anti-mouse MARCO monoclonal antibody ED31 was kindly provided by Dr. G. Kraal (Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The wild-typeEscherichia coli strain K12 was from ATCC. E. coli strain HB101 and Salmonella typhimurium galE mutant strain LB5010 were generously provided by Dr. Mikael Rhen (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm). Mouse L929 fibroblasts were from ATCC. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), DMEM/F-12, fetal calf serum, the human embryonic kidney epithelial 293/EBNA cell line, pSec-Tag2 vector, and G418 were obtained from Invitrogen.N-Glycosidase F was obtained from New England Biolabs. Ascorbic acid, heparin, polyinosinic acid (poly(I)), puromycin, tunicamycin, and trypsin were from Sigma. Unlabeled and FITC-labeled LPS (from E. coli serotype 0111:B4) were also from Sigma. Unlabeled LPS, which was used in the binding assay with sMARCO, had been phenol-extracted and purified by ion-exchange chromatography (L-3024). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako or Molecular Probes. Ni-NTA-agarose was from Qiagen. FITC was obtained from Fluka. SYPROTM Ruby protein gel stain and Pro-QTMEmerald 300 lipopolysaccharide gel stain kit were purchased from Molecular Probes. All DNA manipulations were carried out using established molecular biological methods. To generate the plasmid directing the expression of sMARCO, the region encoding the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains in the full-length mouse MARCO cDNA was replaced by a fragment encoding the mouse immunoglobulin κ (Igκ) chain leader sequence followed by a 6-residue polyhistidine tag (Fig. 1A). This plasmid was constructed in the following way. First, a PCR fragment encoding the mouse Igκ chain leader sequence plus 11 extra amino acids (AAQPARRARAT) was inserted into the vector pCEP-Pu (20Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This fragment was amplified with the primers 5′-ATGGAGACAGACACACTC-3 and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCGTACGGCGCGCGCGCCT (HindIII-recognition site underlined) using the pSec-Tag2 vector as a template. The fragment was cloned into theKpnI-Klenow-HindIII-treated pCEP-Pu vector. Next, a PCR fragment encoding for the entire extracellular part of MARCO (nucleotides 223–1557) was inserted into the HindIII andNotI sites of this vector. The 1.3-kb MARCO fragment was generated using primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGGAGCAGCTCCAGATG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCAGGAGCATTCCACACCC-3′ (HindIII and NotI recognition sites underlined). Finally, a fragment encoding the histidine tag was inserted into theHindIII site. The fragment was generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-AGCTT(CATCAC)3A-3′ and 5′-AGCTT(GTGATG)3A-3′. Annealing of the oligonucleotides generated HindIII-compatible overhangs, and the fragment could thus be inserted into the expression construct without further manipulations. The sequence of the expression cassette was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate the domain V-expression construct, a fragment encoding the C-terminal portion of the α3(VI)-collagen was excised from the vector pCEP-Pu/AC7 with NheI and BamHI, and was replaced by a 300-bp NheI/BglII fragment encoding mouse MARCO domain V. This fragment was amplified using pSG5 full-length mouse MARCO as a template. In this plasmid, a BglII site was immediately following the translation stop codon. The sense primer (5′-GTCAGCTAGCCCAACGCGTCCGGATC-3′) contained anNheI recognition site (underlined). The antisense primer (5′-CCTCCACAACTAGAATGCAGTG-3′) was derived from the vector sequence 3′ of the BglII site. The resulting construct encoded a protein with the BM-40 signal sequence followed by the first four N-terminal residues of BM-40 (APLA) and mouse MARCO domain V starting from residue Gln421. The authenticity of the construct was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant proteins were expressed using the 293/EBNA cell expression system. The human embryonic kidney epithelial 293/EBNA cells were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This cell line constitutively expresses the EBNA-1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus, thus allowing episomal replication of a vector containing the Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication. The cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 250 μg/ml neomycin analog G418. Cells in 10-cm culture dishes were transfected using the calcium-phosphate method with 20 μg of the expression vector. The transfected cells were selected with 2–3 μg/ml puromycin. Puromycin-resistant clones were tested for the recombinant protein expression by growing the cells in serum-free medium for 24 h. When analyzing the sMARCO production, ascorbic acid (100 μg/ml) was added into the medium. The production of sMARCO or recV was tested by dot-blot analysis with the rat anti-mouse MARCO mAb ED31 (15van der Laan L.J. Kangas M. Dopp E.A. Broug-Holub E. Elomaa O. Tryggvason K. Kraal G. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 57: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been shown earlier that the epitope for ED31 resides in domain V (16van der Laan L.J. Dopp E.A. Haworth R.

A clone expressing sMARCO was grown to confluency in DMEM/fetal calf serum, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum proteins, and switched to serum-free DMEM/F-12 containing 250 μg/ml G418, 1 μg/ml puromycin, and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Freshly made ascorbic acid was added every 24 h. The medium was collected and exchanged with fresh medium every 72 h over a 15-day period. The collected medium was centrifuged to remove cellular debris and frozen for storage. For the purification of sMARCO, ½ volume of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl (buffer A) was first added to the harvested medium (typically ∼400 ml), after which 1 ml (bed volume) of Ni-NTA beads were added, the slurry was incubated by shaking at 4 °C for 16 h, and then packed into a column. The column was first washed with 30 bed volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and then with a similar volume of lower pH washing solution, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 0.5 m NaCl. sMARCO was eluted with 10 bed volumes of 80 mm imidazole in PBS. Fractions were collected and purity of samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining under reducing conditions. When analyzed by Western blotting, samples were not reduced because the mAb ED31 does not recognize the reduced domain V. The protein was stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. For the purification of recV, the serum-free conditioned medium was produced as described for sMARCO, except that the cells were grown in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium for 9 days (medium changed every 72 h). EDTA (5 mm) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) were added to the collected conditioned medium. The medium was dialyzed against 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.8, cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min), and applied to a Fractogel EMD SO 3− cation exchange column (Merck). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (90–240 mm, 60 ml). Saturated ammonium sulfate was added to pooled fractions to a final concentration of 2m, and the sample was passed over a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 1.8 m(NH4)2SO4 in 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 4.8. After elution with a linear (NH4)2SO4 gradient (1.8–0m, 30 ml), recV-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, concentrated, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. N-Linked oligosaccharides were removed from purified sMARCO by N-glycosidase F digestion. Prior to digestion, sMARCO (2 μg) was denatured by incubating the protein at 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. After adding 1/10 volume of 0.5 msodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10% Nonidet P-40, 500 units ofN-glycosidase F was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 3 or 16 h. Control samples were treated in the same manner, except that the enzyme was omitted. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. In some experiments, sMARCO-expressing cells were cultured with (2 or 5 μg/ml) or without tunicamycin for 3 days, and sMARCO was purified from the medium by Ni-NTA chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Purified sMARCO was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20 mmNaCl, at 30.6 μg/ml, and circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a AVIV model 62DS CD2 spectrophotometer using a thermostatted cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. Melting curves were recorded by measuring the molar ellipticity of the wavelength at 220 nm between 15 and 70 °C, and increasing the temperature by 30 °C/h. The concentration of sMARCO was determined by amino acid analysis. Purified sMARCO was incubated with trypsin at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:10 by weight (molar ratio ∼1:3) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, at 21 °C for 2 h. After terminating the reaction by soybean trypsin inhibitor, the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Glycerol spraying rotary shadowing electron microscopy and evaluation of the data from electron micrographs were carried out as described previously (21Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples with protein concentrations of about 20 μg/ml were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9. They were mixed with equal volumes of 80% glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica pieces with a nebulizer designed for small volumes shortly after mixing. They were dried in high vacuum for 4 h and shadowed under rotation with 2 nm platinum/carbon at a 9° angle, followed by coating with a stabilizing 10-nm carbon film. Specimens were observed in a LEO EM 910 electron microscope operated at 80 kV accelerating voltage. Length measurements and statistical evaluations were performed with a personal computer attached to a graphics tablet. For the bacteria-binding assay, 13-mm glass coverslips were coated with 5 μg of sMARCO, recV, or recombinant nephrin (rNephrin) for 1 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C. rNephrin encompasses the first two Ig domains of the molecule followed by a 6-residue polyhistidine tag. This protein had also been produced using the 293/EBNA cell expression system. 2Y. Sun and K. Tryggvason, unpublished data. An additional coverslip was incubated with PBS only. The coverslips were then incubated with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl (buffer B), before addition of the bacteria. FITC-labeled E. coli (sonicated 3 × 15 s before the use) were left to bind for 1 h at 37 °C. In some of the assays, sMARCO-coated surfaces were incubated with polyanions poly(I) or heparin before adding the bacteria. Poly(I) was used at a concentration of 300 μg/ml. Heparin was used at the same concentration or at 1 mg/ml. Polyanions were also present in the bacteria-containing solution. Following incubation with the bacteria, the coverslips were washed three times with buffer B. Bacterial binding was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Living bacteria were labeled fluorescently as described (23Pikaar J.C. Voorhout W.F. van Golde L.M. Verhoef J. Van Strijp J.A. van Iwaarden J.F. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 172: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures of bacteria were washed three times with PBS, after which the bacteria were suspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3buffer, pH 9.6, containing 0.1 mg of FITC, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with periodic mixing. The bacteria were washed three times with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Na2PO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 6 mm glucose, and 0.1% (w/v) gelatin to remove free FITC, and resuspended into the same buffer to a final concentration of 1 × 109/ml. The cells were stored at 4 °C, and used within 4 days. The bacteria-binding assays were carried out as described above. In addition, we tested the binding to transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the full-length mouse MARCO. The transfectants were seeded on coverslips 24 h after transfection, and assayed for bacterial binding the next day. The bacteria-binding assay was carried out as described previously (18Brannstrom A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The MARCO-expressing cells were identified using the mAb ED31 and goat anti-rat Alexa fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody. Two different assays were used to study whether MARCO was capable of binding LPS. When testing the binding of LPS to cell-associated MARCO, we utilized stable L929 cell transfectants that we have recently generated. Parental L929 cells were transfected with plasmids pcDNA3-mouse MARCO (19Pikkarainen T. Brannstrom A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10975-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and PGK-Puro in a molar ratio of 10:1, and the stable clones were selected in the presence of G418 and puromycin. L929 cells expressing the full-length mouse MARCO or the parental L929 cells were seeded on coverslips 1 day prior to the binding assay. They were then rinsed with serum-free DMEM, and incubated with FITC-labeled LPS in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were washed five times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Binding was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. When testing the binding of LPS to sMARCO, 2 μg of the recombinant protein was incubated with 6 μg of LPS in 1 ml of PBS for 30 min at room temperature with constant mixing. The LPS used in this assay was taken from a stock that was sonicated for 3× 15 s before use. After incubation, 40 μl of the 50% Ni-NTA slurry was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h with constant mixing. As a control, an identical assay was carried out without sMARCO. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, boiled in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE. LPS and glycoproteins were detected by staining with the Pro-QTM Emerald 300 lipopolysaccharide gel stain kit. Transfected 293/EBNA cells expressing sMARCO (Fig.1A) were initially screened by dot-blot analysis using mAb ED31, which recognizes domain V of mouse MARCO. The results were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (data not shown). Several stable sMARCO-producing clones were obtained. The one with the highest expression was expanded, and sMARCO was purified from the serum-free conditioned medium to >95% homogeneity on the Ni-NTA r"

The largest subunit (I) contains the ligands to a low spin hemeb and a binuclear center that consists of CuBand heme a3, and subunit II contains a mixed valence [CuA1.5+–CuA1.5+] homodinuclear copper complex. Subunit IIa forms just one transmembrane helix. Based on the crystal structure, the binuclear center of cytochrome ba3 is similar to those of theaa3 type oxidases from Paracoccus denitrificans and bovine heart (1Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P.

In the oxidized form, heme a3 is high spin five-coordinate, and CuB is ligated with three histidines, His-290, His-291, and His-240 (if not stated otherwise, we adopt the residue numbering of the bovine heart enzyme). Tyrosine 244 is covalently linked to His-240. The A-type heme in cytochrome ba3 contains a hydrophobic hydroxyethylgeranylgeranyl group, which is straight and reaches the cytoplasmic side without interfering with the proton pathways, instead of a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain as seen in most bacterial and eucaryotic aa3 oxidases (1Soulimane T.

Recently, it was reported that cytochrome ba3 is capable of reducing nitric oxide to N2O (7Giuffrè A. Stubauer G. Sart P. Brunori M. Zumft W.G. Buse G. Soulimane T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Buse G. Becker A. Bamberg E. Michel H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the ba3 oxidase is expected to be similar to other distantly related heme-copper oxidases (P. denitrificans, mammalian, andbo3 from Escherichia coli) with respect to the oxygen chemistry since the central features of the active site are similar, and the catalyzed chemical reaction is identical (1Soulimane T.

The proton pathway in ba3oxidase, as revealed from the crystal structure, starts at the cytoplasmic site and through the heme a3 ligand H376, and the heme a3 propionates lead directly to accumulation of water molecules (1Soulimane T.

The presence of water molecules near the heme a3 propionates is conserved among all structurally known oxidases (P. denitrificans, mammalian, and bo3 fromE. coli), and their involvement in the proton exit channel has been supported by mutagenesis experiments (8Ostermeier C.

Given that the ba3 oxidase is a member of the large heme-copper oxidase superfamily, it is essential to learn its function to understand possible alternative strategies in the dioxygen and nitric oxide reduction, and in the mechanism of proton translocation. In addition, the high affinity of CuB for CO is unique among all heme-copper oxidases that allow spectroscopic measurements to be performed. This may lead to new insights concerning the functional mechanisms of heme-copper oxidases as well as how the properties of CuB are related to proton translocation. Most proposed proton-pumping mechanisms involve CuB and its histidine ligands (4Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9591-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have been proposed as the crucial elements in the proton-pumping pathway. The existence and identity of such reorganization of the CuB geometry caused by protonation/deprotonation and/or breakage of one of the Cu-N(His) bonds is a difficult matter to either prove or disprove since CuBis spectrally silent and therefore no definite spectroscopic evidence has yet been observed. Several spectroscopic techniques have been used to show thatba3 has peculiar ligand binding properties (12, for a review, see Ref. 13Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, there is a general consensus that the binding of CO to the binuclear center of ba3follows that found in all cytochrome c and quinol heme-copper oxidases, which proceeds according to Scheme 1.

The thermal dissociation rate of the heme-CO complex of bovine fully reduced cytochromec oxidase-CO is very slow (0.023 s−1) and thus,k−2 can be neglected (13Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently,k−2 was measured for the CO-bound reduced cytochrome ba3 of T. thermophilus(19Giuffrè A. Forte E. Antonini G. D'Itri E. Brunori M. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and found significantly faster (0.8 s−1) than in the bovine aa3 and bo3 fromE. coli enzymes (13Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Lemon D.D Calhoun M.W Gennis R.B. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11953-11956Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, the FTIR1 difference (“dark-minus-light”) approach has also been used to probe the structure and dynamics of the ba3 oxidase (12Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that in the dark-minus-light FTIR spectra, the positive peaks at 1974 and 1983 cm−1 represent CO bound to the ferrous heme a3 whereas the asymmetric negative band centered at 2053 cm−1 represents CO bound to CuB1+. In this report, we have investigated the CO-bound cytochromeba3 complex at room temperature by FTIR and time-resolved step-scan FTIR (TR-FTIR) spectroscopy to probe the structure of the binuclear hemea3-CuB center and the coupled protein structures in response to the photodissociation/recombination of CO. The results indicate that in addition to the C-O stretching modes of the CO bound to heme a3 at 1973 and 1982 cm−1 reported earlier, an additional CO mode at 1967 cm−1, representing the α-form found in other heme-copper oxidases, is detected. Moreover, we make the unexpected observation of the C-O stretching mode of the equilibrium CuB1+-CO complex (complex A in Scheme 1), which is detected at 2053 cm−1 at room temperature and remained unchanged in H2O/D2O exchanges and between pD 5.5 and 9.7. Thus far, FTIR observation of the C-O stretching modes when bound to CuB has been successful only by “light-minus-dark” difference FTIR spectra in which the photolyzed CO from the heme Fe migrates to CuB. The TR-FTIR data indicate that the rate of decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex is 34.5 s−1, and rebinding to heme a3 occurs with an observed recombination rate constant k2 = 28.6 s−1 (t1/2 = 24.2 ms). We also show that the transient CuB1+-CO complex is not pD-dependent (5.5–9.7). Our results indicate that CuB maintains its associated ligands under different chemical conditions, and no deprotonation/protonation events occur to its ligands in the pD 5.5–9.7 range. Perturbation of the hemea3 propionates (COOH) is observed upon CO photolysis. The rate of decay (43.3 s−1) of the hemea3 propionates (COOH) is on a time-scale coincident with the decay of the CuB1+-CO complex suggesting that there is a coupling between ligation dynamics in the binuclear center and the environment sensed by the hemea3 propionates. The dynamics of the ligation reactions at the binuclear center and the coupled protein response are discussed. Cytochrome ba3 was isolated from T. thermophilus HB8 cells according to previously published procedures (3Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The samples used for the FTIR measurements had an enzyme concentration of ∼1 mm and were placed in a desired buffer (pD 5.5–6.5, MES; pD 7.5, HEPES; pD 8.5–9.5 CHES). The pD solutions prepared in D2O buffers were measured by using a pH meter and assuming pD = pH (observed) + 0.4. Dithionite-reduced samples were exposed to 1 atm of CO (1 mm) in an anaerobic cell to prepare the carbonmonoxy adduct and transferred to a tightly sealed FTIR cell under anaerobic conditions (l = 30 μm). CO gas was obtained from Messer (Frankfurt, Germany), and isotopic CO (13CO) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). The 532 and 355 nm pulses from a continuum Nd-YAG laser (7-ns wide, 3–7 Hz) were used as a pump light (3–10 mJ/pulse) to photolyze theba3-CO oxidase. FTIR measurements were performed on a Bruker Equinox IFS 55 spectrometer equipped with the step-scan option (Bruker, Newark, DE). For the time-resolved experiments, a TTL pulse (transistor transistor logic) provided by a digital delay pulse generator (Quantum Composers, 9314T) triggers, in order, the flashlamps, Q-switch, and the FTIR spectrometer. Pretriggering the FTIR spectrometer to begin data collection before the laser fires allows eleven fixed reference points to be collected at each mirror position, which are used as the reference spectrum in the calculation of the difference spectra. Changes in intensity were recorded with an MCT detector (mercury cadmium telluride, Graseby infrared D316, response limit 600 cm−1) amplified in the DC-coupled mode and digitized with a 200-kHz, 16-bit, analog-to-digital converter. A broadband interference optical filter (Optical Coating Laboratory, Santa Rosa, CA) with short wavelength cut off at 2.67 μm was used to limit the free spectral range from 2.67 to 8 μm. This leads to a spectral range of 3900 cm−1, which is equal to an under-sampling ratio of 4. Single-sided spectra were collected at 8 cm−1 spectral resolution, 5 or 100 μs time resolution, and 10 co-additions per data point. Total accumulation time for each measurement was 60 min, and 2–3 measurements were collected and averaged. Blackman-Harris three-term apodization with 32 cm−1 phase resolution and the Mertz phase correction algorithm were used. Difference spectra were calculated as ΔA = −log(IS/IR). Optical absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer before and after the FTIR measurements to ensure the formation and stability of the CO adducts. The optical absorption spectrum of the dithionite-reducedba3 enzyme displays Soret maxima at 427 (hemeb2+) and 444 (hemea32+) nm and visible maxima at 559 (heme b2+) and 614 (hemea32+) nm (Fig.1, trace A). Flushing CO over the reduced enzyme shifts the visible band of hemea32+ by 22 to 592 nm and the Soret to 427 nm (Fig. 1, trace B) whereas the bands due to hemeb2+ remained, as expected, unchanged. The difference spectrum (Fig. 1, trace C) confirms the coordination of CO to the reduced enzyme. The FTIR spectrum of the CO-bound cytochrome ba3complex at neutral pH exhibits peaks at 1967, 1973, 1982, and 2053 cm−1 (Fig. 2, trace A). In the 13C16O derivative these peaks shift to 1923, 1928, 1937, and 2007 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2, trace D). We assign the peaks at 1967, 1973, and 1982 cm−1 to the C-O stretching modes of hemea3-CO (complex B), and the peak at 2053 cm−1 to the C-O stretching mode of CuB1+-CO (complex A). The mode at 1967 cm−1 is similar to that found for the α-form in the CO adducts of aa3 oxidases from bovine heart,Rhodobacter sphaeroides, aa3-600, andP. denitrificans (21Mitchell D.M Shapleigh J.P.

The frequency of the 1982 cm−1mode, however, does not coincide with the β-form found in other heme-copper oxidases (20Stavrakis S. Koutsoupakis K. Pinakoulaki E. Urbani A. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and thus, we suggest that it represents a structure of the active site in which CuB exerts a strong steric effect on the heme a3-bound CO. The α-form represents a conformation of the enzyme in which the frequencies of ν(Fe-CO) and ν(CO) lie off the correlation curve for heme proteins with a trans-histidine ligand (22Wang J.W. Takahashi S. Hosler J. Mitchell D.M. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the β-form, the frequencies are placed on the correlation curve (22Wang J.W. Takahashi S. Hosler J. Mitchell D.M. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and in the γ-conformation, CuB is moved closer to the CO-bound heme a3, thereby the Fe-C-O moiety is further distorted from its preferred symmetry in the α-form (28Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The frequency of the CO mode of the CuB1+-CO complex at 2053 cm−1, however, is 10–12 cm−1higher and 8–12 cm−1 lower than the corresponding frequencies of the β- and α-forms found in other heme-copper oxidases (23Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Park S. Pan L.-P. Chan S.I. Alben J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1036-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and thus, we are unable to assign it to either the α- or the β-form at present. Although the species we detect in the FTIR data could arise from a hemea3-CO/CuB1+-CO complex, consideration of k−2 (0.8 s−1) suggests that the peaks we detect are associated with the formation of complexes A and B (Scheme 1). The frequencies of these C-O modes are all very close to those that have been previously reported for the reduced CO-bound enzyme in the photo-steady-state (12Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and their frequencies and bandwidths remained unchanged between H2O and D2O and also between pD 5.5 and 9.7 (Fig. 2,traces A—B and B–G). The ratio of the relative areas of the Fe-CO/Cu-CO is 4:1 in the absolute spectra, and considering the integrated absorptivities expected of CO complexes of heme and copper proteins (26Alben J.O. Moh P.P. Fiamingo F.G. Altschuld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the ratio of εFe-CO/εCu-CO is ∼1.5:1 suggesting ∼30% of unligated heme a3, in agreement with the magnetic circular dichroism (17Goldbeck R.A. Einarsdoátirr O. Dawes T.D. O'Connor D.B. Surerus K.K Fee J.A. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9376-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and optical data (19Giuffrè A. Forte E. Antonini G. D'Itri E. Brunori M. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the step-scan time-resolved FTIR difference spectra (td = 150 μs–78.5 ms, 8 cm−1 spectral resolution) of fully reduced ba3-CO subsequent to CO photolysis by a nanosecond laser pulse (532 nm). Under our experimental conditions (8 cm−1 spectral resolution), the 1967, 1973, and 1982 cm−1 peaks are not resolved, and thus a single negative peak is observed at 1977 cm−1. The 4 cm−1resolution experiment (data not shown) clearly demonstrates the presence of the three bands but the signal-to-noise is lower than that obtained with 8 cm−1 resolution. The negative peak at 1977 cm−1 arises from the photolyzed hemea3-CO. The positive peak that appears at 2053 cm−1 is attributed to the C-O stretch (νCO) of CuB as found under continuous light illumination by Einarsdoáttir et al. (12Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its intensity is diminished near 70 ms. The frequency of the C-O mode in the transient CuB1+-CO complex is the same as that of the equilibrium CuB1+-CO (complex A). This observation suggests that no structural change at CuBoccurs in association with CO binding to and dissociation from hemea3. No significant intensity variations are detected in the transient difference spectra (td= 5–3000 μs) for either the 2053 and 1977 cm−1 modes. At later times, however, the decreased intensity of the transient 2053 cm−1 mode (3–80 ms) is accompanied by an increased intensity at 1977 cm−1. The intensity ratio (∼1.5) of the Fe-CO/CuB-CO remains constant for all data points, and thus, we conclude that no fraction of CO escapes the binuclear center at 293 K. This is consistent with the low temperature experiments in which it was demonstrated that the CuB1+-CO intermediate is fully formed and that no significant fraction of CO escapes the metal centers below 300 K (12Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows a single TR-FTIR difference spectrum averaged from 5–1000 μs in the 1500–2200 cm−1 region. It is evident that there are features in the 1600–1710 cm−1region whose absorbances (positive or negative) are on the order of 3 × 10−5 absorbance units or less. The frequency of the band at 1706 cm−1 is indicative of the C=O stretching vibration of protonated carboxylic groups of the hemea3 propionates because in the reduced-minus-oxidized FTIR difference spectrum of cytochromeba3, the band at 1706 cm−1 has been assigned to the C=O mode of a protonated heme a3propionate (29Hellwig P. Soulimane T. Buse G. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9648-9658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The propionate C=O stretching band is seen as a derivative-shaped feature in the TR-FTIR difference spectrum with the trough/peak at 1706/1694 cm−1. The positive features at 1642 and 1665 cm−1 are due to amide I (a-helical). Therefore, it appears that upon photodissociation of CO from heme Fea32+ and binding to CuB1+, the protein conformation changes near the heme a3 propionates. The time evolution of the trough/peak at 1706/1694 cm−1 that is depicted in Fig.5, inset, demonstrates that these transient C=O stretches decay on a time-scale coincident with the decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex. Fig. 4 continues the study of the transient species subsequent to CO photolysis in the pD 5.5–9.7 range but using 355 nm laser pulse rather than 532 nm. The data show that photodissociation of CO from heme a3 produces the same transient photoproduct as that obtained with 532 nm photolysis pulse and without changes in the intensity ratio of the 1977/2053 cm−1 modes. The 5-μs transient difference spectra (Fig.4, traces A–F) show that minimal changes are observed in the coordination site of CuB over a pD range of 5.5–9.7. The continuous variability in intensity of the CO modes associated with heme a3 and CuB over a 0.005–80-ms time-scale is the most quantified aspect of ligand dissociation from CuB and ligand rebinding to heme a3and is depicted in Fig. 5. The total area of the CuB1+-CO and Fe2+-CO bands shown in Fig. 3A were measured as a function of time to determine the rate of the decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex (34.5 s−1) and, since it is known (13–14,19) that k−2 ≪k2 then kobs =k2, the rate of recombination of CO to hemea3 (k2 = 28.6 s−1) at room temperature. The curves are three-parameter fits to the experimental data according to first-order kinetics. Fig.5, inset, shows the decay of the 1694 and 1706 cm−1 modes (43.3 s−1) as measured by the intensity of the corresponding modes shown in Fig. 3B(inset).

A remarkable property of curli is their ability to interact with a wide range of human proteins, interactions that contribute to the enhanced virulence of curli-expressing E. coli. To define the protein-binding region(s) of curli, we investigated the binding properties of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the curli subunit. Two peptides, one covering a 24-amino acid residue sequence in the NH2-terminal half of the subunit (NNS24) and one corresponding to the 26 COOH-terminal residues (VDQ26), were found to bind a number of human proteins. Physiochemical analysis revealed that NNS24 adopts a thermally stable β-structure, and in solution the peptide forms soluble multimers, predominantly octamers. Intact curli are known to activate the proinflammatory and procoagulant contact system, and when added to human plasma, the NNS24 and VDQ26 peptides induced the release of the potent vasoactive peptide bradykinin.

Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and a minor component, CsgB (9Arnqvist A. Olseán A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), acting as a nucleator in the formation of insoluble curli aggregates at the bacterial surface (10Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Temperature and various stress conditions, such as low osmolarity and starvation, regulate the expression of curli (11Arnqvist A. Olseán A. Pfeifer J. Russell D.G. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A recent report describes the complex network of regulatory factors that control the production of both curli and thin aggregative fimbriae (12Brown P.K. Dozois C.M. Nickerson C.A. Zuppardo A. Terlonge J. Curtiss III., R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Among clinical E. coli isolates, curli are expressed by most enterohemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis strains, whereas enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic strains do not express curli (4Olseán A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,13Ben Nasr A. Olseán A. Sjo¨bring U. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This difference in expression suggests a role for curli inE. coli pathogenicity, a notion that is further supported by findings that curli induce proinflammatory cytokines and that anti-CsgA antibodies are found in serum samples from patients with E. coli sepsis (14Bian Z. Brauner A., Li, Y. Normark S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that curliatedE. coli when injected into mice activate the NO/NOS2 arm of the innate immune system, resulting in blood pressure fall (14Bian Z. Brauner A., Li, Y. Normark S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Finally, curliated E. coli, but not a non-curliated mutant strain, has the ability to enter eukaryotic cells (15Gophna U. Barlev M. Seijffers R. Oelschlager T.A. Hacker J. Ron E.Z. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2659-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A noteworthy property of curli is their broad protein-binding capacity. A large number of human proteins have been shown to interact with curli, including many plasma proteins and MHC1 class I antigens (4Olseán A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,13Ben Nasr A.

Infect Immun. 1998; 66: 944-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Available data indicate that the CsgA subunit is responsible for most of these interactions, which in some cases have been shown to contribute to E. coli virulence. Thus, the components of the contact system bind and assemble on curli fibers, and as a consequence the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin is generated and a hypocoagulative state is induced (17Herwald H. Mo¨rgelin M. Olseán A. Rhen M. Dahlba¨ck B. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, blocking of contact system activation prevents curliated bacteria from inducing severe lung lesions in rats (18Persson K. Mo¨rgelin M. Lindbom L. Alm P. Bjo¨rck L. Herwald H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The connection between bacterial virulence and the protein-binding properties of curli prompted us to investigate whether the binding and functional properties of curli could be mapped more precisely. In the present study we identify two regions in the CsgA subunit that have broad protein binding activity and the capacity to activate the contact system. A series of overlapping peptides (see Fig. 2A), based on the sequence of the curli subunit CsgA, were synthesized at Innovagen, Lund, Sweden. HPLC and mass spectrometry were used to control the quality of the peptides. Anti-fibrinogen antibodies were from DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark, and antibodies against high molecular weight kininogen (H-kininogen) were raised in sheep as described (19Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Johnson D.A. Salvesen G. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human fibrinogen, fibronectin, and serum albumin (HSA) were purchased from Sigma. The preparations of human MHC class I antigen, β2-microglobulin, factor XII, H-kininogen, plasminogen, and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) used have been described previously (7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Olseán A. Wick M.J. Mo¨rgelin M. Bjo¨rck L. Infect Immun. 1998; 66: 944-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Herwald H. Mo¨rgelin M. Olseán A. Rhen M. Dahlba¨ck B. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.15 m NaCl, 0.06m phosphate, pH 7.2) and applied to PVDF membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Milliblot-D system (Millipore). Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with PBSAT (PBS + 0.02% sodium azide, 0.25% bovine serum albumin + 0.25% Tween 20). Various proteins were labeled with 125I using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (20Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with radiolabeled protein for 3 h at room temperature, washed in PBSAT, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film using regular intensifying screens (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Binding of radiolabeled proteins to intact bacteria was done as described (7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Basically, 2 × 108 bacteria were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The bacteria were incubated with 125I-labeled protein (50–100 ng) in a total volume of 250 μl in polypropylene tubes at 20 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the bacteria were washed once in 2 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and the radioactivity associated with the pellet was determined after centrifugation. Binding was expressed as the percentage of the added radioactivity. The NNS24 and VDQ26 peptides (10 mg) were coupled separately to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To suspensions of 200 μl of NNS24- or VDQ26-coupled Sepharose, 0.5 ml of citrated fresh human plasma was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation the Sepharose beads were washed in PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.0. As a control, plasma was simultaneously absorbed with glycine-Sepharose. After elution, the pH was adjusted to 7.4 by adding 1 m Tris to the samples. Proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of 1% SDS (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 30 min at 100 mA (22Khyse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (blocking buffer). Immunoprinting of the transferred proteins was done as described (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). A rabbit antibody against fibrinogen and a sheep antibody against H-kininogen, diluted 1:1,000 and 1:5,000, respectively, in the blocking buffer, were used. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit or sheep IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:3,000 followed by a chemiluminescence detection method as described by Nesbitt and Horton (24Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DOSY experiments on NNS24 (50 μm in D2O) were carried out on a Varian INOVA 500 (500 MHz) NMR spectrometer at 27 °C using bipolar paired stimulation echo (BPPSTE) pulse sequence (25Pelta M.D. Barjat H. Morris G.A. Davis A.L. Hammond S.J. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1998; 36: 706-714Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Wu D.H. Chen A. Johnson C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; A115: 123-126Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The duration of pulsed field gradients was 1 ms; the amplitudes were increased in 11 steps from 18.59 gauss/cm to 74.35 gauss/cm, and 8192 transients (with 8 dummy scans) were acquired for each increment. Data analysis was carried out using DOSY processing software (27Barjat H. Morris G.A. Smart S. Swanson A.G. Williams S.C.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; B108: 170-172Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. The spectra were recorded in the far-UV region (260–190 nm) in a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm. The experiments were recorded in H2O at 20 °C at concentrations of 50, 24, and 12 μm. Spectra were acquired at a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a 2-s response time. Four scans were accumulated for each experiment. The solvent dichroic absorbance was subtracted using Jasco software. The thermal unfolding curve was run at a single wavelength (216 nm) characteristic for β-sheet structures at a concentration of 50 μm. The temperature was increased from 5 to 90 °C at a scan rate of 50 °C/h. Peptides NNS24, ALQ26, GFG24, and VDQ26 were added separately to human citrated plasma from healthy individuals. The peptides were dissolved in 100% Me2SO and diluted 10 times in water. 1, 10, or 100 μg of the peptides in 100 μl of Me2SO/water was added to 300 μl of plasma. The samples were incubated under rotation for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed for bradykinin content in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Markit-M-Bradykinin, Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The bradykinin concentration was determined from the enzyme activity of peroxidase-labeled BK bound to the anti-BK antibodies; detection limit is 4.9 pg/well. A standard curve was prepared with five BK concentrations (4.9, 19.6, 78, and 313; 1250 pg/well). Samples were analyzed in duplicate and the results expressed as ng/ml plasma. A number of different human proteins have been shown to interact with curli. In most of these experiments, radiolabeled proteins were used in binding experiments with curli-expressing bacteria, whereas isogenic curli-deficient mutants served as controls (4Olseán A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Ben Nasr A. Olseán A. Sjo¨bring U. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Olseán A. Wick M.J. Mo¨rgelin M. Bjo¨rck L. Infect Immun. 1998; 66: 944-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, purified curli organelles and the CsgA subunit alone were demonstrated to bind the tested proteins (4Olseán A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Olseán A. Wick M.J. Mo¨rgelin M. Bjo¨rck L. Infect Immun. 1998; 66: 944-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, initial experiments were performed to confirm and expand these previous data. 125I-labeled human fibronectin, fibrinogen, plasminogen, t-PA, H-kininogen, factor XII, MHC class I antigens, β2-microglobulin, and HSA, were tested for binding to curli-expressing E. coli and an isogenic curli-deficient mutant. These results (Fig. 1) show that all proteins except HSA interact with curli-expressing bacteria, whereas none of the tested proteins had affinity for the mutant. To further investigate the binding properties of curli, we synthesized a set of overlapping peptides covering the entire CsgA curli subunit. The peptides (Fig. 2A) were applied to filters, which were probed with the various radiolabeled proteins tested for binding to intact bacteria (see Fig. 1). Fig.2B shows the results obtained with 125I-labeled fibrinogen. Distinct dose-dependent binding is seen to peptides NNS24, KQF22, and VDQ26. The specificity was tested by incubating the filter with an excess of unlabeled fibrinogen. This completely inhibited the binding of radiolabeled fibrinogen to the peptides (data not shown). Apart from HSA, which did not bind to any of the peptides, and factor XII, which gave weak signals with peptides KQF22 and VDQ26 but a strong signal with peptide NNS24, the other radiolabeled proteins (fibronectin, plasminogen, t-PA, H-kininogen, MHC class I antigens, and β2-microglobulin) tested gave rise to the same binding pattern as fibrinogen (data not shown). These results suggest two protein-binding sites in the CsgA subunit, one in the NH2-terminal region and one in the COOH-terminal region. Physiochemical properties of NNS24 were investigated by circular dichroism (CD) analysis and NMR. CD analysis of the peptide revealed that NNS24 is predominantly in a β-sheet conformation as indicated by a single maximum and minimum at 197 and 216 nm, respectively (Fig. 3A). The intensity of the CD signal at 216 nm is correlated directly to the concentration of the peptide indicating that the β-sheet content is invariant within this concentration range (12–50 μm). This conformation is thermally relatively stable against thermal denaturation with a melting point (Tm) of ∼66 °C (Fig.3B) compared with the average Tm of proteins, which is 63 °C (28Pheil W. Hins H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1986: 349-376Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the NNS24 peptide adopts a stable and folded conformation in solution. Amyloid fibrils characteristically are composed of proteins rich in β-sheets, and they bind Congo red. Also curli fibers are stained with this reagent (29Hammar M. Arnqvist A. Bian Z. Olseán A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NNS24 and the two most COOH-terminal peptides, KQF22 and VDQ26, but not the other CsgA-derived peptides (see Fig. 2A), were distinctly stained red when applied to PVDF membranes and incubated with Congo red (data not shown). These observations suggest also that peptides KQF22 and VDQ26 form β-sheets and that the protein-binding regions of curli have this conformation in common. CD analysis of these peptides could not be performed, as they are soluble only in Me2SO. Although much less pronounced than peptides KQF22 and VDQ26, the NNS24 peptide has a tendency to precipitate, suggesting that it could form soluble multimers. To study the multimerization properties of NNS24, diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy experiments were performed, resulting in a diffusion coefficient (D value) of 1.3 × 10−1 (± 0.034) m2/s in D2O at 2 °C, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa. The molecular mass of NNS24 determined from its amino acid sequence is 2480.1 Da, demonstrating that the peptide aggregates and forms multimers, predominantly octamers, in solution. The multimerization of the protein-binding peptides of curli indicates that these regions could also participate in the polymerization of CsgA subunits and, together with the nucleator protein CsgB (29Hammar M. Arnqvist A. Bian Z. Olseán A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), contribute to the formation of curli organelles. An important question raised by the broad protein-binding capacity of curli is to what extent the multitude of possible protein interactions actually takes place in the complex mixture of proteins surrounding bacteria in vivo. Previous experiments (7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Herwald H. Mo¨rgelin M. Olseán A. Rhen M. Dahlba¨ck B. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in which curli-expressing bacteria were incubated with human plasma showed that a large number of different plasma proteins are indeed simultaneously bound to the bacterial surface through interactions with curli. For instance, incubation with human plasma will result in the binding and assembly of components of the contact system but also in the binding of several other plasma proteins, such as plasminogen and fibrinogen, to curliated bacteria (7Sjo¨bring U. Pohl G. Olseán A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Herwald H. Mo¨rgelin M. Olseán A. Rhen M. Dahlba¨ck B. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To test whether the NNS24 and VDQ26 peptides, analogous to intact curli, could interact with many different proteins when exposed to an excess of proteins in a complex protein mixture, the peptides were coupled to Sepharose. Following incubation with human plasma and extensive washing, proteins bound to NNS24- or VDQ26-Sepharose were eluted by low pH and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, STAIN,lanes 2, several proteins were bound and eluted from NNS24- and VDQ26-Sepharose. Compared with plasma (lanes 1) some bands were accentuated, whereas other, such as the HSA bands around 66 kDa, were weaker or missing in the eluates (lanes 2). In contrast, no proteins were absorbed from human plasma and eluted from glycine-Sepharose, the negative control (lanes 3). These results demonstrate a broad but selective binding of human plasma proteins by the two curli-derived peptides. Sepsis and septic shock caused by Gram-negative bacteria is a serious and important clinical condition causing more than 100,000 deaths annually in the United States alone (30Bone R.C. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several observations have indicated that curli play a role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. First, E. coli strains isolated from patients with sepsis frequently express curli (13Ben Nasr A. Olseán A. Sjo¨bring U. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and antibodies to CsgA are found in these patients (14Bian Z. Brauner A., Li, Y. Normark S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Second, when curliated bacteria are injected intravenously into mice or rats, they induce bleeding disorders, a fall in blood pressure, and lung lesions (17Herwald H. Mo¨rgelin M. Olseán A. Rhen M. Dahlba¨ck B. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Persson K. Mo¨rgelin M. Lindbom L. Alm P. Bjo¨rck L. Herwald H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Bian Z. Yan Z.Q. Hansson G.K. Thoreán P. Normark S. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), symptoms that are common in cases of severe sepsis. The hypocoagulatory state of human plasma following exposure to curli is due to the binding of factor XII and fibrinogen to curli (17Herwald H. Mo¨rgelin M. Olseán A. Rhen M. Dahlba¨ck B. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 4, A andB, BLOT I, fibrinogen is absorbed from plasma by NNS24- and VDQ26-Speharose. The contact system consists of the three serine proteinases, factor XI, factor XII, and plasma prekallikrein, and the non-enzymatic cofactor H-kininogen. When the system is assembled and activated, H-kininogen is cleaved by activated kallikrein to generate bradykinin, a highly potent proinflammatory peptide. On bacterial surfaces contact activation will result in the cleavage of H-kininogen into two major 45- and 65-kDa fragments (13Ben Nasr A. Olseán A. Sjo¨bring U. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Bjo¨rck L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and in sepsis low levels of factor XII and intact H-kininogen correlate with a fatal outcome (32Pixley R.A. Zellis S. Bankes P. DeLa Cadena R.A. Page J.D. Scott C.F. Kappelmayer J. Wyshock E.G. Kelly J.J. Colman R.W. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 23: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is therefore noteworthy that H-kininogen is absorbed from plasma by the Sepharose-coupled curli peptides and cleaved into fragments of 45 and 65 kDa (Fig. 4, A and B,BLOT II, lanes 2). These results suggest that the contact factors are bound and assembled on NNS24- and VDQ26-Sepharose and that the system is activated to generate bradykinin. Bradykinin is a primary mediator of inflammatory processes and induces pain, vasodilatation, and increased vascular permeability due to the local production of prostaglandins and nitric oxide (33Hall J.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 56: 131-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Consequently, a massive release of bradykinin by curliated bacteria could help to explain the hypovolemic hypotension seen in septic shock. To investigate whether the cleavage of H-kininogen shown in Fig. 4,A and B, BLOT II, actually results in the generation of bradykinin, peptides NNS24, GFG24, and VDQ26 were added separately to fresh human plasma. 1, 10, or 100 μg of the peptides in 100 μl of 10% Me2SO were added to 300 μl of plasma, and following incubation, the amount of bradykinin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Neither the GFG24 peptide nor 10% Me2SO alone generated bradykinin above background level (<0.1 ng/ml plasma), whereas even 1 μg of NNS24 induced a significant increase (0.71 ± 0.03 ng/ml plasma). When 10 or 100 μg of NNS24 was added, this resulted in a massive generation of bradykinin (12.8 ± 3.4 and 57.0 ± 13.1 ng/ml plasma, respectively). The VDQ26 peptide did not induce bradykinin release at 1 or 10 μg, but at 100 μg the amount was clearly above background level (2.46 ± 0.15 ng/ml plasma). These results show that the fragmentation of H-kininogen induced by NNS24 and VDQ26 generates bradykinin. In conclusion, the present work has identified and characterized two protein-binding regions of curli, which are also responsible for the activation of the pro-inflammatory contact system. The important role played by curli in virulence and its unique protein-binding properties should stimulate future investigations of the multipotent structural entities included in the NNS24 and VDQ26 peptides.

Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) reported that purified CsgA subunits polymerize into amyloid curli fibers. It is likely that the NH2- and COOH-terminal CsgA regions defined in this study participate in this assembly process."

https://openalex.org/W2064337036,"We report an unexpected nonphotothermal material organization induced by continuous-wave visible laser light at low power levels. This effect is observed along the laser beam propagation direction in fully transparent entangled solutions of common homopolymers featuring sufficiently high molecular mass and optical anisotropy along the chain backbone. The resulting formation of long-lived stringlike or dotlike patterns on the micrometer scale, probed by dark-field coherent imaging, depends on the molecular mass, architecture, solvent nature, and polymer concentration. Electrostrictive and alignment forces as well as chain cooperativity are responsible for the osmotic compression of the polymer solute. Subsequent waveguiding effects induce autoamplification and ""pattern writing"" upon prolonged illumination. This wave-medium coupling could potentially lead to photorefractive, microoptics, and nanotechnology applications."
https://openalex.org/W1973056955,"Mutations in the tumour suppressor genes SMAD4 (DPC4, deleted in pancreatic cancer locus 4) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) have been implicated in the development of pancreatic cancer in humans. Treatment of wild-type, Smad4(+/-), Apc(Min/+) or Apc(Min/+)Smad4(+/-) mice with N-Nitroso-N-Methyl Urea (NMU) results in abnormal foci in pancreatic acinar cells characterized by increased levels of beta-catenin. Previously such foci have been shown to be the precursors of pancreatic neoplasia. Interestingly, only NMU-treated Apc(Min/+)Smad4(+/-) mice exhibit a significant increase in abnormal pancreas, which was found to be due to increased number of abnormal foci rather than increased focus size. A range of foci sizes were analysed, but only smaller abnormal foci were characterized by morphological nuclear atypia. These studies suggest functional co-operation between TGF-beta and Wnt signalling pathways in the suppression of pancreatic tumorigenesis in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2077533010,"Increases in both Ca2+ and nitric oxide levels are vital for a variety of cellular processes; however, the interaction between these two crucial messengers is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in hepatocytes, in response to inflammatory mediators, dramatically attenuates Ca2+ signaling by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-forming hormone, vasopressin. The inhibitory effects of induction were reversed by nitric oxide inhibitors and mimicked by prolonged cyclic GMP elevation. Induction was without effect on Ca2+ signals in response to AlF4− or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, indicating that phospholipase C activation and release of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores were not targets for nitric oxide inhibition. Vasopressin receptor levels, however, were dramatically reduced in induced cultures. Our data provide a possible mechanism for hepatocyte dysfunction during chronic inflammation.

Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar). That increases in the cytosolic [Ca2+] can mediate opposing cellular fates highlights the necessity and control of this ubiquitous signaling ion in cell function (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar). Such exquisite specificity is likely encoded in the remarkable spatial and temporal complexity of the Ca2+ signal (2Thomas A.P. Bird G.St. J. Hajnoáczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D.

In non-excitable cells, Ca2+ increases derive initially from mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar) and are sustained by influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane (5Putney J.W., Jr. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli acting on G protein-coupled receptors or receptor-tyrosine kinases converge at the level phospholipase C (PLC)1 to mediate increases in the levels of the intracellular messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). IP3 in turn mediates increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] via activation of IP3 receptors located on the membranes of intracellular Ca2+ stores (6Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and propagate regeneratively through and between cells as intra- and intercellular Ca2+ waves, respectively (2Thomas A.P.

Physiol. 1999; 276: R575-R585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is likely to integrate liver functions such as bile secretion. Nitric oxide (NO⋅) is a gaseous, short-lived messenger, which, like Ca2+, is intimately involved in cellular functions in both health and disease (17Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, 19Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). NO⋅ is produced from the amino acid l-arginine by the NO⋅ synthase family of enzymes (20Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar, 21Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive forms of NO⋅ synthase (cNOS) are expressed in certain cells, such as neurons (type I) and endothelial cells (type III), throughout their lifetime and are activated by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ (20Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar, 22Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). The inducible (type II) form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), is usually only expressed upon immune stimulation in cells such as macrophages, in most cases is Ca2+-insensitive, and is constitutively active (22Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Most, but not all, effects of NO⋅ are transduced through activation of guanylate cyclase and subsequent increases in cyclic GMP concentration (23Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Although much is known about Ca2+ and NO⋅ signaling pathways in isolation, relatively few studies have addressed the possible interactions of these messengers. Clearly stimuli that increase Ca2+ in cells that express cNOS will stimulate NO⋅ production. It is well established that NO⋅derived from stimulated endothelial cells can inhibit Ca2+signaling in adjacent smooth muscle effecting vasodilation (24Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 399-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), albeit by a poorly defined mechanism. In contrast, we have previously demonstrated that IP3-dependent Ca2+ signals in hepatocytes are potentiated by NO⋅derived either from chemical donors or bradykinin-stimulated endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo (25Rooney T.A. Joseph S.K. Queen C. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19817-19825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Patel S. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Stellato K.A. Shon M. Thomas A.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes do not express cNOS but can express iNOS upon appropriate stimulation (27Geller D.A. Nussler A.K., Di Silvio M.D. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the effect of iNOS expression on agonist-mediated Ca2+ signals in rat hepatocytes. In contrast to the potentiating effects of acute NO⋅ production (25Rooney T.A.

Our data highlight the importance of controlled NO⋅ production in liver Ca2+ signaling and provide a plausible mechanism for liver dysfunction during chronic inflammation. Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of livers from fed Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (28Robb-Gaspers L.D. Burnett P. Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Rizzuto R. Thomas A.P.

Cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with collagen (type I rat tail, Collaborative Biomedical Products; 10 μg/cm2) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in Williams medium E supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% v/v), penicillin, (10 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), gentamycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), glutamine (2 mm), and insulin (140 nm). After 3 h the insulin concentration in the medium was reduced to 14 nm and cells cultured for an additional 16–20 h either in the absence or presence of an inducer mixture consisting of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 026:B6, Sigma; 10 μg/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; murine recombinant, Invitrogen; 500 units/ml) interleukin-1β (IL-1β; murine recombinant, Invitrogen; 15 units/ml), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ; rat recombinant, Invitrogen; 100 units/ml). PPM-18 (50 μm) or carboxy-PTIO (500 μm,Calbiochem) were added together with the inducer mixture as indicated (Table I). In some experiments, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (500 μm) was included in the media in place of the inducer mixture.

Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and antibody binding visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were raised to iNOS (monoclonal, residues 961–1144 of the murine macrophage isoform; Transduction Laboratories), Gαq/α11(polyclonal, common C-terminal decapeptide) (31Ibarrondo J. Joubert D. Dufour M.N. Cohen-Solal A. Homburger V. Jard S. Guillon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C and fixed in methanol (100%) at −20 °C for 10 min. Following three washes in PBS at 25 °C, cells were permeabilized with digitonin (25 μg/ml, 10 min). Cells were washed again (three times) in PBS and then incubated in a blocking buffer consisting of PBS supplemented with fetal calf serum (5% v/v) and bovine serum albumin (1% w/v) for 1 h at 25 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. Incubation of the primary (1/50 dilution) and secondary (1/100 dilution) antibodies (same as for immunoblotting) was performed sequentially in blocking buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound antibody after each incubation was removed by washing the cells three times (5 min) in a buffer consisting of Tris-HCl (100 mm), NaCl (150 mm), and Tween 20 (0.05% v/v). Antibody binding was visualized using tyramide signal amplification. Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser using a standard fluorescein filter set. Cytosolic calcium concentration was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+indicator, fura-2. Cells were loaded with 5 μm fura-2-AM and 0.02% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 for 20 min in a buffer composed of (in mm) 121 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 5 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 25 HEPES (pH 7.4 at 37 °C), 0.1 bromosulfophthalein, and 0.25% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Cells were then mounted onto the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope and Ca2+ concentration monitored by measuring the fluorescence ratio of the dye (excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 420–600 nm) using a cooled charged-coupled device. Data were collected every 3 s and corrected for autofluorescence as described (32Patel S. Santra M. McQuillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Thomas A.P. J. Biol.

For luminal calcium concentration measurements, cells were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ indicator fura-2-FF (Molecular Probes) by incubation with 6 μm fura-2-FF-AM and 0.02% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 for 30 min. Cells were washed twice into an intracellular-like medium composed of (in mm) 130 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 KH2PO4, 0.5 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.15 CaCl2, 20 Tris (pH 7.2 at 37 °C) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin), an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm creatine phosphate and 5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase), and 1 μm ruthenium red. Cells were permeabilized with digitonin (10 μg/ml) and released dye (monitored by loss of cytosolic fluorescence) removed by two more washes in complete intracellular-like medium. Ca2+ uptake into intracellular stores was initiated by the addition of Mg-ATP (2 mm) and changes in luminal [Ca2+] followed by monitoring the fluorescence ratio of the compartmentalized dye (excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 420–600 nm) at 3-s intervals as above. Control and induced cultures were washed twice with a medium composed of (in mm) 116 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 5 NaHCO3, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4) and suspended (2 × 107 cells/ml) in ice-cold homogenization medium composed of (in mm) 1 EDTA, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min and disrupted at 4 °C by 15 strokes in a Potter homogenizer (Teflon/glass, tight piston). Following centrifugation (100 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), supernatant fractions were collected and further centrifuged at 21,000 ×g (15 min at 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in homogenization medium at a protein concentration of 3–5 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Binding of increasing concentrations of [125I]OH-LVA (specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol) to membranes was performed in quadruplicate from two independent cultures at 37 °C as described previously (34Guillon G. Trueba M. Joubert D. Grazzini E. Chouinard L. Cote M. Payet M.D. Manzoni O. Barberis C. Robert M. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound and free ligand were separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters (Clifton, NJ). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled vasopressin. Total RNA was extracted from control or induced cultures using RNeasy® total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and samples (5 μg) reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using oligo(dT)15 primers and 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Aliquots of the RT-PCR mixture were amplified using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche) with primers based on the reported sequence of the rat V1a receptor (forward, 5′-ATG AGT TTC CCG CGA GGC T-3′; reverse, 5′-TTG GAC GCA GTC TTG CAG GA-3′) (35Innamorati G. Lolait S.J. Birnbaumer M. Biochem.

PCR was performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermocycler (32 cycles consisting of 30 s at 96 °C, 45 s at 59 °C, followed by 3 min at 72 °C) and samples analyzed by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-impregnated 2% agarose gels. Flash photolysis of microinjected caged IP3 and monitoring of cytosolic [Ca2+] using fluo-3 were performed exactly as described (29Tordjmann T. Berthon B. Jacquemin E. Clair C. Stelly N. Guillon G. Claret M. Combettes L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using Biuret reagent (Sigma). All data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean. Hepatocytes cultured in the presence of LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ (see “Experimental Procedures”) expressed a protein with a molecular mass of 142 ± 5 kDa (n = 3) that was recognized by an antibody raised to iNOS from murine macrophages (Fig.1A). This protein was expressed throughout the cytoplasm and found to be concentrated in certain regions, particularly in the cell periphery (Fig.1B). Only a small proportion of cells (<5%) from control cultures stained positively for iNOS (Fig. 1C). The observed iNOS distribution was specific because no staining was observed in the absence of primary antibody (Fig. 1D). In control cultures, stimulation of individual hepatocytes with submaximal concentrations (2–5 nm) of the IP3-forming hormone, vasopressin (VP), initiated repetitive transient increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig.2A). Increasing the VP concentration converted these oscillatory Ca2+ signals to sustained ones. In induced cultures, however, VP-induced Ca2+ signals were dramatically inhibited (Fig.2B); no response to submaximal VP concentrations were observed in a majority of cells (TableI). Reduced sensitivity was also observed at supramaximal VP concentrations (Table I). Analysis of complete concentration-effect relationships (Fig.3) indicated that the concentration of VP required to stimulate Ca2+ increases in 50% of the cells (EC50) was 1 and 4.8 nm in control and induced cells, respectively, and that the percentage of cells responsive to a maximal concentration of VP was reduced from 88% to 41% upon induction. Similar inhibitory effects of induction were observed when cells were stimulated with the α-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (data not shown). Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] in response to cyclopiazonic acid, a reversible Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, however, were similar in control (peak cytosolic [Ca2+] = 757 ± 28 nm, n= 78 cells) and induced (peak cytosolic [Ca2+] = 709 ± 27 nm, n = 89 cells) cultures. Both carboxy-PTIO (500 μm), an NO⋅ scavenger (36Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and PPM-18 (50 μm), an inhibitor of iNOS expression (37Yu S.M., Wu, J.F. Lin T.L. Kuo S.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were able to reverse the inhibitory effects of induction (Table I). We confirmed by immunocytochemistry that PPM-18 blocked iNOS expression under our experimental conditions (data not shown). These data indicate that attenuation of VP-dependent Ca2+ signaling in induced cultures was caused by NO⋅ derived from iNOS expression.Figure 3Effect of iNOS induction on VP concentration-effect relationships.

Data are from up to nine independent hepatocyte preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because many of the effects of NO⋅ are mediated by increases in cyclic GMP (38McDonald L.J.

A. 1994; 91: 12472-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of elevating cyclic GMP levels on VP sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that brief incubations (10 min) with cell-permeable cyclic GMP analogues potentiated IP3-dependent Ca2+ signaling (25Rooney T.A. Joseph S.K. Queen C. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19817-19825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,40Guihard G. Combettes L. Capiod T. Biochem.

In contrast, cells cultured in the prolonged (16–20 h) presence of 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (500 μm), were significantly less responsive to VP than untreated cells (Fig. 4A, Table I). Cells treated with 8-bromo-cAMP, however, were marginally more responsive to VP than control cells (Fig. 4B, Table I) an effect probably resulting from phosphorylation and sensitization of hepatic IP3 receptors by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (41Burgess G.M.

Because VP and other agonists stimulate Ca2+ signals primarily through mobilization of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores, we compared IP3 sensitivity in control and induced cultures (Fig. 5). Permeabilized hepatocytes readily accumulated Ca2+ into intracellular stores in response to ATP. Once steady-state loading had been achieved, a submaximal IP3 concentration resulted in partial release of the accumulated Ca2+. A maximal IP3concentration effected a more rapid and robust response. The remaining IP3-insensitive store could be released with the divalent ionophore, ionomycin. Although sensitivity to VP in intact cells was severely compromised in induced cultures (Fig. 2 and Table I), the IP3 sensitivity of these cells when permeabilized appeared normal (Fig. 4B). Thus, a submaximal concentration of IP3 (0.3 μm) released 20 ± 1% and 20 ± 2% (n = 37) of the accumulated Ca2+ releasable by ionomycin in control and induced cultures, respectively. The response to a maximal concentration of IP3 (20 μm) was also similar in the two cultures (39 ± 2% and 42 ± 2% for control and induced cultures, respectively). Prolonged 8-bromo-cyclic GMP treatment was also without effect on IP3 sensitivity in permeabilized cells (data not shown). One concern was that any possible effects of NO⋅ on the IP3 receptor may be reversed upon permeabilization of the cell because iNOS is predominantly a cytosolic enzyme. We therefore assessed IP3 sensitivity in intact cells by using caged IP3. Control cells injected with caged IP3responded to submaximal VP concentrations in the typical oscillatory fashion (Fig. 6A). Following washout of the agonist, photolytic liberation of IP3resulted in a transient increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 6A). In induced cultures, VP was without effect on the cytosolic [Ca2+]; however, the response to uncaging of IP3 (peak increase = 14 ± 4%, area under curve = 2694 ± 992 arbitrary units, n = 9; Fig. 6B) was indistinguishable from control cells (peak increase = 17 ± 3%, area under curve = 3021 ± 711 arbitrary units, n = 4, Fig.6A). The response was specific to the presence of IP3, because no response was observed upon UV illumination in cells not injected with the caged precursor (n = 9; Fig. 6B, lower trace). These data, together with results from permeabilized cells (Fig. 5), strongly suggest that the target for NO⋅ is upstream of the IP3 receptor. VP acts on the V1a receptor expressed in hepatocytes to stimulate PLC through Gαq/Gα11 activation (44Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). AlF4−, however, can induce Ca2+ oscillations in hepatocytes independently of cell surface receptor occupancy through direct activation of G proteins (13Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Tordjmann T. Berthon B. Jacquemin E. Clair C. Stelly N. Guillon G. Claret M. Combettes L.

We therefore compared the effects of AlF4− in control and induced cultures. Cells from both cultures responded to AlF4− with oscillations in cytosolic [Ca2+] reminiscent of those evoked by IP3-forming hormones (Fig. 7and Table I). As expected, only the control cultures responded to VP (Fig. 7A). From Western blot analysis, protein levels of Gαq/Gα11 and PLC-β3 in induced cultures were 110 ± 9% (n = 12) and 106 ± 3% (n = 18), respectively, of that in control cultures (Fig. 8). These data indicate that G protein and PLC are unaffected by iNOS expression.Figure 8iNOS expression does not alter expression levels of G proteins or PLC.

Trueba M. Joubert D. Grazzini E. Chouinard L. Cote M. Payet M.D. Manzoni O. Barberis C. Robert M. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity [125I]OH-LVA binding was detectable in membranes prepared from both control (Kd = 12.7 pm) and induced (Kd = 8.1 pm) cultures; however, the maximal density of binding sites was reduced from 10 to 3.5 fmol/mg upon induction (mean data from two independent preparations performed in quadruplicate; Fig. 9A). In addition, results from semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that amplification of an 1100-base pair product, corresponding to amino acids 1–367 of the V1a receptor (35Innamorati G. Lolait S.J. Birnbaumer M. Biochem. J. 1995; 314: 709Google Scholar), was markedly lower in induced cultures (Fig. 9B). From densitometric analysis, the VP receptor/β-actin mRNA ratio decreased from 0.65 ± 0.1 in control cultures to 0.25 ± 0.08 in induced cultures (n = 4 preparations). Taken together, these data suggest that attenuation of VP-induced Ca2+ signaling in the induced cultures is likely caused by down-regulation of VP receptors. 2Western blot analysis using a N-terminal VP receptor antibody indicated that total VP recep"
https://openalex.org/W2316144664,"The mechanisms utilized to transduce apoptotic signals that originate from within the nucleus, in response to DNA damage for example, are not well understood. Identifying these mechanisms is important for predicting how tumor cells will respond to genotoxic radiation or chemotherapy. The Rb tumor suppressor protein can inhibit apoptosis triggered by DNA damage, but how it does so is unclear. We have previously characterized a death domain protein, p84N5, that specifically associates with an amino-terminal domain of Rb protein. The p84N5 death domain is required for its ability to trigger apoptotic cell death. Association with Rb protein inhibits p84N5-induced apoptosis suggesting that it may be a mediator of Rb's effects on apoptosis. Unlike other death domain-containing apoptotic signaling proteins, however, p84N5 is localized predominantly within the nucleus of interphase cells. Here we test whether p84N5 requires nuclear localization in order to trigger apoptosis. We identify the p84N5 nuclear localization signal and demonstrate that nuclear localization is required for p84N5-induced apoptosis. To our knowledge, this identifies p84N5 as the first death-domain containing apoptotic signaling protein that functions within the nucleus. By analogy to other death domain containing proteins, p84N5 may play some role in apoptotic signaling within the nucleus. Further, p84N5 is a potential mediator of Rb protein's effects on DNA damage induced apoptosis."
