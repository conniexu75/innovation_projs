https://openalex.org/W3118048495,"Millions of new viral sequences have been identified from metagenomes, but the quality and completeness of these sequences vary considerably. Here we present CheckV, an automated pipeline for identifying closed viral genomes, estimating the completeness of genome fragments and removing flanking host regions from integrated proviruses. CheckV estimates completeness by comparing sequences with a large database of complete viral genomes, including 76,262 identified from a systematic search of publicly available metagenomes, metatranscriptomes and metaviromes. After validation on mock datasets and comparison to existing methods, we applied CheckV to large and diverse collections of metagenome-assembled viral sequences, including IMG/VR and the Global Ocean Virome. This revealed 44,652 high-quality viral genomes (that is, >90% complete), although the vast majority of sequences were small fragments, which highlights the challenge of assembling viral genomes from short-read metagenomes. Additionally, we found that removal of host contamination substantially improved the accurate identification of auxiliary metabolic genes and interpretation of viral-encoded functions."
https://openalex.org/W3117021508,"As countries in Europe gradually relaxed lockdown restrictions after the first wave, test–trace–isolate strategies became critical to maintain the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at low levels1,2. Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave that is currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6–8%) to 38% (35–44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behaviour of suspected cases of COVID-19 is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low epidemic activity achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. Substantially more aggressive, targeted and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing strategy will be critical to enable partial lifting of the current restrictive measures in Europe and to avoid a third wave. Analyses of virological and surveillance data in France show that a substantial proportion of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 have remained undetected and that easily accessible and efficient testing is required to control the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3117031117,"The repair of inflamed, demyelinated lesions as in multiple sclerosis (MS) necessitates the clearance of cholesterol-rich myelin debris by microglia/macrophages and the switch from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory lesion environment. Subsequently, oligodendrocytes increase cholesterol levels as a prerequisite for synthesizing new myelin membranes. We hypothesized that lesion resolution is regulated by the fate of cholesterol from damaged myelin and oligodendroglial sterol synthesis. By integrating gene expression profiling, genetics and comprehensive phenotyping, we found that, paradoxically, sterol synthesis in myelin-phagocytosing microglia/macrophages determines the repair of acutely demyelinated lesions. Rather than producing cholesterol, microglia/macrophages synthesized desmosterol, the immediate cholesterol precursor. Desmosterol activated liver X receptor (LXR) signaling to resolve inflammation, creating a permissive environment for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Moreover, LXR target gene products facilitated the efflux of lipid and cholesterol from lipid-laden microglia/macrophages to support remyelination by oligodendrocytes. Consequently, pharmacological stimulation of sterol synthesis boosted the repair of demyelinated lesions, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies for myelin repair in MS. Efficient repair of demyelinated CNS lesions involves the resolution of inflammation and induction of remyelination. Berghoff et al. show that sterol synthesis in microglia is key to both processes, which can be supported by squalene therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3114648893,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus. However, the potential for long-term self-renewal of individual NSCs within the adult brain remains unclear. We used two-photon microscopy and followed NSCs that were genetically labeled through conditional recombination driven by the regulatory elements of the stem cell-expressed genes GLI family zinc finger 1 (Gli1) or achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1). Through intravital imaging of NSCs and their progeny, we identify a population of Gli1-targeted NSCs showing long-term self-renewal in the adult hippocampus. In contrast, once activated, Ascl1-targeted NSCs undergo limited proliferative activity before they become exhausted. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that Gli1- and Ascl1-targeted cells have highly similar yet distinct transcriptional profiles, supporting the existence of heterogeneous NSC populations with diverse behavioral properties. Thus, we here identify long-term self-renewing NSCs that contribute to the generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W3114206934,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) studies provide associations of genetic variants with gene expression but fall short of pinpointing functionally important eQTLs. Here, using H3K27ac HiChIP assays, we mapped eQTLs overlapping active cis-regulatory elements that interact with their target gene promoters (promoter-interacting eQTLs, pieQTLs) in five common immune cell types (Database of Immune Cell Expression, Expression quantitative trait loci and Epigenomics (DICE) cis-interactome project). This approach allowed us to identify functionally important eQTLs and show mechanisms that explain their cell-type restriction. We also devised an approach to eQTL discovery that relies on HiChIP-based promoter interaction maps as a structural framework for deciding which SNPs to test for association with gene expression, and observe ultra-long-distance pieQTLs (>1 megabase away), including several disease-risk variants. We validated the functional role of pieQTLs using reporter assays, CRISPRi, dCas9-tiling guides and Cas9-mediated base-pair editing. In this article we present a method for functional eQTL discovery and provide insights into relevance of noncoding variants for cell-specific gene regulation and for disease association beyond conventional eQTL mapping."
https://openalex.org/W3115035889,"Successfully navigating in physical or semantic space requires a neural representation of allocentric (map-based) vectors to boundaries, objects and goals. Cognitive processes such as path-planning and imagination entail the recall of vector representations, but evidence of neuron-level memory for allocentric vectors has been lacking. Here, we describe a novel neuron type, vector trace cell (VTC), whose firing generates a new vector field when a cue is encountered and a ‘trace’ version of that field for hours after cue removal. VTCs are concentrated in subiculum, distal to CA1. Compared to non-trace cells, VTCs fire at further distances from cues and exhibit earlier-going shifts in preferred theta phase in response to newly introduced cues, which demonstrates a theta-linked neural substrate for memory encoding. VTCs suggest a vector-based model of computing spatial relationships between an agent and multiple spatial objects, or between different objects, freed from the constraints of direct perception of those objects. Poulter et al. report on vector trace cells (VTCs) in the hippocampal subiculum. VTCs support vector coding for previously encountered, now absent, objects and boundaries, potentially facilitating navigation to remembered goals."
https://openalex.org/W3117059933,"Background Since the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. In Indonesia, the first case was reported in early March 2020, and the numbers of confirmed infections have been increasing until now. Efforts to contain the virus globally and in Indonesia are ongoing. This is the very first manuscript using a spatial-temporal model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia, as well as providing a patient profile for all confirmed COVID-19 cases. Method Data was collected from the official website of the Indonesia National Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19, from the period of 02 March 2020–02 August 2020. The data from RT-PCR confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was categorized according to demographics, symptoms and comorbidities based on case categorization (confirmed, recovered, dead). The data collected provides granular and thorough information on time and geographical location for all 34 Provinces across Indonesia. Results A cumulative total of 111,450 confirmed cases of were reported in Indonesia during the study period. Of those confirmed cases 67.79% (75,551/111,450) were shown as recovered and 4.83% (5,382/111,450) of them as died. Patients were mostly male (50.52%; 56,300/111,450) and adults aged 31 to 45 years old (29.73%; 33,132/111,450). Overall patient presentation symptoms of cough and fever, as well as chronic disease comorbidities were in line with previously published data from elsewhere in South-East Asia. The data reported here, shows that from the detection of the first confirmed case and within a short time period of 40 days, all the provinces of Indonesia were affected by COVID-19. Conclusions This study is the first to provide detailed characteristics of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Indonesia, including their demographic profile and COVID-19 presentation history. It used a spatial-temporal analysis to present the epidemic spread from the very beginning of the outbreak throughout all provinces in the country. The increase of new confirmed cases has been consistent during this time period for all provinces, with some demonstrating a sharp increase, in part due to the surge in national diagnostic capacity. This information delivers a ready resource that can be used for prediction modelling, and is utilized continuously by the current Indonesian Task Force in order to advise on potential implementation or removal of public distancing measures, and on potential availability of healthcare capacity in their efforts to ultimately manage the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3117443701,"Resorting to a One Strain Many Compounds (OSMAC) approach, the marine Streptomyces sp. BRB081 strain was grown in six different media settings over 1, 2, 3 or 7 days. Extractions of mycelium and broth were conducted separately for each media and cultivation period by sonication using methanol/acetone 1:1 and agitation with ethyl acetate, respectively. All methanol/acetone and ethyl acetate crude extracts were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS and data treatment was performed through GNPS platform using MZmine 2 software. In parallel, the genome was sequenced, assembled and mined to search for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) of secondary metabolites using the AntiSMASH 5.0 software. Spectral library search tool allowed the annotation of desferrioxamines, fatty acid amides, diketopiperazines, xanthurenic acid and, remarkably, the cyclic octapeptides surugamides. Molecular network analysis allowed the observation of the surugamides cluster, where surugamide A and the protonated molecule corresponding to the B-E isomers, as well as two potentially new analogues, were detected. Data treatment through MZmine 2 software allowed to distinguish that the largest amount of surugamides was obtained by cultivating BRB081 in SCB medium during 7 days and extraction of culture broth. Using the same data treatment, a chemical barcode was created for easy visualization and comparison of the metabolites produced overtime in all media. By genome mining of BRB081 four regions of biosynthetic gene clusters of secondary metabolites were detected supporting the metabolic data. Cytotoxic evaluation of all crude extracts using MTT assay revealed the highest bioactivity was also observed for extracts obtained in the optimal conditions as those for surugamides production, suggesting these to be the main active compounds herein. This method allowed the identification of compounds in the crude extracts and guided the selection of best conditions for production of bioactive compounds."

We evaluated differences between White/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N = 866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020-May 4, 2020.Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)]. Hispanic patients were symptomatic longer before presenting to care (median 5 vs 3d, p = 0.039) but were more likely to be sent home with self-quarantine than be admitted to hospital (29% vs 16%, p<0.001). Hispanic patients had fewer comorbidities yet comparable rates of ICU or death (34% vs 36%). Nonetheless, a greater proportion of Hispanic patients recovered by 14 days after presentation (62% vs 45%, p<0.001; OR = 1.99, p = 0.011 in multivariable adjusted model) and fewer died (2% versus 18%, p<0.001).Hospitalized Hispanic patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities compared to White/non-Hispanic patients; despite comparable rates of ICU care or death, a greater proportion recovered. These results have implications for public health policy and the design and conduct of clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3113950476,"Background Iron metabolism is essential because it plays regulatory roles in various physiological and pathological processes. Disorders of iron metabolism balance are related to various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) exert critical effects on chemotherapy failure, cancer metastasis, and subsequent disease recurrence and relapse. However, little is known about how iron metabolism affects liver CSCs. Here, we investigated the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and ferroportin (FPN), two iron importers, and an upstream regulator, iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and related CSCs. Methods The expression levels of TFR1, FPN and IRP2 were analysed using the GEPIA database. CSCs were derived from parental LIHC cells cultured in serum-free medium. After TFR1 knockdown, ROS accumulation and malignant behaviours were measured. The CCK-8 assay was performed to detect cell viability after TFR1 knockdown and erastin treatment. Results TFR1 expression was upregulated in LIHC tissue and CSCs derived from LIHC cell lines, prompting us to investigate the roles of TFR1 in regulating CSCs. Knockdown of TFR1 expression decreased iron accumulation and inhibited malignant behaviour. Knockdown of TFR1 expression decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by erastin treatment and maintained mitochondrial function, indicating that TFR1 is critical in regulating erastin-induced cell death in CSCs. Additionally, knockdown of TFR1 expression decreased sphere formation by decreasing iron accumulation in CSCs, indicating a potential role for TFR1 in maintaining stemness. Conclusion These findings, which revealed TFR1 as a critical regulator of LIHC CSCs in malignant behaviour and stemness that functions by regulating iron accumulation, may have implications to improve therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3115918279,"ESG factors are becoming mainstream in portfolio investment strategies, attracting increasing fund inflows from investors who are aligning their investment values to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) declared by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investments. Do investors sacrifice return for pursuing ESG-aligned megatrend goals? The study analyses the risk-adjusted financial performance of ESG-themed megatrend investment strategies in global equity markets. The analysis covers nine themes for the period 2015–2019: environmental megatrends covering energy efficiency, food security, and water scarcity; social megatrends covering ageing, millennials, and urbanisation; governance megatrends covered by cybersecurity, disruptive technologies, and robotics. We construct megatrend factor portfolios based on signalling theory and formulate a novel measure for stock megatrend exposure (MTE), based on the relative fund flows into the corresponding thematic ETFs. We apply pure factor portfolios methodology based on constrained WLS cross-sectional regressions to calculate Fama-French factor returns. Time-series regression rests on the generalised method of moments estimator (GMM) that uses robust distance instruments. Our findings show that each environmental megatrend, as well as the disruptive technologies megatrend, yielded positive and significant alphas relative to the passive strategy, although this outperformance becomes statistically insignificant in the Fama-French 5-factor model context. The important result is that most of the megatrend factor portfolios yielded significant non-negative alphas; which supports our assumption that megatrend investing strategy promotes SDGs while not sacrificing returns, even when accounting for transaction costs up to 50bps/annum. Higher transaction costs, as is the case for some of these ETFs with expense ratios reaching 80-100bps, may be an indication of two things: ESG-themed megatrend investors were willing to sacrifice ca. 30-50bps of annual return to remain aligned with sustainability targets, or that expense ratio may well decline in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3114118799,"With the COVID-19 pandemic infecting millions of people, large-scale isolation policies have been enacted across the globe. To assess the impact of isolation measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output, we create a mathematical model to simulate the spread of COVID-19, incorporating effects of restrictive measures and segmenting the population based on health risk and economic vulnerability. Policymakers make isolation policy decisions based on current levels of disease spread and economic damage. For 76 weeks in a population of 330 million, we simulate a baseline scenario leaving strong isolation restrictions in place, rapidly reducing isolation restrictions for non-seniors shortly after outbreak containment, and gradually relaxing isolation restrictions for non-seniors. We use 76 weeks as an approximation of the time at which a vaccine will be available. In the baseline scenario, there are 235,724 deaths and the economy shrinks by 34.0%. With a rapid relaxation, a second outbreak takes place, with 525,558 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 32.3%. With a gradual relaxation, there are 262,917 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 29.8%. We also show that hospitalizations, deaths, and economic output are quite sensitive to disease spread by asymptomatic people. Strict restrictions on seniors with very gradual lifting of isolation for non-seniors results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. Therefore, we recommend this strategy and measures that reduce non-isolated disease spread to control the pandemic while making isolation economically viable."
https://openalex.org/W3117201083,"Lignin is a recalcitrant macromolecule formed by three alcohols (monolignols) predominantly connected by β-aryl ether linkages and is one of the most abundant organic macromolecules in the biosphere. However, the role played by environmental bacteria in lignin degradation is still not entirely understood. In this study, we identified an environmental Klebsiella strain isolated from sediment collected from an altitudinal region in a unique Brazilian biome called Caatinga. This organism can also grow in the presence of kraft lignin as a sole source of carbon and aromatic compounds. We performed whole-genome sequencing and conducted an extensive genome-based metabolic reconstruction to reveal the potential mechanisms used by the bacterium Klebsiella variicola P1CD1 for lignin utilization as a carbon source. We identified 262 genes associated with lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs) and lignin-degrading auxiliary enzymes (LDAs) required for lignin and aromatic compound degradation. The presence of one DyP (Dye-decolorizing Peroxidase) gene suggests the ability of P1CD1 strain to access phenolic and nonphenolic structures of lignin molecules, resulting in the production of catechol and protocatechuate (via vanillin or syringate) along the peripheral pathways of lignin degradation. K . variicola P1CD1 uses aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase to perform direct conversion of vanillin to protocatechol. The upper funneling pathways are linked to the central pathways of the protocatechuate/catechol catabolic branches via β-ketoadipate pathways, connecting the more abundant catabolized aromatic compounds with essential cellular functions, such as energy cellular and biomass production (i.e., via acetyl-CoA formation). The combination of phenotypic and genomic approaches revealed the potential dissimilatory and assimilatory ability of K . variicola P1CD1 to perform base-catalyzed lignin degradation, acting on high- and low-molecular-weight lignin fragments. These findings will be relevant for developing metabolic models to predict the ligninolytic mechanism used by environmental bacteria and shedding light on the flux of carbon in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W3114937128,"Purpose Cardiac involvement in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is increasingly recognized as a mayor cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of present study is to investigate the early stages of cardiac involvement in SSc by Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), combining the non-invasive detection of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis using T2 and T1 mapping techniques and the assessment of microcirculatory impairment through perfusion response to cold pressor test (CPT). Methods 40 SSc patients (30 females, mean age: 42.1 years) without cardiac symptoms and 10 controls underwent CMR at 1.5 T unit. CMR protocol included: native and contrast-enhanced T1 mapping, T2 mapping, T2-weighted, cineMR and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. Microvascular function was evaluated by comparing myocardial blood flow (MBF) on perfusion imaging acquired at rest and after CPT. Native myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation times, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), T2 signal intensity ratio, biventricular volumes and LGE were assessed in each patient. Results SSc patients had significantly higher mean myocardial T1 (1029±32ms vs. 985±18ms, p&lt;0.01), ECV (30.1±4.3% vs. 26.7±2.4%, p&lt;0.05) and T2 (50.1±2.8ms vs. 47±1.5ms, p&lt;0.01) values compared with controls. No significant differences were found between absolute MBF values at rest and after CPT; whereas lower MBF variation after CPT was observed in SSc patients (+33 ± 14% vs. +44 ± 12%, p&lt;0.01). MBF variation had inverse correlation with native T1 values (r: -0.32, p&lt;0.05), but not with ECV. Conclusions Myocardial involvement in SSc at preclinical stage increases native T1, T2 and ECV values, reflecting inflammation and fibrosis, and reduces vasodilatory response to CPT, as expression of microvascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3114375374,"Background A zoonotic association has been suggested for several PCR ribotypes (RTs) of Clostridioides difficile . In central parts of Sweden, RT046 was found dominant in neonatal pigs at the same time as a RT046 hospital C . difficile infection (CDI) outbreak occurred in the southern parts of the country. Objective To detect possible transmission of RT046 between pig farms and human CDI cases in Sweden and investigate the diversity of RT046 in the pig population using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Methods WGS was performed on 47 C . difficile isolates from pigs (n = 22), the farm environment (n = 7) and human cases of CDI (n = 18). Two different core genome multilocus sequencing typing (cgMLST) schemes were used together with a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis and the results were related to time and location of isolation of the isolates. Results The pig isolates were closely related (≤6 cgMLST alleles differing in both cgMLST schemes) and conserved over time and were clearly separated from isolates from the human hospital outbreak (≥76 and ≥90 cgMLST alleles differing in the two cgMLST schemes). However, two human isolates were closely related to the pig isolates, suggesting possible transmission. The SNP analysis was not more discriminate than cgMLST. Conclusion No general pattern suggesting zoonotic transmission was apparent between pigs and humans, although contrasting results from two isolates still make transmission possible. Our results support the need for high resolution WGS typing when investigating hospital and environmental transmission of C . difficile ."
https://openalex.org/W3117249473,"Introduction People in Ethiopia, including pregnant women, highly consume both home-made and manufactured alcohol beverages due to lack of awareness about the harmful effect of risky alcohol use, and cultural acceptance of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption and other hazardous patterns of use like binge drinking have tremendous adverse effects on fetus and mothers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of alcohol consumption, binge drinking and its determinants among pregnant women residing in Kolfe sub-city, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among a total of 367 pregnant women. The participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression was conducted using SPSS version 20 software to identify determinants of alcohol consumption and binge drinking. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was used to declare a statistical significance in multiple logistic regression. The results were described using adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Results This study revealed that the prevalence of alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and weekly alcohol consumption of four or more units among pregnant women was 39.78%, 3.54% and 4.9%, respectively. Not having formal education [AOR 95% CI = 8.47 (2.42, 29.62), having primary education [AOR 95% CI = 4.26 (1.23, 14.74), being a housewife [AOR 95% CI = 4.18 (2.13, 8.22), having an unplanned pregnancy [AOR 95% CI = 2.47(1.33, 4.60), having a history of abortion [AOR 95% CI = 3.33 (1.33, 6.05)], not having awareness about the harmful effect of alcohol consumption [AOR 95% CI = 4.66 (2.53, 8.61)], and not having family social support [AOR 95% CI = 2(1.14,3.53) were determinants of alcohol consumption among pregnant women. Conclusions This study found a high level of alcohol consumption among pregnant women. Interventions to create awareness on the harmful effects of alcohol are needed. Moreover, strengthening social support during pregnancy and family planning services to reduce unplanned pregnancy and abortion should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3114440449,"First cases of COVID-19 were reported from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it progressed rapidly. On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC, then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic. COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020. A total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4 related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the cases, with the age group 31–45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95–98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%). Djibouti responded to COVID-19 pandemic following an efficient and effective strategy, using a strong collaboration between civilian and military health assets that increased the response capacities of the country. Partnership, coordination, solidarity, proactivity and commitment were the pillars to confront COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3114825667,"Background Government of India and the World Health Organization have guidelines for outpatient management of young infants 0–59 days with signs of Possible Serious Bacterial Infection (PSBI), when referral is not feasible. Implementation research was conducted to identify facilitators and barriers to operationalizing these guidelines. Methods Himachal Pradesh government implemented the guidelines in program settings supported by Centre for Health Research and Development, Society for Applied Studies. The strategy included community sensitization, skill enhancement of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Medical Officers (MOs) to identify PSBI and treat when referral was not feasible. The research team collected information on facilitators and barriers. A technical support unit provided training and oversight. Findings Among 1997 live births from June 2017 to January 2019, we identified 160 cases of PSBI in young infants resulting in a coverage of 80%, assuming an incidence of 10%. Of these,29(18.1%) had signs of critical illness (CI), 92 (57.5%) had clinical severe infection (CSI), 5 (3.1%)had severe pneumonia (only fast breathing in young infants 0–6 days), while 34 (21%) had pneumonia (only fast breathing in young infants 7–59 days). Hospital referral was accepted by 48/160 (30%), whereas 112/160 (70%) were treated with the simplified treatment regimens at primary level facilities. Of the 29 infants with CI, 18 (62%) accepted referral; 26 (90%) recovered while 3 (10%) who had accepted referral, died. Of the 92 infants who had CSI, 86 (93%) recovered, 65 (71%) received simplified treatment and one infant who had accepted referral, died. All the five infants who had severe pneumonia, recovered; 3 (60%) had received simplified treatment. Of the 34 pneumonia cases, 33 received simplified treatment of which 5 (15%) failed treatment; two out of these 5 died. Overall, 6/160 infants died (case-fatality-rate 3.4%); 2 in the simplified treatment (case-fatality-rate 1.8%) and 4 in the hospital group (case-fatality-rate 8.3%). Delayed identification and care-seeking by families and health system weaknesses like manpower gaps and interrupted supplies were challenges in implementation. Conclusions Implementation of the guidelines in program settings is possible and acceptable. Scaling up would require creating community awareness, early identification and appropriate care-seeking, strengthening ASHA home-visitation program, building skills and confidence of MOs and ANMs, uninterrupted supplies and a dependable referral system."
https://openalex.org/W3117142171,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged in December 2019. Convalescent plasma represents a promising COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report on the manufacturing of a plasma-based product containing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 obtained from recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma donors were screened as follows: 1) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by real-time PCR (RT-PCR)); 2) a subsequent negative PCR test followed by a 2-week waiting period; 3) an additional negative PCR test prior to plasmapheresis; and 4) confirmation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Convalescent plasma was stored fresh (2–6°C) for up to 5 days or frozen (-30°C) for long-term storage. Donor peripheral blood and final plasma product were assayed for binding antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and their titers measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We performed 72 plasmaphereses resulting in 248 final products. Convalescent plasma contained an RBD-specific antibody titer (IgG) ranging from 1:100 to 1:3200 (median 1:800). The titer was congruent to the titer of the blood (n = 34) before collection (1:100–1:6400, median 1:800). Levels of IL-8 and LBP of donors were slightly increased. Therapeutic products derived from a human origin must undergo rigorous testing to ensure uniform quality and patient safety. Whilst previous publications recommended RBD-specific binding antibody titers of ≥ 1:320, we selected a minimum titer of 1:800 in order to maximize antibody delivery. Production of highly standardized convalescent plasma was safe, feasible and was readily implemented in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3116049941,"Objective This study aimed to investigate the anxiety levels of healthcare workers and to provide guidance on potential accurate social and psychological interventions for healthcare workers during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China. Methods Healthcare workers from five hospitals in Zhejiang Province were randomly selected into this study. Zung Self-Assessment Scale for Anxiety (SAS) was used to evaluate the anxiety status of the included 1637 healthcare workers. Results The total anxiety score of healthcare workers in Zhejiang Province was 30.85 ± 6.89. The univariate analysis showed that the anxiety level of healthcare workers was related to gender, education, occupation, physical condition, job risk coefficient, and with family members on the first-line combating COVID-19 (P &lt;0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that physical condition and job risk coefficient were predictors of anxiety levels of healthcare workers. Conclusions During the epidemic of COVID-19, 1637 healthcare workers generally had an increased tendency to have anxiety. Individualized assessment of the anxiety level of healthcare workers should be provided, and different interventions should be given based on the evaluation results."
https://openalex.org/W3117230039,"RNA interference (RNAi) plays key roles in post-transcriptional and chromatin modification levels as well as regulates various eukaryotic gene expressions which are involved in stress responses, development and maintenance of genome integrity during developmental stages. The whole mechanism of RNAi pathway is directly involved with the gene-silencing process by the interaction of Dicer-Like ( DCL ), Argonaute ( AGO ) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR ) gene families and their regulatory elements. However, these RNAi gene families and their sub-cellular locations, functional pathways and regulatory components were not extensively investigated in the case of economically and nutritionally important fruit plant sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis L.). Therefore, in silico characterization, gene diversity and regulatory factor analysis of RNA silencing genes in C . sinensis were conducted by using the integrated bioinformatics approaches. Genome-wide comparison analysis based on phylogenetic tree approach detected 4 CsDCL , 8 CsAGO and 4 CsRDR as RNAi candidate genes in C . sinensis corresponding to the RNAi genes of model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . The domain and motif composition and gene structure analyses for all three gene families exhibited almost homogeneity within the same group members. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis clearly indicated that the predicted genes have direct involvement into the gene-silencing and other important pathways. The key regulatory transcription factors (TFs) MYB, Dof, ERF, NAC, MIKC_MADS, WRKY and bZIP were identified by their interaction network analysis with the predicted genes. The cis -acting regulatory elements associated with the predicted genes were detected as responsive to light, stress and hormone functions. Furthermore, the expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis showed that these RNAi candidate genes were highly expressed in fruit and leaves indicating their organ specific functions. Our genome-wide comparison and integrated bioinformatics analyses provided some necessary information about sweet orange RNA silencing components that would pave a ground for further investigation of functional mechanism of the predicted genes and their regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W3117575082,"Objective Mature hair follicles represent an important stage of hair follicle development, which determines the stability of hair follicle structure and its ability to enter the hair cycle. Here, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify hub genes of mature skin and hair follicles in Inner Mongolian cashmere goats. Methods We used transcriptome sequencing data for the skin of Inner Mongolian cashmere goats from fetal days 45–135 days, and divided the co expressed genes into different modules by WGCNA. Characteristic values were used to screen out modules that were highly expressed in mature skin follicles. Module hub genes were then selected based on the correlation coefficients between the gene and module eigenvalue, gene connectivity, and Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The results were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results Ten modules were successfully defined, of which one, with a total of 3166 genes, was selected as a specific module through sample and gene expression pattern analyses. A total of 584 candidate hub genes in the module were screened by the correlation coefficients between the genes and module eigenvalue and gene connectivity. Finally, GO/KEGG functional enrichment analyses detected WNT10A as a key gene in the development and maturation of skin hair follicles in fetal Inner Mongolian cashmere goats. qPCR showed that the expression trends of 13 genes from seven fetal skin samples were consistent with the sequencing results, indicating that the sequencing results were reliable.n"
https://openalex.org/W3113816942,"By assessing diversity variations of bacterial communities under different rhizocompartment types (i.e., roots, rhizosphere soil, root zone soil, and inter-shrub bulk soil), we explore the structural difference of bacterial communities in different root microenvironments under desert leguminous plant shrubs. Results will enable the influence of niche differentiation of plant roots and root soil on the structural stability of bacterial communities under three desert leguminous plant shrubs to be examined. High-throughput 16S rRNA genome sequencing was used to characterize diversity and structural differences of bacterial microbes in the rhizocompartments of three xeric leguminous plants. Results from this study confirm previous findings relating to niche differentiation in rhizocompartments under related shrubs, and they demonstrate that diversity and structural composition of bacterial communities have significant hierarchical differences across four rhizocompartment types under leguminous plant shrubs. Desert leguminous plants showed significant hierarchical filtration and enrichment of the specific bacterial microbiome across different rhizocompartments ( P &lt; 0.05). The dominant bacterial microbiome responsible for the differences in microbial community structure and composition across different niches of desert leguminous plants mainly consisted of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. All soil factors of rhizosphere and root zone soils, except for NO 3 — N and TP under C . microphylla and the two Hedysarum spp ., recorded significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, soil physicochemical factors have a significant impact on driving the differentiation of bacterial communities under desert leguminous plant shrubs. By investigating the influence of niches on the structural difference of soil bacterial communities with the differentiation of rhizocompartments under desert leguminous plant shrubs, we provide data support for the identification of dominant bacteria and future preparation of inocula, and provide a foundation for further study of the host plants-microbial interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3114660903,"Purpose To compare the variations in ocular torsion measurements made using different fundus photographic methods. Methods We enrolled subjects with three conditions: (1) patients with intermittent exotropia (IXT) ( n = 44), (2) patients with unilateral superior oblique palsy (SOP) ( n = 10), and (3) normal subjects as controls ( n = 85). Ocular torsion was measured by disc-center–fovea angle (DFA) using three different imaging modalities: (1) conventional fundus photography (CFP) with a 45° field of view (FV), (2) wide-field fundus photography (WFP) with a 200° FV, and (3) optical coherence tomography (OCT) with a 55° FV. Results In the IXT group, the DFAs in the right and left eyes were 5.70±3.35° and 6.37±3.36°, respectively, for CFP, 8.39±5.24° and 8.61±3.67° for WFP, and 5.73±3.61° for 6.16±3.50° for OCT. In the SOP group, the DFAs in paretic and nonparetic eyes were 12.19±1.69° and 6.71±1.09°, respectively, for CFP, 14.29±2.36° and 8.23±3.31° for WFP, and 12.12±1.73° and 6.91±1.12° for OCT. In the control group, the DFAs in the right and left eyes were 5.39±2.65° and 5.71±3.16°, respectively, for CFP, 8.77±5.56° and 8.90±6.24° for WFP, and 5.27±2.67° and 5.72±3.20° for OCT. There was no difference between the results from CFP and OCT among the three groups. However, the torsional angle was larger when measured using WFP than the other two photographic methods (CFP and OCT) in all three groups (all p &lt;0.05). Conclusion The ocular torsion measurement varies with the fundus photographic method used to measure it. Clinicians should be careful to avoid overestimating ocular extorsion when it is evaluated using WFP."

https://openalex.org/W3118085813,"Background The use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) as a birth control method is very common worldwide. OCPs have many other labeled non-contraceptive indications, and as a result there is an associated risk of improper use, as with any other medications. This study was designed to assess the unforeseen improper uses of OCPs observed by community pharmacists in Jordan. Method A cross-sectional study design was conducted using a self-administered survey. A convenience sample (n = 380) of Jordanian community pharmacists, were recruited through social media resources. The survey included multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses were completed using SPSS. Results More than half of the recruited pharmacists (55.3%) were female, and the mean age of the participants was 32.58 ± 9.94. The majority of the pharmacists (85%) had good knowledge about the non-contraceptive indications of OCPs. About 53% of them confirmed their exposure to cases of the improper use of OCPs. About 67.5% of the pharmacists who confirmed exposure to such cases, reported the topical use of OCPs for the enhancement of hair growth. Around 15% of those pharmacists stated that OCPs were used to give negative results for addictive drug screening tests. In the event that the pharmacists suspected improper use, more than 90% suggested they would refrain from dispensing the pills. Conclusion This study has spotlighted many unforeseen uses of OCPs in Jordan and highlighted the need for restricted national regulations on the monitoring of OCP prescription/selling patterns in Jordan by policymakers. Moreover, there is a need for the establishment of national educational programs for the Jordanian community regarding the safe proper use of OCPs."
https://openalex.org/W3113603783,"Fibrosis is a pathognomonic feature of structural heart disease and counteracted by distinct cardioprotective mechanisms, e.g. activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT pro-survival pathway. The Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase 7 (CRL7) was identified as negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signalling in skeletal muscle, but its role in the heart remains to be elucidated. Here, we sought to determine whether CRL7 modulates to cardiac fibrosis following pressure overload and dissect its underlying mechanisms. For inactivation of CRL7, the Cullin 7 (Cul7) gene was deleted in cardiac myocytes (CM) by injection of adeno-associated virus subtype 9 (AAV9) vectors encoding codon improved Cre-recombinase (AAV9-CMV-iCre) in Cul7 flox/flox mice. In addition, Myosin Heavy Chain 6 (Myh6; alpha-MHC)-MerCreMer transgenic mice with tamoxifen-induced CM-specific expression of iCre were used as alternate model. After transverse aortic constriction (TAC), causing chronic pressure overload and fibrosis, AAV9-CMV-iCre induced Cul7 -/- mice displayed a ~50% reduction of interstitial cardiac fibrosis when compared to Cul7 +/+ animals (6.7% vs. 3.4%, p&lt;0.01). Similar results were obtained with Cul7 flox/flox Myh6-Mer-Cre-Mer Tg(1/0) mice which displayed a ~30% reduction of cardiac fibrosis after TAC when compared to Cul7 +/+ Myh6-Mer-Cre-Mer Tg(1/0) controls after TAC surgery (12.4% vs. 8.7%, p&lt;0.05). No hemodynamic alterations were observed. AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was increased 3-fold (p&lt;0.01) in Cul7 -/- vs. control mice, together with a ~78% (p&lt;0.001) reduction of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells three weeks after TAC. In addition, CM-specific expression of a dominant-negative CUL7 1152stop mutant resulted in a 16.3-fold decrease (p&lt;0.001) of in situ end-labelling (ISEL) positive apoptotic cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CM-specific ablation of Cul7 restrains myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis upon pressure overload, and introduce CRL7 as a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapeutic strategies of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W3115616719,"The visual exploration and analysis of biomolecular networks is of paramount importance for identifying hidden and complex interaction patterns among proteins. Although many tools have been proposed for this task, they are mainly focused on the query and visualization of a single protein with its neighborhood. The global exploration of the entire network and the interpretation of its underlying structure still remains difficult, mainly due to the excessively large size of the biomolecular networks. In this paper we propose a novel multi-resolution representation and exploration approach that exploits hierarchical community detection algorithms for the identification of communities occurring in biomolecular networks. The proposed graphical rendering combines two types of nodes (protein and communities) and three types of edges (protein-protein, community-community, protein-community), and displays communities at different resolutions, allowing the user to interactively zoom in and out from different levels of the hierarchy. Links among communities are shown in terms of relationships and functional correlations among the biomolecules they contain. This form of navigation can be also combined by the user with a vertex centric visualization for identifying the communities holding a target biomolecule. Since communities gather limited-size groups of correlated proteins, the visualization and exploration of complex and large networks becomes feasible on off-the-shelf computer machines. The proposed graphical exploration strategies have been implemented and integrated in UNIPred-Web, a web application that we recently introduced for combining the UNIPred algorithm, able to address both integration and protein function prediction in an imbalance-aware fashion, with an easy to use vertex-centric exploration of the integrated network. The tool has been deeply amended from different standpoints, including the prediction core algorithm. Several tests on networks of different size and connectivity have been conducted to show off the vast potential of our methodology; moreover, enrichment analyses have been performed to assess the biological meaningfulness of detected communities. Finally, a CoV-human network has been embedded in the system, and a corresponding case study presented, including the visualization and the prediction of human host proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3115971468,"Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disorder of unknown etiology in which immune-mediated liver injury progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to determine whether circulating soluble TIM3 (sTIM3) is elevated in patients with AIH patients and whether sTIM-3 levels are associated with clinical parameters of AIH. Methods We enrolled 123 Japanese patients with AIH who were identified from the National Hospital Organization–AIH-liver–network database, as well as 32 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 30 patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and healthy control subjects. Serum sTIM-3 concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Results Serum levels of sTIM-3 were significantly higher in AIH patients (median 4865 pg/ml; [interquartile range (IQR); 3122–7471]) compared to those in CHC (1026 pg/ml [IQR: 806–1283] p &lt;0.001), PBC (2395 pg/ml [IQR: 2012–3422] p &lt;0.001) or healthy controls (1285 pg/ml [IQR: 1098–1812] p &lt;0.001). In AIH group, serum sTIM-3 were correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin (TB) and negatively correlated with serum levels of albumin (Alb). Serum levels of sTIM-3 were also strongly correlated with Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) levels, but did not correlate with the histological grade of liver fibrosis. Steroid treatment of AIH patients significantly reduced serum sTIM-3 levels (2147±623pg/ml versus 1321±378pg/ml, p &lt;0.001). Conclusions Circulating sTIM-3 levels were elevated in AIH patients and are associated with AIH disease activity and AIH-related liver damage. These findings indicate that serum sTIM-3 correlated with disease status of AIH and could be useful biomarkers to detect autoimmune-mediated liver injury. Our data suggest a possible link between the TIM-3/GAL-9 pathway and AIH severity or phenotype, and further investigations of the TIM-3 pathway and AIH pathophysiology is warranted."

In this study, a time-series analysis was conducted of trends in life expectancy from 2003 to 2018, and causes of death were analyzed using the Kannisto-Thatcher method and the Arriaga decomposition method. The time trend analysis of yearly life expectancy changes indicated that, in Korea, there was a tendency for the yearly increase in life expectancy between 2003 and 2018 to decrease by 0.0211 years per calendar year. The contribution of cardiovascular diseases, the most important contributor to the life expectancy increase in Korea, gradually decreased over this period. The contribution of cardiovascular diseases to the life expectancy increase was 0.506 years in 2003–2006, but this contribution decreased to 0.218 years in 2015–2018. The positive contributions of ill-defined causes and external causes to life expectancy increase detected in previous periods were not evident in 2015–2018. Diseases of the respiratory system made the largest negative contribution both between 2015 and 2018 and between 2017–2018. The life expectancy stagnation in 2018 could be understood as the combined effect of (a) decreasing momentum in the increase of life expectancy and (b) a chance event in 2018 involving life expectancy. Currently, it is difficult to judge whether the stagnation of life expectancy in 2018 is temporary, and further analyses of life expectancy and contributing causes of death in the future are needed."

Existing assessments of self-agency, many of which focus on agency of movement, can be prohibitively time-consuming and often yield ambiguous results. Here, we introduce a short online motion tracking task that quantifies movement agency through both first-order perceptual and second-order metacognitive judgments. The task assesses the degree to which a participant can distinguish between a motion stimulus whose trajectory is influenced by the participant’s cursor movements and a motion stimulus whose trajectory is random. We demonstrate the task’s reliability in healthy participants and discuss how its efficiency, reliability, and ease of online implementation make it a promising new tool for both diagnosing and understanding disorders of agency."
https://openalex.org/W3117302149,"In apartment houses, noise between floors can disturb pleasant living environments and cause disputes between neighbors. As a means of resolving disputes caused by inter-floor noise, noises are recorded for 24 hours in a household to verify whether the inter-floor noise exceeded the legal standards. If the noise exceeds the legal standards, the recorded sound is listened to, and it is checked whether the noise comes from neighboring households. When done manually, this process requires time and is costly, and there is a problem of whether the listener’s judgments of the sound source are consistent. This study aims to classify inter-floor noise according to noise sources by using a convolutional neural network model. A total of 1,515 sound sources of data recorded for 24 h from three households were annotated, and 40 4s audio clips of six noise sources, including “Footsteps,” “Dragging furniture,” “Hammering,” “Instant impact (dropping a heavy item),” “Vacuum cleaner,” and “Public announcement system” were identified. Moreover, datasets of 16 classes using ESC50’s urban sound category audio were used to distinguish the inter-floor noise heard indoors from the external noise. Although DenseNet, ResNet, Inception, and EfficientNet are models that use images as their domains, they showed an accuracy of 91.43–95.27% when classifying the inter-floor noise dataset. Among the reviewed models, ResNet showed an accuracy of 95.27±2.30% as well as a highest performance level in the F1 score, precision, and recall metrics. Additionally, ResNet showed the shortest inference time. This paper concludes by suggesting that the present findings can be extended in future research for monitoring acoustic elements of indoor soundscape."
https://openalex.org/W3113753578,"Potentiodynamically fabricated poly(alizarin red s) modified GCE was characterized using CV and EIS techniques. In contrast to the cyclic voltammetric response of the unmodified GCE for metronidazole, an irreversible reduction peak with three-folds of current enhancement and reduced overpotential at the poly(alizarin red s) modified GCE showed the catalytic effect of the modifier towards reduction of metronidazole. While observed peak potential shift with increasing pH (4.0–10.0) indicated the involvement of protons during the reduction of metronidazole, peak potential shift with scan rate (20–300 mV s -1 ) confirmed the irreversibility of the reduction reaction of metronidazole at the modified GCE. A better correlation for the dependence of peak current on scan rate (r 2 = 0.9883) than on square root of scan rate (r 2 = 0.9740) supplemented by slope value of 0.38 for plot of log(current) versus log(scan rate) indicated the reduction reaction of metronidazole at the surface of the modified electrode was predominantly adsorption controlled. Under the optimized method and solution parameters, reductive current response of tablet sample showed linear dependence on spiked standard concentration in a wide range (0–125 μM) with excellent determination coefficient r 2 , LoD and LoQ of 0.9991, 0.38, and 1.25 μM, respectively. Spike recovery of 97.9% and interference recovery of 96.2–97.5% in the presence of 21.28 and 31.92 μM of uric acid and ascorbic acid validated the applicability of the present method for determination of metronidazole in tablet formulation. The metronidazole content of the tested tablet formulation using standard addition method was found to be 97.6% of what is claimed by the tablet manufacturer making the developed method an excellent potential candidate for its applicability to determine metronidazole in real samples with complex matrix."
https://openalex.org/W3113946680,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin as adjunctive antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing non-elective cesarean delivery in comparison with no macrolides, to adapt to azithromycin shortages in COVID-19 pandemic. Study design We conducted a multi-center, prospective observational cohort study from March 23, 2020 through June 1, 2020. We followed all women receiving either clarithromycin or no macrolide antibiotic for adjunct surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries. The primary outcome was development of postpartum endometritis. Secondary outcomes included meconium-stained amniotic fluid at time of cesarean delivery, neonatal sepsis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients in this study were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted negative. Results This study included 240 patients, with 133 patients receiving clarithromycin and 107 patients receiving no adjunct macrolide prophylaxis. Patients receiving clarithromycin were noted to have significantly lower rates of postpartum endometritis as compared to those who did not receive adjunct prophylaxis (4.5% versus 11.2%, p = 0.025). In crude (unadjusted) analysis, a significantly lower risk of developing endometritis was noted in the clarithromycin group as compared to the control group (66% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.95, p = 0.040). When adjusted for perceived confounders, a significant difference was again noted (67% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97, p = 0.034). Stratified analysis of significantly different demographic factors including Black race, BMI, and age was performed. A significantly decreased risk of development of endometritis when taking clarithromycin versus no adjunct macrolide was noted for Black race women in crude and adjusted models (crude: 87% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83, p = 0.032; adjusted: 91% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79, p = 0.026). This was also noted for women aged 18–29 years in crude and adjusted models (crude: model, 79% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.014; adjusted model: 75% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.94, p = 0.028). All other stratified analyses did not yield significant differences in endometritis risk. Conclusion Our study suggests that administration of clarithromycin for adjunctive surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries may be a safe option that may provide suitable endometritis prophylaxis in cases where azithromycin is unavailable, as was the case during the start of COVID-19 pandemic, most especially for Black race women and women ages 18–29 years."
https://openalex.org/W3113986234,"Methionine (Met) is an essential precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor required for biological processes such as DNA and histone methylation, which alter gene expression. In dairy cows, dietary Met has been observed to exert transcriptional alterations with beneficial effects on milk biosynthesis; however, the extent of these effects via SAM remains unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of Met supply on histone methylation in lysine residues K9 and K27 in the histone tail H3 via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system in immortalized bovine mammary alveolar epithelial cells (MACT) incubated varying concentration of Met. The histone methylation data was complemented with global DNA methylation, cellular protein synthesis, and RT-qPCR analysis of genes related to Met cycle, DNA and histone methylation, AA transporters, and protein synthesis. The histone methylation data was performed on MACT cells seeded at 30,000 cells/well in 96-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. The transfections of FRET gene reporter plasmids H3K9 and H3K27 was performed with 0.3 μL/well of Lipofectamine® 3000 and 50 ng of plasmid DNA per well. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 0, 125, 250, and 500 μM of Met, and quantification of histone methylation was performed at 0, 12, and 24 h post-treatment as well as cell viability at 24 h using CellProfiler software. An inverted microscope for live imagining (EVOS ® FL Auto) equipped with a motorized scanning stage, and an environment-controlled chamber at 37˚C and 5.0% of CO 2 was used to take 4 pictures/well at 4x magnification. A more defined response on histone methylation was observed in H3K9 than H3K27 to Met supply, where maximal histone methylation in H3K9 was observed with 125 μM of Met. This greater histone methylation in H3K9 at 125 μM was accompanied by greater cellular protein concentration. The linear increase in Met supply causes a linear decrease in global DNA methylation, while linearly upregulating genes related to the Met cycle (i.e., MAT1A , PEMT , SAHH , and MTR ). The histone methylation data suggest that, to some extent, methyl-donors such as Met may affect the methylation sites, H3K9 and H3K27, and consequently causing a different epigenetic alteration. In the context of the dairy cow, further refinement to this FRET assay to study histone methylation could lead to establishing novel potential mechanisms of how dietary methyl donors may control the structural conformation of the bovine genome and, by extension, gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3114104858,"Spelling is a literacy skill that must be mastered during children’s academic development. It involves a variety of cognitive factors, including morphological awareness. Studies in the alphabet and Chinese systems have shown that there is a close relationship between morphological awareness and spelling. Although there is clearly a significant unidirectional effect of morphological awareness on spelling significantly, few studies have explored the bidirectional relationship between morphological awareness and spelling. This three-time point longitudinal study was designed to investigate the reciprocal effects of morphological awareness and character spelling in Chinese. Participants included 124 children from two primary schools in Mainland China. The students were tracked from first grade to third grade and were administered a battery of tests to measure morphological awareness (e.g., homophone awareness, homograph awareness, and compounding awareness) and spelling to dictation, controlling for IQ, phonological awareness, and orthographic awareness. A structural equation model was utilized to examine the reciprocal relation between the students’ morphological awareness and character spelling. Results showed that earlier morphological awareness predicted subsequent spelling abilities from first grade to third grade and spelling in first grade predicted morphological awareness in second grade; however, spelling in second grade did not predict the subsequent morphological awareness in third grade. This study suggests that there is a bidirectional association between morphological awareness and spelling from first grade to second grade in Chinese, and a unidirectional association between morphological awareness and spelling from second grade to third grade. Future studies could examine the causal relationship between morphological awareness and character spelling by using an instructional intervention."

Data were extracted from electronic patient files of the Brazilian public oral health services. The sample comprised 2,405 class I and II restorations performed 4 to 24 years ago (mean, 8.9 years) in 351 patients (6.8 teeth/patient) across 12 public health units located in different city regions (42 professionals—55 restorations). The restoration was considered successful if it had not been repaired or replaced at the time of evaluation; failure was defined as replacement of the restoration, the need for endodontic treatment, tooth/restoration fracture or tooth extraction. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier test for restoration survival and Cox regression to evaluate the factors associated with failure. The majority of the restorations involved the use of amalgam (85%), involved a single face (70%), and were without pulp/dentin capping (85%). The overall survival rate was 95%, and the mean observation time was 8.9 years. The restoration survival was 79% (95% CI: 60.6–89.5) over 24 years, and the mean survival time was 22.2 years (95% CI: 21.9–22.6 years). The annual failure rate up to 24 years was 0.9%. After the adjustment, only the number of restored faces and the geographic location where the restoration was performed remained associated with failure of the restoration. The direct posterior restorations performed at the evaluated public health service units presented high survival rates. The restorations of people with lower access to POHS had lower survival rates. Class I restorations presented higher survival rates than class II restorations with two or more faces, regardless of the restorative material used."

Drug effects on [Ca 2+ ] i were studied by the fura-2 fluorescence ratio technique. Terbutaline (100 nmol-100 M), forskolin (30 nM-100 M) or 8-Br-cAMP (100 nM– 10 μM), administered in the arterial perfusate produced significant reductions in AHF. The AH reducing effect of terbutaline was blocked by a selective inhibitor of protein kinase A (KT-5720). ATP (100 M) caused a rapid, transient (peak) increase in [Ca 2+ ] i followed by a sustained plateau phase lasting more than 5 minutes. Preincubation of the cells (6 min) with terbutaline, forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP significantly reduced the peak calcium response to ATP. The sustained plateau phase of the response, on the other hand, was augmented by each of the agents. KT-5720 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of terbutaline on the peak and totally inhibited its effect on the plateau phase. These data indicate: (a) that AHF in the bovine eye can be manipulated through cyclic AMP, operating via protein kinase A, (b) that protein kinase A can affect [Ca 2+ ] i homeostasis, (c) that calcium release from the intracellular store, not the entry, affects AHF, and (d) that interaction of [Ca 2+ ] i with cAMP plays a role in modulating AH secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3115132610,"Three studies (total N = 1486) investigated how inferences about a person’s current moral character guide forecasts about that person’s future moral character and future misfortunes, and tested several plausible moderating variables. Inferences about current moral character related (very strongly) to forecasts about future moral character and also (less strongly) to forecasts about future misfortunes. These relationships were moderated by two variables: Relations between inferences and forecasts were somewhat weaker when perceivers made judgments about children, compared to judgments about adults, and relations between character inferences and forecasts about misfortunes were somewhat stronger among perceivers who more strongly believed in karma. In contrast, results provided no evidence of any moderating effects due to perceivers’ beliefs about the stability of moral dispositions (i.e., implicit personality theories). These results show how dispositional inferences, moral judgments, and beliefs about karmic justice interact to shape forecasts about the future."
https://openalex.org/W3117817713,"Background Research on how services can be adapted to meet the needs of people with dementia with an immigrant or minority ethnic background is scarce. Several approaches have been discussed: offering services adapted to language and culture, adding bilingual staff to mainstream services, and providing cultural awareness and sensitivity training to health personnel in mainstream services. This study seeks to develop more knowledge of challenges and possible adjustments related to receive and provide public care for people living with dementia with an immigrant or minority ethnic background. Methods and materials Through a qualitative design, including 19 single interviews, 3 dyad interviews and 16 focus groups with older immigrants, relatives of immigrants with dementia, and health personnel, we explored experiences and perceptions related to receive and provide care for people with immigrant backgrounds living with dementia in Norway. The analysis were conducted inspired by Kvale and Brinkmann’s three contexts of interpretations. Results Challenges related to language and communication were emphasized as the most fundamental barrier to provide adjusted care; exemplified through cases of isolation and agitation among patients not able to communicate. Care services framed by the majority culture creates feelings of alienation and exclusion. Not having access to specific types of food and the possibility to listen to songs, music, literature or TV programs representing a familiar and homely context may prevent use of public dementia care. Findings also point to differences in moral views regarding life-prolonging treatment in advanced stages of dementia. Conclusion This study argues that to be able to address challenges related to migration-driven diversity one needs holistic care services that addresses individual as well as socio-cultural needs. A linguistically and culturally diverse workforce may represent an important resource, potentially reducing some of the problems related to communication. On a structural level, it seems necessary to allocate more time and resources, including the use of interpreters, when assessing and getting to know persons with dementia with another linguistic and cultural background. However, shared language does not guarantee understanding. Rather, one needs to become familiar with each person’s way of being ill, on a cultural and individual level, including changes occurring living with progressive dementia. Getting to know a person and his/her family will also facilitate the possibility to ensure a more familiar and homely context. Thus, continuity in relation to language and culture is important, but continuity in relations may be equally important ensuring that people with dementia receive equitable care."
https://openalex.org/W3114379499,"Changes in intracellular calcium levels in the sinus node modulate cardiac pacemaking (the calcium clock). Trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels are counterion channels on the surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and compensate for calcium release from ryanodine receptors, which play a major role in calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and the calcium clock. TRIC channels are expected to affect the calcium clock in the sinus node. However, their physiological importance in cardiac rhythm formation remains unclear. We evaluated the importance of TRIC channels on cardiac pacemaking using TRIC-A-null (TRIC-A –/– ) as well as TRIC-B +/– mice. Although systolic blood pressure (SBP) was not significantly different between wild-type (WT), TRIC-B +/– , and TRIC-A –/– mice, heart rate (HR) was significantly lower in TRIC-A –/– mice than other lines. Interestingly, HR and SBP showed a positive correlation in WT and TRIC-B +/– mice, while no such correlation was observed in TRIC-A –/– mice, suggesting modification of the blood pressure regulatory system in these mice. Isoproterenol (0.3 mg/kg) increased the HR in WT mice (98.8 ± 15.1 bpm), whereas a decreased response in HR was observed in TRIC-A –/– mice (23.8 ± 5.8 bpm), suggesting decreased sympathetic responses in TRIC-A –/– mice. Electrocardiography revealed unstable R-R intervals in TRIC-A –/– mice. Furthermore, TRIC-A –/– mice sometimes showed sinus pauses, suggesting a significant role of TRIC-A channels in cardiac pacemaking. In isolated atrium contraction or action potential recording, TRIC-A –/– mice showed decreased response to a β-adrenergic sympathetic nerve agonist (isoproterenol, 100 nM), indicating decreased sympathetic responses. In summary, TRIC-A –/– mice showed decreased cardiac pacemaking in the sinus node and attenuated responses to β-adrenergic stimulation, indicating the involvement of TRIC-A channels in cardiac rhythm formation and decreased sympathetic responses."
https://openalex.org/W3115063219,"Military literature has demonstrated the utility and safety of tourniquets in preventing mortality for some time, paving the way for increased use of tourniquets in civilian settings, including perioperatively to provide a bloodless surgical field. However, tourniquet use is not without risk and the subsequent effects of tissue ischemia can impede downstream rehabilitative efforts to regenerate and salvage nerve, muscle, tissue and bone in the limb. Limb ischemia studies in both the mouse and pig models have indicated not only that there is residual flow past the tourniquet by means of microcirculation, but also that recovery from tissue ischemia is dependent upon this microcirculation. Here we expand upon these previous studies using portable Near-Infrared Imaging to quantify residual plasma flow distal to the tourniquet in mice, pigs, and humans and leverage this flow to show that plasma can be supersaturated with oxygen to reduce intracellular hypoxia and promote tissue salvage following tourniquet placement. Our findings provide a mechanism of delivery for the application of oxygen, tissue preservation solutions, and anti-microbial agents prior to tourniquet release to improve postoperative recovery. In the current environment of increased tourniquet use, techniques which promote distal tissue preservation and limb salvage rates are crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3116013589,"The migration of populations from rural to urban areas is a typical phenomenon of urbanization in developing countries. Based on Lacanian psychoanalysis theory, this study analyzes the decision-making mechanism of the willingness of rural populations settling in cities (RPSC), and analyzes the key factors that affect the willingness of RPSC by using the binary Logit regression method based on survey data in Changyi, China. The results show that the willingness of RPSC is a realistic choice under the joint action of the ‘mirrored’ incarnation and the ‘non-mirrored’ order. Among the factors, ‘age’, ‘ethnic groups’, ‘educational attainment’, and ‘social intercourse’, representing the ‘mirrored’ incarnation, and ‘communities’ safety gap’, ‘healthcare services policy’, ‘public housing policy’ and ‘employment insurance gap’, representing the ‘non-mirrored’ order, are significant in affecting the willingness of RPSC. These findings validate the adaptability of psychoanalysis to analyze the willingness of RPSC, and increases the understanding of individual willingness and behavioral choice in the context of a specific social background, which can provide decision-making reference for urban and rural planning and public policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W3116453528,"Background This study assessed the association between heart failure (HF) medication (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers (BB), mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRA) and diuretics) and HF readmissions in a real-world unselected group of patients after a first hospital admission for HF. Furthermore we analysed readmission rates for ACEI versus ARB and for carvedilol versus β1-selective BB and we investigated the effect of HF medication in relation to time since discharge. Methods and findings Medication at discharge was determined with dispensing data from the Dutch PHARMO Database Network including 22,476 patients with HF between 2001 and 2015. After adjustment for age, gender, number of medications and year of admission no associations were found for users versus non-users of ACEI/ARB (hazard ratio, HR = 1.01; 95%CI 0.96–1.06), BB (HR = 1.00; 95%CI 0.95–1.05) and readmissions. The risk of readmission for patients prescribed MRA (HR = 1.11; 95%CI 1.05–1.16) or diuretics (HR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.09–1.25) was higher than for non-users. The HR for ARB relative to ACEI was 1.04 (95%CI 0.97–1.12) and for carvedilol relative to β1-selective BB 1.33 (95%CI 1.20–1.46). Post-hoc analyses showed a protective effect shortly after discharge for most medications. For example one month post discharge the HR for ACEI/ARB was 0.77 (95%CI 0.69–0.86). Although we did try to adjust for confounding by indication, probably residual confounding is still present. Conclusions Patients who were prescribed carvedilol have a higher or at least a similar risk of HF readmission compared to β1-selective BB. This study showed that all groups of HF medication -some more pronounced than others- were more effective immediately following discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3113460329,"We test common sense psychology of intragroup relations whereby people assume that intragroup respect and ingroup prototypicality are positively related. In Study 1a, participants rated a group member as more prototypical if they learned that group member was highly respected rather than disrespected. In Study 1b, participants rated a group member as more respected by other group members if they learned that group member was prototypical rather than unprototypical. As a commonsense psychology of groups , we reasoned that the perceived relationship between prototypicality and intragroup respect would be stronger for cohesive groups compared to incohesive groups. The effect of intragroup respect on perceptions of prototypicality (Study 2a &amp; 2c) and the effect of prototypicality on perceptions of intragroup respect (Study 2b) were generally stronger for participants considering cohesive groups relative to incohesive groups. However, the interaction effect of prototypicality and group cohesion on intragroup respect did fail to replicate in Study 2d. In Studies 3, 4a, and 4b we manipulated the relationship between prototypicality and intragroup respect and found that when these variables were in perceptual harmony participants perceived groups as more cohesive. The results of eight out of nine studies conducted are consistent with the prediction that people make inferences about intragroup respect, prototypicality, and group cohesion in a manner that maintains perceptual harmony."
https://openalex.org/W3114553277,"Children with severe motor and intellectual disabilities experience chronic pain but cannot communicate verbally. However, no Japanese tool currently exists for assessing pain in this population. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the reliability and validity of a Japanese version of the Paediatric Pain Profile, which is a behavioral rating scale to assess pain in children with severe neurological disabilities. The sample comprised 30 children with severe motor and intellectual disabilities at three hospitals in Japan. Three specialist nurses rated low and high pain video scenes of the children (twice at 1-week intervals) using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability behavioral scale and a translated Japanese version of the Paediatric Pain Profile. On the basis of their ratings, we calculated the internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and intra- and inter-observer reliabilities of the Paediatric Pain Profile. Additionally, we assessed concurrent validity using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability behavioral scale and construct validity using low versus high pain scenes. Both internal consistency (low pain: alpha = 0.735; high pain: alpha = 0.928) and test–retest reliability ( r = 0.846) of the Japanese version of the Paediatric Pain Profile were good. Intra-observer reliability was substantial ( r = 0.748), whereas inter-observer reliability was only moderate ( r = 0.529). However, the concurrent validity with Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scores was good ( r = 0.629) and construct validity was confirmed ( p &lt; 0.001). We confirmed the validity of the Japanese version of the Paediatric Pain Profile, but reliable pain assessment may require repeated ratings by the same person. To accurately assess pain in children with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, healthcare staff must be properly trained and become more skilled in using the Japanese version of the Paediatric Pain Profile."
https://openalex.org/W3115403896,"Bloom-forming cyanobacteria dramatically influence nutrient cycling in eutrophic freshwater lakes. The phosphorus (P) assimilation and release of bloom-forming cyanobacteria significantly may also affect the phosphorus source and amounts in water. To understand the phosphorus release process of bloom-forming cyanobacteria below the accumulated surface and sedimentary bloom-forming cyanobacteria, the degradation of bloom-forming cyanobacteria dominated by Microcystis spp. at different cell density in the dark was investigated over a 25-day microcosm experiment. The dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) contents increased with the increment of cyanobacterial density, and the dark status markedly increased the proportion of DIP in water during the decline period of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Meanwhile, the process of cyanobacterial apoptosis accompanied by the changes of malondialdehyde (MDA) and phosphatase (AKP) contents, and the increases of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities of cyanobacteria in the dark, especially in low-density groups (5.23×10 8 cells L -1 ), which further affect the physicochemical water parameters. Moreover, the DIP release from high-density cyanobacteria (7.86×10 7 cells L -1 ~5.23×10 8 cells L -1 ) resulted from the relative abundance of organophosphorus degrading bacteria in the dark. Therefore, the fast decay of cyanobacteria in the dark could accelerate DIP release, the high DIP release amount from accumulated bloom-cyanobacteria provide adequate P quickly for the sustained growth of cyanobacteria."

In two independent studies, we performed a factorial analysis of correspondence of the words provided by the participants as well as a similitude analysis. The results indicated that “fair price” was mainly associated with time, effort and experience level of photographers. Both French- and English-speaking samples made similar associations around the concept of fair price but the order of importance varied. We observed some gender-related differences in both samples, although the relative number of male and female participants must be taken into consideration."
