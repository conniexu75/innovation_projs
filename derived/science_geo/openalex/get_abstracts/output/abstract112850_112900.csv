https://openalex.org/W2037915962,"Exposure of mammalian cells to radiation triggers the ultraviolet (UV) response, which includes activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). This was postulated to occur by induction of a nuclear signaling cascade by damaged DNA. Recently, induction of AP-1 by UV was shown to be mediated by a pathway involving Src tyrosine kinases and the Ha-Ras small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, proteins located at the plasma membrane. It is demonstrated here that the same pathway mediates induction of NF-kappa B by UV. Because inactive NF-kappa B is stored in the cytosol, analysis of its activation directly tests the involvement of a nuclear-initiated signaling cascade. Enucleated cells are fully responsive to UV both in NF-kappa B induction and in activation of another key signaling event. Therefore, the UV response does not require a signal generated in the nucleus and is likely to be initiated at or near the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2095278911,"The availability of p53 knockout mice generated by gene targeting has enabled us to investigate the functional role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in initiation, promotion, and progression of carcinogenesis in vivo, using mouse skin as a model system. The number, size, and growth rate of benign papillomas were not increased in the p53 heterozygous mice in comparison with wild type. The p53 null mice showed a reduced yield of papillomas, but these underwent much more rapid malignant progression, with some poorly differentiated carcinomas developing after only 10 weeks of promotion. Progression rate was also greater in heterozygous than in wild-type mice and was associated with loss of the remaining wild-type allele. Most tumors from all groups had activating mutations in the H-ras gene. Absence of p53, therefore, does not augment the frequency of initiation or the rate of promotion but greatly enhances malignant progression."

https://openalex.org/W2075165827,"The high mobility group protein HMG I(Y) and the transcription factor NF-kappa B are required for the activity of positive regulatory domain II (PRDII), a virus-inducible regulatory element of the human interferon-beta gene promoter. In this paper we provide evidence that HMG I(Y) is also required for the activity of PRDIV, a regulatory element that synergizes with PRDII. In this case, HMG I(Y) stimulates binding of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and the assembly of inducible complexes containing ATF-2 and c-Jun. Remarkably, HMG I(Y) also specifically interacts with the leucine zipper/basic region of ATF-2, and ATF-2 in turn interacts with NF-kappa B. We therefore propose that the HMG I(Y) plays a critical structural role in establishing transcriptional synergy between PRDII and PRDIV by promoting the activities and/or binding of NF-kappa B and ATF-2 and by facilitating their interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1973724691,"Recent progress in regioselective and enantioselective epoxidations catalyzed by metalloporphyrins is discussed here, with an explanation of the biomimetic antecedents of this area and its relevance to synthetic applications. Classification of the catalysts that have been studied allows useful conclusions to be drawn about the development of this field. In particular, both the most promising biomimetic and practical catalysts have arisen from systems that can be systematically modified by convenient synthetic methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2008532096,"Although several interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell lines proliferate in response to IL-4 or insulin, the 32D line does not. Insulin and IL-4 sensitivity was restored to 32D cells by expression of IRS-1, the principal substrate of the insulin receptor. Although 32D cells possessed receptors for both factors, they lacked the IRS-1--related protein, 4PS, which becomes phosphorylated by tyrosine in insulin- or IL-4--responsive lines after stimulation. These results indicate that factors that bind unrelated receptors can use similar mitogenic signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells and that 4PS and IRS-1 are functionally similar proteins that are essential for insulin- and IL-4--induced proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2063374921,"The bcl-2 proto-oncogene can prevent the death of many cell types. Mice were generated that were chimeric for the homozygous inactivation of bcl-2. Lymphocytes without Bcl-2 differentiated into phenotypically mature cells. However, in vitro, the mature T cells that lacked Bcl-2 had shorter life-spans and increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids and gamma-irradiation. In contrast, stimulation of CD3 inhibited the death of these cells. T and B cells with no Bcl-2 disappeared from the bone marrow, thymus, and periphery by 4 weeks of age. Thus, Bcl-2 was dispensable for lymphocyte maturation, but was required for a stable immune system after birth."
https://openalex.org/W2094923559,"In budding yeast genes that encode G1 cyclins and proteins involved in DNA synthesis are transcriptionally activated in late G1. A transcription factor, called SBF, is composed of Swi4 and Swi6 proteins and activates transcription of G1 cyclin genes. A different, but related, complex called MBF binds to MCB elements (Mlu I cell cycle box) found in the promoter of most DNA synthesis genes. MBF contains Swi6 and a 120-kilodalton protein (p120). MBF was purified and the gene encoding p120 (termed MBP1) was cloned. A deletion of MBP1 was not lethal but led to deregulated expression of DNA synthesis genes, indicating a direct regulatory role for MBF in MCB-driven transcription. Mbp1 is related to Swi4. Strains deleted for both MBP1 and SWI4 were inviable, demonstrating that transcriptional activation by MBF and SBF has an important role in the transition from G1 to S phase."

This widespread infection depends on the organism's ability to escape host defenses by gaining entry and surviving inside the macrophage. DNA sequences of M. tuberculosis have been cloned; these confer on a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain an ability to invade HeLa cells, augment macrophage phagocytosis, and survive for at least 24 hours inside the human macrophage. This capacity to gain entry into mammalian cells and survive inside the macrophage was localized to two distinct loci on the cloned M. tuberculosis DNA fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1587792888,"A proximal and critical biochemical event upon T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation is the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) pathway. ZAP-70, a PTK of the p72syk family, associates with phosphorylated TCR subunits upon TCR stimulation. Here we report that the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70, expressed as a fusion protein, bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3 epsilon and TCR zeta from activated Jurkat T cell lysates. The single N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of ZAP-70, expressed separately, do not bind these TCR subunits. In comparison to fusion proteins containing SH2 domains from other proteins, the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 demonstrate a remarkably restricted repertoire of protein binding, binding only TCR zeta and CD3 epsilon. ZAP-70 is also recovered in the binding assay, but this is likely to be a consequence of its interaction with multiple SH2 binding sites on the zeta-zeta and CD3 epsilon-containing dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2080796174,Expression of either the CD4 or CD8 glycoproteins discriminates two functionally distinct lineages of T lymphocytes. A null mutation in the gene encoding CD4 impairs the development of the helper cell lineage that is normally defined by CD4 expression. Infection of CD4-null mice with Leishmania has revealed a population of functional helper T cells that develops despite the absence of CD4. These CD8- alpha beta T cell receptor+ T cells are major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted and produce interferon-gamma when challenged with parasite antigens. These results indicate that T lymphocyte lineage commitment and peripheral function need not depend on the function of CD4.
https://openalex.org/W2098101908,"Telomeres, the ends of linear chromosomes, typically consist of tandem repeats of simple G-rich sequences. At high concentrations, single-stranded telomeric DNA can form dimers and tetramers involving G-quartets. We show that under physiological conditions, the beta subunit of the Oxytricha telomere-binding protein greatly accelerates G-quartet formation. The reaction occurs with oligonucleotides ending in the Oxytricha (T4G4T4G4) and Tetrahymena (T2G4T2G4) telomeric sequences; the sequence preceding these telomeric repeats can be nontelomeric, single-, or double-stranded. Protein deletion analysis indicates that the carboxy-terminal highly basic domain of the beta subunit, which is dispensible for telomeric complex formation, is sufficient for mediating G-quartet formation. The finding that a telomeric protein acts as a molecular chaperone for G-quartet formation provides a strong argument that such DNA structures exist in vivo at chromosome telomeres."

Using a 17-kringle recombinant form of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) to transiently transfect human hepatoma cells, we could not detect recombinant Lp(a) (r-Lp(a)) particles intracellularly, by analysis of postnuclear lysates. However, covalent r-Lp(a) complexes were observed in the transfected cell supernatants. Upon addition of [35S]Cys-labeled human embryonic kidney cell supernatants transfected with 9-kringle or 17-kringle recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) variants to human plasma, covalent r-Lp(a) complexes were observed, which could be immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for either apo(a) or apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100); r-Lp(a) complexes containing the 17-kringle r-apo(a) were shown to be in the 1.063 g/ml"
https://openalex.org/W2038909360,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is believed to function in vivo by catalyzing the isomerization of disulfide bonds in proteins and thereby facilitating their folding. In S. cerevisiae PDI is encoded by an essential gene. Deletion of nearly one-third of the C-terminal residues of PDI altered PDI's cellular localization but not cell viability. Further deletions resulted in lethality, but these truncated proteins still exhibited PDI activity in vitro. Cells carrying a variant PDI in which both-CGHC-active sites were disrupted were viable. However, these cells exhibited a delay in the disulfide bond formation and transport of carboxypeptidase Y. In vitro enzyme assays revealed that disruption of both sites abolished catalytic activity. These results indicate that PDI catalyzes disulfide bond formation both in vivo and in vitro and that the integrity of the active sites is required for catalysis. However, this catalytic activity is not essential for yeast viability."

https://openalex.org/W2040172407,"Plants are continually subjected to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation (290 to 320 nanometers) as a component of sunlight, which induces a variety of types of damage to the plant DNA. Repair of the two major DNA photoproducts was analyzed in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and in a mutant derivative whose growth was sensitive to UV-B radiation. In wild-type seedlings, repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers occurred more slowly in the dark than in the light; repair of this photoproduct was not affected in the mutant. Repair, in the dark, of pyrimidine-pyrimidinone(6-4) dimers was defective in the UV-sensitive mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1858048976,"Recent evidence indicates that cell death through apoptosis may be an important mechanism to prevent tumor development. Therefore, agents that inhibit apoptosis may function as tumor promotors. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nicotine on the process of apoptosis. The results demonstrate that nicotine inhibits apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), UV light, chemotherapeutic drugs, and calcium ionophore. This phenomenon was observed in normal and transformed cells derived from a variety of species and tissues, including tumor cell types related to tobacco use. The major nicotine metabolite, cotinine, also inhibited apoptosis, whereas N-nitrosodiethylamine, a carcinogen found in tobacco, was without effect. Therefore, nicotine-mediated inhibition of apoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of tobacco-related cancer as well as decrease the efficacy of cancer therapies.—Wright, S.

https://openalex.org/W2021210221,"The Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) develops from a heterogeneous population of neural stem cells (neuroblasts), yet the genes regulating neuroblast determination remain unknown. The segmentation gene wingless is regionally expressed in the neuroectoderm from which neuroblasts develop. A conditional wingless mutation is used to inactivate CNS function without affecting segmentation. The stripe of wingless-expressing neuroectoderm generates apparently normal neuroblasts after wingless inactivation; however, adjacent anterior and posterior neuroectoderm requires wingless nonautonomously for subsequent neuroblast determination and formation. Loss of wingless results in the absence or duplication of identified neuroblasts, highlighting its role in generating neuroblast diversity in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1575682645,"A 50-kDa integrin-associated protein (IAP), identified by its role in activation of neutrophils by extracellular matrix proteins, has recently been found to have a primary sequence that predicts five transmembrane domains, raising the possibility that the protein participates in ion transport. In endothelial cells, extracellular matrix proteins and anti-integrin antibodies have been shown to trigger an influx of [Ca2+]i via voltage-independent membrane channels. We now show that monoclonal antibodies to IAP that block neutrophil activation completely inhibited the fibronectin-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells. An antibody that binds IAP but does not block neutrophil function had no effect on endothelial cell [Ca2+]i. Inhibition of IAP function had no effect on endothelial cell adhesion, no effect on the integrin-mediated rise in intracellular pH, and no effect on the integrin-mediated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, inhibition of IAP had no effect on the influx of Ca2+ triggered by histamine. These results demonstrate that IAP is specifically required for the integrin-regulated calcium influx and suggest that IAP itself might be an integrin-associated calcium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1580202151,"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase of Escherichia coli catalyzes the reaction, UDP-GlcNAc + R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP--> UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc + ACP. Using Matrex Gel Green A and heparin-agarose, we have purified the enzyme to near homogeneity from a strain that overproduces it 474-fold. The subunit molecular mass determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis is approximately 30 kDa, consistent with results of previous radiolabeling experiments in mini-cells. The amino-terminal sequence (Met-Ile-Asp-Lys-Ser-Ala-Phe-Val-His-Pro) and the amino acid composition of the purified protein are consistent with DNA sequencing (Coleman, J., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170, 1268-1274). At saturating concentrations of the second substrate, the apparent Km values for UDP-GlcNAc and R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP are 99 and 1.6 microM, respectively. There is an absolute requirement for the R-3-hydroxy moiety of the fatty acyl-ACP substrate; myristoyl-ACP binds effectively (IC50 = 2 microM) but is inactive ( O acyl transfer reactions. Thus, although UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferase catalyzes the first unique step of lipid A biosynthesis, it is the second enzyme (the deacetylase) that commits the substrates to this pathway. The specific activity of the deacetylase is elevated approximately 5-fold when lipid A synthesis is inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1527431548,"The therapeutic potential of somatic gene therapy has been extensively investigated in recent years, yet its slow progression into the clinical setting can be attributed to problems associated with the inability to achieve efficient gene transfers, to obtain sustained level of expression of the transfected gene, and the necessity to avoid immunorejection after transplantation. Here we report on an alternate strategy in gene therapy that overcomes all three problems by immunoisolating genetically modified cells in a biocompatible membrane, thereby introducing a system that can provide sustained delivery of the desired gene product. As a model, mouse fibroblasts transformed with the human growth hormone gene (Ltk-GH) were encapsulated with an alginate-poly-L-lysinealginate membrane. Long-term in vitro studies showed that the encapsulation of the cells was physiologically compatible with growth and survival of the cells. Furthermore, there was a unique pattern of secretion of the human protein by the encapsulated cells: there was a phase of steady increase in the secretion of the human growth hormone by each cell, followed by a plateau phase. The most convincing evidence of the feasibility of this strategy was provided by the in vivo study: Balb-c mice transplanted with encapsulated Ltk-GH cells had detectable serum levels of human growth hormone (hGH) for the duration of the study (115 days). Moreover, encapsulated cells recovered from a recipient 1 year after the transplantation continued to secrete high levels of hGH in culture.—Tai, I. T., Sun, A. M.

https://openalex.org/W2053883235,"A characteristic feature of early zygote development in Chlamydomonas is the selective degradation of chloroplast DNA from the mating type minus parent. The zygote-specific gene cluster ezy-1 is linked to the mating type locus and is transcribed almost immediately upon zygote formation. We show here that the acidic Ezy-1 polypeptide is rapidly transported to both the plus and minus chloroplasts, where it interacts with each chloroplast nucleoid. Expression of ezy-1 is selectively inhibited when plus, but not minus, gametes are briefly ultraviolet irradiated just prior to mating, a treatment known to disrupt the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast traits. We propose that the Ezy-1 polypeptide participates in the destruction of the minus chloroplast DNA in zygotes and thus the uniparental Inheritance of chloroplast traits. The ezy-1 gene represents a valuable molecular probe for dissecting mechanisms underlying organelle inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W1493220182,"Previous NMR studies (Karslake, C., Piotto, M. E., Pak, Y. M., Weiner, H., and Gorenstein, D. G. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 9872-9878) had shown that a 22-amino acid signal peptide of rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) when bound to a micelle had two amphiphilic alpha-helices, one located at the N terminus and the other at the C terminus. It was shown that deletion of either helix caused the precursor protein not to be imported (Wang, Y., and Weiner, H., (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4759-4765). The two helices are separated by a Arg-Gly-Pro flexible region, and to test the role of this linker region in the import and processing of the precursor protein, we deleted it from the ALDH signal peptide and precursor protein. The 19-amino acid signal peptide of ALDH, to which has been added 3 residues at the C terminus and from which has been deleted the 3-residue flexible linker region, has been studied by two-dimensional NMR in a dodecylphosphocholine micelle. In this membrane-like environment the peptide contains a single alpha-helical segment that extends almost the entire length of the peptide. NH exchange experiments show residues on the hydrophobic face of the peptide to exchange much more slowly than those of the hydrophilic face. Combined with the previous study, these results suggest that precursor protein import simply requires a sufficiently long amphiphilic helix (or helices) to bind stably to the membrane. The N and C helices of native ALDH are only about 6-8 residues long; this represents only about two turns of a helix, and either helix on its own does not provide enough stabilization to ensure folding and binding to the membrane. The linker-deleted ALDH peptide contains a single helix of 12-14 residues that is long enough to provide a hydrophobic surface that can stably interact with the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The function of the C helix in the native signal peptide is therefore to enhance the stability and binding of the N-terminal signal to the membrane. Significantly, unlike native ALDH precursor protein, the linker-deleted signal peptide precursor protein could no longer be processed after import into mitochondria. As explained by modeling of the alpha-helix and the NH exchange rate data, the precursor protein requires that the first several residues of the mature protein be part of the hydrophobic membrane associated face of the helix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1539749981,"Chronic rejection is the most common reason for late loss of a transplant. The molecular mechanism of chronic rejection is not known and there is no treatment for this disorder. The characteristic histological feature in chronic rejection is increased smooth muscle cell replication in the vascular wall, leading to allograft arteriosclerosis. In this study we demonstrate that nonimmunosuppressed rat aortic allografts undergoing chronic rejection synthesize increased quantitites of several smooth muscle cell growth-promoting substances in the vascular wall including interleukin-1, eicosanoids, and several peptide growth factors. Administration of a stable somatostatin analog lanreotide, BIM 23014, strongly inhibits myocyte proliferation in the allograft in vivo. It has no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vitro. Concomitantly, the locally produced peptide growth factors, i.e., epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and BB-isomer of platelet-derived growth factor, but not other mediators of inflammation, are significantly reduced. The results suggest that growth factors are the main effector molecules leading to myocyte proliferation in allograft arteriosclerosis and that allograft arteriosclerosis (chronic rejection) may be specifically inhibited by lanreotide administration.—Häyry, P., Räisänen, A., Ustinov, J., Mennander, A., Paavonen, T.

The biological relevance of CD8α-Lck association in T cell development was tested with transgenic mice generated to express a CD8α molecule with two amino acid substitutions in its cytoplasmic domain, which abolishes the association of CD8α with Lck. The CD8α mutant was analyzed in a CD8-/- background and in the context of the transgenic 2C T cell receptor. The development and function of CD8+ T cells in these mice were apparently normal. Thus, CD8α-Lck association is not necessary for positive selection, negative selection, or CD8-dependent cytotoxic function."
https://openalex.org/W1490098407,"Studies have been conducted to investigate the structure-function relationships of retinoids in their in vitro interaction with plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and in their influence on plasma retinol concentration. Two classes of retinoids, one bearing modifications in the area of the retinol hydroxyl end group (fenretinide, N-(ethyl) retinamide, all-trans, and 13-cis retinoic acid) and the other one also bearing modifications in the area of the cyclohexene ring (etretinate, acitretin, and arotinoid Ro 13-7410), were investigated. Whereas substantial modifications of the retinol hydroxyl group do not prevent the binding to RBP, an intact trimethylcyclohexenyl group seems to be crucial for binding. Both classes of retinoids, administered orally at equimolar doses, reduce plasma retinol concentration in rats but with different kinetics. A marked lowering of plasma retinol occurs early (within 5 h) after administration of retinoids that interact with RBP in vitro, whereas it occurs at later times (24 h) after retinoids that do not interact with RBP. The concentrations of both classes of retinoids found in plasma do not account for the temporal difference in this effect. The early reduction of plasma retinol might be the consequence of in vivo specific binding of retinoids to RBP, as suggested by the in vitro results. The late reduction observed for retinoids lacking in vitro affinity for RBP is due to other mechanisms or to metabolism to retinoids binding to RBP.—Berni, R., Clerici, M., Malpeli, G., Cleris, L., Formelli, F.

https://openalex.org/W1592548488,"Recent studies show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains proteases, but it is not understood how these enzymes are regulated. In this report we study the selective ER degradation of the subunits (alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta) of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). When analyzed in vivo, unassembled subunits of the TCR fail to reach the Golgi apparatus and show a differential sensitivity to degradation after synthesis. The alpha, beta, and delta subunits are degraded rapidly, while gamma, epsilon, and zeta are stable. To study the regulation of proteolysis in more detail, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits were expressed alone in fibroblasts and their selective degradation analyzed in vitro. The beta and delta chains were degraded in the complete absence of vesicular transport, indicating their degradation in the ER membrane compartment. Proteolysis was unaffected by GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)), EDTA, or depletion of ATP. The gamma and epsilon subunits were stable under the same in vitro conditions, indicating that the assay reconstituted selective protein degradation within the ER. Furthermore, the results showed that the gamma and epsilon subunits did not escape degradation by being transported from the ER to pre-Golgi, or cis-Golgi, membrane compartments. Structural determinants of ER degradation contained within the membrane anchor of the TCR beta subunit were only active in permeabilized cells when reducing agents were added to the assay. Surprisingly, reducing conditions disrupted the regulation of ER proteolysis and induced rapid ER degradation of the stable CD3 gamma subunit and of a control interleukin 2 receptor chimera. Taken together, the results indicated that the ER membrane compartment regulates the selective degradation of newly synthesized proteins. Importantly, the stability of proteins retained in the ER was highly sensitive to redox conditions. It is possible that the redox buffer within the ER lumen may regulate ER protein degradation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1496926820,"Gene transfer systems targeting the asialoglycoprotein receptor have been developed to introduce functional genes into cells in culture and livers of intact animals. A synthetic neoglycoprotein carrier was constructed and complexed to a chimeric gene containing the cDNA for human factor IX ligated to the promoter-regulatory region of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from the rat. The complex was used to transfect human hepatoma cells that express the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Human factor IX DNA sequences were found in cells 10 days after treatment. A 1.4 kB mRNA transcript was detected by Northern blot hybridization, which was inducible by treatment with dexamethasone or cAMP with theophylline. Western blot hybridization of proteins secreted into the culture medium detected human factor IX. The chimeric gene was also transferred into livers of rats using the neoglycoprotein carrier system after partial hepatectomy. Although the results were variable, the exogenous gene was transcribed in livers of several animals, and maximal levels of expression of the fully processed human factor IX were detected 30 days after introduction. The concentration of factor IX in the blood returned to control levels 60 days after transfection. Factor IX production was induced as late as 96 days after treatment by feeding transfected animals a diet high in protein but devoid of carbohydrates. This DNA carrier system can be used to introduce functional genes into the livers of rats, and may be a useful technique for gene therapy targeting the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1558078590,"Neither the physiological function of sigma (sigma) receptors nor the cellular mechanism responsible for the pharmacological effects of sigma receptor ligands is known. We now report that sigma receptor ligands noncompetitively inhibit nicotine-stimulated catecholamine release from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. The rank order of potency of ligands to inhibit nicotine-stimulated catecholamine release is significantly correlated (P < 0.005) with that observed in radioligand binding assays selective for the sigma 1 receptor subtype. This naltrexone-insensitive effect is paralleled by an inhibition of nicotine-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i. Sigma ligands were without effect on catecholamine release or [Ca2+]i in the absence of nicotine. In addition, nicotine accelerated the association of the sigma receptor selective radioligand, [3H](+)pentazocine, to adrenal medullary homogenates while having no effect on the rate of ligand dissociation, consistent with a sigma ligand binding site closely associated with and allosterically modulated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Thus, the actions of agonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in bovine chromaffin cells are modulated by sigma 1 receptor selective ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1502031474,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) initiates a series of signaling events leading to diverse cell type-specific effects on proliferation and morphology. The multiple effects of TGF-beta 1 are not due to selective expression of receptor subtypes, but rather probably reflect cell-specific expression of downstream components of the particular signaling system. To address this possibility and to identify specific signaling pathways activated by TGF-beta 1, we attempted to restore cell responsiveness to the cytokine by introducing various intracellular signal transducers in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, a cell line that is minimally responsive to TGF-beta 1. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with Gi alpha 1 cDNA, TGF-beta 1 induced a reversible morphological transformation that was identical to the effect of this cytokine in indicator cells such as AKR-2B fibroblasts. Gi alpha 1 transfectants also exhibited mitogenic hyperresponsiveness to TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 does not elicit these responses in control nontransfected fibroblasts or cells transfected with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Go alpha 1. The response to TGF-beta 1 in Gi alpha 1 transfectants is blocked by pertussis toxin and is lost in Gi alpha 1 transfectants that have spontaneously reverted and no longer express Gi alpha 1. These data indicate that the expression of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gi alpha 1, normally absent in these cells, confers cell sensitivity to TGF-beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W1672768195,"Hemolysin B (HlyB) is a membrane-bound transport protein composed of an amino-terminal multiple membrane-spanning portion followed by a conserved ATP binding sequence. Together with the inner membrane protein HlyD and the outer membrane protein TolC, HlyB is responsible for transport of the 107-kDa toxin HlyA from the cytoplasm, across both membranes of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli, directly to the medium. We have used a mutational approach to investigate a postulated interaction between HlyA and HlyB. We have isolated transport-deficient mutants of HlyA altered in the C-terminal signal sequence and used one of these, a deletion of 29 amino acids, to select compensatory mutants in the transporter protein HlyB. Fifteen mutants located at six different sites, all mapping within the amino-terminal multiple membrane-spanning domain of HlyB, were identified. All of the mutations are clustered into three groups located close to the predicted inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. We propose that these locations are close to sites on HlyB that interact with the C-terminal signal sequence of HlyA. This interaction is likely to involve either binding of HlyA to HlyB or activation of the transport mechanism. The compensatory mutants also display different patterns of specificity in terms of their ability to transport different HlyA mutants. The fact that point mutations are able to compensate for drastic changes in the signal sequence of HlyA suggests that substrate specificity of transporters such as HlyB may shift dramatically during evolutionary history. This could account for the diversity of substrates observed for the ABC transporter superfamily in nature."

Dose-response curves carried out in January, May, July, and October suggest that the seasonal effects reported are related to differences in the sensitivity of mice to melatonin during the course of the year. These results show seasonal variations in the immune modulatory action of melatonin."
https://openalex.org/W1576945083,"A potential gene therapy strategy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is to disrupt the intracellular transport of viral proteins. We report here the binding and transporting of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp160 to lysosomes as a result of the expression of fusion genes consisting of soluble CD4 and lysosome targeting domains. The effective lysosome targeting domain tested includes a lysosomal protease zymogen, procathepsin D, and the COOH-terminal domains of three lysosome membrane proteins: lamp-1, lamp-2, and lysosomal acid phosphatase. We demonstrated that cell fusion (syncytium), caused by the transport of gp160 to the surface of HeLa-CD4+ cells, was completely abolished by the expression of these fusion genes. The lysosomal localization of gp160 in HeLa cells coexpressing CD4-fusion genes was also established. From pulse-chase experiments, we observed that gp160 and the fusion proteins were degraded, as expected of lysosomal activities. Additionally, T lymphoblastoid cells transiently and permanently expressing these fusion genes strongly retarded the propagation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Thus, these fusion genes can deprive HIV of newly synthesized envelope protein gp160 for the assembly of new virions and are potentially useful in gene therapy against AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1544369272,"Ricin is a protein toxin that arrests protein synthesis in mammalian cells by catalytically inactivating ribosomes. To interact with ribosomes, the A chain of the toxin must enter the cytosol. Entry involves receptor-mediated endocytosis and penetration of the toxin through an intracellular membrane, but the identity of the compartment where penetration occurs is unknown. It has been suggested that the A chain penetrates from the endoplasmic reticulum, implying the existence of a pathway from endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, perhaps via, retrograde transport through the Golgi. (For a recent review, see Pelham, H. R. B., Roberts, L. M., and Lord, J. M. (1992) Trends Cell Biol. 2, 183-185.) To investigate the role of the Golgi in the intoxication process of ricin, we studied the effect of ricin on mutants of the End4 complementation group of Chinese hamster ovary cells. End4 mutants express a temperature-sensitive block in secretion that is correlated with the disappearance of the Golgi stacks at the level of fluorescence microscopy. We found that End4 cells and wild-type cells were equally sensitive to ricin at the restrictive temperature, although the minimum lag before inhibition of protein synthesis was longer in the mutant cells. The simplest interpretation of these data is that ricin does not pass through the cis, medial, or trans stacks of the Golgi en route to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1540406636,"A survey of 128 biotechnology core facilities has provided data on the finances, services, space requirements, and personnel. An average facility had four full-time personnel and 7.5 major instrument systems, and occupied 969 sq. ft. Average total income was $244,000/year, but annual user fee income was only $125,000. Typically, facilities required substantial institutional support or grants. Cost recovery (user fee income divided by total income) averaged 49%. During the last 5 years user fee income, total income, and cost recovery have increased. In-house charges for protein sequencing and peptide synthesis increased approximately 30%, while oligonucleotide synthesis charges decreased by 74%. The costs (charges corrected for subsidy from non-user fee income) for most services did not significantly change, except that oligonucleotide synthesis costs decreased by 25% in 1992. DNA synthesis had the highest throughout per month (116 samples), followed by amino acid analysis (86 samples) and DNA sequencing (67 samples). Other services averaged from 5 to 60 samples. DNA synthesis and purification were the services used by the greatest number of principal investigators. A number of services including DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, RNA synthesis, electroblotting, and carbohydrate analysis have been introduced in the last 3 years. Although these services are characterized by high levels of methods development and non-user runs, they are offered by twice the percentage of facilities as in 1989, and are increasingly contributing to facility income."
https://openalex.org/W1576967076,"A number of protein kinases have been shown to undergo autophosphorylation, but few have demonstrated a coordinate increase or decrease in enzymatic activity as a result. Described here is a novel S6 kinase isolated from human placenta which autoactivates through autophosphorylation in vitro. This S6/H4 kinase, purified in an inactive state, exhibited a molecular mass of 60 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 60-kDa protein underwent autophosphorylation, was labeled by 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP, and reacted with an antibody to the conserved APE domain of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The protein did not cochromatograph with p70 S6 kinase and did not cross-react with an anti-p70 kinase antibody. The synthetic peptide S6-21, histone H4, and myelin basic protein were phosphorylated by the purified S6/H4 kinase. Mild digestion of the inactive S6/H4 kinase with trypsin generated a 40-kDa fragment, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The trypsin treatment was necessary, but not sufficient, to fully activate the kinase. Subsequent incubation of the trypsin-treated S6 kinase with MgATP resulted in the rapid autophosphorylation of the 40-kDa fragment along with a coordinate increase in kinase activity. The autophosphorylation of the 40-kDa protein was positively correlated with MgATP incubation time and an increase in activity toward the S6-21 peptide, histone H4, and myelin basic protein. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that this previously uncharacterized S6 kinase belongs to a unique family of protein kinases which utilize autophosphorylation as part of their in vivo activation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1773785030,"To increase our understanding of the molecular basis for antibody specificity and for the cross-reactivity of anti-peptide antibodies with native proteins it is important to study the three-dimensional structure of antibody complexes with their peptide antigens. For this purpose it may not be necessary to solve the structure of the whole antibody complex but rather to concentrate on elucidating the combining site structure, the interactions of the antibody with its antigen and the bound peptide conformation. We have developed an NMR methodology based on two-dimensional difference spectrum measurements which extract the information concerning antibody-peptide interactions and intramolecular interactions in the bound ligand from the crowded and unresolved spectrum of the Fab complex. These measurements yield restraints on interproton distances in the complex which are used to dock the peptide into calculated models for the antibodies' combining sites. Comparison of the interactions of three antibodies against a cholera toxin peptide (CTP3), which differ in their cross-reactivity with the toxin, yields information about the size and conformation of antigenic determinants recognized by antibodies, the structure of their combining sites and relationships between antibodies' primary structure, and their interactions with peptide antigens.—Anglister, J., Scherf, T., Zilber, B., Levy, R., Zvi, A., Hiller, R., Feigelson, D.
