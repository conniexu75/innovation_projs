https://openalex.org/W2138006485,"S. cerevisiae kex2 mutants are defective for the production of two biologically active secreted peptides: killer toxin and the mating pheromone, alpha-factor. Both molecules are excised from larger precursor polypeptides. In normal cells, the alpha-factor precursor is core-glycosylated and proteolytically processed intracellularly. In kex2 mutants, however, prepro-alpha-factor is not proteolytically cleaved and is secreted in a highly glycosylated form. All kex2 mutants examined (three independent alleles) lack a Zn++-sensitive membrane-associated endopeptidase with specificity for cleaving on the carboxyl side of a pair of basic residues. Absence of this activity cosegregates with the other phenotypes of a kex2 lesion in genetic crosses. The normal KEX2 gene was isolated by complementation of three of the phenotypes conferred by the kex2-1 mutation. The cloned DNA, either on a multicopy plasmid or integrated into the genome, restores both enzymatic activity in vitro and the normal pattern of proteolytic processing and glycosylation of prepro-alpha-factor in vivo. Gene dosage effects suggest that KEX2 is the structural gene for the endopeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1983998410,"Scrapie is a degenerative, neurological disorder caused by a slow infectious agent or prion. Extensively purified preparations of prions were denatured by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate and the major protein component (PrP 27-30) was isolated by preparative HPLC size exclusion chromatography after proteinase K digestion. The purified PrP 27-30 molecules were not infectious. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of purified PrP 27-30 demonstrated the absence of covalently linked polynucleotides. Amino acid composition studies showed that PrP 27-30 contains at least 17 naturally occurring amino acids. A single N-terminal amino acid sequence for PrP 27-30 was obtained; the sequence is N-Gly-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr-His-Asn-Gln-Trp-Asn-Lys-Pro-Ser-Lys and it does not share homology with any known proteins. The same amino acid sequence was found when an extensively purified preparation of prions aggregated into rods and containing approximately 10(9.5) ID50 U/ml was sequenced directly. Knowledge of the amino acid sequence should permit determination of the genetic origin and replication mechanism of prions."
https://openalex.org/W2078551003,"We have surveyed expression of the six Drosophila actin genes during ontogeny. Unique portions of cloned actin genes were used to monitor levels of respective mRNAs in developmentally staged whole organisms and dissected body parts. We find that each gene is transcribed to form functional mRNA, which accumulates with a distinct pattern. Two of the genes, act5C and act42A, are expressed in undifferentiated cells and probably encode cytoplasmic actins. Act57A and act87E are expressed predominantly in larval, pupal, and adult intersegmental muscles; act88F in muscles of the adult thorax; and act79B in the thorax and leg muscles. These composite data define three main patterns of actin gene expression which are correlated with changing Drosophila morphology, particularly muscle differentiation and reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2077326676,"Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) of Drosophila melanogaster is coded by a single structural gene, active in both larvae and adults. The major larval and adult transcripts of Adh differ in their 5′-untranslated regions. The major larval mRNA is about 1100 bases long, some 50 bases shorter than the major adult transcript. The 5′ end of the larval mRNA is colinear with the genomic sequence immediately adjacent to the coding region, starting 70 base pairs (bp) upstream of the initiation codon. By contrast, the adult mRNA shares only 36 of its 123 5′-untranslated bases with the larval mRNA; the remaining 87 are encoded by a sequence 654 bp upstream. Both initiation sites are preceded by a TATA box some 24 bp upstream. The developmental specificity of Adh expression is seen, therefore, to have a counterpart in the specificity of transcription initiation at the two separate promoter regions."
https://openalex.org/W2034268083,"Certain fluorescent dyes, previously reported to localize mitochondria, when used at higher concentrations also localize a continuous net-like structure in both living and glutaraldehyde-fixed cells. A similar reticular structure can be detected by phase-contrast microscopy and whole-mount electron microscopy in potassium permanganate-fixed cells as well. This structure is mostly tubular, with some patch-like areas, and is likely to be the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The organization of the reticular structure is sensitive to colchicine and rotenone but not to cytochalasin B, taxol, monensin, the calcium ionophore A23187, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, or hydrocortisone."
https://openalex.org/W1969461355,The locus fushi tarazu appears to be involved in the establishment of the segmentation pattern of the Drosophila embryo. The cuticle of ftz mutant embryos is missing structures in alternating segments such that only half the normal number of segments are present. We have localized ftz+ transcripts in tissue sections of wild-type Drosophila embryos by in situ hybridization. Transcripts from the ftz+ gene were first detected during nuclear cleavage prior to cell formation. During the last two nuclear divisions ftz+ transcription becomes gradually restricted such that at the cellular blastoderm stage the ftz+ transcripts are localized in seven evenly spaced bands of cells. The size of each band is similar to the size of the segment primordia at the blastoderm. By the time segmentation becomes morphologically distinct ftz+ transcripts are no longer detected. These results suggest that the ftz+ gene plays a key role in the determination of the segmentation pattern in the embryo.

https://openalex.org/W1986004077,"Interleukin 2 (IL-2) has an important role in the regulation of the expression of IL-2 receptors and the synthesis of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) by T lymphocytes. IL-2 is required for the optimum expression of IL-2 receptors on activated T lymphocytes and for maximum synthesis of IFN-gamma in vitro. Dexamethasone, an immunosuppressant drug that inhibits IL-2 synthesis, diminished the expression of IL-2 receptors and the synthesis of IFN-gamma. Anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody known to prevent the binding of IL-2 to its receptor without inhibiting IL-2 synthesis, down-regulated the expression of the receptor and partially inhibited synthesis of IFN-gamma. In a population of T lymphocytes prevented from synthesizing IL-2 by dexamethasone and incapable of using IL-2 as a result of blockage of IL-2 receptors by anti-Tac, the number of receptor-bearing cells and receptor density were diminished. Anti-Tac in combination with dexamethasone also exerted a synergistic effect on IFN-gamma synthesis, inhibiting it almost completely. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone IFN-gamma synthesis may be of clinical importance, since IFN-gamma activates macrophages and thereby triggers one of the defense mechanisms against bacterial infections."

https://openalex.org/W1620610430,"The co-carcinogenic compound phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not its inactive analogue 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate causes the phosphorylation of several rabbit neutrophil polypeptides whose molecular weights and isoelectric points (pI) are as follows: Mr = 40,000, pI = 6.4; Mr = 50,000, pI = 4.9; Mr = 55,000, pI = 6.3; Mr = 64,000, pI = 6.0; Mr = 70,000, pI = 5.6; Mr = 90,000, pI = 6.0. Most of these phosphorylated proteins are located exclusively in the cytosol; the 64,000 molecular weight protein is found both in the cytosol and the cytoskeleton, and the 40,000 molecular weight protein is found in the nuclear pellet. The 50,000 molecular weight protein is also phosphorylated in whole cells by the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe and in cell-free systems by protein kinase C. Using limited proteolysis, one phosphopeptide fragment was phosphorylated by the three stimuli. In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate causes cell aggregation and the exocytotic release of the specific granules of rabbit neutrophils. In contrast, both compounds increase the amount of actin associated with the cytoskeleton. The divalent cation ionophore A23187 at low concentration and the compound phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate act synergistically in causing neutrophil degranulation. Lysosomal enzyme release and the phosphorylation of the 50,000 molecular weight polypeptide produced by phorbl 12-myristate 13-acetate are inhibited by trifluoperazine, and these two responses seem to be causally related. These results are discussed in terms of the role of 1,2-diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C in specific granule release from rabbit neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2019486354,"Deletion mutants of the Drosophila hsp 70 promoter region have been fused to a truncated Drosophila Adh gene lacking its own promoter. These fusion genes were introduced into the Drosophila genome using the P-element transformation system. S1 mapping of fusion transcripts in transformed flies shows that their expression is completely dependent on the function of the hsp 70 promoter, and that 97 bp of hsp 70 5'-flanking DNA is sufficient to induce transcription upon heat shock to a level similar to that of the wild-type hsp 70 gene. By contrast, a deletion containing 68 bp of 5'-flanking DNA is only inducible to a low level even though this deletion retains the consensus sequence, which is sufficient for induction and maximal expression of this gene in COS cells and Xenopus oocytes. A sequence centered at -125 with the potential for forming an S1 nuclease-sensitive structure does not affect inducibility or efficiency of expression."

https://openalex.org/W2023545761,"Antisera to a synthetic c-myc peptide and to c-myc antigens synthesized from various portions of the human gene expressed in Escherichia coli were used in order to characterize the protein product of the human c-myc oncogene. Although the deduced molecular weight of the human c-myc protein is 49,000, these antisera precipitate a protein from human cells that migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel as if its molecular weight were 65,000. In addition, the mouse c-myc protein, whether synthesized in cells or in a cell-free system directed by pure, synthetic messenger RNA, has analogous properties and is immunoprecipitated by the antiserum to the human c-myc protein. Similar proteins are immunoprecipitated from monkey, rat, hamster, and frog cells, suggesting evolutionary conservation of antigenic structure of the c-myc protein among vertebrates. In addition, and in a manner consistent with the behavior of its messenger RNA, the immunoprecipitable c-myc protein is sharply induced by the action of mitogens on resting human T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068689577,"Apolipoproteins A-1 and A-2 were purified from human plasma. At concentrations present in human bile these proteins prolonged the nucleation time of cholesterol monohydrate crystals when added to model systems of supersaturated bile. In contrast, apolipoprotein C-3 and other serum proteins did not have this effect. Also, when human gallbladder bile was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography, apolipoproteins A-1 and A-2 were among the proteins present in a fraction of bile enriched in potent inhibitors of cholesterol crystal nucleation. These findings suggest that apolipoproteins A-1 and A-2 in supersaturated human gallbladder bile could inhibit the rate of formation of solid cholesterol crystals and thus help to prevent spontaneous cholesterol gallstone formation in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2016089890,"Loss-of-function mutations of a new homeotic gene, sxc, in Drosophila cause transformations of body segments, suggesting inappropriate expression of BX-C and ANT-C genes. I present evidence that sxc+ is required during embryogenesis for the selective repression of the BX-C in different larval segments and show that this requirement may be met entirely by maternally derived gene product. sxc+ is also required later in development to ensure the appropriate expression of ANT-C and BX-C genes in adult thoracic and abdominal segments. Absence of sxc+ in the mesothorax apparently results in the ectopic expression of the bx+ (or Ubx+) function in both the anterior and posterior compartments; this suggests that pbx mutations may define a regulatory rather than a structural function."
https://openalex.org/W1573008312,"Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and assessed for the presence of contaminating polymorphonuclear leukocytes and platelets. Incubations of these cell isolates were performed in the presence or absence of the calcium ionophore A23187 and/or 1-14C-labeled or unlabeled arachidonic acid. Using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography with simultaneous monitoring of ultraviolet light absorption at 229 and 280 nm and, where appropriate, of radioactivity, our studies reveal that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells generate leukotrienes C4 and B4 (LTC4 and LTB4) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) following stimulation with A23187. The ratio of LTC4 to LTB4 was approximately 10-fold greater among the mononuclear cells than among similar incubations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Furthermore, the mononuclear cells failed to metabolize LTB4 into the omega-hydroxy or omega-carboxy derivatives that were always present in, and very characteristic of incubations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Depletion of monocytes from the mononuclear cells by double adherence resulted in virtual loss of the generation of 5-lipoxygenase-derived products by the remaining nonadherent cells, supporting the conclusion that the monocytes and not the lymphocytes were the source of LTC4, LTB4, and 5-HETE. The presence of both 12-HETE and the cyclooxygenase-derived 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid correlated with the degree of platelet contamination, suggesting that the platelets account for the presence of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2049422734,"We have constructed a gene fusion using the promoter of Drosophila hsp70 and the structural gene for Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and used this construct to transform Adh-deficient flies. In these transformants, Adh is expressed only after heat shock. Like hsp70 itself, this heat-shock-inducible Adh (Adhhs) is induced in a wide variety of tissues. It fails to be induced in primary spermatocytes. Although the tissue distribution of Adh activity is very different from wild type, this does not appear to be deleterious. Indeed, the induction of Adhhs allows flies to survive exposure to ethanol. We have used this latter characteristic to select dominant, trans-acting mutations that alter the response of flies to heat shock."
https://openalex.org/W1526949464,"We have studied the nature of chromatin alterations along immunoglobulin light chain (IgL) genes during B cell development using cultured murine cell lines. Employing a chromatin fractionation procedure on micrococcal nuclease-treated nuclei, we demonstrate that transcriptionally active k IgL chromatin lacks a canonical nucleosomal repeat and exhibits a pronounced association with insoluble nuclear material but is processed by nuclease to a soluble nucleosomal component that apparently lacks histone H1 and is enriched in high mobility group proteins. Of particular significance, utilizing a variant plasmacytoma cell line that has transcriptionally inactivated one k allele via a promoter deletion, we demonstrate that transcription per se is not responsible for these novel alterations. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin encompassing germline (unrearranged) and transcriptionally silent lambda IgL alleles in k-producing plasmacytomas exhibit some of the same unusual properties that are displayed by k alleles. Finally, we demonstrate that these alterations only occur in cell lines of the lymphocyte lineage that have progressed past the early pre-B cell stage; when inactive, both k and lambda IgL genes possess typical nucleosomal packaging and co-fractionate with histone H1-containing chromatin. These findings lead us to propose a model that predicts B cell stage-specific alterations in IgL chromatin prior to gene rearrangement and transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2034967723,"When Drosophila tissue culture cells are shifted from 25 to 36°C (heat shocked) the pre-existing mRNAs (25°C mRNAs) remain in the cytoplasm but their translation products are underrepresented relative to the induced heat shock proteins. Many of these undertranslated 25°C mRNAs are found in association with polysomes of similar size in heat-shocked and control cells. Furthermore, the messages encoding α-tubulin, β-tubulin, and actin are found associated with one-third to one-half as many total ribosomes in heat-shocked cells as in cells incubated at 25°C. Increased temperature should lead to increased output of protein per ribosome. However, the 25°C proteins are actually synthesized at less than 10% of 25°C levels in heat-shocked cells. Thus, the rates of both elongation and initiation of translation are significantly (15- to 30-fold) slower on 25°C mRNAs than they are on heat shock mRNAs in heat-shocked cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979914089,"The response of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice to immunization with proteins coupled to (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP) is dominated by distinctly different sets of antibodies. The VH gene family previously shown to be involved in the C57BL/6 response has now been shown to have highly homologous counterparts in BALB/c but of five sequenced BALB/c VH regions, none appeared likely to be able to encode an NP-binding protein. The active VH region from a BALB/c hybridoma making a characteristic anti-NP antibody was recovered and sequenced and shown to be quite different from the VH gene family involved in the C57BL/6 response. Comparison of the variation of the closely related VH regions between the two mouse strains showed that there are separate types of evolutionary pressures on the framework and complementarity-determining regions. The molecular basis for strain-specific immune responses appears to be that the structural divergence of VH regions between mouse strains is great enough that different strains use different VH regions for making the predominant class of antibodies to a specific hapten."

https://openalex.org/W2033335837,"In the course of studying the Antennapedia (Antp) locus, we found that one of the 3' Antp exons has weak cross-homology to another gene affecting segmentation, fushi tarazu (ftz; meaning ""not enough segments""), which is 30 kb to the left of Antp. Homozygous ftz- embryos die before hatching and lack alternate body segments. The reduced number of segments results from the fusion of the anterior portion of one segment with the posterior portion of the next segment. The ftz gene encodes a single 1.9 kb poly(A)+ RNA expressed exclusively from the early blastoderm to gastrula stages of embryonic development. The structure of the ftz gene has been analyzed by S1 nuclease mapping and by restriction mapping of a cDNA clone. The ftz gene consists of two exons, and it is the 3' exon that cross-hybridizes with the 3' exon of Antp. The role of ftz in cell determination is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1654413081,"The present study compares the molecular mechanism by which thrombin, platelet-activating factor, and epinephrine induce platelet activation. Thrombin and platelet-activating factor induce an initial activation of phospholipase C, as measured by formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid, during platelet shape change which is independent of and dissociated from metabolism of arachidonic acid. Phospholipase C activation and shape change are independent of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of cyclooxygenase products occurs subsequent to the initial activation of phospholipase C and those metabolites are associated with platelet aggregation and further activation of phospholipase C. On the other hand, epinephrine is an unique platelet stimulus since it requires extracellular divalent cations and does not induce platelet shape change or activation of phospholipase C. Our results indicate that activation of phospholipase C may be a mechanism by which physiological agonists can activate platelets independently of extracellular divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W2130056529,"We employed des-Arg9-bradykinin to investigate the relation between bradykinin-induced prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and bradykinin-induced protein accumulation. In this feedback control system, bradykinin-induced PG synthesis limits bradykinin-induced protein production. At low concentration (5 X 10(-8) M), des-Arg9-bradykinin was significantly less active than bradykinin in stimulating the formation of prostaglandins by human fetal lung fibroblasts in culture. At high concentration (5 X 10(-6) M), bradykinin induced a 24% increase in protein formation, while des-Arg9-bradykinin induced a 61% increase in collagen formation and an 80% increase in total protein accumulation. In the presence of indomethacin, bradykinin-induced protein formation was increased further, whereas des-Arg9-bradykinin-induced protein formation was unchanged. The bradykinin derivative increased the production of types I and III procollagens without affecting the distribution of procollagen types. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA in lung fibroblast cultures was increased 3-fold by des-Arg9-bradykinin alone or by bradykinin in combination with indomethacin. Des-Arg9-[Leu8]bradykinin inhibited the des-Arg9-bradykinin-induced protein formation and cell division. These data indicate that both bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin stimulate protein formation and cell division; des-Arg9-bradykinin alone stimulates protein formation and cell division without activating PG synthesis and PG feedback control."

https://openalex.org/W39223659,"Purified 12-hydroperoxyeicosa - 5, 8, 10, 14 - tetrae noic acid (12-HPETE) containing deuterium atoms at 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, and 15 was prepared by incubating octadeuterated arachidonic acid with a platelet preparation in air or [18O]oxygen gas. A mixture of 12-HPETE containing 16O16O:18O18O (5:4) was subsequently prepared and incubated with hematin in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4); in another experiment the same mixture of 12-HPETE was incubated with a rat lung preparation (0-30% ammonium sulfate) which lacked epoxide hydratase activity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry negative ion chemical ionization analysis of the extracted products after conversion into pentafluorobenzyl-trimethylsilyl derivatives indicated that the products from both incubations, i.e. 12-hydroxyeicosa - 5,8,10,14 - tetraenoic acid (12 - HETE), 8 - hydroxy - 11,12-epoxyeicosa - 5,9,14 - trienoic acid (8H-11,12-EPETE), 10H - 11,12-epoxyeicosa - 5,8,14 - trienoic acid (10H-11,12-EPETE), and 8,11,12-trihydroxyeicosa-5,9,14-trienoic acid, all retained either two [16O]oxygen or two [18O]oxygen atoms of starting 12-HPETE and that no mixed species existed which contained one [16O]oxygen and one [18O]oxygen atom. These results demonstrate for the first time in the arachidonic acid series an intramolecular transfer of the terminal hydroxyl group of the hydroperoxide of 12-HPETE to the C-8 or C-10 alkyl positions to form the hydroxyepoxides 8H-11,12-EPETE and 10H-11,12-EPETE. This reaction carried out by both hematin in the absence of protein and the rat lung preparation is suggestive of a metal-hydroperoxide-olefin cage complex facilitating a concerted reaction in which the terminal hydroxyl group of the hydroperoxide is trapped by alkyl free radical centers."
https://openalex.org/W2036409079,"The thymus exports a selected subset of virgin T lymphocytes to the peripheral lymphoid organs. The mature phenotype of these thymus emigrants is similar to that of medullary thymocytes and has been cited as supporting a medullary rather than cortical exit site. Using the monoclonal antibody MEL-14, we identify a 1%–3% subpopulation of thymocytes that expresses high levels of a receptor molecule involved in lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes. We present evidence that these rare MEL-14hi thymocytes are predominantly of mature phenotype and represent the major source of thymus emigrants. Surprisingly, MEL-14hi thymocytes are exclusively cortical in location, although their mature phenotype may allow them to masquerade as medullary cells in conventional studies. We also demonstrate that unlike medullary thymocytes, many cortisone-resistant thymocytes (CRT) are MEL-14hi. Thus, in contrast to current dogma, CRT do not represent a sample of medullary thymocytes as they are found in situ and their level of immunocompetence does not necessarily reflect that of the medullary population. Our findings refute the hypothesis that phenotypically and functionally mature cells are restricted to the medulla, and support our proposition that most thymus emigrants are derived from the MEL-14hi cortical subset."
https://openalex.org/W1577997208,"Two systems were used to generate collagen fibrils in vitro by enzymic cleavage of intermediates in the conversion of procollagen to collagen. In one system fibrils were generated by using procollagen NH2-terminal proteinase to cleave pNcollagen, the intermediate which contains the NH2-terminal but not the COOH-terminal propeptides found in procollagen. When pNcollagen was incubated with procollagen NH2-terminal proteinase, the NH2-terminal propeptides were enzymically cleaved from the protein, and there was an increase in the turbidity of the solution over and above the turbidity observed with pNcollagen alone. Electron microscope examination of the samples demonstrated that the increase in turbidity was associated with the assembly of collagen fibrils. The fibrils had a mean diameter of 104 nm +/- 51.7 S.D. or about the same as fibrils formed from pNcollagen alone. However, the fibrils formed by enzymic cleavage of pNcollagen had a more distinct gap-overlap pattern and they appeared to be more tightly packed than fibrils of pNcollagen. Varying the concentration of enzyme varied both the rate of enzymic cleavage of the pNcollagen and the rate of fibril assembly, but there was no consistent effect on the diameter or morphology of the fibrils. In the second system, fibrils were generated with a recently described procedure (Miyahara, M., Njieha, F. K., and Prockop, D. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8442-8448) in which procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase is used to cleave pCcollagen, the intermediate containing the COOH-terminal but not the NH2-terminal propeptides found in procollagen. When incubated with procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase, the COOH-terminal propeptides were cleaved and collagen fibrils assembled. The collagen fibrils were unusually thick with a mean diameter of 1184 nm +/- 291 S.D. The large diameters of the fibrils made it possible to demonstrate by scanning electron microscopy that each fibril was comprised of a bundle of subfibrils packed into a right-handed helix. The fibrils frequently had branch points which appeared to consist of subfibrils which separated from the main axis of the structure. Also, the surface of the fibrils was scalloped at 270- to 300-nm intervals, suggesting that some of the collagen molecules on the surface were in a 4D staggered array. The results suggested the hypothesis that the order in which the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal propeptides are cleaved in the conversion of procollagen to collagen may provide a mechanism for controlling the diameter, or both the diameter and morphology, of collagen fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2023913486,"Mutations at the fushi tarazu locus in Drosophila melanogaster affect both segment number and the pattern of cuticular structures on alternating segments of embryos. The ftz gene has been cloned and characterized. Two mutations, ftzw20 and ftzRpl are associated with lesions in a 3.2 kb fragment of DNA cloned in the Antennepedia Complex (ANT-C) chromosome “walk.” The structure of DNA isolated from the ftzw20 and ftzRpl chromosomes indicates that the mutations are associated with a 4.9 kb insertion of DNA and a chromosomal rearrangement breakpoint, respectively. The 3.2 kb genomic DNA fragment hybridizes to a 1.8 kb polyadenylated transcript which accumulates maximally at 2–4 hr of embryonic development. The ftzw20 and ftzRpl mutations have different phenotypic consequences for the developing embryo, although both mutations interrupt the 1.8 kb transcription unit. The genetic and molecular data indicate that the 1.8 kb transcript derives from the ftz locus. The gene products are synthesized and utilized several hours prior to the visibly detectable morphogenetic events which the gene apparently regulates."
https://openalex.org/W1491296468,"Mitochondrial imports of acylcarnitine and carnitine have been measured by new methods based on the monitoring of deacylation of acylcarnitines and the acetylation of carnitine in the matrix, subsequent to their entry. These methods have shown higher import rates than those calculated from the uptake of radioactive carnitines into mitochondria as employed until presently. This new approach has permitted the import of long chain acylcarnitine to be followed unambiguously; the results have confirmed that the carnitine acylcarnitine translocase is indeed involved in this import which also proceeds by a mole to mole exchange-diffusion against internal carnitine. Depletion of matrix carnitine greatly decreased the substrate import rates based on their uptake assay but much less so when the deacylation and acylation techniques were employed to monitor imports. These results have revealed that there is a small pool of carnitine in the matrix which readily equilibrates with the medium carnitine through the translocase but which equilibrates with the larger matrix carnitine pool slowly. This finding has necessitated reinterpretation of several previous observations on the translocase that were based on the assumption of a single matrix carnitine pool and in which the translocase was assumed to constitute the rate-limiting step in the activity measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2011235121,"We have studied two derivatives of the IgA (lambda 2) secreting myeloma cell line MOPC315:MOPC315.26, which produces and secretes a lambda 2 light chain, and MOPC315.37, which produces but does not secrete the lambda 2 chain. It has been reported that the only alteration in the MOPC315-37 lambda 2 chain is located in the variable region (Mosmann and Williamson, (1980) Cell 20, 283-292). In order to determine the nature of this alteration, we cloned the fragment of the chromosome containing the rearranged lambda 2 gene from both the nonsecreting variant MOPC315-37 and the normal lambda 2-secreting parent MOPC315-26 and determined their nucleotide sequence. We found that the nucleotide sequences coding for the leader peptide and for the constant region of the lambda 2 chain were identical in the secretor and nonsecretor. The sequences of the variable region differed at a single base pair corresponding to the first nucleotide in the codon for amino acid number 15. MOPC315-26 has a G in this position creating the codon GGT which codes for glycine, and MOPC315-37 has a C in this position creating the codon CGT which codes for arginine. Thus, we have demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution of a neutral amino acid, glycine, for a positively charged amino acid, arginine, results in the failure of a protein to be secreted."
https://openalex.org/W1583322461,"Abstract GH3 rat anterior pituitary cells possess a Na+/Ca2+ exchange transport mechanism which is present in purified plasma membrane vesicles prepared from these cells. Imposition of an outwardly directed Na+ gradient in vesicles results in a marked concentrative uptake of Ca2+ which is abolished by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Transport activity depends on a sustained Na+ gradient. Dissipation of the driving force by treatment with Na+ ionophores or by passive gradient collapse abolished transport activity. The exchange reaction is completely reversible since addition of extravesicular Na+ enhances Ca2+ efflux from Ca2+ loaded vesicles. A kinetic analysis of Na+/Ca2+ exchange indicates saturation kinetics for both substrates with apparent values of Km for Na+ and Ca2+ of 17 mM and 5 microM, respectively, and a Vmax of about 8 nmol/min/mg of protein for Ca2+ uptake at 25 degrees C. In addition to Na+/Ca2+ exchange, the transporter functions in a Ca2+/Ca2+ exchange mode with an apparent Km of 20 microM and Vmax of 16 nmol/min/mg of protein for Ca2+ influx. Na+/Ca2+ exchange is not inhibited by protonophores indicating that Ca2+ flux does not occur via coupled Na+/H+, Ca2+/H+ exchange. Transport is inhibited by derivatives of the pyrazine diuretic amiloride. The pH dependency of Ca2+ uptake displays a sigmoidal relationship with stimulation of activity at alkaline pH and inhibition at acid pH. Furthermore, the reaction is electrogenic (i.e. more than 2 Na+ transported per Ca2+) as demonstrated by stimulated uptake of lipophilic cations during exchange and by effects of artificially imposed membrane potentials on the rate of Ca2+ transport. Plasma membrane vesicles prepared from bovine anterior pituitary glands also display Na+/Ca2+ exchange with many of the same characteristics. These results support the notion that Na+/Ca2+ exchange functions in Ca2+ homeostasis in pituitary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1234052980,"Phospholipid has been reported to be necessary for optimal catalytic activity of a number of mammalian cytochrome P-450 (P-450) systems. We also confirm that a number of individual phospholipids and mixtures, used as soluble monomers or phospholipid vesicles, show activation of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity by an enzyme system composed of rat liver microsomal P-450PB-B and NADPH-P-450 reductase. However, by preincubating a mixture of P-450 and NADPH-P-450 reductase at high concentrations, optimal activity can be obtained in the absence of phospholipid. The catalytic activity of the complex formed is concentration dependent in the absence of lipid or in the presence of soluble lipid. The activity in phospholipid vesicles is optimal and concentration independent. The apparent Km for NADPH-P-450 reductase in P-450-dependent oxidation systems is lowered severalfold in the presence of phospholipid. The apparent Km for the P-450 substrate, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and the temperature dependence of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity were unaffected by the addition of phospholipid to a preformed complex of P-450PB-B and NADPH-P-450 reductase. The effect of lipid on a number of other P-450 isozymes was also examined and in no case did lipid enhance the catalytic activity of the preformed complex. These results lead to the conclusion that the major effect of phospholipids in P-450-based enzyme systems is the facilitation of an active P-450:NADPH-P-450 reductase complex. This is the first report that maximum P-450 supported monooxygenase activity can be obtained in the absence of phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1585690374,"A vitamin D-dependent Mr = 28,000 calcium-binding protein (CaBP) has been isolated from rat kidney. Rat renal CaBP was purified from heat-treated post-mitochondrial supernatants by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. The specific properties and characteristics of the protein were examined. Rat renal CaBP was found to have a pI of 4.8 and showed increased electrophoretic mobility during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. Amino acid analysis of renal CaBP revealed a high content of glutamic and aspartic acids and a low level of methionine, histidine, cysteine, and tyrosine, similar but not identical to chick intestinal CaBP. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the alpha-helical content of renal CaBP was of the order of 31% and was changed to a minor degree by the addition of calcium. A study of the thermal stability indicated that renal CaBP is heat-stable up to 75 degrees C. Binding studies utilizing the technique of equilibrium dialysis established a dissociation constant of 2.1 X 10(-6) M and binding sites with a capacity of approximately 4 mol Ca2+/mol of CaBP. Immunologically, using Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, a precipitin line which joined with total coalescence with that due to purified renal CaBP was observed with extracts of rat brain and kidney but not with extracts of rat parathyroid, skeletal muscle, myocardium, bone, pancreas, intestine, and liver. In summary, these studies present the first purification and characterization of vitamin D-dependent rat renal calcium-binding protein. The antibody as well as the protein will be useful for the development of a radioimmunoassay and for the determination of the molecular mechanisms of induction of renal calcium-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2066467756,"We have examined the process by which the 3' terminus of the Drosophila histone H3 mRNA is produced in vitro. When a template containing a portion of DNA that flanks the normal 3' end of the histone H3 gene and an oligo dC tail on the template strand is transcribed in vitro by Drosophila RNA polymerase II, transcription continues beyond the 3' end of the H3 gene. A processing activity was identified that cleaves the precursor transcript generating an RNA species with the same 3' end as the mature H3 mRNA. The processing activity was partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and sucrose gradient sedimentation. The isolated activity was found to require Mg++ but did not require addition of a nucleoside triphosphate for activity. The activity sedimented with a molecular weight of approximately 140,000 daltons. Transcription of the template and processing of the RNA can be uncoupled in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2111531151,"Absolute configurations of the arene 1,2-oxides formed from napththalene and anthracene by cytochrome P-450c, the predominant isozyme of cytochrome P-450 found in the livers of rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene, were determined via two different approaches. The first consisted of trapping the arene oxides with N-acetyl-L-cysteine to form S-conjugates, methylation of the conjugates with diazomethane, and separation of the resulting diastereomeric esters by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis by this procedure of the arene oxides formed from radioactive naphthalene and anthracene by a highly purified and reconstituted monooxygenase system containing cytochrome P-450c indicated that 73 and greater than or equal to 95%, respectively, of the metabolically formed arene oxides consisted of the (+)-(1R,2S)-enantiomer. In the second approach, each hydrocarbon was incubated with a reconstituted system containing both cytochrome P-450c and epoxide hydrolase. Under these conditions, the predominant metabolites are trans-1,2-dihydrodiols formed by epoxide hydrolase catalyzed trans-addition of water to the arene oxide intermediates. In both cases, the (-)-(1R,2R)-dihydrodiols predominated; 92% for naphthalene and 99% for anthracene. Enzyme-catalyzed addition of water to (+)- and (-)-anthracene 1,2-oxide and (+)-napthalene 1,2-oxide occurred exclusively (greater than 99%) at the allylic 2-position. The (-)-(1S,2R)-naphthalene 1,2-oxide, however, is converted to a 40:60 mixture of the (-)-(1R,2R)- and (+)-(1S,2S)-dihydrodiols by benzylic and allylic attack, respectively, resulting in increased enantiomeric purity of the dihydrodiol relative to the oxide. Thus, qualitatively and quantitatively both approaches indicate that the (+)-arene (1R,2S)-oxides predominate. The results are discussed in terms of the steric constraints of a proposed model for the catalytic binding site of cytochrome P-450c."
https://openalex.org/W2145686360,"Chloroquine inhibits the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols at a concentration of 10 microM or more in mouse L cells but has no effect on fatty acid synthesis and CO2 production from the same substrate even at a 10-fold higher concentration of the drug. The site of inhibition is distal to the formation of mevalonate since chloroquine also inhibits [14C]mevalonate metabolism to sterols and does not decrease the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) or the incorporation of [14C]acetate into the total nonsaponifiable lipids. Analyses by thin layer and high pressure liquid chromatography of the nonsaponifiable lipid fraction from cultures incubated with chloroquine show an accumulation of radioactivity in the region of squalene oxide. Identification of the radiolabeled lipid as squalene oxide has been established by: (a) its co-migration with the authentic squalene oxide standard; (b) its conversion into squalene glycol by acid hydrolysis; and (c) its further metabolism to desmosterol when chloroquine is removed from the medium. Addition of chloroquine (12.5-50 microM) to 20,000 X g supernatant fractions of mouse liver homogenates inhibits the incorporation of [14C]mevalonolactone into cholesterol and lanosterol, with corresponding increases of [14C]squalene oxides, in a concentration-dependent manner. It appears, therefore, that chloroquine inhibits the enzymatic step catalyzed by 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase (EC 5.4.99.7). Incubation of cell cultures with chloroquine (50 microM) arrests cell growth and causes cell death after 1-3 days. However, simultaneous incubation of chloroquine with either cholesterol or lanosterol prevents cell death and permits cell growth. Uptake of chloroquine is not affected by exogenous sterols since intracellular chloroquine concentrations are the same in cells grown with or without added sterols. The cytotoxicity of chloroquine, under our experimental conditions, must, therefore, be due primarily to its inhibition of sterol synthesis. In addition to its well known effect on protein catabolism, chloroquine has been found to inhibit protein synthesis. The significance of these findings concerning the use of chloroquine in studying the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539141878,"The actions of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) to stimulate the production of progesterone and the synthesis of cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome P-450ssc) and adrenodoxin were investigated in bovine granulosa cells maintained in primary monolayer culture. Treatment of granulosa cells in culture with FSH resulted in an increased incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable cytochrome P-450scc in a concentration-dependent fashion with a maximal effect being obtained at an FSH concentration of 500 ng/ml. Treatment of granulosa cells with FSH also resulted in the induction of synthesis of adrenodoxin. The cyclic AMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, induced the synthesis of both cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin to a greater extent than did FSH. LDL also stimulated the synthesis of both cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin, when added to cells maintained in the presence of lipoprotein-poor serum. The presence of FSH or 8-Br-cAMP together with LDL resulted in a higher rate of enzyme synthesis than that observed with each effector alone. FSH, 8-Br-cAMP, and LDL also stimulated progesterone production by cultured granulosa cells. The results of this study offer a possible mechanism whereby granulosa cells undergo cytodifferentiation in vivo into luteal cells. The concentration of LDL in follicular fluid is very low. Following ovulation, vascularization of the follicle occurs and thus the granulosa cells are exposed to high levels of LDL, allowing for provision of substrate cholesterol, as well as stimulation of the synthesis of the enzymes involved in cholesterol side chain cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1571719006,"Covalent adducts formed from the ultimate carcinogen 7 beta,8 alpha-dihydroxy-9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[ a]pyrene inhibit the enzyme-catalyzed transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to cytosine residues in DNA. Two DNA methyltransferase enzymes, isolated from the bacterium Haemophilus and mouse spleen nuclei, were tested for their ability to methylate carcinogen-modified substrates in vitro. These model enzymes possess the known methylation activities found in mammalian cells, de novo, and maintenance methylation of CpG-containing nucleotide sequences. The in vitro alkylation of DNA substrates by the carcinogen effectively decreases the methyltransferase reaction of both enzymes in a manner that is directly dependent upon the level of covalent modification of the DNA. Inhibition of de novo methylation activity can be detected at very low levels of carcinogen modification, 1 hydrocarbon residue per 20,000-40,000 nucleotides. Adduct levels in this range are capable of initiating transformation. Both enzymes are inactivated by direct reaction with the carcinogen in the absence of DNA. We also find that carcinogen adducts are capable of inhibiting DNA methylation at CpG sites removed from the primary lesion. These results support the proposal that carcinogen-induced DNA damage can cause alterations in methylation patterns that may eventually lead to heritable changes in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1736691240,"Virginiamycin M inhibits both peptide bond formation and binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to bacterial ribosomes, and induces a lasting inactivation of the 50 S subunit (50 S). In the present work, the effects of this antibiotic on the acceptor and donor sites of peptidyltransferase have been explored, in the presence of virginiamycin M as well as after its removal. Virginiamycin M inhibited the binding of puromycin to ribosomes and reduced both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic binding of Phe-tRNA to the A site by inducing its release from the ribosomes (similar effects were observed with 50 S), whereas the antibiotic had no effect on the binding of unacylated tRNAPhe to the same site. Moreover, virginiamycin M caused Ac-Phe-tRNA or Phe-tRNA to be released from the ribosomal P site, when complexes were incubated with unacylated tRNA, elongation factor G, and GTP (similar finding with 50 S). Instead, peptide bond formation between Ac-Phe-tRNA positioned at the P site and Phe-tRNA at the A site was found to take place, albeit at a very low rate, in the presence of the antibiotic. The overall conclusion is that both the acceptor and donor substrate binding sites of the peptidyltransferase, which interact with the aminoacyl moiety of tRNA, are permanently altered upon transient contact of ribosomes with virginiamycin M."
https://openalex.org/W1543557649,"The ciliary membrane of Tetrahymena pyriformis is physically and metabolically remote from the main centers of lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, it possesses an independent capacity to modify its phospholipid molecular species composition rapidly under stress. The role of ciliary phospholipid deacylating and reacylating enzymes in this phenomenon has been evaluated. Isolated cilia showed substantial phospholipase A (combined A1 and A2), acyl-CoA synthetase and acyltransferase activities. Activities of all the three enzymes of cilia from 39 degrees C-grown cells were greatly reduced when the cilia were incubated at 15 degrees C. In contrast, the phospholipase A and acyltransferase activities in cilia from 15 degrees C-grown cells were surprisingly high at 15 degrees C and twice as high at 37 degrees C as were the equivalent activities in preparations from 39 degrees C-grown cells. While the in vivo substrate specificity of phospholipase A could not be meaningfully assessed, the acyltransferases exhibited a temperature-dependent substrate specificity in vivo. Growth temperature also affected the positional distribution of fatty acids incorporated into ciliary phospholipids in vivo. The ability of acyltransferases to utilize added [14C] acyl-CoA could be markedly stimulated, and their lipid class specificity could be significantly altered in vitro by supplementing the incubation mixture with exogenous lysophospholipid acceptors. These findings suggest that the rate-limiting factor in acyl chain turnover is not the activity of acyltransferases per se but rather the availability of suitable substrates and acceptors. Therefore, we postulate that temperature alters the rate and specificity of ciliary membrane phospholipid retailoring primarily by controlling the in situ phospholipase A activity."

https://openalex.org/W1557427481,"Reaction microcalorimetry and equilibrium dialysis have been used to study the binding of AMP and IMP to glycogen phosphorylase b (EC 2.4.1.1) at 25 degrees C and pH 6.9. The combination of both techniques has enabled us to obtain some of the thermodynamic parameters for these binding processes. Four binding sites were found to be present in the dimeric active enzyme for both AMP and IMP. The binding to two high-affinity sites, which, in our opinion, correspond to the activator sites, seems to be cooperative. The two low-affinity sites, which would then correspond to the inhibitor sites, appear to be independent when the nucleotides bind to the enzyme. The negative delta G0 of binding/site at 25 degrees C is the result in all cases of a balance between negative enthalpy and entropy changes. The large differences in delta H and delta S0 for the binding of AMP to the activator sites (-27 and -70 kJ mol-1; -22 and -150 J X K-1 mol-1) suggest the existence of rather extensive conformational changes taking place in phosphorylase b on binding with the allosteric activator. Whereas the affinity of AMP for the activator sites is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of IMP, the affinity of both nucleotides, including their delta H and delta S0 values, seems to be the same for the inhibitor sites."
https://openalex.org/W98231265,"In previous studies on glycosyltransferase activities in porcine trachea, we demonstrated the presence of two galactosyltransferases which transfer galactose from UDP-galactose to N-acetylglucosamine (Sheares, B.T. and Carlson, D.M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9893-9898). One enzyme, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase, synthesized galactosyl-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosamine while the other, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase, synthesized galactosyl-beta 1,4-N-acetylglucosamine. A third galactosyltransferase has now been demonstrated utilizing a solubilized membrane preparation from pig trachea, which also synthesizes galactosyl-beta 1,4-N-acetylglucosamine as determined by gas-liquid chromatography and Diplococcus pneumoniae beta-galactosidase treatment. This new UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase is distinct from the lactose synthetase A protein in that it does not bind to alpha-lactalbumin-agarose or to N-acetylglucosamine-agarose. The enzyme is separable from the UDP-galactose:N-acetylgalactosaminyl-mucin 3 beta-galactosyltransferase by affinity chromatography on asialo ovine submaxillary mucin adsorbed to DEAE-Sephacel. This newly discovered 4 beta-galactosyltransferase binds to UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose and is partially separated from UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography. Neither high concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine (200 mM) nor alpha-lactalbumin inhibits the incorporation of galactose into galactosyl-beta 1,4-N-acetylglucosamine by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1570374272,The Na+-dependent phosphate transport system in the brush border of rabbit kidney exhibits a positive requirement for a divalent metal ion. Treatment of the brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) with a divalent metal chelator in combination with the divalent metal ionophore A23187 dramatically and selectively decreased the Na+-dependent uptake of phosphate; Na+-independent uptake of phosphate was not affected. The combination of chelator plus A23187 also inhibited uptake of phosphate in the presence of Na+ but in the absence of a gradient for sodium across the BBMV. This indicates that the inhibitor is not a result of an alteration in the Na+ gradient by chelator plus ionophore. The inhibited Na+ gradient-dependent transport of phosphate was restored by removing the chelator and adding Mn2+ to the BBMV. The phosphate-binding proteolipid (phosphorin) isolated from rabbit kidney BBMV binds inorganic phosphate with high affinity and specificity. Binding of phosphate to phosphorin is also inhibited by divalent metal chelators and can be restored by addition of a divalent metal. We conclude that a divalent metal ion is required both for the Na+-dependent phosphate transport in BBMV and for the binding of phosphate to the proteolipid phosphorin. These findings are consistent with our suggestion that phosphorin is a component of the Na+-dependent phosphate transport system in renal brush-border membranes.
https://openalex.org/W1547690943,"Incubation of apoprotein A-I (apo-A-I), the major protein component of human high density lipoprotein, with rat liver microsomal membranes under conditions of elevated pH and ionic strength leads to the production of a soluble protein:lipid complex (A-I/MM complex). The A-I/MM complex, as purified by density gradient centrifugation and agarose column chromatography, possesses a lipid composition similar to the hepatic microsomal membrane and a protein/lipid ratio similar to that of plasma high density lipoproteins, but markedly different from that of recombinant particles prepared with synthetic lipids. The A-I/MM complex constitutes a more physiological recombinant particle than can be formed using synthetic lipids and may be a suitable model for the newly assembled intracellular high density lipoproteins. Incubation of the erythrocyte plasma membranes with apo-A-I under the same conditions as used with microsomal membranes fails to generate any lipid:apoprotein complexes. This membrane specificity for forming soluble lipoprotein complexes suggests that the microsomal membranes possess a unique feature, possibly their lipid composition, which render them particularly suitable to serve as lipid donors to the apoproteins which are undergoing assembly within the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi organelles."
