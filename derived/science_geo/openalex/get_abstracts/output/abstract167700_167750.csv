In addition, mice lacking CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) develop a nephrotic syndrome that resembles NPHS mutations suggesting that all three proteins are essential for the integrity of glomerular podocytes. Although the precise glomerular function of either protein remains unknown, it has been suggested that nephrin forms zipper-like interactions to maintain the structure of podocyte foot processes. We demonstrate now that nephrin is a signaling molecule, which stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases. Nephrin-induced signaling is greatly enhanced by podocin, which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of nephrin. Mutational analysis suggests that abnormal or inefficient signaling through the nephrin-podocin complex contributes to the development of podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria.

The most severe disorder is the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, caused by mutations in NPHS1,1 the gene encoding for nephrin. The disease manifests itself with massive proteinuria in utero and nephrosis at birth (1Kestila M. Lenkkeri U. Mannikko M. Lamerdin J. McCready P. Putaala H. Ruotsalainen V. Morita T. Nissinen M.

The nephrotic syndrome usually leads to death during the first 2 years of life unless the patient undergoes renal transplantation (2Holmberg C. Antikainen M. Ronnholm K. Ala Houhala M. Jalanko H. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1995; 9: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nephrin is an integral membrane protein located at opposing sites of the secondary foot processes formed by podocytes, a specialized epithelial cell that ensures size- and charge-selective ultrafiltration (reviewed in Ref.3Tryggvason K. Wartiovaara J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 10: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The precise function of nephrin is unknown; however, it appears to form a zipper-like filter structure within the ∼40-nm-wide slit between two foot processes (4Ruotsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome caused by mutations of NPHS2, the gene encoding for podocin, follows a milder clinical course. Proteinuria often starts several months after birth but can be delayed for several years (5Boute N. Gribouval O. Roselli S. Benessy F. Lee H. Fuchshuber A. Dahan K. Gubler M.C. Niaudet P. Antignac C.

Genet. 1995; 4: 2155-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). NPHS2 encodes for podocin, a protein exclusively expressed in the podocytes of the developing and mature glomeruli. Podocin is a member of the stomatin protein family with a short N-terminal domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytosolic C-terminal domain. Podocin is predicted to form a membrane-associated hairpin-like structure with a cytosolic N- and C-terminal domain that is typical for stomatin-like proteins and caveolins. CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is an adapter molecule that was first identified as an SH3-containing protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 (7Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J.

Surprisingly, mice lacking CD2AP exhibit a nephrotic syndrome that resembles NPHS1 mutations (8Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Because CD2AP appears to interact with the cytoplasmic tail of nephrin, these findings suggested that CD2AP and nephrin participate in a common signaling pathway necessary to maintain crucial podocyte functions. Using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, a cell line that lacks nephrin, podocin, and CD2AP, we demonstrated that nephrin is a signaling molecule. Expression of nephrin in HEK 293T cells triggers cellular activation that involves stimulation of the stress-activated protein kinase p38 and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Cellular activation is greatly enhanced by podocin, which binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of nephrin but fails to bind and augment nephrin R1160 X, a nephrin mutation truncated by a nonsense mutation at Arg1160 (9Lenkkeri U. Mannikko M. McCready P. Lamerdin J. Gribouval O. Niaudet P.M. Antignac C.K. Kashtan C.E. Homberg C. Olsen A. Kestila M. Tryggvason K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that nephrin and podocin form a signaling complex that supports the functional and structural integrity of glomerular podocytes. The human podocin cDNA sequence was used to search for mouse EST clones containing podocin nucleotide sequence (standard nucleotide BLAST, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Clone AW106985 was identified to contain the complete coding region of mouse podocin (GenBankTM accession number AY050309). To generate C-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length human nephrin the 5-prime sequence was isolated by polymerase chain reaction from a human kidney library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and inserted into clone NPHS902 kindly provided by Dr. Karl Tryggvason (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden); the FLAG-tag was inserted at the 3′ end of the coding sequence to create a C-terminally FLAG-tagged construct (denoted as Nephrin.F). Membrane-bound fusion proteins of the C-terminal and N-terminal cytoplasmic domains of podocin and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of nephrin were generated using a pCDM8 cassette that contained the leader sequence of CD5 fused to the CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1 followed by the transmembrane region of CD7 (10Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described (11Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed twice and lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody, followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for ∼3 h. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. HEK 293T cells seeded in 12-well plates were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct, a β-galactosidase expression vector (kindly provided by C. Cepko), and vectors directing the expression of the proteins as indicated. Total DNA amount was 1.5–2.0 μg/well. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h, harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT) for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to remove insoluble material. Luciferase activity was determined using a commercial assay system (Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT) and normalized for β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. Equal expression of proteins was ensured by Western blot analysis. To determine the phosphorylation status of p38 and c-Jun, dually phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated c-Jun were visualized by Western blot analysis, using phosphospecific antisera (New England Biolabs). Equal loading was confirmed by reprobing the membrane with the non-phospho-antibodies and by Amido Black staining. The degree of phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun was quantified by densitometry of non-saturated radiographs with the NIH Image software. The domain architecture of the extracellular domain of nephrin, containing eight immunoglobulins, a fibronectin type III-like domain repeat, and a single transmembrane domain, suggests that nephrin is as an adhesion molecule involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Based on the structure of the glomerular podocyte slit diaphragm (12Rodewald R. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and the electron microscopic localization of nephrin (4Ruotsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the N-terminal six immunoglobulin repeats of nephrin form interdigitating zipper-like homophilic interactions (4Ruotsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 13Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2440-2445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of nephrin is relatively short but contains several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. In particular, Tyr1176, Tyr1193, and Tyr1210 are predicted to serve as potential docking sites for SH2 domain-containing adapter and signaling molecules (cansite.bidmc.harvard.edu/, medium stringency). Because overexpression of surface receptors can initiate signaling in a ligand-independent fashion (14Zhou B.P. Hu M.C. Miller S.A., Yu, Z. Xia W. Lin S.Y. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8027-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Weng L.P. Yuan J. Yu Q. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we assayed the activity of AP-1 transcription factor in HEK 293T cells expressing nephrin. Fig. 1 demonstrates that nephrin caused a substantial increase (∼20-fold) in AP-1-dependent luciferase activity. In contrast, serum triggered a 3-fold increase (data not shown), whereas podocin and CD2AP alone had only marginal effects on AP-1 activation (Fig. 1). Interestingly, podocin synergistically augmented nephrin-mediated AP-1 activation, yielding a nearly 40-fold transactivation of the luciferase construct. Western blot analysis revealed that this augmentation was not the result of altered protein levels (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, CD2AP had only a marginal effect on nephrin-mediated AP-1 activation (Fig. 1 B) and did not further augment the synergism between nephrin and podocin (data not shown). AP-1 is composed of homodimers and heterodimers of Jun, Fos, or activating transcription factor family members and modulates a variety of cellular programs, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 16Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). Using AP-1 as a downstream target of nephrin signaling in combination with dominant-negative mutations of protein kinases and small G-proteins, we determined that nephrin activates stress-activated p38 protein kinase as well as c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase JNK (17Arnould T. Kim E. Tsiokas L. Jochimsen F. Gruning W. Chang J.D. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Tsiokas L. Cohen H.T. Kim E. Walz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3423-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, dominant-negative mutants of small G-proteins (Cdc42, Rac1, RhoA) and protein kinases that activate JNK (MKK4) and p38 (MKK3, MKK6) inhibited the nephrin-mediated AP-1 activation. In contrast, a dominant-negative MEK1 had no effect on the nephrin-mediated AP-1 activation, indicating that nephrin stimulates p38 and JNK but not ERK1/ERK2. Similar results were obtained for the AP-1 activation triggered by nephrin in combination with podocin (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that podocin increases the efficiency of nephrin signaling without recruiting additional signaling molecules. To confirm these results, we monitored the phosphorylation status of p38 and c-Jun, using phosphospecific antisera. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 C, nephrin triggers phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun that is significantly augmented by podocin. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that nephrin is a signaling molecule that can activate canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. The structural similarities of podocin to other stomatin-like proteins suggest that podocin forms homo-oligomers to facilitate recruitment of nephrin to specialized membrane domains. We speculated therefore that the synergistic effect of podocin on nephrin signaling results from a direct interaction between podocin and nephrin in vivo. Fig.3 A demonstrates that the cytoplasmic tail of nephrin binds podocin. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domain of podocin (Fig. 3 B). The Fin-major (2-base pair deletion in exon 2 that results in a frameshift and introduces a stop codon within the same exon) and the Fin-minor (nonsense mutation in exon 26 resulting in a stop at Arg1109) mutations are the two most common mutations, found in more than 90% of all Finnish patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (NPHS1). However, neither the Fin-major nor the Fin-minor mutant is expressed, and nephrin is completely absent in patients with either mutation. To determine the significance of AP-1 signaling in congenital nephrotic syndrome, caused by NPHS1 mutations, we truncated nephrin at amino acid 1160, corresponding to the most C-terminal nephrin truncation reported in patients to date (9Lenkkeri U. Mannikko M. McCready P. Lamerdin J. Gribouval O. Niaudet P.M. Antignac C.K. Kashtan C.E. Homberg C. Olsen A. Kestila M. Tryggvason K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 19Beltcheva O. Martin P. Lenkkeri U. Tryggvason K. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This truncation deletes the three potential SH2-binding sites but retains several other potential tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation sites. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 C, the truncated nephrin bound only marginal amounts of podocin, indicating that a sufficient interaction between podocin and nephrin requires the C-terminal 81 amino acids of nephrin. In contrast, neither nephrin nor podocin interacted with CD2AP (Fig. 3 D), and CD2AP did not affect the binding between nephrin and podocin (data not shown). Surprisingly, the nephrin R1160 X mutation promotes a high level of AP-1 activation that was not significantly different from wild-type nephrin (Fig. 3 E). Because this nephrin mutation failed to bind podocin, we speculated that one important function of podocin is the augmentation of nephrin signaling. To test this hypothesis, the nephrin R1160 X truncation was co-expressed with podocin. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 E, podocin failed to significantly augment the AP-1 activation mediated by the nephrin R1160 Xmutant, whereas both podocin and the nephrin mutation were well expressed (Fig. 3 F). Our results suggest that the function of nephrin is contingent on three requirements: expression of functionally intact protein, targeting of nephrin to the secondary foot processes, and efficient signaling of nephrin originating at the slit diaphragms. Most nephrin mutations, including the Fin-major and Fin-minor mutations, result in the absence of protein (20Patrakka J. Kestila M. Wartiovaara J. Ruotsalainen V. Tissari P. Lenkkeri U. Mannikko M. Visapaa I. Holmberg C. Rapola J. Tryggvason K. Jalanko H. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 972-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), thereby completely abrogating nephrin function. In contrast, the nephrin R1160 X mutation appears to be well expressed, at least in a heterologous expression system, and retains the ability to activate AP-1. However, it fails to interact with podocin. Based on the predicted structure of podocin and its potential to form membrane-associated homo-oligomers, podocin may serve two closely related functions: the recruitment and/or stabilization of nephrin at the podocyte foot process, and the augmentation of nephrin signaling, perhaps by organizing specialized nephrin-containing microdomains. It is therefore conceivable that nephrin signaling is preserved in patients with NPHS2 mutations but greatly reduced. We assayed the formation of AP-1 transcriptional activity as a marker for cellular activation; however, it is likely that signaling by the nephrin-podocin complex triggers additional cellular signaling cascades and programs aimed to preserve the structural integrity of the podocyte slit diaphragm. CD2AP did not contribute to the AP-1 activation mediated by the nephrin-podocin complex. However, it is possible that CD2AP is ultimately required to activate the specific downstream target of nephrin-podocin signaling, essential for normal podocyte function. Overexpression of nephrin ± podocin in a heterologous cell system may prove to be an efficient way to identify crucial signaling cascades and target genes that maintain podocyte function and integrity.

In liver, LPL is also believed to promote uptake of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and thereby facilitate reverse cholesterol transport. In this study we show that the Lpl gene is a direct target of the oxysterol liver X receptor, LXRα. Mice fed diets containing high cholesterol or an LXR-selective agonist exhibited a significant increase in LPL expression in the liver and macrophages, but not in other tissues (e.g. adipose and muscle). Studies inLxr-deficient mice confirmed that this response was dependent more on the presence of LXRα than LXRβ. Analysis of theLpl gene revealed the presence of a functional DR4 LXR response element in the intronic region between exons 1 and 2. This response element directly binds rexinoid receptor (RXR)/LXR heterodimers and is sufficient for rexinoid- and LXR agonist-induced transcription of the Lpl gene. Together, these studies further distinguish the roles of LXRα and β and support a growing body of evidence that LXRs function as key regulators of lipid metabolism and are anti-atherogenic.

Mice harboring Lxr-null mutations lack the ability to sense dietary cholesterol and as a consequence fail to regulate a number of lipid metabolic pathways, including cholesterol absorption and transport, and bile acid synthesis. Several lines of evidence suggest that, in addition to sterol metabolism, LXRs reciprocally regulate fatty acid metabolism. For example, in wild-type mice dietary cholesterol induces a marked increase in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, whereas cholesterol levels are maintained at normal levels due to increased catabolism. This phenotype is reversed in Lxrα knockout animals, which accumulate high levels of cholesterol but show no increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and have normal triglyceride levels (25Peet D.J.

Recently, we have shown that the cholesterol-induced elevation in fatty acid synthesis is due to the direct activation by LXRs of the gene encoding SREBP-1c (36Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.

SREBP-1c is the primary transcription factor responsible for regulating fatty acid synthesis in the liver and peripheral tissues (16Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 38Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the coordinate regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism by LXRs provides a means by which the body may protect itself from elevated levels of cholesterol. These findings prompted us to investigate other lipid-regulating genes as potential targets of LXRα and LXRβ action. In this work we show that cholesterol-induced LPL gene expression in the liver is directly regulated by RXR/LXR heterodimers in a tissue-specific manner and that in vivo this regulation is mediated predominantly by LXRα. These studies define a new mechanism for governing tissue-specific LPL expression and further expand the role of the LXRs as key regulators of lipid metabolism. LG268, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and T0901317 were acquired from Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Steraloids Inc., and Tularik, Inc, respectively. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was obtained from Intracel Corp. (Rockville, MD). Mouse Lpl gene sequences were obtained from GenBank™. The promoter region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from mouse genomic DNA using primers 5′-CCTTAGAAAACGGATCGTAGACTACTCAAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCACTCTTCTCGCTTCTAGAGGCGTCTG-3′. A fragment spanning nucleotide −289 to +752 of the promoter was cloned intoSmaI-XhoI sites of pGL2-basic vector (Promega). Mutations at the DR4.2 site (+635) were created by SOE (Splicing by Overlap Extention) polymerase chain reaction (39Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-CTGTAGTGAGGGGTGGTGAGGTCCCTATAGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CTATAGGGACCTCACCACCCCTCACTACAGCTTTG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined). To create DR4.1-TK-LUC and DR4.2-TK-LUC, oligonucleotides (sequences shown in Fig. 4) withBamHI overhang sequences were ligated into theBamHI site of the TK-LUC vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Animal experiments were approved by the Institution Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and were conducted as described previously (27Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Mice were fed ad libitum Teklad 7001 rodent diet supplemented with cholesterol and receptor agonists or vehicle. The rexinoid LG268 was solubilized at 4.5 mg/ml in a vehicle containing 0.9% carboxymethylcellulose, 9% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.05% Tween 80 and provided in the diet to give a final concentration of 30 mg/kg body weight. The LXR agonist T0901317 was solubilized in a vehicle containing 1% methylcellulose and 1% Tween 80 and administered by oral gavage or provided in the diet at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. RNA was extracted and used in Northern analysis as described previously (25Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J.

For these experiments poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg/lane) or total RNA (10 μg/lane) was separated on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with 32P-labeled human LPL or mouse actin or cyclophilin cDNAs. The human LPL cDNA probe has been described previously (40Auwerx J.H. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from thioglycolate-injected male mice of wild-type orLxrα/β−/− genotype as described in a previous study (31Venkateswaran A. Repa J.J. Lobaccaro J.M. Bronson A.

Cells were pooled from four wild-type or fiveLxrα/β−/− mice and distributed on two plates, one for each treatment condition. Cells were allowed to adhere for 7 h in DMEM containing10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and either vehicle (Me2SO) or 10 μm LXR agonist (T0901317) and incubated for 42 h. The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293, was maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed in 96-well plates in media containing 10% dextran-charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (41Lu T.T. Makishima M.

Ligands were added at final concentrations of 0.1 μm LG268 and 5 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. All transfection data were normalized using an internal β-galactosidase marker and represent the mean of triplicate assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (42Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Sequences of the Lpl DR4.1, DR4.2, and DR4.2m elements are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Competitor DR4 containing the perfect tandem repeat of AGGTCA was described previously (42Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried at 80 °C for 1.5 h and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −80 °C overnight. Previous work has shown that the hepatic accumulation of triglycerides in cholesterol-fed mice is dependent on the expression of LXRα (25Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that changes in hepatic LPL expression are associated with this response, wild-type,Lxrα−/−, Lxrβ−/−, andLxrα/β−/− mice were treated with various dietary regimens for 12 h or 7–10 days and then sacrificed, and hepatic LPL expression was examined by Northern analysis. On a low cholesterol diet in the absence of added agonists, LPL expression in the liver was barely detectable regardless of genotype (Vehicle lanes in Fig. 1). After feeding a diet rich in cholesterol for 7 days, which is known to generate endogenous oxysterol LXR ligands (43Zhang Z. Li D. Blanchard D.E. Lear S.R. Erickson S.K. Spencer T.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LPL mRNA expression was increased 2.5- to 5-fold in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, A and B). In parallel experiments, treatment with a potent synthetic LXR agonist (27Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) resulted in a 12- to 17-fold increase in LPL mRNA in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Elevation of LPL mRNA was also evident after just one 12-h treatment with LXR agonist (Fig.1 C), suggesting that Lpl is a direct LXR target gene. Treatment of wild-type mice for 10 days (Fig. 1 C) or 12 h (Fig. 1 D) with the RXR agonist LG268 (27Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) also resulted in activation of hepatic LPL gene expression, consistent with the notion that RXR works as a permissive heterodimer with LXR (42Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Significantly, hepatic LPL expression induced by either LXR or RXR agonists was virtually absent in mice lacking both LXRs (Fig. 1,C and D). The RXR/LXR-induced expression of LPL was still observed in the Lxrβ knockout mice (Fig.1 B) but was not present in the Lxrα knockout mice (Fig. 1 A). These data indicate that LPL expression in the liver is regulated by the RXR/LXR heterodimer. In addition, because the liver expresses both LXRα and β subtypes, these data suggest that Lpl is predominantly an LXRα target gene. It is of interest that in these experiments high cholesterol diets did not induce LPL expression in either the Lxrα or βknockout animals (Fig. 1, A and B), even though the potent synthetic agonist did. At present, the significance of this finding is unknown but could reflect differences in the pharmacology of the synthetic agonists versus endogenous ligands, or differences in the strain background of the Lxrα knockout (which is in an A129 background) versus Lxrβknockout (which is in a C57BL/6 and A129 mixed background) animals. In any case, these experiments show unequivocally that the induction of LPL expression requires the expression of at least one LXR subtype. We next looked at regulation of LPL expression in other known LXR target tissues. Macrophages and adipose tissue express high levels of LXR proteins and are known to regulate several LXR target genes (27Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 31Venkateswaran A. Repa J.J. Lobaccaro J.M. Bronson A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14700-14707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 36Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). LPL expression in peritoneal macrophages was stimulated 2-fold after a 42-h treatment with LXR agonist (Fig.2 A). Although the induction was not as high as that seen in liver (Fig. 1), the effect in macrophages was consistently reproducible (in four independent experiments). It is also of significance to note that the basal expression in macrophages was higher, which affected the fold induction but not the maximal level of expression induced by the LXR agonist. This induction was absent in macrophages isolated fromLxrα/β double-knockout mice. In contrast, in adipose tissue, which expresses higher basal levels of LPL, the LXR agonist exhibited no significant effect on LPL expression in either mouse genotype after a 12-h or 10-day oral administration of the drug (Fig.2, B and C, respectively). We also looked at expression of LPL in heart, muscle, kidney, intestine, and adrenals, tissues that are known to express LPL. Similar to the results found in adipose tissue, none of these other tissues exhibited LXR-dependent regulation of LPL (Fig. 2 D). These data support the conclusion that LPL expression is differentially regulated by LXR in a tissue-specific manner. The mouse Lpl gene promoter and partial coding sequences were obtained from GenBank™. A computer-assisted search for potential LXR response elements was performed. The search revealed two DR4-like sequences (Fig.3 A), one at −274 to −259 (DR4.1, 5′-TAAATCagtgTAAACC-3′) and another at +635 to +650 (DR4.2, 5′-TGACCGgtggTGACCT-3′). Electrophoresis mobility gel shift assays were performed to investigate the direct binding of receptors to each sequence. An oligonucleotide containing the DR4.2 sequence was radiolabeled and used in the experiments shown in Fig. 3 (Band C). The DR4.2 oligo produced a significant band shift when incubated with in vitro translated RXR/LXRα protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) but not when incubated with either receptor alone (lanes 2 and 3). Binding of the RXR/LXRα heterodimer was completely inhibited by a 10- and 50-fold molar excess of either unlabeled DR4.2 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5 and 6) or the canonical DR4 LXRE (lanes 11 and 12) oligonucleotide identified previously (42Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). This inhibition was specific, because a mutated version of the DR4.2 element (see Fig. 5 A for sequence) was unable to compete for binding, even at a 50-fold molar excess (Fig.3 B, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast to the DR4.2 element, the DR4.1 element was unable to compete for binding to the RXR/LXRα heterodimer (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9 and10), suggesting that this site does not function as an LXRE. We also looked at the ability of LXRβ to bind to the two sites. LXRβ protein was radiolabeled by in vitro translation to a specific activity that was similar to LXRα and tested in the band-shift assay. In contrast to LXRα (Figs. 3 B and3 C, lane 6), the RXR/LXRβ heterodimer bound only weakly (∼10-fold less) to the DR4.2 oligonucleotide (Fig.3 C, lane 4). As expected, LXRβ exhibited no binding to the DR4.1 site (data not shown). Similar results were seen using either human or mouse receptor proteins. To test the ability of the DR4-like elements to function as LXR response elements, one copy of either the DR4.1 or DR4.2 elements was cloned into the luciferase reporter gene TK-Luc and cotransfected into HEK 293 cells with or without expression plasmids for mouse LXRα, LXRβ, and RXRα receptors. After treatment with ethanol vehicle, rexinoid LG268, LXR ligand 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, or both ligands, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with the band-shift results in Fig. 3, only the DR4.2 element was able to mediate RXR/LXR-dependent transactivation of the reporter gene. In addition, LXRα-mediated transcription was significantly higher than that of LXRβ, further supporting the notion that the Lpl gene is more selectively activated by LXRα than LXRβ. To demonstrate that the DR4.2 element identified above functions as an LXRE in the context of the Lpl gene promoter, the mouse Lpl gene from −289 to +752 was cloned into the luciferase vector pGL2 and the resultant reporter gene (pLPLwt-Luc) was tested for LXR-dependent transactivation. This portion of the Lpl gene contains both the DR4.1 and DR4.2 sequences (Fig.5 A). A similar construct in which the DR4.2 site was mutated to destroy LXR binding (see Fig.3 B, lanes 7 and 8) was also tested. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the wild-type promoter conferred significant RXR/LXRα-dependent transactivation to theLpl promoter, whereas the mutated version in which the DR4.2 site was altered (pLPLmut-Luc) did not. We conclude from these data that the Lpl promoter contains a functional LXRE located within the first intron of the gene. In a similar experiment LXRβ was also able to mediate activation of the wild-type promoter, albeit at a significantly reduced level (data not shown). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that the Lplgene is a direct target of LXR-mediated regulation by oxysterols. Furthermore, these data suggest that this regulation is governed primarily by LXRα. In this study we show that the mouse Lpl gene is a direct target of the oxysterol receptor, LXR. The activation ofLpl gene transcription by LXR is mediated via an LXRE in the first intron of the mouse gene. This LXRE is conserved in the humanLpl gene as well, indicating that LXR responsiveness is also conserved in humans. Furthermore, we show that LXR regulation of LPL expression is tissue-specific. LPL is markedly up-regulated by RXR/LXR agonists in liver and to a lesser extent in macrophages but not in adipose, muscle, kidney, adrenal, intestine, or heart. One of the questions raised by these findings is what is the physiological basis of the tissue-specific regulation of LPL by LXRs. LPL is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lipoprotein triglycerides for uptake of fatty acids into adjacent tissues. Thus, in tissues such as adipose and muscle, LPL activity is required to meet the high demand these tissues have for free fatty acids. Despite the fact that LXRs are expressed abundantly in adipose and are known to regulate other adipose target genes, such as SREBP-1c, it is of significance that Lpl is not regulated by LXRs in this tissue. One explanation for this lack of regulation may be that subtle changes in the expression of LPL are masked by the already high basal level of LPL expression in adipose. However, it is worth noting that other transcription factors, in particular PPARγ (see below), are able to regulate Lpl in this tissue. A more likely explanation is that tissue-specific regulation of Lpl by LXRs in liver and macrophages is directly linked to the role LXRs play in maintaining whole body cholesterol balance. One attractive hypothesis is that LXR up-regulates LPL to help the body clear the serum of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (via macrophages) and transport this cholesterol (via HDL) back to the liver for catabolism and elimination. At present the function of LPL in macrophages and liver is controversial and just beginning to be elucidated. LPL has been suggested to have both pro- and anti-atherogenic properties in these tissues (44Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in macrophages LPL has been shown to facilitate uptake of cholesterol esters, presumably by remodeling triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein into chylomicron remnants and low density lipoprotein that are then taken up by macrophages (45Lindqvist P. Ostlund-Lindqvist A.M. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Little J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathogenic conditions, the excess cholesterol build-up in macrophages would lead to the development of foam cells. However, under non-pathogenic conditions, this cholesterol ester may be converted to oxysterols and free cholesterol that are effluxed out of the macrophage into HDL and transported to the liver. In the liver, LPL expression is normally undetectable in adult animals (9Semenkovich C.F. Chen S.H. Wims M. Luo C.C. Li W.H. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Vilaro S. Llobera M. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but as shown by this study hepatic LPL expression is up-regulated markedly by high cholesterol diets and LXR agonists (Fig.1). Several recent studies implicate the role of hepatic LPL expression as being anti-atherogenic by helping to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport through the HDL pathway. Strauss et al. (2Strauss J.G. Frank S. Kratky D. Hammerle G. Hrzenjak A. Knipping G. von Eckardstein A. Kostner G.M. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36083-36090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed that adenoviral-mediated expression of LPL in Lpl-deficient mice is necessary and sufficient to promote maturation of HDL. It has also been shown that LPL can mediate the selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol into liver cells by a mechanism that evidently does not involve the enzymatic activity of the lipase (3Rinninger F. Kaiser T. Mann W.A. Meyer N. Greten H. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1335-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that LPL is induced by LXR and its agonists and that cholesterol induction of LPL is LXR-dependent is consistent with the recent identification of other LXR target genes in macrophages and liver that are in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. These genes include the ABC sterol transport proteins ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, and ABCG8; apolipoprotein E; cholesterol ester transfer protein; and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (24Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A.

Together these findings support a growing body of evidence that demonstrates LXRs are key sensors of sterol metabolism and maintain normal cholesterol balance by promoting sterol efflux from peripheral cells, increasing circulating HDL-cholesterol, increasing hepatic sterol catabolism and excretion, and inhibiting further sterol absorption (25Peet D.J.

A. 2001; 98: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Another conclusion that can be extrapolated from this and other recent studies is that LPL expression is coordinately regulated by multiple dietary factors via nuclear receptors. Here we have shown that sterol-mediated regulation of Lpl requires the LXRs. Previous work has shown that, in macrophages, high glucose induces LPL expression, in part through enhanced expression of PPARα (20Sartippour M.R. Renier G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fatty acids and other PPARα agonists also induce LPL expression in the liver through a pathway that may involve LXR activation (11Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 47Tobin K.A. Steineger H.H. Alberti S. Spydevold O. Auwerx J. Gustafsson J.A. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TNF has also been shown to enhance both fatty acid synthesis and LPL activity in liver (12Enerback S. Semb H. Tavernier J. Bjursell G. Olivecrona T. Gene. 1988; 64: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TNF stimulation in these cases is also believed to be indirect, suggesting that either PPAR or LXR may be modulating TNF induction of LPL. Finally, in adipocytes, LPL expression is specifically induced by PPARγ agonists (11Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), but not by LXR agonists (Fig. 2), even though LXRα is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and can potently up-regulate other adipose target genes such as SREBP-1c (36Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). These data support the notion that the LXRs (oxysterol receptors) and PPARs (fatty acid receptors) define two distinct, but overlapping metabolic pathways that govern fatty acid metabolism in response to different dietary lipids (i.e.cholesterol and fatty acids). A final intriguing observation from this work is the finding that LXRα is a more selective regulator of Lpl than LXRβ. In liver, LPL synthesis has been reported to be confined to Kupffer cells (48Camps L. Reina M. Llobera M. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Vilaro S. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1877-1888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although there is evidence that in newborn rats LPL is expressed in hepatocytes (49Burgaya F. Peinado J. Vilaro S. Llobera M. Ramirez I. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that part of the LXRα selectivity for LPL expression is attributable to differential cell type expression of the two LXR genes, we note that the in vitro data on Lpl promoter binding and activation by the LXRs (Figs. 3 and 4) support the idea that LXRα has a higher affinity than LXRβ for the Lpl LXRE. In either case, the identification of Lpl as an LXRα-selective target gene is in keeping with the previous notion that LXRα and LXRβ have distinct targets in vivo (25Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W.

Because LXR agonists have pharmacologic effects that are both desirable (e.g.increased reverse cholesterol transport) (27Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B.

In parallel, an internal peptide (residues 98–112) of hen egg white lysozyme, obtained after digestion with clostripain, possessed broad spectrum antimicrobial action in vitro. This internal peptide is part of a helix-loop-helix domain (87–114 sequence of hen lysozyme) located at the upper lip of the active site cleft of lysozyme. The helix-loop-helix (HLH) structures are known motifs commonly found in membrane-active and DNA-binding proteins. To evaluate the contribution of the HLH peptide to the antimicrobial properties of lysozyme, the HLH sequence and its secondary structure derivatives of chicken and human lysozyme were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity against several bacterial strains. We found that the full HLH peptide of both chicken and human lysozymes was potently microbicidal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans. The N-terminal helix of HLH was specifically bactericidal to Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the C-terminal helix was bactericidal to all tested strains. Outer and inner membrane permeabilization studies, as well as measurements of transmembrane electrochemical potentials, provided evidence that HLH peptide and its C-terminal helix domain kill Gram-negative bacteria by crossing the outer membrane via self-promoted uptake and causing damage to the inner membrane through channel formation. The results are discussed in terms of proposed mechanisms for the catalytically independent antimicrobial activity of lysozyme that offer a new strategy for the design of potential antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of infectious diseases.

Assaf Y. Sharon N. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lysozyme is an antimicrobial enzyme widely distributed in nature and is found in mammalian tissues and secretions, insects, plants, bacteria, and viruses (1Schindler M. Assaf Y. Sharon N. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Besides its antimicrobial activity, lysozyme has many other functions including inactivation of certain viruses (2Hasselberger F.X. Hasselberger F.X. Uses of Enzymes and Immobilized Enzymes. Nelson-Hall Inc., Chicago1978: 128Google Scholar), surveillance of membranes of mammalian cells (3Osserman E.F. Klockars M. Halper J. Fischer R.E. Osserman E.F. Canfield R.E. Beychok S. Lysozyme.

Uses of Enzymes and Immobilized Enzymes. Nelson-Hall Inc., Chicago1978: 128Google Scholar). Lysozyme, however, has the capacity to neutralize and strongly interact with lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria (11Ohno N. Morrison D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4434-4441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, its secretion in many tissues is known to be induced upon bacterial infection (12Engstrom A. Kadalayil L. Sun S.C. Samakovlis C. Hultmark D. Faye I. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Hultmark D. Steiner H. Rasmuson T. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The importance of lysozyme as a key molecule in the defense against bacterial infection has been recognized (10Hughey V.L. Johnson E.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bukharin O.V. Usviatsov B.I. Matiiash I.N. Pastukhova G.V. Prianishnikova L.I.

Antibiotiki (Mosc.). 1976; 21: 441-444PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is still not certain whether or not its catalytic activity contributes to its antimicrobial function. The literature abounds with evidence implicating an alternative functional site in lysozyme having the primary bactericidal activity, with the N-acetylmuramidase activity of secondary importance in microbial defense (17Jolles J. Jolles P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 63: 165-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 18Laible N.J. Germaine G.R. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 720-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies (19Ibrahim H.R. Nahrung. 1998; 42: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ibrahim H.R. Higashiguchi S. Juneja L.R. Kim M. Yamamoto T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1996; 44: 1416-1423Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we showed that the antimicrobial action of hen egg white lysozyme (cLz)1 depends not on its enzymatic activity but rather on a structural phase transition. Partially unfolded cLz showed enhanced bactericidal action against Gram-negative bacteria while retaining its inherent microbicidal activity to Gram-positive ones (21Ibrahim H.R. Higashiguchi S.

Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 89-94Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the bactericidal cLz undergoes conformational changes particularly at the aspartylglycyl sequences (residues 101 and 102) located in the loop structure at the upper lip of the active site cleft (19Ibrahim H.R. Nahrung. 1998; 42: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ibrahim H.R. Higashiguchi S. Sugimoto Y. Aoki T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 89-94Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Tomizawa H. Yamada H. Ueda T. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8770-8774Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This observation, together with the results of the proteolytic digestion of cLz, suggests that a specific bactericidal domain may actually be involved in the antimicrobial action of lysozyme. The digestion of cLz by clostripain produces a pentadecapeptide (residues 98–112) with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (24Pellegrini A. Thomas U. Bramaz N. LKlauser S. Hunziker P. Fellenberg R.V. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 82: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is that the pentadecapeptide forms part of a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif (residues 88–114 of cLz and 87–115 of human lysozyme, hLz) located at the upper lip of the active site cleft of the molecule. The helical hairpin structures, such as HLH observed in cLz (residues 88–114) and h-Lz (residues 87–115), are known motifs commonly found in bactericidal and cytolytic pore-forming proteins (25Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,26Srisailam S. Arunkumar A.I. Wang W. C. Yu Chen H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 15: 1-2Google Scholar). For example, cecropin A and B1, major antimicrobial peptides in the immune response of silk moths, consist of two α-helices flanked by a loop maintained by Gly and Pro residues (26Srisailam S. Arunkumar A.I. Wang W. C. Yu Chen H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 15: 1-2Google Scholar, 27Boman H.G. Faye I. Gudmundsson G.H. Lee J.Y. Lidholm D.A. Eur. J.

Colicin E1, a bactericidal plasmid-encoded protein with the ability to form an ion channel in the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane, possesses a C-terminal α-helical hairpin that mediates insertion and subsequent channel assembly into the membrane (29Kim Y. Valentine K. Opella S.J. Schendel S.L. Cramer W.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Lindeberg M. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. J. Mol.

Structure examination of lysozyme indicates that there are recurrent features around its catalytic apparatus. It is likely that interaction with substrate (peptidoglycan) or the bacterial surface (lipopolysaccharides) and the positioning of its HLH domain near the membrane surface appear to be key elements in the mode of bactericidal action of this enzyme. To explore the structure-antimicrobial relationship and to test this mechanism of action of lysozyme, we sought to elucidate the role of HLH domain on the antimicrobial action of lysozyme. In this investigation, the full HLH domain and several secondary structure derivatives of both hen egg white and human lysozyme were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms. The synthetic HLH peptides and their fragments were also evaluated with regard to secondary structure elements and their ability to interact with and permeabilize the membranes of E. coli and model phospholipid membranes. The importance of this highly conserved sequence of HLH domain for antimicrobial specificity, the mechanism of action of known lysozyme molecules, and its potential as a new drug against bacterial infectious diseases are discussed. The following polypeptides were synthesized by different companies: polypeptide DITASVNCAKKIVSDGNGMNAWVAWRNR was from Chiron (Clayton Victoria, Australia); DITASVNCAKKIVS, DGNGMN, and AWVAWRNR were from Alpha Diagnostic (San Antonio, TX); DNIADAVACAKRVVRDPQGIRAWVAWRNR, DNIADAVACAKRVVR, DPQGIR, DPQGI, and RAWVAWRNR were from the peptide synthesis service of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Nigericin, 3,3′-diisopropyl thiadicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-5), and o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) were from Sigma. Valinomycin was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). 7-[(Thienyl-2-acetamido)-3-(2-(4 N,N-dimethylaminophenylazo)-pyridinium-methyl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (PADAC) was from Calbiochem. Phospholipids were isolated from E. coli K-12 (IFO 3301) as described by Viitanen et al. (32Viitanen P. Newman M.J. Foster D.L. Wilson T.H. Kaback R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 429-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nucleosil 100-5C 18 columns for reversed phase chromatography was from Macherey & Nagel (Düren, Germany). Trypticase soy broth (TSB) and agar were from Difco. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers used for the peptide purification were of high pressure liquid chromatography grade and were purchased from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Bacterial strains E. coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 , Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Serratia marcescens ATCC 8100,Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Candida albicans ATCC 2091, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698 were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The wild strains of Staphylococcus lentus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus were obtained from the Institute of Bacteriology of the Veterinary Hospital, Zürich, Switzerland.Bacillus subtilis BGA was from Merck. E. coliML35p was a generous gift of Dr. R. I. Lehrer (UCLA School of Medicine). The crude peptides were purified by reversed phase fast protein liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil 100–5C column. The column was eluted using a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The bactericidal assay was performed as described previously (24Pellegrini A. Thomas U. Bramaz N. LKlauser S. Hunziker P. Fellenberg R.V. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 82: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ml of trypticase soy broth (TSB) was inoculated with a single colony of bacteria and incubated overnight at 37 °C. One ml of bacterial suspension was diluted (1:50) in TBS. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C until logarithmic phase was reached (∼1–4 × 108 cfu/ml). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min, washed, and resuspended (106 cfu/ml) in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Aliquots (50 μl) of the bacterial suspension were mixed with 50 μl of water containing the test peptide in 2-fold serial dilutions. 100 μl of 2% TSB in 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer was then added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, serially diluted in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and plated on trypticase soy agar. Colony-forming units were obtained after incubation of the plates at 37 °C for 24 h. Assays were performed in duplicate. Susceptibility of C. albicanswas tested essentially according to the procedure described above for the antibacterial assay. Briefly, 50 μl of 106 cfu/ml of C. albicans blastoconidia derived from a 24-h culture in TSB were incubated with 50 μl of the test peptide solution and 100 μl of 2% TSB in phosphate buffer. After an incubation time of 2 h, the mixture was plated on TSB agar. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and the colonies were counted. Outer membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p was determined by measuring the release of β-lactamase activity into the culture medium using PADAC as a substrate, according to the procedure described by Lehrer (33Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Bacteria grown to logarithmic phase were collected, washed, and resuspended (108 cfu/ml) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Bacterial suspension (50 μl) was added to a thermoelectrically preheated cuvette to 37 °C containing 612.5 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1% TSB, and 12.5 μl of 2.7 mm PADAC. After incubating at 37 °C for 15 min, test peptide solution (50 μl) was added (0.5 mm). The permeabilization of outer membrane was monitored by measuring the decrease of absorbance at 570 nm over time due to PADAC hydrolysis. Controls contained water instead of peptide solutions. Determination of the inner membrane permeabilization was performed by measuring the β-galactosidase activity of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35p at 37 °C using ONPG as substrate (33Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An aliquot (75 μl) of bacteria suspension (108 cfu/ml) was pipetted into a 37 °C preheated cuvette, containing 550 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1% TSB, and 75 μl of 25 mm ONPG. After 15 min of incubation, 50 μl of the test peptide solution was added (0.5 mm). The production of o-nitrophenol over time was monitored spectrophotometrically at 400 nm. An equivalent volume of water replaced the peptide solution in the control assay. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from phospholipids of E. coli K-12, as described previously (34Ibrahim H.R.

An aliquot (100 μl) of purified phospholipid stock (50 mg/ml argon-saturated 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to 900 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (for K+-loaded liposomes), or in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm phosphate buffer, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) for liposome binding. The dispersion was sonicated for 2 s followed by a 3-s pause, and the cycle was repeated until clarification. The solution was centrifuged at 356,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The liposomal pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer and then sonication and centrifugation were repeated. Finally, the preparations were centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 rpm in a microtube to remove multilamellar vesicles. The liposomal preparations were kept in an ice-water bath under argon and used within a few hours in the following experiments. The ability of peptide to dissipate membrane potential (ΔΨ) was determined by measuring the fluorescence quenching of [diS-C3-(5)] using a Hitachi F-3000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), as reported previously (34Ibrahim H.R. Sugimoto Y. Aoki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1523: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,35Ibrahim H.R. Yamada M. Matsushita K. Kobayashi K. Kato A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5059-5063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C, excitation at 622 nm, and recording emission at 670 nm. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mmdiS-C3-(5), and 70 μg/ml liposomes (K+-loaded) in a total volume of 1.0 ml. The K+-loaded liposomes were energized (inside negative, −160 mV) by a valinomycin-mediated potassium diffusion potential. Peptide was then added at the indicated concentrations, and changes in fluorescence were monitored over time. The data were compared with that of the control experiment of the nigericin-mediated electroneutral exchange of K+ for H+. To verify the integrity of treated liposomes during assay, nigericin was added after 650 s. The results are presented as fluorescence intensity. Peptides (final concentration of 2 μm) were dissolved in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.3. A 10-μl aliquot of the liposomes preparation in the same buffer was added to give a final concentration of 500 μg of phospholipid/ml (147 μm) and then excited at 288 nm with 2-nm resolution. Tryptophan (Trp) intrinsic emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm and were corrected for the blank values and dilution by addition of liposomes or additives such as EDTA. Three-dimensional structures of lysozyme and its HLH peptide were generated by RasMol version 2.6 (Biomolecular Structures Group, Glaxo Wellcome) using the Protein Data Bank file retrieved from Swiss-Prot data base of human (code 1LZS) and hen egg white (code 1HEW) lysozyme. Recently, we presented evidence that proteolytic digestion of lysozyme by clostripain releases an antimicrobial peptide (residues 98–112) from lysozyme that forms the middle part of an HLH motif (24Pellegrini A. Thomas U. Bramaz N. LKlauser S. Hunziker P. Fellenberg R.V. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 82: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional fold of lysozyme when complexed with a substrate analogue (GlcNAc)3 is shown in Fig.1. The active site of c-type lysozyme divides the molecule into two domains, the α-domain and the β-domain, whereas the HLH domain (dark region, Fig.1 A) is uniquely located at the upper lip of the active site of the enzyme. The HLH domain falls within the region of greatest degree of conservation of all c-type lysozymes (36Post C.B. Brooks B.R. Karplus M. Dobson C.M. Artymiuk P.J. Cheetham J.C. Phillips D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 455-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the HLH domain of cLz and hLz are shown in Fig.1 B. Sixteen of 28 residues are identical, with 5 others being chemically conservative substitutions. Given this degree of homology and the unique spatial location at the active site cleft, this HLH domain might serve as the primary antimicrobial domain of lysozyme, particularly as its α-helical hairpin structure resembles those of the bactericidal motifs reported for colicins and cecropins (27Boman H.G. Faye I. Gudmundsson G.H. Lee J.Y. Lidholm D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar,31Song H.Y. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2927-2934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the HLH domain is shown in Fig.2 A. For this study, the full HLH domains of chicken (cLz-(87–114)) and human (hLz-(87–115)) lysozyme were systematically synthesized. To examine more closely the structural requirements needed for the antimicrobial action, the N-terminal helix (H1), C-terminal helix (H2), and the intervening loop (Lp) of the respective HLH domain were also synthesized (Fig.2 B). We observed that the C terminus of the loop in the peptide of hLz possesses a positively charged residue (Arg107), whereas in the cLz there is a neutral residue (Asn106). To ascertain the positively charged Arg107 that might be essential for the bactericidal capacity of hLz, two analogues (HP-Lp and HP-Lp′) for the loop peptide of human HLH domain were synthesized with single Arg addition (HP-Lp′). Chicken lysozyme and the synthetic peptides were tested for bactericidal activity against six Gram-negative (B. bronchiseptica, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and S. typhimurium), six Gram-positive (B. subtilis, M. luteus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lentus, and S. zooepidemicus), and a fungus (C. albicans). As shown in Table I, lysozyme and the full HLH peptides of both cLz (CP-full) and hLz (HP-full) were effective against almost all bacterial strains tested. However, HP-full peptide exerted a markedly stronger bactericidal activity against all test strains than that of CP-full peptide. The bactericidal activity of HP-full was also higher than that of lysozyme against almost all the bacterial strains investigated. Only against E. coli and S. marcescens was it less bactericidal than lysozyme. The peptide CP-full inhibited weakly the growth of E. coli and was devoid of antibacterial activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. A common antimicrobial behavior shared by the full HLH domain of cLz (CP-full) and hLz (HP-full) is that they exert stronger effects against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. It is worthy to note that Gram-positive bacteria are much more susceptible to the action of HLH peptides than the Gram-negative ones. The peptides CP-full and HP-full can ideally be resolved into three secondary structural elements as follows: two α-helical structures (N- and C-terminal) and the loop connecting the two α-helices. To investigate which part of the HLH sequences of CP-full and of HP-full is essential for bactericidal activity, the peptides CP-(87–100) (CP-H1), CP-(101–106) (CP-Lp), CP-(107–114) (CP-H2), HP-(87–101) (HP-H1), HP-(102–106) (HP-Lp), HP-(102–107) (HP-Lp′), and HP-(107–115) (HP-H2) were synthesized and tested for bactericidal activity. The C-terminal α-helix CP-H2 and HP-H2 derived from the HLH sequence of cLz and hLz, respectively, exerted much stronger bactericidal activity than the N-terminal α-helix (CP-H1 and HP-H1) against all strains tested. The C-terminal α-helix (CP-H2), however, was inactive against S. marcescens. The N-terminal α-helix (CP-H1) was specifically bactericidal, although to different degrees, against all Gram-positive bacteria tested. In addition, it exhibited significant activity against C. albicans and was weakly effective against E. coli. In contrast to cLz, hLz-derived N-terminal α-helix (HP-H1) was bactericidal against only three Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis, M. luteus, and S. lentus) and the Gram-negative bacteria B. bronchiseptica. All of the loop sequences of the parent HLH domain derived from either cLz (CP-Lp) or hLz (HP-Lp and HP-Lp′) virtually exhibited strong bactericidal activity against B. subtilis. CP-Lp was essentially inactive against all the other strains tested but exhibited weak activity against C. albicans. HP-Lp showed a similar trend of activity but was moderately active against S. zooepidemicusand weakly active against S. typhimurium. The analogous loop derived from the human sequence with a C-terminal Arg residue (HP-Lp′) was weakly active against S. epidermidis and S. zooepidemicus and inactive against all of the other bacteria tested.Table IAntibacterial activity of lysozyme, the synthetic helical-hairpin domains of chicken (CP-full) and human (HP-full) lysozyme, and their secondary structure derivativesOrganismsStrainActivity1-aAntibacterial activity is represented as log N/N1 where N refers to the control number of colonies without antibacterial material, and N1 refers to the number of colonies containing antibacterial material after an incubation period of 2 h.

MMPs are regulated by different cytokines, ECM proteins, and other factors. However, the molecular mechanisms by which osteopontin (OPN), an ECM protein, regulates ECM invasion and tumor growth and modulates MMP activation in B16F10 cells are not well defined. We have purified OPN from human milk and shown that OPN induces pro-MMP-2 production and activation in these cells. Moreover, our data revealed that OPN-induced membrane type 1 (MT1) MMP expression correlates with translocation of p65 (nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)) into the nucleus. However, when the super-repressor form of IκBα (inhibitor of NF-κB) was transfected into cells followed by treatment with OPN, no induction of MT1-MMP expression was observed, indicating that OPN activates pro-MMP-2 via an NF-κB-mediated pathway. OPN also enhanced cell migration and ECM invasion by interacting with αvβ3integrin, but these effects were reduced drastically when the MMP-2-specific antisense S-oligonucleotide was used to suppress MMP-2 expression. Interestingly, when the OPN-treated cells were injected into nude mice, the mice developed larger tumors, and the MMP-2 levels in the tumors were significantly higher than in controls. The proliferation data indicate that OPN increases the growth rate in these cells. Both tumor size and MMP-2 expression were reduced dramatically when anti-MMP-2 antibody or antisenseS-oligonucleotide-transfected cells were injected into the nude mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report that MMP-2 plays a direct role in OPN-induced cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth and that demonstrates that OPN-stimulated MMP-2 activation occurs through NF-κB-mediated induction of MT1-MMP.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes are not well understood. In the past, several investigators have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 and the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) play a major role in the regulation of cancer cell migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion, and metastasis by degrading the ECM proteins (3Liotta L.A.

Current investigations have focused on the understanding of molecular mechanism(s) by which osteopontin (OPN), an ECM protein, regulates MMP expression both in vitro and in vivo and controls invasiveness and tumor growth in B16F10 cells. OPN is a noncollagenous, sialic acid-rich, and glycosylated phosphoprotein (6Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 7Denhardt D. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). It has an N-terminal signal sequence, a highly acidic region consisting of nine consecutive aspartic acid residues, and a GRGDS cell adhesion sequence predicted to be flanked by the β-sheet structure (8Prince C.W. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This protein has a functional thrombin cleavage site and is a substrate for tissue transglutaminase (7Denhardt D. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). OPN binds with type I collagen (9Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibronectin (10Singh K. Devouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18696-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and osteocalcin (11Ritter N.M. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several highly metastatic transformed cells synthesize higher levels of OPN compared with non-tumorigenic cells (12Craig A.M.

It has been shown that OPN also interacts with CD44 receptor globulin (13Weber G.F. Akshar S. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). OPN causes cell adhesion and migration, ECM invasion, and cell proliferation by interacting with its receptor αvβ3 integrin in various cell types (14Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. Li X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9308-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Integrins are noncovalently associated, heterodimeric, cell-surface glycoproteins with α- and β-subunits. Integrins are a superfamily of transmembrane glycoproteins found predominantly on the surface of leukocytes that mediate cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. Until today, ∼12 α-subunits, 8 β-subunits, and 20 αβ-heterodimers were documented in the literature (15Giancotti F.G. Rhuoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). MMPs are a family of enzymes that are classified under different subgroups (16Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). MMP-2 (also called type IV collagenase or gelatinase A) degrades several ECM proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, type I collagen, and proteoglycans. It plays critical roles in embryogenesis, tissue remodeling, inflammation, periodontitis, and metastasis (16Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). Several reports have indicated that the increased levels of MMP-2 correlate with the invasive properties of certain tumor cell types (16Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar,17Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J.C.

TIMP-2 is a non-glycosylated protein (21 kDa) that forms a complex with both the inactive and active forms of MMP-2 (18Miyazaki K. Funahashi K. Numata Y. Koshikawa N. Akaogi K. Kikkawa Y. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14387-14393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the ligation of αvβ3 integrin in melanoma cells by anti-αvβ3 integrin antibodies enhances the expression of MMP-2, resulting in increased levels of cellular invasiveness (17Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of melanoma cells with vitronectin induces the expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 as well as enhances cellular invasiveness in a dose-dependent manner (19Bafetti L.M. Young T.N. Itoh Y. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 143-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (20Takahashi K. Eto H. Tanabe K.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) showed that treatment of human melanoma cells with monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody induced the expression of MMP-2 and enhances cell migration and ECM invasion. However, treatment of the same melanoma cells with recombinant OPN-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein failed to induce the expression of MMP-2. It was speculated that MMP-2 expression did not occur probably because of the glutathioneS-transferase fusion with osteopontin (20Takahashi K. Eto H. Tanabe K.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, Maquoiet al. (21Maquoi E. Frankenne F. Noel A. Krell H.-W. Grams F. Foidart J.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that type IV collagen induces the activation of MMP-2 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Here we report that treatment of B16F10 cells with purified human OPN (but not with other ECM proteins such as fibronectin, type I collagen, and laminin) induced the expression of pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2. We provide evidence that OPN induced membrane type 1 (MT1) MMP expression by stimulating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. OPN also enhanced cell migration and ECM invasion by interacting with the αvβ3 integrin receptor in these cells. Transient transfection of B16F10 cells with the MMP-2-specific antisense S-oligonucleotide (ASMMP-2), but not with the sense S-oligonucleotide (SMMP-2), caused pronounced inhibition of MMP-2 protein expression and drastic suppression of OPN-induced cell migration and ECM invasion. Interestingly, OPN also induced tumor growth, and expression of MMP-2 in tumors of OPN-injected nude mice was significantly higher than in controls. Moreover, when anti-MMP-2 antibody was injected into OPN-induced tumors, the size of the tumors and the levels of active MMP-2 were reduced dramatically compared with controls. Similarly, when ASMMP-2-transfected cells were injected into the mice, the size of the tumors and the levels of MMP-2 were also suppressed compared with SMMP-2- or LipofectAMINE Plus-injected cells. Taken together, these data indicate that OPN-induces pro-MMP-2 expression and activation and enhances cell migration, ECM invasion, and tumor growth. These data further demonstrate that MMP-2 is mechanistically involved in the regulation of these processes. Fibronectin, type I collagen, laminin, GRGDSP, GPenGRGDSPCA, GRGESP, and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

The IgG-purified anti-OPN antibody was purchased from R&D Systems. The anti-OPN antibody was also raised against purified intact human OPN in rabbits and characterized in our laboratory. Na125I (carrier-free; 3.7 GBq/ml) was purchased from Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (Mumbai, India). Boyden-type cell migration chambers were obtained from Corning Corp. BioCoat MatrigelTM invasion chambers were from Collaborative Biomedical. The nude mice (NMRI, nu/nu) were obtained from the National Institute of Virology (Pune, India). All other chemicals were analytical grade. The murine melanoma cells (B16F10) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Human milk was collected from a local hospital. OPN was purified by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, followed by FPLC. Briefly, the milk sample was centrifuged, and the cleared sample was loaded onto the DEAE-Sephadex column. The column was washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing OPN were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar), followed by Western blot analysis. Briefly, the OPN sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with established IgG-purified anti-OPN antibody (1:5000 dilution). It was washed, incubated further with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution), and detected using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Partially purified OPN was purified further on an FPLC Resource-Q column with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) over a period of 40 min and rechromatographed under the same conditions on the Resource-Q column. The final purity of OPN was checked by SDS gel and Western blot analyses using both established and in-house anti-OPN antibodies as described above. The concentration of OPN was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To check the effect of OPN on MMP-2 expression and activation, the B16F10 cells were treated with varying concentrations of purified OPN (0–10.0 μm) in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected by centrifugation, concentrated, and dialyzed. The dialyzed samples containing an equal amount of total proteins were mixed with sample buffer in the absence of reducing agent, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and loaded onto zymographic SDS gel containing gelatin (0.5 mg/ml) as described (23Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The gels were washed and incubated in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm CaCl2, 1 μmZnCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) for 16 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. The zones of gelatinolytic activity were shown by negative staining. Purified MMP-2 was used as a control. In separate experiments, the cells were treated with other ECM proteins (5.0 μm each fibronectin, type I collagen, or laminin) or peptides (10.0 μm each GRGDSP, GPenGRGDSPCA, or GRGESP) and incubated under the same conditions described above. The conditioned media were collected and used for zymography. To analyze the levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNAs in untreated and OPN-treated cells, the cells were first treated with OPN (10 μm), and total RNA was extracted using the RNAzol method (Tel-Test) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at absorbances of 260 and 280 nm. An equal amount of total RNA (20 μg) was denatured in formaldehyde and resolved by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels. The RNA samples were transferred from the gels to nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Hybridization was performed using an α-32P-labeled mouse MMP-2 or TIMP-2 probe. The 708-base pair MMP-2 cDNA probe was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification, followed by hybridization with an MMP-2-specific probe. The 508-base pair TIMP-2 probe was obtained by digesting plasmid pBluescript SK containing partial-length TIMP-2 cDNA (nucleotides 1173–1680) (a generous gift from Prof. M. Seiki, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) with HindIII. The DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were exposed to Eastman Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film and autoradiographed. The nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification (24Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) of the method of Dignam (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of OPN (5 μm) in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were scraped, washed with PBS, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were separated by spinning at 3300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), followed by the addition of an equal volume of high salt buffer. The lysed nuclei were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cleared supernatant was collected. The post-nuclear supernatant was used for cytoplasmic extraction. To this supernatant was added 0.1 volume of cytoplasm extraction buffer (0.3 mm Hepes (pH 7.9) containing 30 mm MgCl2 and 1.4m KCl). The sample was centrifuged, and the cleared supernatant was collected. The protein concentrations in the supernatants of both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The level of NF-κB p65 in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65 antibody as described above. In other experiments, the super-repressor form of IκBα fused downstream to a FLAG epitope in an expression vector (pCMV4) was transiently transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the vector containing IκBα was mixed with plus reagent in Opti-MEM I and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. LipofectAMINE was mixed with DNA plus reagent and incubated further at room temperature for 15 min. The LipofectAMINE Plus-DNA complex was added to cells and mixed by gentle agitation. After 48 h, the cells were treated in the absence or presence of OPN (5 μm) and incubated further at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm iodoacetamide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and used for detection of MT1-MMP by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-MT1-MMP antibody as described above. The migration assay was conducted using a Transwell cell culture chamber according to the standard procedure described (25Yue T.L. McKenna P.J. Ohlstein E.H. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. Johanson K. McDevitt P. Feuerstein G.Z. Stadel J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, the confluent monolayer of B16F10 cells was harvested with trypsin/EDTA and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min. The cell suspension (5 × 105cells/well) was added to the upper chamber of a pre-hydrated polycarbonate membrane filter. Purified intact OPN (0–10 μm) was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium, which acted as a chemoattractant. To ascertain whether OPN-stimulated migration occurred via αvβ3 integrin, the cells were pretreated with anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody (40 μg/ml) for 20 min, and then OPN was added (5.0 μm). Similarly, the cells were also pretreated with monoclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody (50.0 μg/ml), and then OPN was added. In other experiments, the cells were individually treated with GRGDSP, GRGESP, or GPenGRGDSPCA (5.0 μm each) for 20 min and then incubated with OPN (5.0 μm). After treatment, the cells were incubated in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C for 24 h. The non-migrating cells on the upper side of the filter were scraped and washed. The migrating cells on the reverse side of the filter were stained with Giemsa. The migrating cells on the filter were counted and a photomicrograph was taken under an Olympus inverted microscope. In separate experiments, SMMP-2- or ASMMP-2-transfected cells (5 × 105cells/well) were added to the upper chamber, and a migration assay was performed under the same conditions as described above. The experiments were repeated in triplicate. Preimmune IgG served as a nonspecific control. The ECM invasion assay was performed using commercially available 24-well plates that consist of upper and lower chambers as described (26Melchiorri A. Carlone S. Allanvena G. Aresu O. Parodi S. Aaronson S. Albini A. Anticancer Res. 1990; 10: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kundu G.C. Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2915-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The two chambers were divided by a porous filter, the upper surface of which was precoated with a layer of artificial basement membrane, MatrigelTM (Collaborative Biomedical). The cell suspension (5 × 105 cells/well) was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium. which acted as a chemoattractant. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of purified intact OPN (0–10.0 μm) and then added to the upper chamber. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody (40.0 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody (50.0 μg/ml), GRGDSP (5.0 μm), GRGESP (5.0 μm), or GPenGRGDSPCA (5.0 μm) for 20 min and then incubated with OPN (5.0 μm) at 37 °C for 24 h as described above. The non-migrating cells and Matrigel from the upper side of the filter were scraped and removed using a moist cotton swab. The invaded cells in the lower side of the filter were stained with Giemsa and washed with PBS (pH 7.6). The invaded cells were then counted, and photomicrographs were taken under the Olympus inverted microscope. In other experiments, SMMP-2- or ASMMP-2-transfected cells (5 × 105cells/well) were added to the upper chamber, and the invasion assay was done under the same conditions as described above. The experiments were repeated in triplicate. Preimmune IgG was used as a nonspecific control. The proliferation assay was performed as described previously (14Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. Li X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9308-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved B16F10 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of OPN (0–10 μm) at 37 °C for 24 h. After 4 h, [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added, and the cells were maintained in culture for another 20 h. After removing the supernatants, the cells were washed with basal medium and lysed in 50% trichloroacetic acid. The acid-precipitable cell-bound radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). To detect the level of αvβ3 integrin in B16F10 cells, the cells were surface-labeled with Na125I and IODO-BEADS as described (28O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer composed of 1% Triton X-100 solution containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA and immunoprecipitated individually with anti-human αv or monoclonal anti-β3 integrin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and autoradiographed. Purified human OPN (20 μg) was radioiodinated using Na125I (carrier-free; 2 mCi) and chloramine T as described (29Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5859) Google Scholar). 125I-OPN was purified by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography, and radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter (Beckman Instruments) with a counting efficiency of ∼85%. The specific activity of carrier-free purified monoiodinated OPN was 78 μCi/μg. For binding assays, subconfluent cultures of B16F10 cells were incubated with 125I-OPN (3.0 × 105 cpm/well) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled purified OPN in 1.0 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reactions were stopped by rapid removal of medium containing unbound radiolabeled OPN. The cells were solubilized with 1 n NaOH and neutralized with 1n HCl, and radioactivity was measured in the γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The Kd value was determined by Scatchard analysis using the LIGAND computer program (30Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Murine ASMMP-2 (5′-CCA CTC GTG CCT CCA TCG TT-3′) and SMMP-2 (5′-AAC GAT GGA GGC ACG AGT-3′) oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate linkages were synthesized (Gemini Biotech). These oligonucleotides were purified by column chromatography, and purity was checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The B16F10 cells were pretreated with OPN (10 μm) at 37 °C for 6 h and then transfected transiently with the sense or antisense S-oligonucleotide using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the sense or antisense S-oligonucleotide was mixed with plus reagent, and then oligonucleotide reagent plus was incubated with LipofectAMINE. The LipofectAMINE Plus-oligonucleotide complex was added to the cells and incubated further at 37 °C for 8 h. The control cells received LipofectAMINE Plus alone. The cell viability was detected by a trypan blue dye exclusion test. After incubation, the oligonucleotide-containing medium was removed, and the cells were refed with fresh medium and cultured for an additional 12 h. The serum-free conditioned medium was used for the detection of MMP-2 by zymography, and the cells were used for migration, ECM invasion, and tumorigenicity experiments as described above. To check the dose-dependent response, a separate transfection experiment was performed with different doses (0–10 μg) of ASMMP-2. The tumorigenicity experiments were performed as described (31Sun Y. Kim H. Parker M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Colburn N.H. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in monolayer and treated in the absence or presence of purified human OPN (10 μm) in serum-free medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After that, the cells (5 × 106 cells/0.2 ml) were detached, centrifuged, washed, and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of male athymic NMRI (nu/nu) mice (6–8 weeks old). Four mice were used in each set of experiments. The mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. OPN (10 μm) was again injected into the tumor sites twice a week for up to 4 weeks. In other experiments, the cells were treated with OPN (10 μm) and injected into mice. A mixture (0.2 ml) of anti-MMP-2 antibody (50 μg/ml) and OPN (10.0 μm) was injected into the same tumor sites twice a week for up to 4 weeks. In separate experiments, the LipofectAMINE Plus-oligonucleotide (ASMMP-2 or SMMP-2) complex was injected into the tumors of the nude mice. After 4 weeks, the mice were killed, and the tumor weights were measured. The tumor tissues were homogenized; l"

They are involved in host defense through their ability to bind to carbohydrate antigens of microorganisms. The scavenger receptors type A and MARCO are classical type scavenger receptors that have internal collagen-like domains. Here we describe a new scavenger receptor that is a membrane-type collectin from placenta (collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1)), which has a typical collectin collagen-like domain and a CRD. The cDNA has an insert of about 2.2 kilobases coding for a protein containing 742 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that CL-P1 is a type II membrane protein, has a coiled-coil region, a collagen-like domain, and a CRD. It resembles type A scavenger receptors because the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain is replaced by a CRD. Northern analyses, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry show that CL-P1 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells but not in macrophages. By immunoblotting and flow cytometry CL-P1 appears to be a membrane glycoprotein of about 140 kDa in human umbilical vein or arterial endothelial cells, placental membrane extracts, and CL-P1 transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. We found that CL-P1 can bind and phagocytose not only bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) but also yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Furthermore, it reacts with oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) but not with acetylated LDL (AcLDL). These binding activities are inhibited by polyanionic ligands (polyinosinic acid, polyguanylic acid, dextran sulfate) and OxLDL but not by polycationic ligands (polyadenylic acid or polycytidylic acid), LDL, or AcLDL. These results indicate that CL-P1 might play important roles in host defenses that are different from those of soluble collectins in innate immunity.

In addition, the type A scavenger receptor (SR-A) also contains a collagen-like domain, which forms an oligomeric structure and binding sites (15Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J.

The primary function of scavenger receptors is the destruction and neutralization of pathogens by endocytosis and phagocytosis. Recent knockout data show that SR-AI-deficient mice are sensitive to Listeria and HSV infections. Thus, it appears that scavenger receptors also have a role in innate immunity (16Suzuki H.

Here we report the molecular cloning of a new membrane-type collectin that functions as a scavenger receptor. The cDNA for this receptor was first synthesized from placenta RNA, and the receptor is called collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1). It is present mainly in endothelial cells but is not present in monocyte-macrophage lineage cells. Surprisingly, this new collectin can bind and phagocytose bacteria and yeast as well as oxidized LDL. Escherichia coli lysis buffer A for the His-Tag system consisted of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Column buffers B, C, D, and E consisted of 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 10 mm Tris; the pH of each buffer was 8.0, 6.3, 5.9, and 4.5, respectively. LB medium contained 1% (w/v) Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, and 1% (w/v) NaCl. IDG medium contained 0.4% casamino acids, 0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05% NaCl, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.5% glucose, and 1 mm MgCl2. Tris-buffered saline (TBS) consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and TBS/C was TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2. Coating buffer contained 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, and 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, pH 9.6. Screening an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for potential new collectin genes revealed a novel gene in EST clone numbers W72977 and R74387. The partial clone (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone ID 34472 of W72977) from a fetal heart cDNA was purchased from ATCC and used to screen a human placenta cDNA library for full-length cDNAs by plaque hybridization. To generate a digoxigenin-DNA probe, we used the PCR. Primers amplifying the DNA probe were synthesized based on the 5′ and 3′ end nucleotide sequences of the insert in clone W72977. The primers synthesized were 5′-CAATCTGATGAGAAGGTGATG-3′ for the reverse primer and 5′-ACGAGGGGCTGGATGGGACAT-3′ for the forward primer. PCR was carried out using a PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction mixture in 50 μl consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 130 mm dTTP, 70 mmdigoxigenin-11-dUTP, 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, 1 μm each primer, and 20 ng of cDNA clone W72977. PCR was performed for 30 cycles in a TaKaRa PCR thermal cycler model 480 (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Each cycle consisted of denaturation for 20 s at 95 °C, annealing for 20 s at 60 °C, and extension for 20 s at 72 °C. The PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and then extracted from the gel using a Sephaglas BandPrep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A phage library was screened essentially as described previously (18Kawai T. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Ohtani K. Kase T. Fujinaga Y. Sakamoto T. Kurimura T. Wakamiya N. Gene. 1997; 186: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1 × 106 plaque forming units of a human placenta λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) were plated with E. coli Y1090r− and incubated at 42 °C for 5 h. Nylon filters (Nytran 13N; Schleicher & Schuell Co.) were prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in hybri-buffer (5 × SSC, 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS), and then hybridized for 16 h at 55 °C with a digoxigenin-labeled probe in the hybri-buffer. The filters were washed twice for 5 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and then twice for 15 min at 55 °C in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The hybridized probe was detected by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Fab) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:5000. The enzyme-catalyzed color reaction was carried out using a nitro blue tetrazolium salt/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgC12. The cDNA inserts in the positive clones were amplified using the primers described above and then directly subcloned in the pCR2.1 vector of a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The subclones were sequenced using an Autoread DNA sequencing kit and an A.L.F. autosequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify the sequence including the transcription start site we took the cDNA including the transcription start site from the Cap Site cDNATM (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) of human placenta by nested PCR (6Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. J. Biol.

Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 574Google Scholar). This procedure is called “cap site hunting” (19Shimamoto A. Funaki H. Yamaguchi M. Watabiki M. Yoneda H. Furuichi Y. Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 574Google Scholar). The primer sets for the first PCR were 5′-CCGGTGGACCTTGTAGTATTG-3′ of the 1RC2 primer (Nippon Gene) and 5′-TTCTTGATGAGCTGACCATGC-3′ of the TGP1 primer that were synthesized commercially. The primer sets for the second PCR were 5′-GTACGCCACAGCGTATGATGC-3′ of the 2RC2 primer (Nippon Gene) and 5′-CATTCTTGACAAACTTCATAG-3′ of the TGP2 primer which were also synthesized commercially. The reaction mixture in 50 μl consisted of LA PCR Buffer II (Mg2+-free), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), 1 μl of Cap Site cDNATM from human placenta, 1.25 unit of TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), and 0.5 μm 1RC2 primer and PR1 primer for the first PCR and 2RC2 primer and PR2 primer for the second PCR. The first PCR was performed for 35 cycles in a TaKaRa PCR thermal cycler MP, each cycle consisting of denaturation for 20 s at 95 °C, annealing for 20 s at 60 °C, and extension for 20 s at 72 °C. The second PCR was performed for 25 cycles in the same buffer and with the same conditions using 1 μl of the first PCR products as template. After gel electrophoresis the final PCR products were extracted from the agarose gel and directly subcloned in the pT7Blue T-Vector (Novagen). The subclones were sequenced using an Autoread DNA sequencing kit and an A.L.F. autosequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human multiple tissue Northern blot membrane was purchased from CLONTECH. It contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. The membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 3 h in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 65 °C with RNA synthesized in vitro and labeled with digoxigenin using a PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The template for the DNA probe was a cDNA whole insert subcloned into pBluescriptII (Stratagene). The filters were washed twice for 5 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then for 15 min in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. The hybridized probe was detected as described above. Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out using total RNAs (1 μg) from brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, trachea, bone marrow, colon, small intestine, spleen, stomach, thymus, mammary gland, prostate, skeletal muscle, testis, uterus, cerebellum, fetal brain, fetal liver, spinal cord, placenta, adrenal gland, pancreas, salivary gland, and thyroid. The RT reaction used oligo(dT)-adaptor primers (RNA LA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) version 1.1, TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The RT products were amplified in a thermal cycler (TaKaRa PCR thermal cycler MP) by 28 cycles of PCR using degenerated primer sets (0.2 μm), TaKaRa LA Taq polymerase (1.25 units), and RT reaction products. The primer sets for PCR were 5′-TGCCCCTGGCCCTGCAGAATG-3′ (CL-P1), 5′-CCACAGCAATGAATGGCTTT-3′ (CL-L1), 5′-ATGGTGATAGTAGCCTGGCTG-3′ (MBP), 5′-GTGGAGAGAAGGGGGAGGCTG-3′ (SP-A), and 5′-GGGACAAAGGCATTCCTGGAG-3′ (SP-D) for the reverse primers and 5′-GGAGTGTCCTTTGCCTTTGAG-3′ (CL-P1), 5′-TAGCAAATACGTAGGATGAG-3′ (CL-L1), 5′-TCAGATAGGGAACTCACAGAC-3′ (MBP), 5′-CCCTGTCCCATGGCCTAAATG-3′ (SP-A), and 5′-TCAGAACTCGCAGACCACAAG-3′ (SP-D) for the forward primers. Amplicons were separated on 1.0% agarose gels. Human LDL was prepared from human plasma by stepwise sodium bromide density gradient centrifugation (20Itabe H. Yamamoto H. Suzuki M. Kawai Y. Nakagawa Y. Suzuki A. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33208-33217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All sodium bromide stock solutions contained 0.25 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, LDL was recovered from the fractions with densities of 1.09–1.063 g/cm3. Prior to oxidation, an aliquot of LDL was passed through a 10DGR desalting column (Bio-Rad) to remove EDTA. OxLDL was prepared by the incubation of LDL (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h with 50 μm CuSO4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.25 mm EDTA. The electrophoretic mobility of the OxLDL toward the anode was approximately 3 times higher than that of unmodified LDL. The OxLDL contained about approximately 50 nmol of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)/mg of protein (21Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22506) Google Scholar). The TBARS of the native LDL was about 1 nmol/mg of protein. Acetylation of LDL (AcLDL) was performed as described previously (22Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Acetylation resulted in the derivatization of more than 75% of the free amino groups as determined with the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid assay (23Ling W. Lougheed M. Suzuki H. Buchan A. Kodama T. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Labeling of LDL, OxLDL, and AcLDL with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) (Molecular Probes) was performed as described previously (24Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the CRD region in CL-P1 (amino acids 590–742 of human CL-P1) in E. coli (pPLH3 and E. coli GI724) was carried out as described previously (6Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The fusion protein CL-P1-CRDhis was used to produce antisera in chickens. Purification and identification of the recombinant CL-P1-CRDhis was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using chicken IgY purified with an EGGstract IgY purification system (Promega). The CL-P1 antibody reacted with CL-P1-CRD but not with CL-L1-CRD, human MBP-CRD, human SP-A-CRD, or human SP-D-CRD on immunoblots (data not shown). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (catalog No. R950–25). The expression vector (pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen)) had two tag proteins of Myc and histidine at its C-terminal end. If the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and chicken anti-CL-P1-CRD antibody react with the plasma membranes of living transfectants, it would indicate that the C-terminal end portion of CL-P1 may be on the surface of the cells. CHO-ldlA7 cells, kindly provided by Dr. M. Krieger (MIT), which lack functional LDL receptors, were maintained at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (25Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA of human CL-P1 was amplified from a human placenta cDNA library by PCR using the forward primer 5′-AATGCGGCCGCACCATGAAAGACGACTTCGCAGAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGACCGCGGTAATGCAGATGACAGTAC-3′. The amplified human CL-P1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and transfected into CHO-ldlA7 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (LF2000) reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To select CL-P1 positive clones, cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Positive cells were detected and sorted using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). Positive clones were checked by the above method, and a stable clone (CHO/CL-P1) was established. CHO/SR-BI cells, which had been transfected with hamster SR-BI cDNA, were a gift from Dr. H. Arai (26Fukasawa M. Adachi H. Hirota K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). They were maintained at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin and perfused through the left ventricle with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and then with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 h, and hearts were collected and treated as described elsewhere (27Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Specimens were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Ultrathin sections were stained immunohistochemically and with Mayer's hematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry was done with anti-CL-P1 antibody (chicken IgY), anti-chicken IgY conjugated with HRP (Chemicon International, Inc.), biotinylated tyramide solution, and avidin-Alexa 488 solution using the TSATM biotin system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The fluorescent images were observed with an Olympus IX70–23 FL/DIC-SP and SPOT2-SP system (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.). The transfected cells (CHO/CL-P1) were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/0.2 ml in 14-mm wells of 35-mm plastic culture dishes (Matsunami Glass Industries, Ltd., Japan) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml G418. They were not fixed and directly incubated with anti-Myc murine monoclonal antibody and anti-CL-P1 chicken antibody, followed by anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa 594 and anti-chicken IgY-conjugated Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) as described previously (6Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent flow cytometry was performed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAEC), both from ATCC. Cells were incubated with anti-CL-P1 chicken antibody and anti-chicken IgY-conjugated Alexa 488 at 4 °C for 30 min and assayed with a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). Appropriate cell fractions were selected using a two-dimensional display of forward scatter and side scatter. Western blotting analyses were performed using CL-P1 transfected cells, HUVEC, placental tissue membrane extracts (BioChain Institute, Inc., CA) without or with de-glycosylation (Enzymatic Deglycosylation kit, Bio-Rad), and in vitro transcription and translation products of CL-P1 cDNA. In vitrotranscription/translation was performed with the TnT T7 Quick Coupled transcription translation system (Promega). All cell surfaces were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). The cells were lysed with SDS-sample lysis buffer as described previously (28Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and fractions were collected after incubation with anti-biotin-agarose (Sigma). Equal concentrations of protein (20 μg), cell lysates, and synthesized protein solutions were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by electroblotting onto BioBlot-NC membranes (Corning Costar Corp.). Membranes were incubated with anti-CL-P1 chicken antibody or anti-Myc murine monoclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY (Chemicon International, Inc.) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International, Inc.). Bands were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) as described previously (6Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CHO/CL-P1, CHO/SR-BI, and CHO-ldlA7 cells were plated at densities of 3 × 104cells/0.2 ml in 14-mm wells of 35-mm plastic culture dishes and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum with or without 0.4 mg/ml G418. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with DiI-OxLDL, DiI-AcLDL, and DiI-LDL. Fluorescent images were observed with the Olympus IX70–23 FL/DIC-SP and SPOT2-SP system (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.). CHO/CL-P1 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 μg/ml DiI-OxLDL in the presence at 200 μg/ml of LDL, AcLDL, and OxLDL24, 10 μg/ml dextran sulfate, polycationic ligands (poly(A), poly(C)), and polyanionic ligands (poly(G), poly(I)) (29Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of DiI-OxLDL, cells were washed and then fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, treated with 1 drop of SlowFade antifade reagent (Molecular Probes), mounted, and sealed. The fluorescent images were observed with the same system as above. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using IPLab imaging software (Scanalytics, Inc.). CHO/CL-P1 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 1 μg/ml E. coli(K12 strain) BioParticles conjugated with Texas Red (Molecular Probes),Staphylococcus aureus BioParticles conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes), or zymosan A (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) BioParticles conjugated with Texas Red (Molecular Probes). After binding, cells were fixed at room temperature for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa 488. Fluorescent images were observed with the system described above. The uptake assay using S. cerevisiae BioParticles conjugated with Texas Red (Molecular Probes) was performed at 37 °C overnight under 5% CO2. After the same staining, phagocytosed bioparticles were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss Co. Ltd.). We screened DNA data bases to identify novel members of the collectin family and identified a cDNA fragment from human EST data bases that showed carboxyl-terminal sequence homology with the collectins. The EST cloneW72977 from a fetal heart cDNA library was used to screen a human placenta cDNA library, and positive clones were isolated. In addition, “Cap-site hunting” (19Shimamoto A. Funaki H. Yamaguchi M. Watabiki M. Yoneda H. Furuichi Y. Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 574Google Scholar) was performed to determine the complete 5′-terminal sequence including the transcription start site of a new collectin mRNA. Restriction mapping and sequencing of the clones revealed that they contained an open reading frame of 2226 base pairs encoding a sequence of 742 amino acids (Fig.1 a). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a collectin structure consisting of a collagen-like region and a CRD. This new collectin, designated collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1), has an intracytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain with a coiled-coil region, a collagen domain, and a CRD (Fig. 1 b). At the amino acid level the cloned mouse CL-P1 has high sequence identity (92%) and the same length and same domain sizes as human CL-P1 (Fig. 1 a). The homology between human and mouse CL-P1 is the highest among the collectins. The collagen domain had the highest homology and has 49 more Gly-X-Y cycles than SR-AI (15Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsu-daira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). CL-P1 has three polycationic regions in a collagen domain that contain basic amino acids (arginine or lysine). These amino acid sequences are almost identical to those in human and mouse CL-P1. CL-P1 has a C-type lectin consisting of six cysteine residues, which is highly homologous to the CRDs in macrophage lectin 2 and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (1Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its ligand specificity is of the galactose type (Gln-Pro-Asp), which is different from the mannose and glucose types (Glu-Pro-Asn) (30Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The whole structure of CL-P1 resembles that of SR-AI (Fig. 1 b). The structures of other SRs, LOX-1 (31Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) and SREC (29Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), expressed in endothelial cells are completely different from those of SR-AI and CL-P1. SR-AI and CL-P1 can form oligomeric structures due to their collagen-like regions and coiled-coil structures. The polycharge islands in the collagen-polymer structure form a strong binding site for negatively charged substances. An endocytosis motif (Tyr-Lys-Arg-Phe) (32Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domigo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), like in the asialoglycoprotein receptor, is present in the intracytoplasmic domain. RT-PCR analyses showed that most tissues express CL-P1 mRNA, in contrast to CL-L1, MBP, SP-A, and SP-D mRNAs (Fig.2 a). Northern blot analyses showed a major band of about 3.2 kilobases in placenta, heart, and lung (Fig. 2 b). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CL-P1 is localized in murine vascular endothelial cells in the heart (Fig.3 a). We also found expression of CL-P1 protein in most vascular endothelial cells in all murine vessels and human heart sections (data not shown). This distribution of CL-P1 protein is consistent with the expression of CL-P1 mRNA in vascular-rich tissues. Macrophages, monocytes, and hepatic Kupffer cells did not express CL-P1 or CL-P1 mRNA (data not shown). The expression of CL-P1 in HUVEC and HUAEC was shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 3 b). However, THP-1, U937, and HL-60 treated with lipopolysaccharide were negative in the above analyses (data not shown). A study of the expression of CL-P1 cDNA in CHO cells showed that this new collectin is a type II membrane protein because it was detected by anti-C-terminal tag antibody (anti-Myc monoclonal antibody) and anti-CRD antibody (CRD at the C-terminal end) (Fig. 3 c). The non-transfected cells were not stained by two antibodies, respectively (data not shown). It was found that CL-P1 has an approximate molecular mass of 140 kDa in CHO/CL-P1, HUVEC, and placenta membrane extracts using anti-Myc and anti-CL-P1 antibodies (Fig.3 d). Deglycosylated CL-P1 produced by an in vitrotranscription/translation system has a mass of 90 kDa, which matches the calculated molecular mass (Fig. 3d). CL-P1 has several N-glycosylation sites in its coiled-coil region. CL-P1 has an oligomeric structure due to its collagen-like and coiled-coil helical domains. Its molecular mass is very high under non-reducing conditions, and the truncated form of CL-P1, lacking a transmembrane domain, is a trimer of about 300 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown).Figure 3Detection of CL-P1 protein by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, membrane immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting. a, paraformaldehyde-fixed sections of murine heart that was cut vertically were stained with chicken anti-human CL-P1-CRD antibody (left, × 10, × 40) and counterstained with hematoxylin eosin (right, × 10, × 40). The arrowheads indicate endothelial cells in micro and small vessels surrounding heart smooth muscle cells, and the arrows indicate endothelial cells in the coronary artery.b, flow cytometry showed membrane immunofluorescences in HUVEC and HUAEC. c, membrane immunofluorescence analyses showed CL-P1 on the surfaces of transfected CHO cells using anti-Myc tag and anti-CL-P1 antibodies. d, extracts of CHO/CL-P1 cells (lanes 1 and 2), HUVEC (lane 3), placenta (lane 4), deglycosylated placenta (lane 5), and in vitro transcription/translation products (lane 6) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and probing with chicken anti-CL-P1 antibody (lanes 1,3, 4, 5, and 6) and mouse anti-Myc antibody (lane 2). The bound antibody was visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and a BCIP/NBT substrate system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Modified LDLs and native LDL were incubated with CHO/CL-P1, CHO/SR-BI, and CHO-ldlA7 cells. OxLDL bound to CHO/CL-P1 cells but Ac-LDL and LDL did not (Fig.4 a). CHO/SR-BI cells could bind all LDLs (OxLDL, AcLDL, and LDL), but CHO-ldlA7 cells did not bind any of them. The binding of DiI-OxLDL to CHO/CL-P1 cells was inhibited by negative polycharged substances (poly(I,G) and dextran sulfate) and by OxLDL but not by LDL or AcLDL (Fig. 4 b). The TBARS of the OxLDL was about 50 nmol/mg. Another OxLDL receptor, LOX-1, showed specific binding of mildly oxidized LDL (TBARS about 10 nmol/mg) (33Yoshida H. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Microbes also bound to CHO/CL-P1 cells (Fig.5). A previous study showed that E. coli and S. aureus, but not yeast , bound to MARCO (34Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which is one of the SR-As. CHO/CL-P1 cells bound yeast as well as E. coli and S. aureus. The non-transfected CHO cells did not bind any of microbes (data not shown). Overnight incubation revealed that yeasts were endocytosed and digested (Fig. 5 b). These binding activities were also inhibited by polyanionic ligands (dextran sulfate and poly(I,G)) (data not shown). Recently, it was found that SR-AI knockout mice have increased fatality from HSV and Listeria infections (16Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H.

Here we show that a scavenger receptor may play a role in innate immunity. CL-P1 is a member of the collectin family, which is considered to play significant roles in innate immunity. Classical collectins are soluble, but CL-P1 is membrane-bound. CL-P1 might bind and control not only bacteria and yeasts but also modified LDLs in the vascular space. The collagen-like domains in human and mouse CL-P1, which have the highest identity (96%) described to date, may play the most important role in these biological functions. A detailed examination of the active binding sites is needed. Here we identified a new collectin, CL-P1, which may have a novel function in the process of atherogenesis as well as a role in protecting against bacterial and yeast pathogens. We thank Professors T. Kinoshita, T. Azuma, H. Nakada, and K. Drickamer for useful discussions and Dr. H. Schulman for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2058811553,"Mechanisms of cationic lipid-based nucleic acid delivery are receiving increasing attention, but despite this the factors that determine high or low activity of lipoplexes are poorly understood. This study is focused on the fine structure of cationic lipid-DNA complexes (lipoplexes) and its relevance to transfection efficiency. Monocationic (N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl),N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride,N-(1-(2,3-dimyristyloxypropyl)-N,N-dimethyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium bromide) and polycationic (2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanammonium trifluoroacetate) lipid-based assemblies, with or without neutral lipid (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol) were used to prepare lipoplexes of different L+/DNA− charge ratios. Circular dichroism, cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy, and static light scattering were used for lipoplex characterization, whereas expression of human growth hormone or green fluorescent protein was used to quantify transfection efficiency. All monocationic lipids in the presence of inverted hexagonal phase-promoting helper lipids (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol) induced appearance of Ψ− DNA, a chiral tertiary DNA structure. The formation of Ψ− DNA was also dependent on cationic lipid-DNA charge ratio. On the other hand, monocationic lipids either alone or with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine as helper lipid, or polycationic 2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanammonium trifluoroacetate-based assemblies, neither of which promotes a lipid-DNA hexagonal phase, did not induce the formation of Ψ− DNA. Parallel transfection studies reveal that the size and phase instability of the lipoplexes, and not the formation of Ψ− DNA structure, correlate with optimal transfection."

However, the mechanisms by which Notch signals are transduced into cells still remain elusive. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms for Notch in the cell fate control of neural progenitor cells. We show that Deltex-1 (DTX1), a mammalian homolog ofDrosophila Deltex, mediates a Notch signal to block differentiation of neural progenitor cells. We found that a significant fraction of DTX1 proteins were localized in the nucleus and physically interacted with the transcriptional coactivator p300. Through its binding to p300, DTX1 inhibited transcriptional activation by the neural-specific helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor MASH1, and this mechanism is likely responsible for the differentiation inhibition of neural progenitor cells. Our results further suggest that DTX1 regulates transcription independently of the previously characterized Notch signaling pathway involving RBP-J and HES1/HES5. Thus, DTX1 serves as an important signaling component downstream of Notch that regulates transcription in the nucleus.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has established that the Notch signaling system plays vital and universal roles in development of a variety of tissues and organs (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

Recent advances have further revealed that either loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations of the genes encoding Notch receptors and their ligands are involved in pathogenesis of human diseases (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Based on the above findings, recent intensive efforts have been focused in studies on the intracellular signaling mechanisms downstream of Notch. Much of our knowledge about the molecules involved in Notch signaling has come from studies in fly and nematode. InDrosophila, Suppressor-of-Hairless (Su(H)) is an important signaling component (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar, 2Kimble J. Simpson P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 333-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Genes encoding proteins homologous to Su(H) have also been identified in both Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates and termed lag-1 and RBP-J(also termed CBF-1 and KBF2), respectively (4Honjo T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). All of the proteins belonging to the Su(H)/RBP-J/LAG-1 family physically associate with the intracellular domain of Notch receptors (5Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Furthermore, Drosophila Su(H) acts in the nucleus as a transcriptional regulator of the Enhancer-of-Split gene complex (E(spl)-C), one of the major targets for Notch signals (13Lecourtois M.

An analogous mechanism has been implicated in vertebrates, in which RBP-J activates the E(spl)-C homologsHes1 and Hes5 (6Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A.

Vital roles for RBP-J, HES1, and HES5 in normal development of vertebrates have been demonstrated in gene-targeting studies in mice (15Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R.

Nevertheless, more recent studies on Drosophila have demonstrated the presence of Notch functions independent of Su(H) and E(spl)-C (13Lecourtois M. Schweisguth F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 18Wang S. Younger-Shepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1997; 124: 4435-4446PubMed Google Scholar, 19Matsuno K. Go M.J.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R.

Supporting this idea, a novel signaling pathway involvingdeltex has recently been characterized inDrosophila (24Diederich R.J. Matsuno K. Hing H. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1994; 120: 473-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Matsuno K. Diederich R.J. Go M.J. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1995; 121: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three closely related members of the Deltex family (DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3) have also been identified in mammals (26Matsuno K. Eastman D. Mitsiades T. Quinn A.M. Carcanciu M.L. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Ordentlich P. Lin A.

All of these fly and mammalian Deltex homologs share many common features in structure, suggesting their important roles in Notch signaling. However, details of their biological functions remain largely unknown. Neurons and glia in the vertebrate nervous system are generated from multipotential neural progenitor cells. During development, neural progenitor cells continue proliferation without overt differentiation, whereas at later stages, they stop dividing and differentiate at particular times and positions. Many lines of previous studies have demonstrated that Notch is involved in this cell fate control event (29Wang S. Barres B. Neuron. 1999; 27: 197-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recent studies have further demonstrated the important roles of the conventional Notch signaling components such as RBP-J, HES1, and HES5 in vertebrate neurogenesis. However, the signaling mechanisms by which the Notch receptors control the differentiation of neural progenitor cells still remain poorly understood. To better understand the functions of Notch signaling in neural development, we examined the intracellular signaling mechanisms in neural progenitor cells in vitro. We took advantage of the immortalized cell line MNS-70, which exhibits many of the properties of multipotential neural progenitor cells (30Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Nakagawa Y. Kaneko T. Ogura T. Suzuki T. Torii M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M. Development. 1996; 122: 2449-2464PubMed Google Scholar, 32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that constitutive expression of a dominant-active form of Notch1 blocked differentiation of MNS-70 cells, and overexpression of the human Deltex homolog DTX1 mimicked this inhibition. Our results suggest that these inhibitory actions of Notch1 and DTX1 are attributable to their ability to block transcriptional activation by the neural-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1transcription factor MASH1. We found that significant fractions of endogenous and exogenous DTX1 proteins were localized in the nucleus and physically associated with the transcriptional coactivator p300. Several lines of evidence suggest that this action of DTX1 is independent of the signaling pathway involving RBP-J and HES1/HES5. Together, our results support the idea that DTX1 regulates nuclear transcription through targeting p300, thereby serving as an important signaling component downstream of Notch. Mouse Notch1 cDNA fragments were engineered to encode the following amino acids (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number Z11886): Notch1-A, 1704–2531; Notch1-B, 1704–2097; Notch1-C, 1704–1976; Notch1-D, 1848–2372; Notch1-E, 1848–2075; Notch1-F, 1704–1847; and Notch1-G, 1744–2372. The FLAG tag epitope sequence was attached in frame to the N-terminal ends of these mutants to enable detection of the proteins in cultured cells. The Myc tag epitope was attached to the C-terminal end of human DTX1 to yield DTX1-Myc (25Matsuno K. Diederich R.J. Go M.J. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1995; 121: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of human DTX1 (accession numberAF053700) and p300 (accession number U01877) were obtained by polymerase chain reactions to encode the following amino acids: DTX1-A, 1–620; DTX1-B, 1–412; DTX1-C, 1–213; DTX1-D, 209–412; DTX1-E, 209–620; DTX1-F, 397–620; p300-A, 1–745; p300-B, 742–1740; p300-C, 1730–2414; and p300-D, 1510–1922. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag and FLAG tag epitopes were attached in frame to the N-terminal ends of the resultant fragments of DTX1 and p300, respectively. Dominant-negative RBP-J carries a point mutation substituting histidine for lysine at position 218 of mouse RBP-J (a kind gift from T. Honjo) (9Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura-Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FLAG-MASH1 and HA-p300 cDNAs encoded full-length rat MASH1 (provided by R. Kageyama) and human p300, respectively, with the tag sequences fused at their N-terminal ends. All of the above constructs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS. The C-terminal transactivation domain of MASH1 (amino acids 168–233) and the N-terminal domain of p300 (p300-A) were fused with the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4 (amino acids 1–147) to yield pGal4-MASH1-TAD and pGal4-p300-A, respectively. The neuroepithelial cell line MNS-70 was established from the forebrain and midbrain neuroepithelia of embryonic day (E) 11.5 rat embryos and manipulated as described previously (30Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Nakagawa Y. Kaneko T. Ogura T. Suzuki T. Torii M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M.

Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated cells were maintained in monolayer (monolayer cultures). To induce differentiation, the cells were allowed to form aggregates in floating culture for 3 days in medium containing 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 μm β-estrogen (Sigma) (aggregation cultures). Cell aggregates were then reseeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated dishes and cultured for 3 days to generate neurons and glia (differentiation cultures) (see Ref. 32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for details). Sublines of MNS-70 cells were established by transfection of the expression plasmid harboring FLAG-Notch1-A or DTX1-Myc cDNA. The subline H1-1 was the clone obtained by transfection of the control vector. Indirect immunocytochemical detection of nestin, microtubule-associated protein-2, and glial fibrillary acidic protein was performed as described previously (32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stained cells were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, and cell nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Molecular Probes, Inc.) before mounting. Coronal cryosections (10 μm thick) of forebrain neuroepithelia of Sprague-Dawley rat embryos at E14.5 were subjected to immunocytochemistry with antibodies against Notch1 and DTX1 as described previously (32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-Notch1 antibody 93-4 recognizes the intracellular domain of Notch1 (21Shawber C. Nofziger D. Hsieh J.J. Lindsell C. Bogler O. Hayward D. Weinmaster G. Development. 1996; 122: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity-purified rabbit anti-DTX1 and anti-DTX2 antibodies were generated by immunization with the synthetic oligopeptides NH2-DASYLDNVLAELTAQGVSEA-COOH and NH2-DPNYLQNVLAELAAQGVTED-COOH, which correspond to the predicted C-terminal amino acid sequences of murine DTX1 and DTX2, respectively (28Kishi N. Tang Z. Maeda Y. Hirai A. Mo R. Ito M. Suzuki S. Nakao K. Kinoshita T. Kadesch T. Hui C. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Okano H. Matsuno K. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 19: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The specificity of anti-DTX1 and anti-DTX2 antibodies was confirmed by immunoblot analyses. Staining was visualized with an ImmunoPure cobalt/nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Pierce) as described previously (32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were counterstained with methyl green before mounting. The 354-base pair genomic fragment of the mouse Hes1 gene (positions −193 to +161; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number D16464) was cloned into pGVB (TOYO-INKI) to yield pHes1-Luc. pE7βA-Luc contains seven repeats of the E box motif (CAGGTG) upstream of the β-actin core promoter (33Akazawa C. Ishibashi M. Shimizu C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8730-8738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The pHNF4-Luc and pGal4-UAS-Luc reporters were described previously (34Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itoh H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assays were performed using NIH3T3, HEK293, and MNS-70 cells. The cells were grown at a density of 6 × 104 (NIH3T3 and HEK293) or 5 × 105 (MNS-70) cells/well of six-well dishes. Transient transfection was performed by the standard calcium precipitation method or by the FuGene-6 lipofection method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each well received an appropriate reporter plasmid (pHes1-Luc DNA, 0.5 μg; pE7βA-Luc DNA, 2 μg; pGal4-UAS-Luc DNA, 0.5 μg; or pHNF4-Luc DNA, 1 μg) in combination with various amounts of expression plasmids. The β-galactosidase expression plasmid pEF-BOS-β-gal was included to normalize the results for transfection efficiency. Expression of MASH1 and nestin proteins in MNS-70 cells was examined as described previously (32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physical interactions of various proteins were examined in co-immunoprecipitation assays. COS-7 cells transfected with various expression plasmids or rat embryos were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mmKCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein complex was recovered by immunoprecipitation and subjected to Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-tag antibodies (anti-FLAG M2 antibody, Eastman Kodak Co.; anti-Myc 9E10 and anti-HA 12CA5 antibodies, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and goat anti-p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear and cytoplasmic/membrane-associated proteins were fractionated by the method described previously (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The proteins fractionated from equal numbers of cells (3 × 104 COS-7 cells and 1 × 105 MNS-70 cells) or from ∼2% of the total homogenate of an E14.5 rat embryo were subjected to Western blotting. The distribution of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins was examined as a control. Immunoreactive bands were visualized and quantified with a Vistra ECF Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by measuring fluorescence intensity using FluorImager SI. Plasmid constructs were designed to express various fragments of DTX1 and p300 as fusion proteins with Gal4-DBD and Gal4-TAD, respectively. The yeast strain PJ69-4A, in which expression of the HIS3 genes is under the control of the GAL1 promoter, was transformed with various combinations of the plasmids. The transcriptional activity ofHIS3 was monitored to detect protein-protein interactions as described previously (36James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the functions of Notch1 and DTX1 in the neural progenitor cell line MNS-70, we established its sublines that constitutively express either a dominant-active (DA) mouse Notch1 (herein termed Notch1-A) (Fig.1 A; see Fig. 2 A) or full-length human DTX1 (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies have demonstrated that truncated mutant forms of Notch receptors in which the large extracellular domains are deleted acquire ligand-independent signaling activities (4Honjo T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, we expected to see that forced expression of Notch1-A would transduce constitutive Notch signals into cells. Likewise, in Drosophila, overexpression ofdeltex recapitulates some of the phenotypes of DA alleles ofNotch (25Matsuno K. Diederich R.J. Go M.J. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1995; 121: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously (30Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Nakagawa Y. Kaneko T. Ogura T. Suzuki T. Torii M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M.

Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these sublines remained undifferentiated in monolayer culture, and the majority (>98%) of the cells expressed the intermediate filament protein nestin, a marker for undifferentiated neural progenitor cells (data not shown). Their differentiation could be conditionally induced through the formation of cell aggregates in floating culture and subsequent reseeding on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Upon differentiation induction, ∼20% of the cells became microtubule-associated protein-2-positive neurons in cultures of both the parental MNS-70 cells and the H1-1 control subline cells (TableI). Another 60% of the cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, a specific marker for astrocytes; and consequently, the percentage of nestin-positive cells was decreased to ∼10%. The remaining cells probably corresponded to intermediate progenitor subtypes that transiently emerge during differentiation of MNS-70 cells (30Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, three independent sublines expressing Notch1-A generated much lower percentages of neurons and glia under the same conditions, and the majority of these cells expressed nestin (32Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M. Development. 1999; 126: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of DTX1 also blocked generation of neurons and glia in three independent sublines (TableI).Figure 2Physical interactions of DTX1 with Notch1 in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2027364010,"Flagellin, the main building block of the bacterial flagellum, acts as potent elicitor of defense responses in different plant species. Genetic analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana identified two distinct loci, termed FLS1 and FLS2, that are essential for perception of flagellin-derived elicitors. FLS2 was found to encode a leucine-rich repeat transmembrane receptor-like kinase with similarities to Toll-like receptors involved in the innate immune system of mammals and insects. Here we used a radiolabeled derivative of flg22, a synthetic peptide representing the elicitor-active domain of flagellin, to probe the interaction of flagellin with its receptor in A. thaliana. The high affinity binding site detected in intact cells and membrane preparations exhibited specificity for flagellin-derived peptides with biological activity as agonists or antagonists of the elicitor responses. Specific binding activity was measurable in all ecotypes of A. thaliana that show sensitivity to flagellin but was barely detectable in the flagellin-insensitive ecotype Ws-0 affected in FLS1. A strongly impaired binding of flagellin was observed also in several independent flagellin-insensitive mutants isolated from the flagellin-sensitive ecotype La-er. In particular, no binding was found in plants carrying a mutation in the LRR domain of FLS2. These data indicate that the formation of functional receptor-binding sites depends on genes encoded by both loci, FLS1 and FLS2. The tight correlation between the presence of the binding site and elicitor response provides strong evidence that this binding site acts as the physiological receptor of flagellin."

Insulin may act as a neurotrophic factor in the retina via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Excessive glucose flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is implicated in the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and diabetic complications such as nephropathy. We tested whether increased glucose flux through the HBP perturbs insulin action and induces apoptosis in retinal neuronal cells. Exposure of R28 cells, a model of retinal neurons, to 20 mm glucose for 24 h attenuated the ability of 10 nm insulin to rescue them from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and to phosphorylate Akt compared with 5 mm glucose. Glucosamine not only impaired the neuroprotective effect of insulin but also induced apoptosis in R28 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (UDP-HexNAc), end products of the HBP, were increased ∼2- and 15-fold after a 24-h incubation in 20 mm glucose and 1.5 mm glucosamine, respectively. Azaserine, a glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitor, reversed the effect of 20 mmglucose, but not that of 1.5 mm glucosamine, on attenuation of the ability of insulin to promote cell survival and phosphorylate Akt as well as accumulation of UDP-HexNAc. Glucosamine also impaired insulin receptor processing in a dose-dependent manner but did not decrease ATP content. By contrast, in L6 muscle cells, glucosamine impaired insulin receptor processing but did not induce apoptosis. These results suggest that the excessive glucose flux through the HBP may direct retinal neurons to undergo apoptosis in a bimodal fashion; i.e. via perturbation of the neuroprotective effect of insulin mediated by Akt and via induction of apoptosis possibly by altered glycosylation of proteins.

The pro-apoptotic BAX protein was also reported to be induced in neuronal as well as vascular components of the retina in patients with diabetes (3Podesta F. Romeo G. Liu W.-H. Krajewski S. Reed J.C.

However, the mechanism of the neurodegeneration in DR remains open to debate. Because insulin administration reduced the rate of apoptosis in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (2Barber A.J. Lieth E.

Insulin exerts a broad array of biological responses by binding to its specific receptors and activating the intracellular signaling cascades such as the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway. Our recent findings have indicated that physiological concentrations of insulin rescue R28 cells, a model of retinal neurons (6Seigel G.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev.

These observations suggest that insulin may play a critical role in maintaining neuronal survival in the retina. Increased glucose flux through the HBP is thought to play a role in glucose-induced insulin desensitization in peripheral tissues and the development of diabetic complications such as nephropathy (12–26). The first and rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, GFAT, catalyzes the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate. The latter is rapidly metabolized to UDP-HexNAc, i.e.UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, in an ∼3:1 ratio. Although only up to 3% of glucose taken up by cells enters into the HBP, the end products UDP-HexNAc serve as essential substrates for the synthesis of glycosyl side chains of proteins and lipids (12Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13McClain D.A. Crook E.D.

Thus, even modest perturbations of the amount of glucose flux through the HBP can exert diverse effects on protein functions. Glucosamine enters this pathway distal to GFAT (27Kornfeld R. J. Biol.

Diabetes Compl. 2001; 15: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the HBP has also been linked to glucose-mediated changes in cellular growth and growth factor expression. For example, high glucose stimulates transforming growth factor-β mRNA levels and extracellular matrix synthesis via the HBP in mesangial cells (25James L.R. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ly H.

Under physiological conditions, endothelial and glial cells elegantly regulate glucose supply to the neuronal cells in the retina (29Kumagai A.K. Diabetes Metab.

Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, glucose metabolism in retinal neurons is likely to be perturbed under diabetic conditions. The retina expresses active GFAT (36Mazlen R.G. Muellenberg C.G. O'Brien P.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1970; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and synthesizes UDP-HexNAc (37Tesoriere G. Vento R. Magistro D. Dones F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hexosamine content is increased in retinal tissues in humans and rats with diabetes (38Heath H. Patterson R.A. Hart J.C.D. Diabetologia. 1967; 3: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in the vitreous in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits (39Walker F. Patrick R.S. Diabetes. 1968; 17: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). From the evidence presented above, we hypothesized that excessive glucose flux through the HBP and accumulation of UDP-HexNAc could reduce the neuroprotective effect of insulin or directly affect survival mechanisms in retinal neurons. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of high glucose and glucosamine on insulin-mediated anti-apoptosis and IR processing and signaling in R28 cells. Our results indicate that high glucose and glucosamine prevent insulin from protecting R28 cells from apoptosis, which is associated with reduced insulin stimulation of Akt activity. Furthermore, at higher concentrations glucosamine induces apoptosis even in serum-fed R28 cells. Azaserine, bovine insulin, glucosamine, and mannitol were purchased from Sigma.

The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against activated caspase-3 (1:1000; CM-1, Idun Pharmaceuticals). The secondary antibody was rhodamine red-X-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were counter-stained with bisbenzimide Hoechst 33258 (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma) (9Barber A.J.

Subconfluent R28 cells seeded on laminin-coated 100-mm plates were incubated in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and either 15 mmmannitol or 15 mm glucosamine for 8 h. The plates were washed twice and incubated for 1 h in pre-warmed methionine-free minimal essential medium containing 5 mm glucose plus 15 mm mannitol or glucosamine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The media were exchanged for 2 ml containing 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the cells were washed and chased for the indicated periods in pre-warmed DMEM plus 10% newborn bovine serum containing 0.2 mm methionine and either 15 mm mannitol or glucosamine. The cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml). Following a 15-min incubation at 4 °C and centrifugation, the supernatant was absorbed for 60 min with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The cleared supernatant was incubated overnight with anti-IRβ antibody at 4 °C. The immune complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml and then boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and subjected to fluorography. After a 24-h incubation in 5 mmglucose, 20 mm glucose, or 5 mm glucose plus 1.5 mm glucosamine, with or without 10 nminsulin, 100-mm plates of R28 cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected with and sonicated in 0.5 ml of 2% perchloric acid. Following centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 2 min, 4 °C), supernatants were neutralized to pH 7.0 with appropriate amounts of 3 m KOH, 0.5 mMOPS, 0.1 m EDTA. To 200 μl of the neutralized cell extract solution, 753 μl of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mmEDTA, 20 μl of 45 mg/ml glucose, 20 μl of 25 mg/ml NADP, 2 μl of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (≅2.3 units) were added. Following the stabilization of the absorbance at 340 nm, 5 μl of 1:5 diluted hexokinase (≅1.1 units) was added. NADPH, which was generated as a product stoichiometric with ATP, was measured before and after the addition of hexokinase using a Beckman U640 spectrophotometer with analytical wavelength of 340 nm (42Passonneau, J. V., and Lowry, O. H. (1993)Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide, pp. 10–11, 122–123, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ.Google Scholar). Duplicates were done for each sample, blank, and standard curve measurement. ATP contents were corrected for protein amount in the sample and expressed as nmol/mg protein. Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Student-Neuman-Keuls multiple comparisons test or by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test (Instat 2.0, Graphpad Software) (9Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E.N. Seigel G.M. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32814-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was accepted if p < 0.05. We have demonstrated previously that insulin can rescue differentiated R28 cells from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum effect at 10 nm (9Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E.N. Seigel G.M. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32814-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To test whether high glucose or glucosamine abrogates the rescue effect of insulin, R28 cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM plus serum containing 5 mmglucose, 20 mm glucose, or increasing concentrations of glucosamine with mannitol as an osmotic control. The cells were then maintained in serum or deprived of serum with or without 10 nm insulin for an additional 24 h. Following the Hoechst staining, the percentage of pyknotic cells in five randomly sampled visual fields per coverslip (n = 3) was calculated (Fig. 1). In the presence of serum, less than 1% of cells incubated in 5 mm glucose were pyknotic, whereas serum starvation led to pyknosis in ∼15% of cells. Insulin treatment significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the number of pyknotic cells to about 8%, which is consistent with our previous observation (9Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E.N. Seigel G.M. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32814-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Exposure to 15 mmmannitol did not show any effects on serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis and insulin rescue of R28 cells. Cells exposed to 20 mmglucose also had very few pyknotic nuclei in the presence of serum, whereas serum deprivation gave rise to pyknosis to a similar degree as controls. However, insulin treatment did not decrease the number of pyknotic cells, suggesting that high glucose had no deleterious effect on cell survival but blocked the ability of insulin to rescue R28 cells from apoptosis. In contrast, glucosamine induced apoptosis even in the presence of serum and augmented the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). Thus, the total population at counting was substantially less in cells treated with 15 mm glucosamine as compared with other medium conditions (Fig. 1 A). 1.5 mm glucosamine attenuated the anti-apoptotic effect of insulin to similar a degree as 20 mm glucose, whereas 15 mm glucosamine completely abrogated that effect (Fig. 1 B). To test whether the increased flux of glucose through the HBP is involved in the attenuated rescue effect of insulin in cells exposed to high glucose, the effect of azaserine, a GFAT inhibitor (12Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was investigated. Following the 24-h incubation in the indicated media conditions with or without 0.1 μm azaserine, apoptosis was induced, and the neuroprotective effect of insulin was determined as described above. In addition to the Hoechst staining, immunocytochemistry using CM-1, an antibody specifically recognizing activated caspase-3, was also conducted (9Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E.N. Seigel G.M. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32814-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to reduce apoptosis was expressed as a ratio of percent pyknosis in cells deprived of serum to that in cells deprived of serum and treated with insulin (Fig.2 B). In cells incubated in media containing 5 mm glucose and 5 mm glucose plus 15 mm mannitol, insulin increased cell survival approximately by 3-fold irrespective of the presence or absence of azaserine. Incubation in 20 mm glucose again abrogated the neuroprotective effect of insulin in cells deprived of serum, whereas in the presence of azaserine, 20 mm glucose no longer blocked the rescue effect of insulin (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, the HBP was, at least in part, involved in the inhibitory effect of high glucose on insulin-mediated anti-apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, in cells exposed to 1.5 mmglucosamine, insulin increased the cell survival only by 1.5-fold regardless of azaserine treatment. Azaserine treatment also normalized the ability of insulin to inactivate caspase-3 in cells incubated in 20 mm glucose (Fig. 2 A) but not in cells exposed to glucosamine (data not shown), further supporting the above hypothesis. To confirm whether high glucose or glucosamine leads to increased levels of hexosamine metabolites in R28 cells and, if so, whether GFAT inhibition reverses this effect, intracellular UDP-HexNAc was measured after a 24-h incubation in 5 or 20 mm glucose or 1.5 mm glucosamine, with or without insulin or 0.1 μm azaserine. In the absence of azaserine, the UDP-HexNAc content in cells incubated in 5 mm glucose with insulin decreased by 35% of control (5 mm glucose without insulin and azaserine, 100% = 7.68 nmol/mg protein; p < 0.05), whereas 20 mm glucose treatment significantly increased the content by 205.6 and 173.5% in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively (Fig. 3). In the presence of azaserine, on the other hand, the UDP-HexNAc content in cells incubated in 5 mm glucose with insulin was significantly lower than control (5 mm glucose without insulin and with azaserine, 100% = 10.06 nmol/mg protein;p < 0.05), whereas 20 mm glucose did not increase the UDP-HexNAc content irrespective of the presence or absence of insulin. Azaserine alone had no effect on the absolute UDP-HexNAc content in cells incubated in 5 mm glucose (p = 0.154). As expected, incubation in 1.5 mm glucosamine without azaserine increased the UDP-HexNAc content by 1600 and 1800% in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively. Azaserine did not reduce the UDP-HexNAc content in cells irrespective of insulin treatment (Fig. 3). Thus, high glucose and glucosamine increased the hexosamine end product, and GFAT inhibition reversed the UDP-HexNAc content in cells incubated in high glucose but not in low glucosamine. These data also suggest that insulin limits the glucose flux through the HBP at normal glucose concentrations but not when ambient glucose is elevated. To elucidate whether attenuation of insulin action by high glucose and glucosamine occurs at the receptor or at the post-receptor levels, the IR content and tyrosine phosphorylation were quantified. R28 cells were exposed to the indicated combinations of glucose, mannitol, or glucosamine"
https://openalex.org/W2046871655,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases (NADP-GDHs) encoded by GDH1 and GDH3 catalyze the synthesis of glutamate from ammonium and α-ketoglutarate. The GDH2-encoded NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase degrades glutamate producing ammonium and α-ketoglutarate. Until very recently, it was considered that only one biosynthetic NADP-GDH was present in S. cerevisiae. This fact hindered understanding the physiological role of each isoenzyme and the mechanisms involved in α-ketoglutarate channeling for glutamate biosynthesis. In this study, we purified and characterized the GDH1- and GDH3-encoded NADP-GDHs; they showed different allosteric properties and rates of α-ketoglutarate utilization. Analysis of the relative levels of these proteins revealed that the expression of GDH1 and GDH3 is differentially regulated and depends on the nature of the carbon source. Moreover, the physiological study of mutants lacking or overexpressing GDH1 or GDH3 suggested that these genes play nonredundant physiological roles. Our results indicate that the coordinated regulation of GDH1-, GDH3-, and GDH2-encoded enzymes results in glutamate biosynthesis and balanced utilization of α-ketoglutarate under fermentative and respiratory conditions.

NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase minimal medium yeast-peptone-dextrose polymerase chain reaction N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid base pair(s) Like most free living microorganisms, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses amino acid biosynthetic pathways that allow the cell to use ammonium as sole nitrogen source. Ammonium utilization occurs exclusively via its incorporation into glutamate and glutamine (1Magasanik B. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 283-317Google Scholar), a process that can be achieved by two metabolic routes. One of them is constituted by the concerted action of glutamine synthetase and the GLT1-encoded glutamate synthase (2Tempest D.W. Meers J.L. Brown C.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 405-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 3Roon R.J. Even H.L. Larimore F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other pathway is mediated by the NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP-GDH)1 (EC 1.4.1.4), a broadly distributed enzyme that catalyzes the reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate (4Holzer H. Schneider S. Biochem. Z. 1957; 328: 361-367Google Scholar, 5Benachenhou-Lahfa N. Forterre P. Labendan B. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, two genes (GDH1 and GDH3) have been described whose products constitute NADP-GDH isoenzymes (6Avendaño A. DeLuna A. Olivera H. Valenzuela L. González A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5594-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamate catabolism is achieved through a reaction catalyzed by a different but related enzyme, the GDH2-encoded NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH) (EC 1.4.1.2), which determines glutamate degradation to ammonium and α-ketoglutarate (4Holzer H. Schneider S. Biochem. Z. 1957; 328: 361-367Google Scholar, 7Smith E.L. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XI. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975: 293-367Google Scholar, 8Miller S.M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).S. cerevisiae is the first microorganism described in which the NADP-GDH activity is encoded by two genes (6Avendaño A. DeLuna A. Olivera H. Valenzuela L. González A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5594-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the physiological significance of this apparent redundancy is not clear. When this yeast is grown on glucose and ammonium as carbon and nitrogen sources, Gdh1p is the primary pathway for glutamate biosynthesis (6Avendaño A. DeLuna A. Olivera H. Valenzuela L. González A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5594-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Drillien R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Grenson M. Dubois E. Piotrowska M. Drillien R. Aigle M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 128: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that GDH1 expression is regulated by the HAP system (11Dang V.D. Bohn C. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to control expression of genes involved in carbon metabolism and respiratory function (12Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Null gdh3Δ mutants show no evident growth phenotype on glucose, and GDH3-dependent activity is negligible on this carbon source. Nevertheless, a biosynthetic role was established for GDH3 in a double gdh1Δ glt1Δ mutant that grows on ammonium sulfate as sole nitrogen source by means of Gdh3p (6Avendaño A. DeLuna A. Olivera H. Valenzuela L. González A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5594-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, global analysis of transcription suggests that GDH3 expression is influenced by the general nitrogen control system (13Cox K.H. Pinchack A.B. Cooper T.C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).S. cerevisiae is able to grow using a variety of carbon sources under fermentative and respiratory conditions. This fact has stimulated discussion as to which specific mechanism allows α-ketoglutarate utilization for glutamate biosynthesis without impairing the integrity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle as an energy-providing system. In this regard, it has been shown that Klebsiella aerogenes strains overexpressing their gdhA gene coding for the biosynthetic NADP-GDH display an auxotrophy that is interpreted as a limitation for α-ketoglutarate and succinyl-coenzyme A (14Janes B.K. Pomposiello P.J. Perez-Matos A. Najarian D.J. Goss T.J. Bender R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2709-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Accordingly, α-ketoglutarate modulates NADP-GDH activity so that fluctuations in the intracellular levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates would regulate glutamate biosynthesis. Indeed, it has been shown that the signal that coordinately regulates carbon and nitrogen metabolism in Escherichia coli depends on the intracellular levels of α-ketoglutarate and glutamine (15Ninfa A. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Reg. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of Gdh3p has been found to be increased during diauxic transition in S. cerevisiae (16Boy-Marcotte E. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a particular role of this enzyme in respiratory metabolism.To understand the function of the duplicated NADP-GDH pathway present in S. cerevisiae, we purified both isoenzymes and studied their biochemical properties. Our results revealed that Gdh1p and Gdh3p have different allosteric properties and rates of α-ketoglutarate utilization. The construction of chimerical plasmids harboring combinations of the GDH1 and GDH3 promoter and coding regions allowed us to determine that expression of these two genes is differentially modulated by the carbon source. Finally, physiological analysis of mutants lacking or overexpressing GDH1 or GDH3 showed that expression of both genes is required to achieve wild-type growth on ethanol. Our results indicate that existence of different NADP-GDH isoenzymes allows the functioning of a regulatory system in which the relative abundance of each isoform modulates the rate at which α-ketoglutarate is channeled to glutamate biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrainsTable I describes the characteristics of the strains used in the present work. All strains constructed for this study were LEU2 derivatives of CLA1 (ura3 leu2) and thus suited for URA3 selection. To obtain a gdh3Δ mutant, CLA1 was transformed with the BglII-linearized plasmid pLV6 (6Avendaño A. DeLuna A. Olivera H. Valenzuela L. González A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5594-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring a 760-bp GDH3 fragment and the yeast LEU2 gene, generating strain CLA12 (GDH1 gdh3Δ ura3). A gdh1Δ gdh3Δ ura3 mutant was obtained from CLA12, using the PCR-based gene replacement protocol described by Wach et al. (17Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar), with kanMX4 as a marker. Two deoxyoligonucleotides were designed based on the GDH1 nucleotide sequence and that of the multiple cloning site present in the pFA6a vector (17Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The deoxyoligonucleotide D1 (5′-CAG AAT TTC AAC AAG CTT ACG AAG AAG TTG TCT CCT CTT TGG AAGCGT ACG CTG CAG GTC GAC-3′) comprised 45 bp of the 5′ region of the GDH1 coding sequence (+11 to +55), and 18 bp (in boldface type) of the pFA6a multiple cloning site. The deoxyoligonucleotide D2 (5′-AAC ACC GAT ATC ACC AGC TGG CAC GTC AGT GTC TTG ACC AAT GTG ATC GAT GAA TTC GAG CTC G-3′) contained 45 bp corresponding to an internal GDH1 gene fragment (+451 to +495) and 19 bp (in boldface type) from the pFA6a multiple cloning site. Qiagen purified pFA6a DNA was used as template for PCR amplification in a Stratagene Robocycler 40 with the following program: one denaturing cycle for 3-min at 94 °C, followed by 26 cycles of 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 50 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C. The 522-bp PCR product obtained was gel-purified and used to transform strain CLA12, generating strain CLA14. A CLA1 LEU2 derivative was obtained by transforming this strain with plasmid YIp351, generating strain CLA11. To obtain a gdh1Δ GDH3 ura3 mutant, the CLA11 strain was transformed with the above mentioned 522-bp PCR product, thus generating CLA13.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this workStrainRelevant genotypeSourceCLA1MAT a GDH1 GDH3 ura3 leu2Ref. 6Avendaño A.

Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for either leucine prototrophy on minimal medium (MM), or G418 resistance (200 mg/liter) (Life Technologies, Inc.) on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD)-rich medium.Growth ConditionsStrains were routinely grown on MM containing salts, trace elements, and vitamins following the formula of yeast nitrogen base (Difco). Filter-sterilized glucose (2%, w/v) or ethanol (2%, w/v) was used as a carbon source, and 40 mm ammonium sulfate was used as a nitrogen source. Supplements needed to satisfy auxotrophic requirements were added at 0.1 mg/ml. Cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm).Construction of Low Copy Number and High Copy Number Plasmids Bearing GDH1 or GDH3 GenesAll standard molecular biology techniques were followed as previously described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-7.87Google Scholar). GDH1 or GDH3 were PCR-amplified together with their 5′ promoter sequence and cloned into either the pRS316 (CEN6 ARSH4 URA3) low copy number or pRS426 (2μ ori URA3) high copy number yeast shuttle vectors (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). For GDH1, the 2596-bp region between −952 from the start codon and +285 from the stop codon was considered to comprise the full GDH1 promoter and coding sequences (11Dang V.D. Bohn C. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For GDH3, a 2646-bp fragment was PCR-amplified, containing the putative regulatory region (−1213 from the start codon) plus the full coding sequence and +48 from the end codon, as reported in the nucleotide sequence of chromosome I from S. cerevisiae (22Bussey H. Kaback D.B. Zhong W. Vo D.T. Clark M.W. Fortin N. Hall J. Ouellette B.F. Keng T. Barton A.B. Su Y. Davies C.J. Storms R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Deoxyoligonucleotides used for this purpose were S1 (5′-CGC GGG ATC CAG TAG TTC AGC GAC AGA AG-3′), S2 (5′-CGC GCG GAT CCC GAG TAA GGT CAT CAA TAA G-3′), S3 (5′-CGC GGG ATC CTG CGG TTA TAT GAT CTT C-3′), and S4 (5′-CGC GCG GAT CCT ACT ACA TAC ACA GAT AG-3′), generating plasmids pLAM1 (GDH1 CEN URA3), pLAM11 (GDH12μ URA3), pLAM2 (GDH3 CEN URA3), and pLAM22 (GDH3 2μURA3). DNA sequencing was carried out, using the T3/T7 priming sites of pRS316 and pRS426, at the Unidad de Biologı́a Molecular, Instituto de Fisiologı́a Celular, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).Plasmids were subsequently transformed into CLA14 double mutant, and uracil prototrophs were selected, thus generating strains CLA14-1, CLA14-11, CLA14-2, and CLA14-22. Control strains harboring the 2μ pRS426 plasmid were constructed by transforming CLA11, CLA12, CLA13, and CLA14, generating strains CLA11-00, CLA12-00, CLA13-00, and CLA14-00, respectively.Construction of GDH1 and GDH3 Chimerical Fusion PlasmidsFusions containing either the GDH1 promoter and the GDH3 coding sequence or the GDH3 promoter and the GDH1 coding sequence were generated by overlapping PCR amplification. For this purpose, primers S1 and S5 (5′-CTC TGG TTC GCT TGT CAT TTC TTT TTC TTT TTG G-3′) were used to obtain a 980-bp product corresponding to the GDH1 5′ cognate sequence and the first 19 bp of the GDH3 coding sequence (in boldface type); this was overlapped with the 1431-bp product of primers S4 and S8 (5′-GAC AAG CGA ACC AGA GTT TC-3′), which included the complete GDH3 coding sequence. Similarly, primers S2 and S9 (5′-GAA ATT CTG GCT CTG ACA TTT TTA CTT TTT ACC-3′) were used to obtain a 1244-bp product corresponding to the GDH3 5′ cognate sequence, together with the first 17 bp of the GDH1coding sequence (in boldface type), and overlapped with the 1632-bp product of primers S3 and S10 (5′-GTC AGA GCC AGA ATT TCA AC-3′), which included the complete GDH1 coding sequence. The whole procedure led to the generation of the following plasmids: pLAM3 (5′GDH3-GDH1 CEN URA3), pLAM33 (5′GDH3-GDH1 2μ URA3), pLAM4 (5′GDH1-GDH3 CEN URA3), and pLAM44 (5′GDH1-GDH3 2μ URA3). Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing as described above.Plasmids were subsequently transformed into the CLA14 double mutant, and uracil prototrophs were selected, generating strains CLA14-3, CLA14-33, CLA14-4, and CLA14-44.NADP-GDH PurificationNADP-GDH activity was purified from ethanol-grown cultures of CLA 14-11 (gdh1Δ gdh3Δ/pLAM11 (GDH1 2μ URA3)), CLA 14-22 (gdh1Δ gdh3Δ/pLAM22 (GDH32μ URA3)), and the CLA4 wild-type strain. Strains were grown in 10 liters of MM supplemented with ethanol and ammonium sulfate, in a fermentor at the Unidad de Escalamiento, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, UNAM. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C and 300 rpm and aerated with 7 liters of oxygen/min. Cells were harvested at an optical density of 0.8–1.0 at 600 nm and stored at −70 °C until used. NADP-GDH was purified by a modified version of the method of Doherty (23Doherty D. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 850-856Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 5 °C.Step 1: Whole Cell Soluble Protein ExtractCells were thawed and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg of N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK)/ml)/g of cells. Crude extracts were obtained after mechanical disruption of cells with a Bead-Beater (8 cycles of 1 min). After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, protein extracts were resuspended in buffer A and diluted to ∼25 mg/ml.Step 2: Ammonium Sulfate FractionationProteins that precipitated between 40 and 65% saturation of ammonium sulfate were resuspended in buffer A. Mixtures were dialyzed twice against 4 liters of buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA).Step 3: DEAE Bio-Gel A ChromatographyDialyzed fractions were applied to a DEAE Bio-Gel A column (23 by 2.8 cm) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mg of TLCK/liter). After sample application, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer B. NADP-GDH was subsequently eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 10 column volumes (0–0.5 m). Fractions with NADP-GDH activity were pooled and dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer B.Step 4: Affinity ChromatographyA Reactive Red-agarose column (13 by 1.2 cm) was equilibrated with buffer A. After application of the sample from the previous step, the column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A. NADP-GDH was eluted with buffer A containing 0.1 mm NADPH. Fractions with NADP-GDH activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼1 mg/ml with an Amicon YM30 membrane, and stored at −70 °C until used.Enzyme Assay and Protein DeterminationWhole cell soluble protein extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis of cell pellets harvested during exponential growth, as described (24Cogoni C. Valenzuela L. González-Halphen D. Olivera H. Macino G. Ballario P. González A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 792-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADP-GDH and NAD-GDH were assayed by the method of Doherty (23Doherty D. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 850-856Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the oxidation of 1.0 μmol of NADPH or NADH/min. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Preparation of Anti-NADP-GDH AntibodiesAntibodies were raised in rabbits injected with purified yeast GDH1-encoded NADP-GDH and partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation according to the method of González-Halphen et al. (26González-Halphen D. Lindorfer M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and native PAGE were performed with 10 and 6% slab gels, respectively. Proteins on polyacrylamide gels were visualized with Coomassie Blue. Immunoblot analysis of SDS-electrophoresed crude extract or pure NADP-GDH was carried out as described by Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1979; 24: 145-149Google Scholar). Immunoblot signaling was optimized by analyzing a number of combinations of antigen and antibody concentrations in the linear range of detectability. Scanned blots were subjected to densitometric analysis using the program ImageQuaNT 4.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Data were normalized to the immunoblot signals of the corresponding purified protein.Molecular Mass DeterminationNative molecular mass was determined on a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (2.6 by 90 cm) equilibrated with 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The column was calibrated with molecular mass standards (29–700 kDa) from Sigma. Purified NADP-GDH was diluted in the same buffer, loaded into the column, and eluted at a rate of 6 ml/h. Molecular mass was determined from a plot of the log molecular mass against elution volume per void volume.The apparent molecular masses of denatured subunits were determined by SDS-PAGE with molecular mass standards (29–205 kDa) from Sigma.Amino-terminal SequencingThe isolation of polypeptides for amino-terminal sequencing was carried out as described previously (28Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. Vazquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. Gonzalez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Edman degradation was carried on an Applied Biosystems Sequencer at the Laboratoire de Microséquençage des Protéines (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France).Enzyme Kinetics and Analysis of Kinetic DataNADP-GDH activity was assayed for the reductive amination reaction at different concentrations of α-ketoglutarate, NADPH, or ammonium chloride and at saturating concentrations of the remaining substrates (8 mm α-ketoglutarate, 200 μmNADPH, and 50 mm ammonium chloride). For the oxidative deamination reaction, different concentrations of glutamate or NADP+ and saturating concentration of the remaining substrate (100 mm glutamate and 300 μmNADP+) were used. The progress of the reaction was always kept below 5% conversion of the initial substrate. Measurements were made at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris at pH 7.2 or 8.0 for the reductive amination or oxidative deamination reaction, respectively. For experiments in which pH was varied, 25 mm acetic acid, 25 mm MES, 50 mm Tris was used as buffer. This buffer minimizes the change of ionic strength with pH (29Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin 4.1 (MicroCal Software, Inc.).Extraction and Determination of Intracellular α-KetoglutarateProtein-free cell extracts were prepared as described by Kang et al. (30Kang L. Keeler M.L. Dunlop P.C. Roon R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of α-ketoglutarate relative to protein concentration was determined with beef glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma) by following NADH oxidation (31Dubois E. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Determination of Extracellular Glucose ConcentrationCells were filtered through 0.22-μm Millipore membranes. Extracellular glucose concentration was determined in the filtrate with the Glucose [HK] kit from Sigma.DISCUSSIONThis study addresses the question of whether GDH1 and GDH3 play overlapping or distinct roles and whether these roles are involved in the inherent capacity of S. cerevisiaeto grow under fermentative or respiratory conditions. The results presented in this paper indicate that the existence of different NADP-GDH isoforms results in glutamate biosynthesis and balanced α-ketoglutarate utilization. The main observations that support this assertion are the following: (a) NADP-GDHs showed differences in their allosteric properties and rates of α-ketoglutarate utilization; (b) the relative abundance of both isoenzymes depended on the nature of the carbon source; (c) a gdh3Δ mutant grew slowly on ethanol, although it had wild-type NADP-GDH activity levels (this mutant showed reduced α-ketoglutarate pools and high activity levels of the catabolic NAD-GDH, indicating an abnormal high glutamate production rate); and (d) GDH1 overexpression from a plasmid did not suppress slow growth or the reduced α-ketoglutarate pool phenotypes of a gdh1Δ gdh3Δ strain; in contrast, overexpression of GDH3 resulted in faster growth and α-ketoglutarate accumulation.It has been recently shown that the regulated expression of yeast tricarboxylic acid cycle genes is governed by two transcriptional complexes that function alternatively, depending on the integrity of the respiratory function (44Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The HAP system regulates the expression of genes that lead to the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate during respiratory metabolism (12Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas expression of these genes is controlled by the RTG system when respiratory function is dampened or lost. This model considers that glutamate plays a central role by repressing RTG-dependent expression of genes leading to α-ketoglutarate (44Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), thus indicating that NADP-GDH activity should be controlled accordingly. A yeast NADP-GDH activity was previously purified (32Camardella L. Di Prisco G. Garofano F. Guerrini A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) at a time when the existence of two isoenzymes was not yet recognized; thus, the kinetic properties and regulation of each isoenzyme could not possibly be discerned. In this study, purification and independent characterization of Gdh1p and Gdh3p enzymes shows that yeast possesses NADP-GDH isoforms that differ in their biochemical properties.Even after the two NADP-GDHs were recognized, induction of GDH3 could not be observed in genome-wide transcription analysis of ethanol-grown yeast, probably because of detectability limitations (45Shamji A. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 46Kuruvilla F.G. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7283-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The results presented here differ from those mentioned above and show unequivocally that GDH3 expression is ethanol-induced and glucose-repressed and that GDH1expression is high on both carbon sources. This brings into accountability the role of the different NADP-GDH isoenzymes in either glucose or ethanol-grown cells. Our results also consider the allosteric regulation of the GDH3-encoded enzyme, which suggests particular regulatory properties for this activity in vivo. This would mediate a more relaxed distribution of α-ketoglutarate to either glutamate biosynthesis or energy-yielding metabolism when cells grow on a nonfermentable or limiting carbon source. During fermentative growth, glutamate biosynthesis would be afforded by the Gdh1p isoenzyme that uses α-ketoglutarate at a faster rate. Accordingly, the existence of multiple isoforms of NADP-GDH activity would provide the pacemaker mechanism that assures optimum glutamate biosynthesis in either fermentative or respiratory conditions without compromising the energy-yielding metabolism. Within this context, it is relevant that the nonfacultative yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, closely related to S. cerevisiae, bears a single homomeric NADP-GDH enzyme (47Romero M. Guzmán-León S. Aranda C. González-Halphen D. Valenzuela L. González A. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).It has been recognized that the expression of the NAD-GDH catabolic enzyme is induced in the presence of ethanol (43Coschigano P.W. Miller S.M. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of this observation has remained obscure, since gdh2Δ mutants show no evident phenotype in ethanol-grown cultures. Considering the results presented in this paper, it can be suggested that the coordinated action of GDH1-, GDH3-, and GDH2-encoded enzymes allows growth on ethanol, equilibrating the production and utilization of α-ke"

Their functions range from the propagation of the action potential and the control of excitability to transepithelial transport and the homeostasis of cell volume. There are many varieties of K+ channels distinguishable by their functional properties and pharmacological sensitivities. From the molecular point of view, three major families have been distinguished (1North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 234-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar): voltage-gated KV channels, Kir inward rectifiers and SKCa/IKCaCa2+-dependent K+ channels. These previously described K+ channels have only one pore domain (P) and form tetramers with each monomer contributing one P domain to the selectivity filter. A novel family of K+ channels which, exceptionally, have two P regions in tandem and four putative transmembrane helices (2P-4TM1) has recently emerged, with 13 mammalian homologues described at the time of this writing. In heterologous systems they give rise to K+-selective conductances open at all voltages and, generally, showing little rectification besides that expected from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) prediction (2Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). A diagnostic feature of these channels is their insensitivity (or low sensitivity) to a range of conventional K+ channel blockers, including various toxins, Ba2+, tetraethylammonium, and 4-aminopyridine. 2P-4TM channels are thought to underlie the leak or background conductances. These conductances maintain the passive properties of the cell. They have also been implicated in the regulation of excitability by neurotransmitters, second messengers, O2, or volatile anesthetics. The discovery of the 2P-4TM channel family provides molecular counterparts for these relatively ill-understood conductances and allows the study of their modulation (1North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 234-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J.

The best studied is TASK-1 (KCNK3), which is thought to be the background K+ conductance closed by neurotransmitters to enhance excitability in the central nervous system (4Millar J.A. Barratt L.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). An increase in cell volume is followed in most cells by regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mediated by efflux of K+, Cl−, organic osmolytes and osmotically obliged water leading to volume recovery. The pathway through which K+exits Ehrlich cells during RVD is not known at the molecular level but has been characterized recently through electrophysiology and flux measurements (6Riquelme G.

This current (IK, vol) is independent of intracellular Ca2+, has a current-voltage relation that obeys the GHK formalism, suggesting the channels involved lack intrinsic voltage dependence, and is selective to K+and Rb+, with PK > PRb.IK, vol is rather insensitive to a number of conventional K+ channel inhibitors but is efficiently blocked by the quaternary ammonium derivative clofilium.IK, vol in Ehrlich cells is markedly dependent upon extracellular pH, being strongly inhibited at pH 6.4 and enhanced at pH 8.4, compared with the control at pH 7.4. The properties of IK, vol in Ehrlich cells, particularly the lack of voltage dependence and insensitivity to many conventional blockers, is reminiscent of the characteristics of the 2P-4TM K+ channels. In addition, its strong dependence on extracellular pH approaches them to a group within the 2P-4TM family that can be distinguished by their sensitivity to extracellular pH. These have been termed TASK, for TWIK (Tandem of P domains in Weak Inward rectifier K+ channels)-related acid-sensitive K+ channels, and more recently TALK, for alkali-activated K+ channels. 2An alternative naming plan, i.e. the KCNK nomenclature, has been proposed in which the allusion to a possible functional description that might not yet be firmly established is avoided (3Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In this, TASK-1, -2, and 3 become KCNK-3, -5, and -9, respectively. 2An alternative naming plan, i.e. the KCNK nomenclature, has been proposed in which the allusion to a possible functional description that might not yet be firmly established is avoided (3Goldstein S.A.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether a member of the TASK group of the 2P-4TM channel family could be responsible for K+ efflux during RVD. It is demonstrated here that, of the three murine TASK K+channels known this far, only mTASK-2 transcript is present in Ehrlich cells. mTASK-2, studied by heterologous expression in HEK-293 cells, is shown to share pharmacological blockade and ion selectivity with the native conductance activated by osmotic swelling of Ehrlich cells. Importantly, osmotic cell swelling can enhance the activity of TASK-2 whereas shrinkage decreases its activity. We therefore propose it to be the molecular counterpart of IK, vol. Total RNA was prepared from adult mouse tissue immediately after euthanasia by cervical dislocation or from Ehrlich cells grown and collected as described before (7Niemeyer M.I. Hougaard C. Hoffmann E.K. Jørgensen F. Stutzin A. Sepúlveda F.V. J. Physiol. (London). 2000; 524: 757-767Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was synthesized from 2–3 μg of RNA using SuperScript (Life Technologies, Inc.), oligo(dT), and random primers in the presence of RNase inhibitors (RNasin, Promega). All animal manipulations were approved by the local ethics committee. The PCR amplification procedures were carried out as described before (13Cid L.P. Niemeyer M.I. Ramı́rez A. Sepúlveda F.V. Am.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar) the primers used were: sense 5′-CGTCGTGCTGCGCCTCAA-3′ and antisense 5′-AGCCTGGCCGTTGTGCGT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides coding for Arg44-Ala50 and Arg245-Ala251 in the Mus musculus TBAK-1 (GenBankTM accession numberAB008537). The expected product is 624 bp long. Conditions were: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 58° for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. mTASK-3 primers, based on the rat homologue (15Kim Y.

They correspond to peptide segments Met35-Leu41and Thr121-Ser127 of rTASK-3 (GenBankTM access number AF192366). The expected product is 338 bp long. PCR conditions were as for mTASK-1. For mTASK-2, the amino acid sequence for (human) hTASK-2 (16Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

ESTs AW31846 and AW31955 were used to design primers 5′-AGTGATTAGTGAACCCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAGTGGCTTCCTCTCACG-3′, which should correspond to 5′- and 3′-untranslated segments. The expected size of the amplicon is around 1623 bp. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 5 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 68 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, 25 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 54 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis were excised and extracted for DNA, which was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). Sequencing was performed automatically. For Northern analysis, total RNA was run in a denaturing agarose gel. After transferring to a nylon membrane, it was probed with digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobe (50 ng ml−1) synthesized by in vitro transcription using mTASK-2 cDNA as a template. Hybridization was conducted at 68 °C. Detection was with an anti- digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), which was used for colorimetric visualization. Western blot was done with crude membrane fractions (17Gallardo P. Cid L.P. Vio C.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G856-G863PubMed Google Scholar).

Homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were spun down at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done using Laemmli buffers on 10% polyacrylamide minigels. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to reveal antigen-antibody reaction. The anti-TASK-2 antibody (APC-07, Alomone Laboratories, Israel) was used at 1:200 dilution. Preadsorption was done by preincubating the antibody with the antigen peptide for 1 h at a 1/1 μg ratio. The mTASK-2 plasmid used in the electrophysiology studies was subcloned in the expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HEK-293 cells as described previously (13Cid L.P. Niemeyer M.I. Ramı́rez A. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1198-C1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD8 cotransfection was used to identify effectively transfected cells. The CD8 antigen was revealed with microspheres (Dynabeads) coated with an anti-CD8 antigen. In cation selectivity studies, the bath solution contained 135 mm XCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm sucrose, 10 mm, Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4.X stands for either Rb, Cs, Li, Na, K, or NH4, as indicated. The pipette solution contained 140 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Alternatively, in experiments at low Cl− concentration this anion was replaced by gluconate to give a final Cl− concentration of 10 mmsolution either in the pipette or bath. In experiments to measure the pH dependence of the currents HEPES (used for pH 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0) in the bathing medium was replaced with CAPS (pH 10 and 11), Tris (pH 8.5 and 9), or MES (pH 6.0). Standard whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed as described elsewhere (13Cid L.P. Niemeyer M.I. Ramı́rez A. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1198-C1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dı́az M. Sepúlveda F.V. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 430: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). When necessary, calculated correction for changes in junction potential were made (19Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Meth. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Changes in cell water volume were assessed in single cells by measuring changes in concentration of an intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye (20Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) exactly as described previously (21Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293 transfected with mTASK-2 cDNA were plated on 25-mm No. 1 round coverslips, loaded with calcein-AM (5 μm, for 5 min) and then superfused with iso-osmotic solution for 30 min before starting the experiment. The experiments were performed using a confocal laser imaging system (LSM5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Excitation light was 488 nm, and emitted light was measured at wavelengths longer than 515 nm. Pictures were obtained at 30-s intervals, and fluorescence of a selected area inside the cell was measured. Under the conditions of the experiment there was no apparent dye photobleaching. The data are presented asF0/Ft, whereF0 = fluorescence in iso-osmotic solution, att = 0, and Ft = fluorescence at time = t. The ratioF0/Ft is proportional to cell volume. Transfected cells were identified by the presence of microbeads as described above. The possible presence of TASK transcripts in Ehrlich cells was assayed in RT-PCR experiments. In Fig. 1 Aspecific primers for mTASK-1 were used. When using RNA from mouse heart as a positive control, a product of a size compatible with the 624 nucleotides of the expected amplicon was seen in the electrophoresis run. However, there was no detectable amplification of mTASK-1 using RNA from Ehrlich cells or from mouse liver, a negative control known to lack mTASK-1 mRNA (2Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Lopes C.M.

A similar result was obtained for mTASK-3, as seen in Fig. 1 B. There was clear amplification of a product of a size compatible with the expected 338 nucleotides amplicon in brain, the site of most abundance of this transcript (15Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol.

To search for the presence of mTASK-2 in Ehrlich cells and mouse kidney by RT-PCR, the protein sequence for (human) hTASK-2 (16Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) was used to search for murine expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two ESTs (AW31846 and AW31955) were identified that contained putative start and stop codons for an mTASK-2 (mouse). Primers were designed to flank these, and RT-PCR with mouse kidney and Ehrlich cell RNA gave products of around 1600 nucleotides as shown in Fig. 1 C, suggesting that mTASK-2 was present in Ehrlich cells. This was confirmed by the Northern blot shown in Fig.1 D that revealed a ∼3.3-kb transcript. The amplicons were subcloned and sequenced confirming the presence of an open reading frame that on translation gave a 502-amino acid sequence containing the two P regions in tandem as well as four putative trans-membrane helices. This predicted polypeptide was 88.8% homologous to hTASK-2. The mTASK-2 sequence information has been deposited in the GenBankTM under accession number AF319542. These data suggest that Ehrlich cells express TASK-2 but not TASK-1 or -3. 3Western analysis with anti-hTASK-1 antibody has suggested the presence of this protein in mouse Ehrlich cells (10Hougaard C. Jørgensen F. Hoffmann E.K. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 622-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We do not understand the origin of this discrepancy with the present data, but as discussed below, the cation selectivity and lack of voltage dependence of the pH effect on IK, vol separate the channel in Ehrlich cells from TASK-1. mTASK-2 expression was also checked by Western blot of membranes from Ehrlich cells, as shown in Fig. 1 E. The analysis revealed a major band of about 70 kDa (lane 1). This, as well as other minor bands, could be abolished by previous incubation of the antibody with the antigenic peptide (lane 2). The mass of mTASK-2 simply derived from the predicted amino acid sequence is 55 kDa. Glycosylation, for which a consensus site is present, could account for this discrepancy. No K+ currents were seen in mock- or untransfected HEK-293 cells (not shown). After transfection with mTASK-2 cDNA, sizeable currents occurred that had voltage and pH dependence characteristics identical to those reported for the human orthologue (16Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These currents showed GHK behavior at all pH values tested (not shown). The selectivity of mTASK-2 was analyzed by cation replacement. Fig. 2 shows currents evoked by the pulse protocol in Fig. 2 A. The pipette solution was high in K+ (140 mm), and the external solution contained 140 (Fig. 2 E) or 5 mm K+and 135 mm of either Na+, Rb+, or Cs+ (Fig. 2, B–D). In Na+-rich medium, instant rectification and a moderate activation/deactivation were observed. With K+-rich medium the currents appeared Ohmic with decreased time dependence. In Cs+ the rectification was more marked, and there was little evidence of time dependence. In Rb+-rich medium, on the other hand, the instantaneous current was large at all potentials and relaxed slightly to a lower absolute value toward the end of the pulse at negative potentials. The current-voltage relations for these experiments as measured at the end of the pulse are shown in Fig. 2 (F andG). In symmetrical K+ solutions, it was linear with a reversal potential at 0 mV. Replacement of all but 5 mm K+ by Na+ shiftedErev to more negative than −70 mV. The current-voltage relation was described by the GHK formalism albeit with a lower PK value than for symmetrical K+ condition (2.4 × 10−11 and 2.8 × 10−11 cm3 s−1, respectively). In low K+ solution and at very depolarized voltages, the fit deviated from the experimental points, which are lower than expected. Fig.2 G compares the current-voltage relations measured in Rb+-, Cs+-, and Li+-rich solutions. The curve in the Li+-replaced solution was indistinguishable from that in Na+. In Cs+, although the reversal was as in Na+, current was depressed in the entire voltage range examined. The reversal in Rb+-rich solution was shifted in the depolarizing direction compared with that in Na+. The permeability ratios for different cations were calculated from the shifts in reversal potential. They are given in Fig. 2 H and compared with those reported for mTASK-1 (KCNK3) (23Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The main difference between TASK-1 and -2 is that the former presents aPRb > PK permeability sequence. Clofilium is an inhibitor ofIK, vol in Ehrlich cells (7Niemeyer M.I. Hougaard C. Hoffmann E.K. Jørgensen F. Stutzin A. Sepúlveda F.V. J. Physiol. (London). 2000; 524: 757-767Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The effect of this compound on mTASK-2 currents is shown in Fig. 3. In theinset to the graph in Fig. 3 A it is seen that 30 μm clofilium inhibited mTASK-2 current evoked by an 80-mV pulse without affecting the kinetics of its development. Current-voltage relations are shown under control conditions (squares) and after superfusing the cells with 20 and 50 μm clofilium. There was a graded inhibition of the current at all potentials explored without affecting the reversal potential. In Fig. 3 B a summary of results for clofilium inhibition of mTASK-2 mediated currents is shown. The measurements were taken at 0 mV (ECl) and are expressed as percent inhibition caused by the drug. The result obtained in mTASK-2 assays (circles) is compared with that obtained previously forIK, vol (7Niemeyer M.I. Hougaard C. Hoffmann E.K. Jørgensen F. Stutzin A. Sepúlveda F.V. J. Physiol. (London). 2000; 524: 757-767Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The solid linerepresents the best fit to the Hill equation to the mTASK-2 data with an IC50 of 25 μm andnH of 2. The data presented above make TASK-2 a likely candidate to be the molecular counterpart of IK, vol. The sensitivity of mTASK-2 current to changes in tonicity was, therefore, tested. Swelling untransfected HEK-293 cells, by exposure to hypotonic solution, resulted in the activation of Cl−current of a type present in other cells (25Dı́az M. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. Rucareanu C. Sepúlveda F.V. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 422: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Valverde M.A. Hardy S.P. Sepúlveda F.V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but no K+ current developed (not shown). In mTASK-2-expressing cells, hypotonic exposure elicited an increase in K+current as measured at ECl (upper trace in Fig. 4 A). As expected, this was accompanied by activation of a small Cl− current measured at EK (lower panel in Fig. 4 A). The current-voltage relations measured in isotonicity under physiological (open circles) or symmetrical (triangles) K+ concentrations (Fig.4 B) showed the expected rectification properties and reversal potentials. The current-voltage relationship measured in physiological K+ concentration under hypotonicity is shown in Fig. 4 C. There was a general increase in current magnitude and a shift in Erev fromEK to a more depolarized value, consistent with concomitant activation of a Cl− conductance. The current at ECl retained pH sensitivity as shown by theblack triangle (pH 8.5) and circle (pH 6.0). In symmetrical K+, Erev changed to 0 mV as expected. As seen in Fig. 4 A, the effect of cell swelling was slowly reversible upon return to isotonicity. Notice the slower recovery time for K+ current, which has been seen before for the native currents (8Hougaard C. Niemeyer M.I. Hoffmann E.K. Sepúlveda F.V. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 283-294PubMed Google Scholar). Cells shrunk in hypertonic medium showed a significant reduction in mTASK2-mediated current. Fig.5 A shows an experiment where a cell was superfused with a solution made 100 mosmhypertonic, through the addition of mannitol without change in ion composition. Hypertonic exposure led to a rapid decrease in mTASK-2-mediated current. This decrease was reversible and was not accompanied by alterations in the current at EK. Fig. 5 B shows current-voltage plots taken before (circles) or after (downward triangles) shrinking the cell by changing the tonicity of the extracellular fluid from 300 to 400 mosm. The current depressed by this maneuver had the same reversal potential, and the effect was similar in the entire voltage range as shown by experiments with symmetrical K+(not shown). Fig. 6 A shows a summary of experiments demonstrating the osmosensitivity of mTASK-2. The average relative changes in mTASK-2 K+ current at 0 mV (ECl) are shown. Statistically significant increases or decreases in current were seen in hypo- and hypertonicity, respectively. The increase in current in hypotonicity occurred with a small but significant change in pH sensitivity. As shown in Fig.6 B the pH dependence of K+ current at 0 mV could be described by a Hill equation with pK a of 8.30 ± 0.07 and nH of 0.81 ± 0.08 (n = 13). In hypotonicity the respective values were 7.99 ± 0.07 and 0.81 ± 0.07 (n = 8), with pK a being significantly reduced with respect to the control (p = 0.0077). This small shift in pK a only accounts for ∼60% of the hypotonicity effect. The pH dependence of the current in hypertonicity was not altered significantly, with a pK a andnH values of 8.24 ± 0.13 and 0.87 ± 0.05 (n = 4), respectively. The effect of mTASK-2 expression on the ability of cells to undergo regulatory volume decrease was tested. As in previous experiments, co-expression of the CD-8 antigen revealed with an antibody conjugated to microbeads was used to identify transfected cells. Fig.7 A shows a group of such HEK-293 cells loaded with calcein to measure changes in their volume (20Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E.

To determine the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in this pathway, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to ouabain and assayed for translocation/activation of PKC from cytosolic to particulate fractions. Ouabain caused rapid and sustained stimulation of this translocation, evidenced by the assay of Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent PKC activities and by the immunoblot analysis of the α, δ, and ε isoforms of PKC. Dose-dependent stimulation of PKC translocation by ouabain (1–100 μm) was accompanied by no more than 50% inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase and doubling of [Ca2+]i, changes that do not affect myocyte viability and are known to be associated with positive inotropic, but not toxic, effects of ouabain in rat cardiac ventricles. Ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 was blocked by PKC inhibitors calphostin C and chelerythrine. An inhibitor of phosphoinositide turnover in myocytes also antagonized ouabain-induced PKC translocation and ERK1/2 activation. These and previous findings indicate that ouabain-induced activation of PKC and Ras, each linked to Na+/K+-ATPase through Src/EGFR, are both required for the activation of ERK1/2. Ouabain-induced PKC translocation and ERK1/2 activation were dependent on the presence of Ca2+ in the medium, suggesting that the signal-transducing and ion-pumping functions of Na+/K+-ATPase cooperate in activation of these protein kinases and the resulting regulation of contractility and growth of the cardiac myocyte.

Although we have demonstrated the ouabain-induced activation of these pathways in several cell types (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol.

In these cells, where the well established inhibitory effects of nontoxic ouabain concentrations on the ion-pumping function of Na+/K+-ATPase lead to small increases in [Na+]i and significant increases in [Ca2+]i, this rise in [Ca2+]i cooperates with the Ca2+-independent activation of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species to regulate the transcription of growth-related genes and cause myocyte hypertrophy (9Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A question raised in the course of these studies on cardiac myocytes was on the possible role of PKC in the proximal pathways that are activated by ouabain. Our early experiments showed that inhibition of PKC blocked the ouabain-induced regulation of several growth-related genes (3Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol.

Cardiol. 1997; 29: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since PKC inhibition also seemed to antagonize the rapid ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we suggested that at least one locus of PKC involvement must be upstream of ERK1/2 (6Kometiani P.

This, coupled with the fact that direct activation of PKC by PMA causes activation of ERK1/2 in myocytes (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar,10Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), led to the postulate that ouabain may indeed cause the rapid activation of PKC in cardiac myocytes. The present studies were initiated to test this hypothesis and to explore the mechanisms of any ouabain-induced PKC activation and its linkage to activation of ERK1/2. Chemicals of highest purity and culture media were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against PKCα (H-7), PKCε (C-15), PKCδ (C-17), ERK1/2 (K-23), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Calphostin C and chelerythrine were purchased from Calbiochem, D609 from Sigma, phosphatidylserine and dioleyl-sn-glycerol from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), Epep from Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA), and fura-2 and fura-2/AM from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The same protocols were used to prepare and culture neonatal ventricular myocytes as described before (3Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In short, myocytes from 1-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and purified on Percoll gradients. In a medium containing four parts of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and one part Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum, myocytes were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. After 24 h, the myocytes were serum-starved for 48 h, at which time all experiments were performed. Some of the experiments were done in a nominally Ca2+-free medium, which was prepared to contain the same components as Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium except that calcium salts were omitted and 0.1 mm EGTA was added to the medium. As we previously reported, incubation of cardiac myocytes in this medium had no significant effect on cell viability for the experimental durations used here (3Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining with a myosin heavy chain antibody showed that the cultures contained more than 95% myocytes. Myocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline; suspended in a solution containing 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjen homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed (the cytosolic fraction), and the pellet was suspended in the above described solution to which Triton X-100 (1%) was also added. After 30 min on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 25,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was collected (the particulate fraction). PKC activities were determined by slight modifications of previously described procedures (13Thomas P.T. Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B.

The reaction mixtures contained 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.75 mmCaCl2, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, either 100 μg/ml histone or 50 μg/ml Epep, with or without 30 μmphosphatidylserine, and 0.5 μmdioleyl-sn-glycerol. After incubation at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by spotting aliquots on phosphocellulose paper (P81) and washing each paper three times with 25 ml of 0.75% phosphoric acid. The collected 32P-labeled substrate was counted by conventional procedures. Reaction time and enzyme concentrations were chosen to ensure the assay of initial velocities. To assay the translocation of the various PKC isoforms, the cytosolic and the particulate fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis, using the indicated isoform-specific antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies, as described before (15Rouet-Benzineb P.

Quantitation of the relative intensities of the immunoblots were done using chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film. Images were scanned with a Bio-Rad densitometer. When necessary, different dilutions of the samples were subjected to immunoblotting, and multiple exposures of the films were used to ensure that quantitative comparisons were made within the linear range of the assay. After the indicated treatments, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in an ice-cold solution containing 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Equal amounts of protein from various lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis as described before (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) using antibodies that detect only phosphorylated/active ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2. Activation was measured as the ratio of the intensities of the appropriate bands detected with the two antibodies. We have shown before that ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 by this procedure correlates with in-gel assay of ERK1/2 activities (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The initial rate of ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake through the Na+/K+-ATPase of intact myocytes was measured as described before (17Kometiani P. Askari A. Liu J. Xie Z. Askari F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1415-H1421Google Scholar), using monensin in the assay medium to ensure that the maximal capacity of the active uptake was being measured (18Stemmer P. Akera T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were incubated in the culture medium at 37 °C for 10 min with different concentrations of ouabain, including the maximally effective 1 mm ouabain; 25 μmmonensin and 86Rb+ as tracer for K+were then added, and uptake was measured after 20 min. It was established that uptake was a linear function of time within this period. This was done using fura-2, by the procedures and calibrations described before (7Xie Z. Kometiani P. Liu J. Li J. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19323-19328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 17Kometiani P. Askari A. Liu J. Xie Z. Askari F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1415-H1421Google Scholar). Briefly, fura-2 fluorescence was recorded using an Attofluor imaging system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) at excitation wavelengths of 340/380 nm and at an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Under each experimental condition, time-averaged signals were obtained from about 20–40 single cells. [Ca2+]i was calculated based on the fluorescence ratio and the Ca2+ calibration curve (7Xie Z.

Student’s ttest was used, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Stimulus-induced activation of PKC involves the translocation of the enzyme from the soluble to the particulate fractions of cells (19Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 20Henrich C.J. Simpson P.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1988; 20: 1081-1085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In experiments of Fig. 1, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to 100 μm ouabain for 10 min or 100 nm PMA for 5 min as positive control and were assayed for PKC activities in particulate and cytosolic fractions. In each fraction Ca2+-stimulated PKC activity (histone kinase) and Ca2+-independent PKC activity (Epep kinase) were assayed (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, in control unstimulated cells, a small fraction of either histone kinase or Epep kinase was in the particulate fraction (see legend to Fig. 1), and upon PMA stimulation the greater portion of each activity was shifted from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction (Fig. 1). Ouabain also caused significant increases in the particulate fraction activities of histone kinase (Fig. 1 A) and Epep kinase (Fig. 1 B); however, these ouabain-induced increases were less than those induced by PMA. The concomitant ouabain-induced decreases in cytosolic activities, which were expected to be small, were not statistically significant (Fig. 1). To determine the effects of ouabain on individual PKC isoforms, we focused on α, ε, and δ isoforms whose translocation from the cytosolic to particulate fractions has been shown to be affected by a number of other stimuli in the neonatal rat cardiac myocytes used here (21Pucéat M.

Exposure of myocytes to 100 μm ouabain for 10 min increased the amount of each isoform, assayed with isoform-specific antibodies, in the particulate fraction (Fig. 2). In the cytosolic fraction, significant ouabain-induced decreases in the levels of immunoreactive ε and δ isoforms, but not in that of α isoform, were also detected (Fig. 2). When the time course of the effects of 100 μm ouabain on the translocation of the three isoforms to the particulate fraction were examined, maximal increases were noted as early as 1 min after exposure to ouabain, and the increases were sustained for at least 20 min (Fig. 3).Figure 3Time course of the ouabain-induced increase in immunoreactive PKC isoforms in the particulate fraction.Myocytes were exposed to 100 μm ouabain, and the assays were done as in Fig. 2. n ≥ 3; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of the experiments of Fig. 4A on the dose dependence of the ouabain-induced translocation of PKCα to the particulate fraction showed the effectiveness of ouabain concentrations as low as 1 μm. To allow the direct comparison of these effects with dose-dependent ouabain effects on the ion transport function of the Na+/K+-ATPase of these myocytes, the effects of selected ouabain concentrations on active Rb+ uptake and on [Ca2+]i of the intact myocytes were also determined (Fig. 4, B and C). The highest concentration of ouabain used in experiments on PKC (100 μm) caused about 50% inhibition of the maximal pumping capacity of Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 4 B) and about doubling of the [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4 C). Clearly, ouabain-induced PKC activation/translocation is obtained in the absence of toxic Ca2+ overload. This is in agreement with our previous data (3Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) showing no significant change in the viability of these myocytes after 12 h of exposure to 100 μm ouabain. Because activations of polypeptide growth factor receptors such as EGFR are known to stimulate phosphoinositide turnover by activation of PLC-γ (26Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) and since ouabain transactivates EGFR in the myocytes used here (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to suspect that the above ouabain-induced activation of PKC might be due to stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover. In fact, ouabain-induced increases in inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol in several cell types, including cardiac preparations, have been noted before (27Gusovsky F. Hollingsworth E.B. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Ho A.K. Ceña V. Klein D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kamiyama A. Shibayama R. Sawada M. Kashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), albeit at ouabain concentrations that are expected to be toxic to cardiac myocytes. To determine whether the ouabain-induced activation/translocation of PKC noted here was indeed linked to stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, we used a PLC inhibitor, D609. Although this compound is a more selective inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC in several cell types (31Muller-Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), it has been shown to inhibit phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC in the intact neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (24Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33Sadoshima J. Izumo S.

Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of myocytes with D609 blocked ouabain-induced translocation of PKCα and PKCε to the particulate fraction (Fig. 5), but it had no significant effect on PMA-induced translocation of the two isoforms (Fig. 6). This and the fact that D609 also had no effect on PMA-induced activation of histone kinase and Epep kinase (data not shown) ruled out the possibility that D609 might have a direct inhibitory effect on PKC. Taken together, the above data support the proposition that ouabain-induced activation/translocation of PKC is the consequence of PLC activation linked to the ouabain-induced transactivation of EGFR.Figure 6Lack of effect of D609 on PMA-induced translocation of the PKC isoforms. Experiments were done with 100 nm PMA as indicated in Fig. 5. n ≥ 3; *,p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We showed before (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that a rather nonspecific PKC inhibitor, H-7, antagonized ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2. This was confirmed with the use of more specific PKC inhibitors chelerythrine and calphostin C (Fig. 7). D609 also blocked ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7), indicating that sequential activations of PLC and PKC are required for ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2. In previous studies, we showed that ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 also required the presence of extracellular Ca2+(6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The question arose as to whether this dependence on extracellular Ca2+ was exerted upstream or downstream of PKC activation. In myocytes that were incubated in a nominally Ca2+-free medium, exposure to ouabain did not activate PKC in contrast to the activation noted in the Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 8). Evidently, the well established ouabain-induced net influx of Ca2+ that leads to a rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4) is required for ouabain-induced activations of PKC and ERK1/2. A main new finding reported here is that ouabain interaction with intact cardiac myocytes leads to rapid translocation/activation of several PKC isoforms from the soluble to the particulate pools of these enzymes (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Before we discuss the implications of these and related findings, it is important to emphasize that the data presented here (Fig. 4), in conjunction with previous findings, clearly indicate that the activating effect of ouabain on PKC is obtained at ouabain concentrations that cause only partial inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 4 B), small changes in [Na+]i (9Liu J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and significant but nontoxic increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4 B; Refs. 3Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 9Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol.

Such degrees of change in Na+/K+-ATPase and intracellular cation concentrations are indeed the requirements for obtaining the positive inotropic effects of ouabain and related digitalis drugs (9Liu J.

In fact, it has been shown (35Schwartz A. Grupp G. Wallick E. Grupp I.L. Ball Jr., W.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268B: 321-338PubMed Google Scholar, 37Grupp G. DePover A. Grupp I.L. Schwartz A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1984; 175: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that the major portion of the positive inotropic action of ouabain on rat ventricular strips is obtained at ouabain concentrations (10–100 μm) comparable with those used in the present studies. Thus, although ouabain effect on the contractile strength of the cultured myocytes was not measured here, 2The low density, serum-starved myocyte cultures used here consist of predominantly quiescent cells (i.e.most cells do not contract spontaneously, and some contract at a low rate). As indicated before (9Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), the easily noted ouabain effects in these cultures are increases in the number of contracting cells and the rate of contractions. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to quantitate the effect of ouabain on the contractile force (cell shortening) or Ca2+ transients. We have shown elsewhere (42Tian J. Gong X. Xie Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1899-H1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, that in electrically paced cultured myocytes, ouabain increases systolic [Ca2+]i, diastolic [Ca2+]i, and the time-averaged [Ca2+]i, as expected. it is reasonable to conclude that the present findings suggest that ouabain-induced PKC activation must accompany the classical effect of ouabain on cardiac contractility, at least in the rat. The present findings provide strong support for the previous suggestion (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that ouabain-induced PKC activation precedes the activation of ERK1/2. To date, the most proximal signaling events that have been identified to be linked to Na+/K+-ATPase are the activation of Src and the transactivation of EGFR (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Evidently, these events lead not only to the activation of Ras (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) but also to the parallel activation of PLC, stimulation of the phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of PKC (Fig. 5). That this PKC activation is essential for ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7) must now be reconciled with our previous data showing that activation of Ras is also essential for ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A reasonable hypothesis is that Ras and PKC must cooperate to activate Raf. This is supported by observations in cells other than cardiac myocytes (38Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 39Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), indicating that Raf recruitment to the plasma membrane requires activated Ras but that activation of the recruited Raf requires additional steps that include phosphorylation of Raf, possibly by PKC. Based on the present data and our previous findings, the status of the signal pathway that links Na+/K+-ATPase to ERK1/2 through PKC and Ras is summarized in Fig. 9. It is important to point out, however, that the steps outlined in Fig. 9 may not be the only links between Na+/K+-ATPase and PKC. In view of the recent evidence suggesting the interaction of Src with RACK·PKC complexes (40Chang B.Y. Chiang M. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20346-20356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), it is possible that ouabain-induced activated Src may also be involved in directing the activated PKC isoforms to their substrates, including Na+/K+-ATPase itself (see below). We showed before (9Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) that activation by ouabain of Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, and Ras-dependent increase in mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species were independent of the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and ouabain-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. We also showed, however, that ouabain-induced activation of ERK1/2 required the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This effect of Ca2+ is now shown to be, at least in part, due to the dependence of ouabain-induced PKC activation on extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 8), which is the source of the ouabain-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. Although the precise mechanism of this Ca2+ effect (perhaps on PLC) remains to be determined, the present findings reinforce the conclusion that there is cross-talk between the ion-pumping function and the signal-transducing function of Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 9). If translocation/activation of some PKC isoforms does indeed accompany the positive inotropic action and the therapeutic use of digitalis, as suggested by the present findings, several further implications are worthy of brief consideration. 1) In view of the above discussed necessity of ouabain-induced increase in [Ca2+]i for the rapid and sequential activations of PKC and ERK1/2, the question arises as whether the activation of these protein kinases may in turn influence the ouabain-induced change in [Ca2+]i. Evidently, the answer is yes, since Tian et al. (42Tian J. Gong X. Xie Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1899-H1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown recently that inhibition of ERK1/2 in adult cardiac myocytes antagonizes ouabain-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, perhaps through an effect of ERK1/2 on Ca2+ channels and/or the Na+/Ca2+exchanger. There is also a large body of evidence to indicate the role of PKC in short term regulation of [Ca2+]ithrough activating or inhibitory effects of PKC on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+uptake/release system, and the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (25Puceat M. Vassort G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ward C.A. Moffat M.P. J. Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2591-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The possibility that ouabain-induced activation of PKC may affect any of these transporters, coupled with the demonstrated role of ERK1/2 in the regulation of [Ca2+]i (42Tian J. Gong X. Xie Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1899-H1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that PKC, ERK1/2, Na+/K+-ATPase, and a number of neighboring membrane receptors and transporters are within a signal feedback cycle (Fig. 9). Thus, the mechanism of the positive inotropic action of ouabain and related drugs may be more complex than previously assumed. 2) Of special interest is the possibility that ouabain-induced translocation/activation of PKC may cause the phosphorylation and regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase. It has been known for a long time that Na+/K+-ATPase is a substrate for PKC (45Ewart H.S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, establishment of the physiological relevance of this has been difficult, at least in part due to isoform- and species-specific structural differences among different Na+/K+-ATPases that affect their interactions with PKC (45Ewart H.S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Feschenko M.S.

In the rat cardiac myocytes where the predominant Na+/K+-ATPase isoforms are known to be good substrates for PKC (47Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

Most β2ARs are recycled back to the plasma membrane within 30 min after endocytosis, whereas most internalized δORs do not recycle but instead traverse a divergent membrane pathway leading to lysosomes (8Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M.

However, little is known about mechanisms that determine the specificity with which GPCRs are sorted between distinct membrane pathways after endocytosis.In general it is thought that cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins contain structural elements that function as sorting “signals” to control specific steps of intracellular trafficking (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 18Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of certain GPCRs contains sequences that promote receptor endocytic trafficking to lysosomes (19Trapaidze N. Keith D.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast, recycling of internalized membrane proteins back to the plasma membrane is generally thought to occur by “default” without any requirement for cytoplasmic sorting signals (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 18Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis includes previous studies establishing that major lipid constituents of the plasma membrane recycle rapidly by “bulk flow” (22Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and that certain integral membrane proteins recycle rapidly in the absence of any exposed cytoplasmic residues (23Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Emerging evidence suggests that recycling of certain GPCRs may not occur by default but may require specific membrane sorting signals. Endocytosed V2 vasopressin receptors (V2Rs) recycle to the plasma membrane by a membrane pathway characterized by its remarkably slow kinetics (t12 > 2 h) (12Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recycling of receptors via this “long pathway” requires a specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic tail of the V2R (12Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) to traverse this distinct recycling pathway. However, disruption of this sorting signal in the V2R causes internalized receptors to recycle with similarly rapid kinetics (t12 < 30 min) as the wild type β2AR (25Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Although these observations confirm that recycling of GPCRs by the specialized long pathway is mediated by a specific cytoplasmic sorting signal, they also support the hypothesis that more rapid recycling of GPCRs occurs by default.A previous study of the β2AR suggested that rapid recycling of certain GPCRs may require a specific sorting signal. Mutations of a sequence present in the distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR, which disrupt a specific interaction with the NHERF (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor)/EBP50 (ezrin/radixin/moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa) family of PDZ domain-containing proteins (27Hall R.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)), impaired recycling of tail mutant β2ARs may not indicate the existence of a specific recycling signal but might instead reflect a secondary consequence of disrupting another aspect of receptor function or membrane organization. Furthermore, as the specific sequence required for high affinity interaction of the β2AR with NHERF/EBP50 family proteins is not conserved in most other GPCRs (33Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it was not established whether this PDZ-interacting sequence could play any role in controlling the membrane trafficking of a distinct GPCR.We have addressed these questions by examining whether sequences derived from the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR are sufficient to function as a transplantable sorting signal to promote rapid recycling of a heterologous GPCR. We have focused on studying effects on the endocytic trafficking of an epitope-tagged version of δOR expressed in HEK293 cells, where this GPCR is well established to endocytose via clathrin-coated pits but differs substantially in its postendocytic sorting from the β2AR even when co-expressed at similar levels in the same cells (8Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the distal tail sequence from the β2AR can indeed function as an autonomous sorting signal, which is fully sufficient to re-route endocytosed δOR into a rapid recycling pathway. This transplantable sorting activity is functionally significant because it also confers reduced proteolytic down-regulation on mutant receptors, and it is possible to reduce the sorting signal sufficient to mediate both effects to a four-residue sequence (DSLL) corresponding to the minimal structure required to mediate detectable binding of the mutant receptor tail to NHERF/EBP50 family proteins. The autonomous activity of this sorting signal is demonstrated by the ability of the four-residue sequence to selectively re-route trafficking of a mutant δOR without causing any detectable effect on the endocytic trafficking of the co-expressed wild type allele. Thus, at least in the case of certain GPCRs, rapid recycling does not occur by default but can instead be mediated by a specific signal-dependent sorting operation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we examined the effect of transplanting sequences derived from the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR on the endocytic trafficking of the δOR. These experiments were motivated by the fact that, although both the β2AR and δOR are co-endocytosed in HEK293 by clathrin-coated pits, these distinct GPCRs differ substantially in their postendocytic trafficking between recycling and degradative membrane pathways, respectively. Furthermore, as these GPCRs signal via coupling to distinct heterotrimeric G proteins, the sorting activity of the β2AR-derived sorting signal does not appear to be limited to Gs-coupled GPCRs. A previous study indicated that a distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain is necessary for rapid recycling of the β2AR. However, as the NHERF/EBP50 family proteins that interact with this sequence serve multiple functions in cell physiology and the sequence required for this protein interaction is not conserved in most other GPCRs (including δOR), it was not determined whether the requirement of this sequence for recycling of receptors reflects its activity as an “autonomous” sorting signal or an indirect consequence perturbing other aspects of cellular function or β2AR signaling activity. The present results demonstrate that this PDZ domain-binding sequence is sufficient to re-route the endocytic trafficking of δOR from a lysosomal degradative pathway into a rapid recycling pathway and to mediate autonomous sorting of a mutant δOR from the wild type δOR when co-expressed in the same cells. Thus, we conclude that the β2AR does indeed contain an autonomous, transplantable endocytic sorting signal, which is sufficient to re-route a heterologous GPCR into a rapid recycling pathway and to cause functionally significant changes in agonist-induced down-regulation of receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of the existence of a modular sorting signal mediating rapid recycling of any GPCR.It has been well documented that GPCRs contain cytoplasmic sequences that influence specific membrane trafficking steps. For example, the D1 dopamine receptor contains a sequence in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that influences trafficking of newly synthesized receptors in the biosynthetic pathway (46Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Na. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Studies of the PAR1 thrombin receptor and thromboxane A2 receptor have identified distinct portions of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that mediate regulated and constitutive endocytosis (47Shapiro M.J.

Studies of PAR1 have also identified a distinct function of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain in promoting receptor trafficking to lysosomes (21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the V2 vasopressin receptor identified a cytoplasmic sequence that mediates trafficking of receptors via a specialized recycling pathway characterized by its remarkably slow kinetics (12Innamorati G.

Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), these studies suggest that only slow pathway(s) of GPCR recycling are mediated by specific sorting signals and more rapid recycling can occur by default. The present results demonstrate the existence of a modular sorting signal that specifically promotes rapid recycling of a heterologous GPCR.The idea that rapid recycling can occur by default is supported by a large number of previous studies of various membrane proteins (49Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). For example, elegant studies of endocytic trafficking of the transferrin receptor indicate that rapid recycling of this transmembrane protein can occur after removal of all exposed cytoplasmic residues (23Mayor S.

Similar experiments suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor can recycle to the plasma membrane in the absence of any specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Moreover, as discussed above, truncation and point mutations of the portion of the V2R tail that abolish slow recycling via the long pathway cause receptors to recycle to the plasma membrane with rapid kinetics (26Innamorati G.

These considerations suggest that the rapid recycling pathway mediated by the β2AR-derived tail sequence represents a specialized mechanism of receptor regulation, consistent with previous observations suggesting that the mechanisms mediating rapid recycling of the β2AR and transferrin receptors are distinguishable (30Cao T.T.

Although our studies have focused exclusively on the functional role of endocytic sorting in controlling proteolytic down-regulation mediated by receptor trafficking to lysosomes, we note that multiple mechanisms can contribute to down-regulation of GPCRs under physiological conditions (51Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In particular, recent studies provide strong evidence for an important role of proteasomes in mediating proteolysis of opioid receptors (52Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P.

In future studies it will be interesting to determine what physiological significance this remarkable diversity of mechanisms mediating both recycling and proteolysis of GPCRs might have. Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 undergo agonist-induced endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (1von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Adv.

However, GPCRs endocytosed by this highly conserved mechanism can follow divergent downstream membrane pathways that serve distinct physiological functions (5Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, both the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and δ opioid receptor (δOR) endocytose in HEK293 cells via clathrin-coated pits within several minutes after agonist-induced activation (1von Zastrow M.

Most β2ARs are recycled back to the plasma membrane within 30 min after endocytosis, whereas most internalized δORs do not recycle but instead traverse a divergent membrane pathway leading to lysosomes (8Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Rapid recycling of the β2AR is well established to play an important role in promoting functional resensitization of signal transduction (3Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G.

Recent studies have identified additional functions of endocytosis in mediating signal transduction and suggest the existence of additional complexity in the post-endocytic membrane trafficking of certain GPCRs (12Innamorati G.

However, little is known about mechanisms that determine the specificity with which GPCRs are sorted between distinct membrane pathways after endocytosis. In general it is thought that cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins contain structural elements that function as sorting “signals” to control specific steps of intracellular trafficking (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 18Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of certain GPCRs contains sequences that promote receptor endocytic trafficking to lysosomes (19Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast, recycling of internalized membrane proteins back to the plasma membrane is generally thought to occur by “default” without any requirement for cytoplasmic sorting signals (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 18Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis includes previous studies establishing that major lipid constituents of the plasma membrane recycle rapidly by “bulk flow” (22Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and that certain integral membrane proteins recycle rapidly in the absence of any exposed cytoplasmic residues (23Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that recycling of certain GPCRs may not occur by default but may require specific membrane sorting signals. Endocytosed V2 vasopressin receptors (V2Rs) recycle to the plasma membrane by a membrane pathway characterized by its remarkably slow kinetics (t12 > 2 h) (12Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recycling of receptors via this “long pathway” requires a specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic tail of the V2R (12Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and this sequence is sufficient to act as a sorting signal to cause a chimeric mutant V1 vasopressin receptor (26Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or β2AR (25Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) to traverse this distinct recycling pathway. However, disruption of this sorting signal in the V2R causes internalized receptors to recycle with similarly rapid kinetics (t12 < 30 min) as the wild type β2AR (25Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Although these observations confirm that recycling of GPCRs by the specialized long pathway is mediated by a specific cytoplasmic sorting signal, they also support the hypothesis that more rapid recycling of GPCRs occurs by default. A previous study of the β2AR suggested that rapid recycling of certain GPCRs may require a specific sorting signal. Mutations of a sequence present in the distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR, which disrupt a specific interaction with the NHERF (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor)/EBP50 (ezrin/radixin/moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa) family of PDZ domain-containing proteins (27Hall R.A.

Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). However, as NHERF/EBP50 proteins play multiple important roles in cell physiology (including controlling ion transport across the plasma membrane (Refs.27Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T.

Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), contributing to the structure of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Refs. 29Reczek D.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and cross-linking certain proteins in the plasma membrane (Ref. 31Raghuram V. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)), impaired recycling of tail mutant β2ARs may not indicate the existence of a specific recycling signal but might instead reflect a secondary consequence of disrupting another aspect of receptor function or membrane organization. Furthermore, as the specific sequence required for high affinity interaction of the β2AR with NHERF/EBP50 family proteins is not conserved in most other GPCRs (33Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it was not established whether this PDZ-interacting sequence could play any role in controlling the membrane trafficking of a distinct GPCR. We have addressed these questions by examining whether sequences derived from the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR are sufficient to function as a transplantable sorting signal to promote rapid recycling of a heterologous GPCR. We have focused on studying effects on the endocytic trafficking of an epitope-tagged version of δOR expressed in HEK293 cells, where this GPCR is well established to endocytose via clathrin-coated pits but differs substantially in its postendocytic sorting from the β2AR even when co-expressed at similar levels in the same cells (8Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the distal tail sequence from the β2AR can indeed function as an autonomous sorting signal, which is fully sufficient to re-route endocytosed δOR into a rapid recycling pathway. This transplantable sorting activity is functionally significant because it also confers reduced proteolytic down-regulation on mutant receptors, and it is possible to reduce the sorting signal sufficient to mediate both effects to a four-residue sequence (DSLL) corresponding to the minimal structure required to mediate detectable binding of the mutant receptor tail to NHERF/EBP50 family proteins. The autonomous activity of this sorting signal is demonstrated by the ability of the four-residue sequence to selectively re-route trafficking of a mutant δOR without causing any detectable effect on the endocytic trafficking of the co-expressed wild type allele. Thus, at least in the case of certain GPCRs, rapid recycling does not occur by default but can instead be mediated by a specific signal-dependent sorting operation. DISCUSSIONIn this study we examined the effect of transplanting sequences derived from the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR on the endocytic trafficking of the δOR. These experiments were motivated by the fact that, although both the β2AR and δOR are co-endocytosed in HEK293 by clathrin-coated pits, these distinct GPCRs differ substantially in their postendocytic trafficking between recycling and degradative membrane pathways, respectively. Furthermore, as these GPCRs signal via coupling to distinct heterotrimeric G proteins, the sorting activity of the β2AR-derived sorting signal does not appear to be limited to Gs-coupled GPCRs. A previous study indicated that a distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain is necessary for rapid recycling of the β2AR. However, as the NHERF/EBP50 family proteins that interact with this sequence serve multiple functions in cell physiology and the sequence required for this protein interaction is not conserved in most other GPCRs (including δOR), it was not determined whether the requirement of this sequence for recycling of receptors reflects its activity as an “autonomous” sorting signal or an indirect consequence perturbing other aspects of cellular function or β2AR signaling activity. The present results demonstrate that this PDZ domain-binding sequence is sufficient to re-route the endocytic trafficking of δOR from a lysosomal degradative pathway into a rapid recycling pathway and to mediate autonomous sorting of a mutant δOR from the wild type δOR when co-expressed in the same cells. Thus, we conclude that the β2AR does indeed contain an autonomous, transplantable endocytic sorting signal, which is sufficient to re-route a heterologous GPCR into a rapid recycling pathway and to cause functionally significant changes in agonist-induced down-regulation of receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of the existence of a modular sorting signal mediating rapid recycling of any GPCR.It has been well documented that GPCRs contain cytoplasmic sequences that influence specific membrane trafficking steps. For example, the D1 dopamine receptor contains a sequence in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that influences trafficking of newly synthesized receptors in the biosynthetic pathway (46Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Na. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Studies of the PAR1 thrombin receptor and thromboxane A2 receptor have identified distinct portions of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that mediate regulated and constitutive endocytosis (47Shapiro M.J.

Studies of PAR1 have also identified a distinct function of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain in promoting receptor trafficking to lysosomes (21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the V2 vasopressin receptor identified a cytoplasmic sequence that mediates trafficking of receptors via a specialized recycling pathway characterized by its remarkably slow kinetics (12Innamorati G.

Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), these studies suggest that only slow pathway(s) of GPCR recycling are mediated by specific sorting signals and more rapid recycling can occur by default. The present results demonstrate the existence of a modular sorting signal that specifically promotes rapid recycling of a heterologous GPCR.The idea that rapid recycling can occur by default is supported by a large number of previous studies of various membrane proteins (49Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). For example, elegant studies of endocytic trafficking of the transferrin receptor indicate that rapid recycling of this transmembrane protein can occur after removal of all exposed cytoplasmic residues (23Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Similar experiments suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor can recycle to the plasma membrane in the absence of any specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Moreover, as discussed above, truncation and point mutations of the portion of the V2R tail that abolish slow recycling via the long pathway cause receptors to recycle to the plasma membrane with rapid kinetics (26Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).

Although our studies have focused exclusively on the functional role of endocytic sorting in controlling proteolytic down-regulation mediated by receptor trafficking to lysosomes, we note that multiple mechanisms can contribute to down-regulation of GPCRs under physiological conditions (51Tsao P. von Zastrow M.

However, as the NHERF/EBP50 family proteins that interact with this sequence serve multiple functions in cell physiology and the sequence required for this protein interaction is not conserved in most other GPCRs (including δOR), it was not determined whether the requirement of this sequence for recycling of receptors reflects its activity as an “autonomous” sorting signal or an indirect consequence perturbing other aspects of cellular function or β2AR signaling activity. The present results demonstrate that this PDZ domain-binding sequence is sufficient to re-route the endocytic trafficking of δOR from a lysosomal degradative pathway into a rapid recycling pathway and to mediate autonomous sorting of a mutant δOR from the wild type δOR when co-expressed in the same cells. Thus, we conclude that the β2AR does indeed contain an autonomous, transplantable endocytic sorting signal, which is sufficient to re-route a heterologous GPCR into a rapid recycling pathway and to cause functionally significant changes in agonist-induced down-regulation of receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of the existence of a modular sorting signal mediating rapid recycling of any GPCR. It has been well documented that GPCRs contain cytoplasmic sequences that influence specific membrane trafficking steps. For example, the D1 dopamine receptor contains a sequence in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that influences trafficking of newly synthesized receptors in the biosynthetic pathway (46Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Na. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Studies of the PAR1 thrombin receptor and thromboxane A2 receptor have identified distinct portions of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that mediate regulated and constitutive endocytosis (47Shapiro M.J.

Studies of PAR1 have also identified a distinct function of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain in promoting receptor trafficking to lysosomes (21Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the V2 vasopressin receptor identified a cytoplasmic sequence that mediates trafficking of receptors via a specialized recycling pathway characterized by its remarkably slow kinetics (12Innamorati G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, as disruption of this sequence causes rapid recycling of receptors (26Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), these studies suggest that only slow pathway(s) of GPCR recycling are mediated by specific sorting signals and more rapid recycling can occur by default. The present results demonstrate the existence of a modular sorting signal that specifically promotes rapid recycling of a heterologous GPCR. The idea that rapid recycling can occur by default is supported by a large number of previous studies of various membrane proteins (49Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). For example, elegant studies of endocytic trafficking of the transferrin receptor indicate that rapid recycling of this transmembrane protein can occur after removal of all exposed cytoplasmic residues (23Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Similar experiments suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor can recycle to the plasma membrane in the absence of any specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (17Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Moreover, as discussed above, truncation and point mutations of the portion of the V2R tail that abolish slow recycling via the long pathway cause receptors to recycle to the plasma membrane with rapid kinetics (26Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These considerations suggest that the rapid recycling pathway mediated by the β2AR-derived tail sequence represents a specialized mechanism of receptor regulation, consistent with previous observations suggesting that the mechanisms mediating rapid recycling of the β2AR and transferrin receptors are distinguishable (30Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In addition, they expand on previous evidence suggesting that specialized membrane trafficking mechanisms may play an important role in distinguishing the functional regulation of specific GPCRs (5Gagnon A.W.

Although our studies have focused exclusively on the functional role of endocytic sorting in controlling proteolytic down-regulation mediated by receptor trafficking to lysosomes, we note that multiple mechanisms can contribute to down-regulation of GPCRs under physiological conditions (51Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In particular, recent studies provide strong evidence for an important role of proteasomes in mediating proteolysis of opioid receptors (52Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P.

In future studies it will be interesting to determine what physiological significance this remarkable diversity of mechanisms mediating both recycling and proteolysis of GPCRs might have.

Regulation of K+conductances is also a major factor in the inhibitory control of smooth muscles that produces relaxation. K+ channels can be activated by inhibitory neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide (2Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A.

Finally, mechanical stimuli, such as cell stretch, can activate K+ channels (10Ordway R.W. Petrou S. Kirber M.T. Walsh J.V. Singer J.J. J.

Koh and Sanders (13Koh S.D. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have recently identified stretch-dependent K+(SDK)1 channels in murine colonic myocytes. The native SDK channels in murine colonic myocytes were inactive under atmospheric pressure and displayed a dramatic increase in open probability upon application of negative pressure to the patch pipette in the on-cell configuration. These channels were also activated in response to smooth muscle cell stretch, which was accomplished by attaching two patch pipettes to either end of the cell and elongating the cell. Potassium channel proteins can be grouped according to transmembrane topology. Those with six transmembrane spans and a pore loop between segments S5 and S6 encode voltage-gated and calcium-sensitive K+ channels. Inwardly rectifying and ATP-sensitive K+ channel proteins have two transmembrane spanning segments and a pore loop between the two segments similar to that between S5 and S6 in the six-transmembrane span channels. Four individual subunits containing these topological structures assemble into a functional K+-selective ion channel. A recently identified family of K+-selective channels encodes two pore loops for each subunit, assembles into dimers, and has been referred to as two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channels (see Ref. 14Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholarfor review). As more K2P channels are identified at a molecular level, it is evident that the gene family encodes a highly diverse group of proteins that can be classified into four phylogenetic families based on homology. The gene names have adopted the prefix KCNK, whereas the original channel names describe aspects of their regulation or electrophysiological properties. The THIK family members (KCNK12 and KCNK13) have the common property of being activated by arachidonic acid and inhibited by the volatile anesthetic halothane (15Rajan S. Wischmeyer E. Karschin C.

The TASK family members (KCNK3 and KCNK9) are acid-sensitive and display currents consistent with background conductances (16Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). TWIK channels (KCNK1, KCNK5, KCNK6, and KCNK7) are weakly inwardly rectifying (16Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and TREK (KCNK2 and KCNK10) or TRAAK (KCNK4) channels are mechanosensitive (18Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M.

Molecular identification of ion channels important to smooth muscle function allows analysis of their biophysical, pharmacological, and regulatory properties in heterologous systems (20Horowitz B. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 19-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the molecular entity responsible for a component of stretch-activated K+ channels in gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. These channels appear to be responsible for one of the nitric oxide-sensitive conductances in gastrointestinal muscles (13Koh S.D. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and possibly vascular smooth muscles. BALB/c mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and incisions were made along the abdomen. Segments of gastrointestinal tissue were isolated, and cells were collected as described previously (21Epperson A. Bonner H.P. Ward S.M. Hatton W.J. Bradley K.K. Bradley M.E. Trimmer J.S. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G127-G136PubMed Google Scholar) and detailed below. Strips of muscle were removed and placed into Krebs solution containing 120.35 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 15.5 mmNaHCO3, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, and 11.5 mm glucose. Segments of tissue were pinned in a dissecting dish with the mucosa facing upward. The mucosa and submucosa were removed by sharp dissection. Small portions of the circular smooth muscle tissue were placed into a Ca2+-free Hanks' solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 15.5 mm NaOH, 0.336 mmNa2HCO3, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 2.9 mm sucrose, and 11 mm HEPES. Strips of tissue were incubated in a Ca2+-free Hanks' solution containing 230 units of collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Co.), 2 mg of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 2 mg of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and 0.11 mg of ATP (Sigma). Incubation in this enzyme was carried out at 37 °C for 8–12 min. The tissues were washed with Ca2+-free Hanks' solution, and gentle trituration resulted in the isolation of individual myocytes. The cells were transferred to the stage of a phase contrast microscope and allowed to adhere to the glass coverslip bottom for 5 min. Smooth muscle cells were distinguished by their characteristic morphology. Single cells were collected through applied suction by aspiration them into a wide bore patch-clamp pipette (borosilicate glass; Sutter Instruments, CA). Approximately 60 smooth muscle cells were collected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA was prepared from tissue and isolated smooth muscle cells using SNAP Total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions including the use of polyinosinic acid (20 μg) as an RNA carrier. First strand cDNA was prepared from the RNA preparations using the Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 500 μg/μl of oligo(dT) primers were used to reverse transcribe the RNA sample. The cDNA reverse transcription product was amplified with channel-specific primers by PCR. The amplification profile for these primer pairs were: 95 °C for 10 min to activate the amplitaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min, each of 40 cycles. The amplified products (5 μl) were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% agarose, 1× Tris, acetic acid, EDTA gel, and the DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. RT control on each RNA sample used a cDNA reaction as template for which the reverse transcriptase was not added, controlling for genomic DNA contamination in the source RNA. These negative controls were subjected to a second round of amplification to assure specificity of the reactions and the quality of the reagents. The following PCR primers were used (the GenBankTM accession number is given in parentheses for the reference nucleotide sequence used): TREK-1 (KCNK2) (accession numberU73488), nucleotides 506–527 and 803–822, amplicon = 316 base pairs; TREK-2 (KCNK10) (accession number NM_021161), nucleotides 1652–1673 and 1806–1826, amplicon = 174 base pairs; TRAAK (KCNK4) (accession number NM_016611), nucleotides 618–640 and 697–718, amplicon = 101 base pairs; and β-actin (V01217), nucleotides 2384–2402 and 3071–3091, amplicon = 498 base pairs. Full-length TREK-1 was amplified using primers designed to hybridize within the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (nucleotides 463–485 and 1786–1795). Real time quantitative PCR was performed using Syber Green chemistry on an ABI 5700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Biosystems). Regression analysis of the mean values of eight multiplex RT-PCRs for the log10 diluted cDNA was used to generate standard curves. Unknown quantities relative to the standard curve for a particular set of primers were calculated yielding transcriptional quantitation of gene products relative to the endogenous standard (β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The reproducibility of the assay was tested by analysis of variance comparing repeat runs of samples, and the mean values generated at individual time points were compared by Student's t test. Whole cell potassium currents from oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed cRNA were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique as described previously (22Hart P.J. Overturf K.E. Russell S.N. Carl A. Hume J.R. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9659-9663Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (resistances between 1 and 3 MΩ), and oocytes were superfused with a solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2.8 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Linear leak and capacitance currents were removed from the recorded currents by applying five hyperpolarizations of one-fifth of the test amplitude, summing the resulting currents, and adding the result to the current elicited by the test pulse (i.e. −P/5 protocol). Stock solutions of tetraethylammonium chloride (1 m; Sigma), 4-aminopyridine (0.1m; Sigma) were prepared in distilled water. Immediately prior to use, stock solutions were diluted to the desired concentration in the superfusate. Each experiment was performed at room temperature (24–28 °C) on oocytes collected from more than one frog. COS cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in modified RMPI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO) and 1% glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were subcultured twice a week by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). The TREK-1 DNA was transfected into COS cells by electroporation. After harvesting COS cells by trypsin-EDTA, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered solution and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered solution at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in the cuvette for electroporation (Electroporator II, Invitrogen, CA). A green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid and pcDNA3.1 containing TREK-1 were transfected at a 10:1 ratio of cDNAs. COS cells expressing TREK-1 were subcultured on glass coverslips for electrophysiological recordings. Current recordings were performed 1–3 days after the electroporation procedure. We performed the patch-clamp technique to measure membrane currents in whole cell and single channel configurations. The patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries pulled with micropipette puller (P-80/PC, Sutter, CA) and heat polished with a microforge (MF-83, Narishige, Japan). The pipette resistances were 1–3 MΩ for whole cell recordings and 5–8 MΩ for single channel recordings. The averaged cell capacitance was 12 ± 5 picofarad. Currents were amplified with a List EPC-7 amplifier and/or Axopatch-1A amplifier and digitized with a 12-bit analog to digital converter (Model TL-1, DMA interface, Axon instrument). The data were stored on videotape or directly digitized on-line using pClamp software (version 5.5.1 or 6.03 Axon instrument). The data were sampled at 2 KHz for whole cell and 1–5 KHz for single channel recordings with low pass filtered at 0.2–1 KHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter. The data were analyzed using pClamp (version 6.2, Axon Instrument) and Origin software (MicroCal Software) to obtain amplitude histogram and channel activity (NPo, where N is the number of channels in the patch, and Po is the probability of channel being open). NPo was determined from 1 min of channel recording. Application of negative pressure to on-cell patches is thought to pull the plasma membrane into the patch pipette, single channel recordings from stretched membrane were recorded. Membrane stretch was elicited by applying suction (negative pressure) to the back end of the patch pipette. The amount of negative pressure was calibrated with a pressure transducer. The negative pressure and volume relation was linear. For whole cell recordings COS cells were bathed in a solution 5 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris. CaCl2 was replaced with MnCl2 for some experiments. The pipettes solution was 130 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm K2ATP, 0.1 mmNa2GTP, 2.5 mm creatine phosphate disodium salt, 0.1 mm mm EGTA and 5 mmHEPES, set to pH 7.2 with Tris. For the perforated whole cell patch-clamp experiments, the composition of the pipette solution was 140 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mmHEPES, adjusted pH 7.2 with Tris. Amphotericin B (90 mg/ml) was dissolved with Me2SO, sonicated, and diluted in the pipette solution to give a final concentration of 270 μg/ml. The external solution for these experiments was the same as for the dialyzed whole cell patch experiments. For single channel recordings in cell-attached or excised patches, the bath solution was 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.61 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris. The pipette solution for asymmetrical K+ gradients was 5 mm KCl and 135 mm NaCl, and for symmetrical K+ experiments it was 140 mm KCl including 200 nmcharybdotoxin to inhibit large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The bath solution was 140 mmK+. Sodium nitroprusside, 8-Br-cGMP, and 8-Br-cAMP were added to the bath solution in some experiments. We also tested the effect of the catalytic subunit of PKG and PKA on TREK-1 from inside-out patches. The mutant S351A of mouse TREK-1 was created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using an ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) as described in the protocol with a minor modification. Linearized TREK-1 plasmid was modified and amplified simultaneously by PCR. Two primer pairs used for PCR are a forward primer (5′-AGCTCGCCGCAGAGCTGGCGGG-3′) containing the S351A mutation spanning nucleotides 1529–1550 of mouse TREK-1 and a reverse primer (5′-TCCGCTTCACGGATGTGGCACG-3′), which was 5′-phosphorylated, complementary to nucleotides 1507–1528. PCR was performed in a 25-μl PCR mixture containing 2.5 μl of 10× mutagenesis buffer, 1 mm dNTP mix, 2 μg of TREK-1 DNA in pcDNA3.1 expression vector as a template, 15 pmol of each primer, and 1 μl of ExSite DNA polymerase blend. The cycling parameters were as follows: 1 cycle of 4 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C followed by 8 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C with a final cycle of 5 min at 72 °C. Following completion of the PCR, 10 units of DpnI and 1.25 units of Pfu DNA polymerase were added directly to the reaction. The reaction mixture was mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 30 min. The DpnI-, Pfu DNA polymerase-treated plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene, CA), and the cells were grown on a LB plate containing 60 μm ampicillin overnight. Each colony grown on the plate was used for a colony-directed PCR (23Krishnan B.R. Blakesley R.W. Berg D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The entire mutant TREK-1 gene (S351A) in the isolated plasmid was sequenced. This plasmid was used for heterologous expression in COS cells. We recently reported the expression of 90 pS, K+-selective, stretch-activated channels in murine and canine colonic myocytes (13Koh S.D. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations led us to examine the expression of stretch-activated K2P channels in smooth muscles. The stretch-activated K2P channels belong to the TREK family (see Ref. 15Rajan S. Wischmeyer E. Karschin C. Preisig-Muller R. Grzeschik K.H. Daut J. Karschin A. Derst C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7302-7311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar for an up to date dendrogram) and include TREK-1, TREK-2, and TRAAK (KCNK2, KCNK4, and KCNK10, respectively). Primers were designed to specifically amplify these cDNAs (see “Experimental Procedures”). RT-PCR was performed on isolated smooth muscle cells derived from several regions of the murine gastrointestinal tract, as well as vascular vessels, urinary bladder, and uterine muscles. The latter two tissues were included because of their roles in hollow organs that function as expandable reservoirs. The expression pattern for the three stretch-activated K2Pchannels in smooth muscles is shown in Fig.1 A. TREK-1 was expressed in all the smooth muscles tested except bladder and uterus. TREK-2 was only expressed in antrum and pulmonary artery. TRAAK could not be detected in any of the smooth muscles tested. The expression level of TREK-1 expression relative to β-actin in smooth muscles is shown in Fig. 1 B. There was little difference in expression levels in smooth muscles and approximately a 20-fold difference in expression between smooth muscle and brain tissue. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. TREK-1 expression relative to β-actin (arbitrary units) was 0.564 ± 0.051 for murine brain, 0.023 ± 0.0054 for murine colon, 0.040 ± 0.0025 for murine jejunum, 0.013 ± 0.0011 for murine fundus, 0.048 ± 0.0062 for murine antrum, 0.062 ± 0.0041 for murine portal vein, and 0.034 ± 0.0059 for murine pulmonary artery (n = 3 for all of these data). Full-length cDNA was amplified from mouse colonic smooth muscle RNA using primers directed to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences. Several independent clones were sequenced and found to be identical to the previously cloned TREK-1 from murine brain (19Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). TREK-1 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and either in vitrotranscribed and injected into Xenopus oocytes or transiently transfected into COS cells. To compare the properties of mTREK-1 cDNA cloned from murine smooth muscle to previous reports as well as the native SDK currents from smooth muscles, mTREK-1 was expressed in oocytes and COS cells. Voltage-clamp recordings from oocytes expressing TREK-1 revealed a rapidly activating and noninactivating current (Fig.2 A). Similar currents were not detected in control-injected oocytes. Typically, resting membrane potential in cells expressing TREK-1 was hyperpolarized by 30.2 mV (i.e. −63.9 ± 1.48 mV (n = 10)) as compared with water injected oocytes (−33.7 ± 1.48 mV (n = 9), p < 0.01), as expected if the background potassium conductance was increased. The ion selectivity of the current was examined by replacing external sodium with potassium such that extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]0) was increased from 5 to 98 mm. Increasing [K+]0 to 98 mm caused the current-voltage relationship to reverse at more positive potentials (Fig. 2 A). We also examined the effects of K+ channel blockers on mTREK-1 currents. Fig. 2shows typical membrane currents recorded from oocytes expressing mTREK-1 under control conditions and in the presence of various “classical” K+ channel blockers. Application of these compounds produced various degrees of inhibition (Fig. 2,B–E); however, none produced a strong inhibition. In COS cells the amplitude of voltage-dependent outward currents were much larger in cells expressing TREK-1 than in nontransfected cells. The peak currents of nontransfected and TREK-1 expressing COS cells were 0.09 ± 0.01 nA (n = 20) and 1.54 ± 0.35 nA (n = 15) at + 50 mV, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C). The current-voltage relationship of nontransfected and transfected cells is shown in Fig. 3 C. Replacement of external Ca2+ with Mn2+ did not reduce the current amplitude significantly (data not shown); however, minor decreases may have resulted because of to reduction of native large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. SDK channels in native colonic myocytes have been shown to be activated by application of negative pressure and cell elongation (13Koh S.D. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the activation of TREK-1 by cell elongation. COS cells were stretched by a micromanipulator. Representative traces obtained in transfected cells and before and after stretch are shown in Fig. 3 (D–F). The mean peak currents were 1.07 ± 0.36 nA at +50 mV under control conditions, and stretch significantly increased the current to 2.43 ± 0.32 nA (n = 3) at +50 mV. A summary of the current-voltage relationship from these experiments is shown in Fig. 3 F. We have found that NO donors and membrane-permeable analogs of cGMP that stimulate protein kinase G (PKG) activate SDK channels in murine colonic myocytes (13Koh S.D. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study we tested the effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 8-Br-cGMP on TREK-1 expressed in COS cells. SNP (10−6m) did not significantly increase outward current in dialyzed cells under whole cell recording conditions (e.g. at +50 mV the average current was 1.06 ± 0.29 nA in control recordings and 1.10 ± 0.40 nA after addition of SNP (n = 4)). Application of 8-Br-cGMP similarly had no significant effect on mTREK-1 current in dialyzed cells (data not shown). However, when the perforated patch technique was used, a significant increase in outward currents in cells expressing mTREK-1 was observed in response to SNP (Fig.4). The mean peak currents at +50 mV was 1.28 ± 0.42 nA (n = 4) under control conditions and increased to 2.31 ± 0.39 nA in the presence of SNP (10−6m; p < 0.05). Application of 8-Br-cGMP (1 mm) also significantly increased outward currents (n = 4, p < 0.05 by analysis of variance). We examined the conductance and the effects of SNP or 8-Br-cGMP on mTREK-1 using on cell patches. In symmetrical K+ gradients (140 mm K+ in the patch solution), the conductance of mTREK-1 channels was 95 ± 2 pS (n = 4). The amplitude of unitary current was 2.1 ± 0.4 pA at 0 mV under asymmetrical K+ conditions (5 mm K+ in the patch solution (n = 4)). We tested the responsiveness of mTREK-1 channels to negative pressure applied to the patches (Fig.5 A). To avoid contamination from native nonselective cation current, the cells were held at 0 mV during these experiments. Application of negative pressure (−20 or −40 cm H2O) caused a significant increase in the open probability of the 53 pS mTREK-1 channels at 0 mV in asymmetrical K+ gradient (5 mm/140 mm) (i.e. NPo increased from 0.08 ± 0.04 to 1.35 ± 0.20 (n = 4); p < 0.01 in response to −40 mm Hg). After releasing the negative pressure (i.e. restoring atmospheric pressure) to the pipette, open probability returned to the control level (Fig.5 A). We also tested the effects of SNP and 8-Br-cGMP on the open probability of mTREK-1 channels. In on-cell patches, the open probability of TREK-1 channels was 0.13 ± 0.12 (n = 3) at 0 mV in asymmetrical K+ gradient. Application of SNP (10−6m) induced an increase of NPo (0.89 ± 0.10; Fig. 5 B). The application of 8-Br-cGMP (10−4m) in the bathing solution also increased the NPo of TREK-1 channels (Fig. 5 D). Activation of TREK-1 channels by cGMP has not previously been reported; however, others have found that cAMP-dependent mechanisms suppress TREK-1 currents (24Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 25Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested 8-Br-cAMP effects on mTREK-1. From an average control current of 0.52 nA at +30 mV, addition of 8-Br-cAMP decreased the currents initially (e.g. to 0.31 nA after 5 min). With sustained exposure to cAMP, we observed a substantial increase in the current (i.e. to 2.32 nA at +30 mV, 15 min after application). The currents returned to control level after washout of cAMP. Representative traces are shown in Fig.6 (A–D). Time courses of the cAMP effects are shown in Fig. 6 E, and averaged current-voltage curves for these experiments are shown in Fig.6 F (n = 4). The amino acid sequence of TREK-1 has two consensus sequences for PKG phosphorylation, and these could also serve as PKA phosphorylation sites. Therefore, we created a point mutation in mTREK-1 in which Ala replaced Ser-351 (S351A). The amino acid sequence containing the two consensus sequences are shown in Fig.7 A. Cells transfected with mTREK-1 (S351A) did not respond to 8-Br-cGMP (1 mm; Fig. 7,B–F). Application of 8-Br-cAMP to cells with mTREK-1 (S351A) caused a significant and sustained suppression of current (Fig.8). For example, the mean peak current at +50 mV in these cells was 2.30 ± 0.58 nA under control condition"
https://openalex.org/W2003306808,"Mouse As4.1 cells, obtained after transgene-targeted oncogenesis to induce neoplasia in renal renin expressing cells, express high levels of renin mRNA from their endogenous Ren-1c gene. We have previously identified a 242-base pair enhancer (coordinates −2866 to −2625 relative to the CAP site) upstream of the mouseRen-1c gene. This enhancer, in combination with the proximal promoter (−117 to +6), activates transcription nearly 2 orders of magnitude in an orientation independent fashion. To further delimit sequences necessary for transcriptional activation, renin promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs containing selected regions of the Ren-1c enhancer were analyzed after transfection into As4.1 cells. These results demonstrate that several regions are required for full enhancer activity. Sequences from −2699 to −2672, which are critical for the enhancer activity, contain a cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE) and an E-box. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that transcription factors CREB/CREM and USF1/USF2 in As4.1 cell nuclear extracts bind to oligonucleotides containing the Ren-1c CRE and E-box, respectively. These two elements are capable of synergistically activating transcription from the Ren-1c promoter. Moreover, mutation of either the CRE or E-box results in almost complete loss of enhancer activity, suggesting the critical roles these two elements play in regulating mouseRen-1c gene expression. Although theRen-1c gene contains a CRE, its expression is not induced by cAMP in As4.1 cells. This appears to reflect constitutive activation of protein kinase A in As4.1 cells since treatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89, caused a significant reduction in Ren-1c gene expression and this reduction is mediated through the CRE at −2699 to −2688.

Renin, an aspartyl protease produced and secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, initiates an enzymatic cascade which results in the production of the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II, the major effector molecule of the renin-angiotensen system. Juxtaglomerular cells are modified smooth muscle cells located at the distal end of the afferent arteriole and in the normal mature kidney represent <.1% of the total kidney cell population (1Hackenthal E. Paul M. Ganten D. Taugner R. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1067-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, juxtaglomerular cells are the principal source of active renin found in the circulation (2Hartcroft P.M. Circ. Res. 1963; 12: 525-534Crossref Google Scholar, 3Kurtz A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 113: 1-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to kidney, there are several extra-renal sites of renin mRNA expression (4Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some mouse strains have only a single renin gene (Ren-1c) whereas other strains have two copies (Ren-1d and Ren-2) (5Abel K.J. Gross K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2111-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Abel K.J. Gross K.W. Genetics. 1990; 124: 937-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these mouse renin genes are approximately equivalently expressed in juxtaglomerular cells, however, their expression is differentially regulated in some extra-renal tissues (7Fabian J.R. Field L.J. McGowan R.A. Mullins J.J. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17589-17594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of transgenic studies have presented compelling evidence suggesting that sequences regulating the tissue, cell, and developmental expression of mouse renin are located between 2.5 and 4.6 kb1 upstream of the transcription start site of the Ren-2 gene (8Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. McGowan R.A. Kane-Haas C.M. Gross K.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Fabian J.R. Mullins J.J. Gross K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, studies employing aRen-1c-GFP transgenic reporter have indicated that the major sequences required to correctly specifyRen-1c expression spatially and temporally within embryonic, extra-embryonic and adult tissues, and in response to physiological perturbation of angiotensin II signaling, are resident within 4.1 kb of the immediate 5′-flanking sequence (45Jones C.A. Hurley M.I. Black T.A. Kane C.M. Pan L. Pruitt S.C. Gross K.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A kidney-derived renin expressing cell line (As4.1), developed from a mouse strain containing only a single renin gene by transgene-targeted oncogenesis (11Sigmund C.D. Okuyama K. Ingelfinger J. Jones C.A. Mullins J.J. Kane C. Wu C.Z. Kenny L. Rustum Y. Dzau V.J. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19916-19922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), facilitates the identification of importantcis-acting regulatory sequences controlling renin gene expression. Consistent with results from transgenic studies, transient transfection analysis of renin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs have demonstrated that sequences located >2.6 kb upstream of the transcription start site are necessary for high level reporter gene expression (10Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In these studies, renin promoter (−117 to +6) CAT constructs containing 5′-flanking sequence extending to −2.6 kb did not increase basal transcriptional activity. However, promoter constructs containing 4.0 kb of upstream sequence (−4,100 to −117) increased transcriptional activity ∼2 orders of magnitude. Progressive deletion analysis localized equivalent activity to a 242-bp fragment (−2866 to −2625). This fragment acts as a classical enhancer of transcription, stimulating promoter activity >50-fold in an orientation and position independent fashion. Sequences showing ∼98% sequence identity to the Ren-1c enhancer have been identified in the 5′-flanking regions of Ren-2 andRen-1d . 2C. D. Sigmund and K. W. Gross, unpublished data.Significantly, recent studies have identified a sequence homologous to the mouse enhancer ∼12 kb upstream of the human renin gene (12Yan Y. Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Catanzaro D.F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The high degree of enhancer homology in the mouse renin genes and the cross-species conservation suggests that this region plays an important role in regulating renin gene transcription. Despite the high degree of sequence similarity, the mouse and human enhancers differ in their ability to activate transcription of a renin promoter. With respect to the transcription start site, the distal 202 bp of the mouse and human sequences demonstrate a higher degree of homology (80%) than the more proximal 40 bp (45%) (12Yan Y. Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Catanzaro D.F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies with chimeric enhancers have demonstrated that the functional difference between the mouse and human enhancers is due to sequence differences in the proximal 40 bp (13Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) detected sequence-specific binding to two overlapping elements, Ea and Eb, within the proximal 40 bp of the mouse enhancer. Mutagenesis and transfection analysis revealed that the higher transcriptional activity observed with the mouse enhancer is due to the stimulating effects of element Eb, whereas element Ea antagonizes the positive influence of element Eb. In addition, the 40-bp element does not stimulate basal promoter activity on its own, suggesting that additional upstream sequences within the 202-bp distal sequence are also necessary for full transcriptional activity. A direct repeat of Eb, named Ec, has been localized upstream of the 40-bp element and 10 bp from Eb (14Shi Q. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3597-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both Eb and Ec are important for the basal expression of the mouse renin gene and bind the retinoic acid receptor and retinoic X receptor to confer retinoic acid activation. Here we report the further delimitation and characterization ofcis-acting elements in the distal 202 bp of the mouseRen-1c enhancer. Our results indicate that a CRE-like element and an E-box are required for the enhancer activity. Moreover, CREB/CREM and USF1/USF2 are identified as transcription factors in As4.1 cells binding to these two sequences, respectively. Mutation of either the CRE or E-box nearly abolishesRen-1c expression, supporting the critical roles these elements play in regulating renin gene transcription. Also, our results suggest that the high basal level of renin gene expression in As4.1 cells is probably the result of constitutive activation of PKA and that the Ren-1c CRE is a target sequence for the cAMP/PKA pathway. Plasmid 117R1 was constructed by inserting a 123-bp fragment containingRen-1c peomoter sequence from −117 to +6 intoBglII/HindIII sites in pGL2-basic (Promega).

All 5′ deletion mutants ofRen-1c enhancer in Fig. 1 A were constructed by inserting the corresponding polymerase chain reaction synthesized fragments containing truncated enhancer plus the promoter region into SacI/HindIII sites in pGL2-basic. Those 3′ enhancer deletion mutants in Fig. 1 B contain polymerase chain reaction-synthesized truncated enhancer fragments inserted into SacI/BglII sites in 117R1. Plasmids 117R1CEC, 117R1mCEC, 117R1CmEC, and 117R1CEmC were constructed by inserting oligonucleotides containing wild-typeRen-1c enhancer sequence from −2702 to −2663 (CEC), CRE-mutated CEC, E-box-mutated CEC, and Ec-mutated CEC intoSacI/BglII sites in 117R1.

TheXhoI/BglII-digested polymerase chain reaction fragments containing Ren-1c enhancer and site specifically mutated enhancers including Ea, Eb, Ec, Ea + Eb, E-box, CRE, and E-box + CRE mutations were inserted intoXhoI/BglII sites in 2625 to create 2625enh, 2625enh/ma, 2625enh/mb, 2625enh/mc, 2625enh/mbc, 2625enh/me, 2625enh/mcre, and 2625enh/mce, respectively. All these enhancers containing mutated sites were also inserted intoSacI/BglII sites in 117R1 to create 117enh, 117enh/ma, 117enh/mb, 117enh/mc, 117enh/mbc, 117enh/me, 117enh/mcre, and 117enh/mce, respectively. Plasmid 117R1-CRE4 was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide containing four copies of theRen-1c CRE into SacI/BglII sites of 117R1. Enh-TA and Enh/mcre-TA were constructed by inserting the Ren-1c enhancer and CRE-mutated enhancer, respectively, into SacI/BgII sites in a pGL2-basic-derived plasmid containing the adenovirus E1b TATA box (46Martin K.J.

Full-length cDNA for USF1 was isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from As4.1 cells and cloned into BamHI/EcoRI sites in pcDNA3.1/myc-His(+)A vector (Invitrogen) without incorporating any epitope Tag. Sequences of all plasmid DNAs were verified by automated sequencing at the Roswell Park biopolymer facility.

Both As4.1 and JEG-3 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For each transfection in a 35-mm culture dish, 2.2 μg of DNA including 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of expression plasmid if needed, nonspecific plasmid, and 0.2 μg of plasmid containing Rous sarcoma virus promoter driving β-galactosidase (RSV-βgal) were mixed with 4.4 μl of FuGENE reagent. Twenty-four h after transfection cells were harvested and measured for luciferase (Luc) and β-galactosidase activities using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Galacto-Light PlusTM chemiluminescent reporter assay (Tropix), respectively. In Figs. 11 and 12, 2 μg of reporter plasmid were used in each transfection assay and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Forskolin (10 μm) and H-89 (10 μm) were added 24 h prior to harvesting. The Luc activity is normalized with β-galactosidase activity to correct differences in transfection efficiency between experiments. All transfection results represent the average + S.E. of at least three separate experiments.Figure 12Effect of PKA specific inhibitor H-89 onRen-1 c expression in As4.1 cells.

For each reaction (10 μl), labeled DNA probe (20,000 cpm) was mixed with about 6 μg of nuclear extracts and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol. When oligonucleotide containing E-box was used as probe, 1 μg of nonspecific competitor polydG·polydC was chosen instead of poly(dI-dC). Reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and then run on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis at room temperature, the gels were dried for autoradiography. In a competition or supershift assay, an excess amount of unlabeled DNA or 1 μl of antibody was added to reaction mixture 15 min or 1 h, respectively, prior to the addition of labeled DNA probe. Antibodies against CREB-1, CREB-2, ATF-1, ATF-2, ATF-3, CREM, c-JUN, USF1, USF2, and c-MYC were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Transcription factor USF1 was in vitro transcribed/translated by TNT-coupled wheat germ system (Promega). Two microliters of reaction were used in each EMSA. As4.1 cells were either untreated or treated with 10 μm H-89 for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated by TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), separated on 1.5% agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized as described (49Petrovic N. Kane C.M. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Radioactive signals from blots were quantified by phosphorimagery. Using a renin expressing kidney-derived tumoral cell line (As4.1) we have previously identified a 242-bp renin enhancer (coordinates −2866 to −2625 relative to the transcription start site) which activates transcription >50-fold in combination with the renin proximal promoter (−117 to +6) (10Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In an effort to more precisely define sequence motifs necessary for high level gene expression, a series of 5′-deleted fragments of theRen-1c enhancer sequence were fused to a renin proximal promoter-Luc reporter gene construct (−117R1) (Fig.1 A) and assayed for activities after transient transfection into As4.1 cells (Fig. 1 B). Deletions of sequences from −2866 to −2699 result in about a 10-fold decrease in enhancer activity. Regions from −2829 to −2803, −2777 to −2751, −2738 to −2712, and −2712 to −2699 contribute to the enhancer activity by about 1.6-, 1.4-, 1.6-, and 3.0-fold, respectively. However, deletion of sequence from −2699 to −2684 results in a dramatic drop (10-fold) in the enhancer activity, suggesting that the sequence within the region from −2699 to −2684 is critical for maximal enhancer activity. To further localize sequences 3′ to −2684 which are important for the enhancer activity, a series of 3′ deletion mutants of enhancer were fused to −117R1 (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of sequence from −2625 to −2663, which contains Ea and Eb sites (13Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), does not significantly affect the enhancer activity (Fig.2 B). However, removal of Ec site (14Shi Q. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3597-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) causes 6-fold reduction in activity. Further deletion from −2672 to −2684 results in another 6-fold decrease in activity, suggesting that this region may contain a protein-DNA interaction site. Consistent with results from 5′ deletion mutants, deletion of sequence from −2684 to −2699 results in almost complete loss of enhancer activity. To identify the DNA-protein interaction site between −2699 to −2684, we employed EMSA using double stranded oligonucleotides containing 21 bp of renin enhancer sequence, −2702 to −2682 (oligonucleotide 1c in Fig.3 A), and nuclear extracts prepared from As4.1 cells (Fig. 3 B). These studies demonstrated the formation of a single complex (Fig. 3 B,lane 1) which was efficiently competed with 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lane 2). To more precisely define the specific base pairs critical for complex formation, competition was performed using six double stranded mutant oligonucleotides each containing sequential 3-bp mutations. Mutants CM1, CM2, CM3, and CM4 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–6) were unable to effectively compete the DNA-protein interaction. However, mutants CM5 and CM6 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–8) effectively competed complex formation. These results suggest that the DNA-protein interaction is confined to the sequence motif AATGACATCACT. Search of the transcription factor data base identified an 8-bp sequence within this motif which showed significant similarity (7/8 bp match) to a consensus CRE. While the consensus CRE is defined by the palindromic sequence TGACGTCA (15Comb M. Birnberg N.C. Seasholtz A. Herbert E. Goodman H.M.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the majority of CREs identified thus far deviate from the consensus sequence by one or more base pairs (19Borrelli E. Montmayeur J.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 321-338PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence identified in the renin enhancer is TGACATCA. To further investigate the potential role of this CRE-like element in the DNA-protein interaction(s) observed during EMSA with As4.1 nuclear extracts, we performed competition assays using double stranded oligonucleotides containing consensus CRE and mutated CRE sequences (Fig. 4 A). When the 21-bp renin oligonucleotide was used as a probe, a single complex was formed (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) and was efficiently competed by increasing molar excess (×25, ×50, ×100) of both unlabeled renin (lanes 2, 3, and 4) and consensus CRE (lanes 5, 6, and 7) oligonucleotides. The mutated CRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 B, lanes 8,9, and 10), however, was unable to effectively compete complex formation. In a reciprocal experiment, the consensus CRE oligonucleotide was labeled and used in EMSA with As4.1 nuclear extracts. This experiment also revealed a single complex (Fig.4 C, lane 1) which was efficiently competed by increasing molar excess (×25, ×50, ×100) of both unlabeled CRE (lanes 2, 3, and 4) and renin (lanes 5, 6, and 7) oligonucleotides. The mutated CRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 C, lanes 8,9, and 10) was again incapable of competing the DNA-protein interaction. These experimental data suggest that complex formation is mediated by a CRE-like element. CREs are known to form DNA·protein complexes with the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. Although each of these proteins can bind to CRE as homodimers, some of these proteins can bind to CRE as heterodimers, both within the family and with members of the AP-1 transcription family (20Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 377Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To identify the specific nuclear factors that contribute to the DNA·protein complex observed with the renin CRE-like element and As4.1 nuclear extracts, we performed EMSAs using antibody against CREB-1 (Fig.5 A). The results showed that addition of this antibody almost completely abolished the formation of As4.1 nuclear proteins·1c complex. The CREB-1 antibody used can also react to ATF-1 and CREM. However, antibodies against ATF-1 and other transcription factors including CREB-2, ATF-2, ATF-3, and c-JUN did not attenuate or supershift the complex (Fig.5 B). Addition of anti-CREM-1 antibody resulted in a partially supershifted complex (Fig. 5 B, lane 6), indicating that the CREM transcription factor(s) can also bind to this site. These results demonstrate that the CRE-like sequence located between −2699 and −2684 is a CREB/CREM-binding site. To determine whether CREB/CREM can activate gene expression by binding to this CRE-like element, a construct containing four copies of this element fused to 117R1 was transfected into As4.1 cells. Addition ofRen-1c CREs resulted in almost 50-fold increase in transcription (Fig. 6). Moreover, the induction was reduced 4-fold by co-transfecting cells with a dominant negative CREB (A-CREB) (21Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), further suggesting involvement of CREB/ATF transcription factors in renin gene regulation. Sequence from −2684 to −2672, which is required for the full enhancer activity, contains an E-box motif (CAGATG). To determine whether this E-box binds nuclear proteins in As4.1 cells, an oligonucleotide RE containing the E-box motif was used in EMSA (Fig.7 A). A complex was formed with polydG·polydC as nonspecific competitor (Fig. 7 B,lane 1) but not with poly(dI-dC) (data not shown). This complex is RE-specific since it was competed by 100-fold excess of RE itself but not by an oligonucleotide mRE containing a mutated E-box (Fig. 7 B, lanes 2 and 3). Also, the E-box complex was effectively competed with 100-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide containing a USF1-binding site but not with a similar oligonucleotide containing a mutated USF1-binding site (Fig.7 C). To examine whether the bHLH-leucine zipper transcription factors USF1/USF2 bind to the Ren-1c enhancer E-box, antibodies against USF1 and USF2 were used in supershift EMSA (Fig.7 D). To separate the USF1/USF2 homodimers and heterodimer in EMSA, the specific RE/As4.1 nuclear extract complex shown in Fig. 7,B and C, was run considerately further into the gel. At least two complexes (L and S) were observed (Fig.7 D, lane 1). Addition of an increasing amount of antibody against USF1 gradually attenuated both the L and S bands (Fig.7 D, lanes 2–6) and the formation of both L and S complexes was completely abolished with more than 0.5 μl of USF1 antiserum (Fig. 7 D, lanes 4–6). Addition of 1 μl of USF2 antiserum almost completely disrupted the formation of the S complex (Fig. 7 D, lane 7), whereas antibody against c-MYC, which recognizes a similar E-box sequence, did not disrupt the formation of either the L or S complex (Fig. 7 D, lane 8). These results suggest that the S band most probably contains the USF1/USF2 heterodimer whereas the L band contains the USF1 homodimer. Considering that USF1 has lower molecular weight than USF2, the USF1 homodimer would move faster than the USF1/USF2 heterodimer in the gel. Thus, the USF1 homodimer in the L band is probably associated with other unidentified proteins. In addition, given the decrease in intensity of the L band in response to antibody against USF2 (Fig.7 D, lane 7), the L band may also contain USF1/USF2 heterodimer associated with other proteins. In vitro synthesized USF1 protein was able to bind to the RE probe (Fig. 7 E, lane 3), and the binding was completely abolished by the addition of USF1 antibody (Fig. 7 E,lane 4). These results suggest a potential role for the USF transcription factors in regulation of renin gene expression. Since the progressive deletion experiments indicated that CRE, E-box, and Ec in the Ren-1c enhancer are all required for the enhancer activity, we wanted to test whether these sites cooperatively activate gene expression. A construct containing enhancer sequence from −2702 to −2663 (see Fig.8 for positions of various regulatory elements), which includes CRE, E-box, and Ec motifs, fused to 117R1 (Fig. 9 A), was transfected into As4.1 cells. This construct activates luciferase expression 29-fold over 117R1 (Fig. 9 B). However, similar constructs containing either mutated CRE or mutated E-box (Fig. 8) was not capable of activating the Ren-1c promoter whereas a construct containing mutated Ec was s"

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which SR-BI facilitates lipid uptake, we examined the connection between lipid donor particle binding and lipid uptake using kidney COS-7 cells transiently transfected with SR-BI. We systematically compared the uptake of [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (CE) and [14C]sphingomyelin (SM) from apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-containing reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles and apo-free lipid donor particles. Although both types of lipid donor could bind to SR-BI, only apo-containing lipid donors exhibited preferential delivery of CE over SM (i.e. nonstoichiometric lipid uptake). In contrast, apo-free lipid donor particles (phospholipid unilamellar vesicles, lipid emulsion particles) gave rise to stoichiometric lipid uptake due to interaction with SR-BI. This apparent whole particle uptake was not due to endocytosis, but rather fusion of the lipid components of the lipid donor with the cell plasma membrane; this process is perhaps mediated by a fusogenic motif in the extracellular domain of SR-BI. The interaction of apoA-I with SR-BI not only prevents fusion of the lipid donor with the plasma membrane but also allows the optimal selective lipid uptake. A comparison of rHDL particles containing apoA-I and apoE-3 showed that while both particles bound equally well to SR-BI, the apoA-I particle gave ∼2-fold greater CE selective uptake. Catabolism of all major HDL lipids can occur via SR-BI with the relative selective uptake rate constants for CE, free cholesterol, triglycerides (triolein), and phosphatidylcholine being 1, 1.6, 0.7, and 0.2, respectively. It follows that a putative nonpolar channel created by SR-BI between the bound HDL particle and the cell plasma membrane is better able to accommodate the uptake of neutral lipids (e.g. cholesterol) relative to polar phospholipids.

The uptake of CE from HDL is different from the endocytic uptake of cholesterol from low density lipoprotein (LDL), in that it does not involve the uptake of the whole lipoprotein particle. Instead, there is a preferential transfer of the CE from the HDL particle without concomitant uptake of the protein component of the lipoprotein (4Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This selective CE uptake pathway had been studied extensively for many years prior to the discovery of SR-BI (5Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J.

The critical role for SR-BI in vivo has been demonstrated by gene transfer experiments showing that overexpression of this protein in the liver lowers plasma HDL cholesterol levels in mice (7Kozarsky K.F.

In contrast, a targeted null mutation in the SR-BI gene in mice increases plasma cholesterol levels and reduces delivery of HDL-CE to the adrenal gland (11Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). SR-BI resides in the plasma membrane of cells and is composed of a glycosylated extracellular domain and two membrane-spanning domains near the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule (11Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The ∼40-kDa extracellular portion of the receptor is critical for function because an antibody directed against this region inhibits the binding and selective CE uptake from HDL (12Temel R.E.

Comparison of SR-BI to a closely related scavenger receptor, CD-36, shows that while both receptors can mediate binding of HDL, only SR-BI is efficient at promoting selective CE uptake and this function is attributable directly to the extracellular domain of SR-BI (13Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Also, mutational analysis of this region of the receptor revealed 2 arginine residues that are critical for allowing the efficient uptake of CE from HDL (13Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The binding of HDL to SR-BI and the selective uptake of CE from HDL are linked processes (14Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The first step in lipid uptake via SR-BI is the binding of the lipid donor particle to the receptor. The second step involves the movement of lipid from the SR-BI-bound lipid donor particle to the cell plasma membrane. Two models for the latter process have been suggested. Earlier studies from this laboratory led to the proposal that the receptor forms a nonpolar channel between a bound HDL particle and the cell plasma membrane through which hydrophobic molecules such as CE can diffuse down a concentration gradient created by the CE/phospholipid (PL) ratio of the HDL particle (16Rodrigueza W.V.

Alternatively, it is thought that SR-BI might facilitate hemifusion between the phospholipid monolayer of an HDL particle and the external monolayer of the plasma membrane, thereby allowing lipid transfer to occur (17Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been shown that selective lipid uptake from HDL occurs during HDL retroendocytosis (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); it is likely that the movement of CE molecules from HDL to the plasma membrane occurs both at the cell surface and in endocytic vesicles. In addition to facilitation of CE uptake, SR-BI mediates uptake of PL from reconstituted HDL particles (16Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1529: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and exchangeable apolipoproteins are among them. Cross-linking studies have demonstrated that the class A amphipathic α-helix present in apolipoproteins is a recognition motif for the receptor (22Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but multiple sites in apolipoproteins may be recognized by SR-BI (23Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S.

Furthermore, there are conflicting reports on the role of apoA-I and apoA-II in mediating HDL binding and selective CE uptake from HDL; Pilon et al. (24Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have suggested that apoA-II is a better ligand for SR-BI than apoA-I but that apoA-II has an inhibitory effect on CE uptake. On the contrary, de Beer et al. (25de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Mirocha N. Jonas A. Webb N.R. de Beer F.C. van Der W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15832-15839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) obtained results showing that apoA-II binds less well to SR-BI than apoA-I but is more efficient at promoting CE uptake than apoA-I. These results suggest that the nature of the ligand binding to SR-BI may influence the selective CE uptake process. Thus, a quantitative investigation of the role of exchangeable apolipoproteins in mediating binding to SR-BI and promoting SR-BI-mediated uptake of lipids is required for better understanding of the mechanism of action of SR-BI. In this study, we examine the association between the binding of a lipid-donating particle and the subsequent lipid movement into the cell. The results suggest that binding of a lipid donor particle to SR-BI is insufficient to allow selective uptake of lipids by SR-BI; interaction of an apolipoprotein with SR-BI is essential for selective uptake of lipids from a donor particle.

Apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and A-II were isolated from human HDL as described (26Weisweiler P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prior to use, the purified apolipoproteins were resolubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Human apoE-3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the method of Morrow et al. (27Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Exp. Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 6 mguanidine HCl and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol overnight and dialyzed extensively against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer prior to use (28Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For some experiments, apolipoproteins were labeled with [125I] using the iodine monochloride method (29Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar); the specific activities of the labeled products were in the range of 300 to 1500 dpm/ng of protein. POPC dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) was dried under nitrogen onto the wall of a glass tube and then placed in a vacuum oven to completely remove any remaining solvent. The lipid was then rehydrated in TBS to form multilamellar vesicles (MLV). Using a sonicator (Branson Sonifier 350), this dispersion was sonicated on ice under nitrogen using a titanium tapered tip for 5 min followed by 1 min of cooling. This cycle was repeated 10 times until the initially cloudy lipid mixture became translucent. To remove the titanium debris that was produced during the sonication the samples were spun in a Beckman GPR centrifuge for 15 min at 3000 rpm. Then to separate any remaining MLV from the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) layer, the sample was centrifuged in a Beckman 50 Ti rotor for 2 h at 4 °C at 145,000 × g (30Rodrigueza W.V. Mazany K.D. Essenburg A.D. Pape M.E. Rea T.J. Bisgaier C.L. Williams K.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The top SUV layer was removed and used in competitive binding experiments. For lipid uptake experiments requiring incorporation of radioactive lipids, the above procedure was modified slightly. Radioactive lipid pairs ([3H]COE or [3H]FC with [14C]SM) of interest in trace amounts (<1 mol % of each) were dried along with POPC, CO, FC (98:1:1 mol ratio) in a glass tube and processed as described above for unlabeled SUV. Negatively charged SUV containing either PS or PI were prepared in a similar manner and contained 48:48:1:1 mole ratios of PS or PI and POPC, FC, and CO. SUV used for measuring direct binding to cells at 4 °C were prepared as described above except they contained only [14C]SM as a marker. Preparation of SUV by the above method yielded vesicles 22 ± 3 nm in diameter (30Rodrigueza W.V. Mazany K.D. Essenburg A.D. Pape M.E. Rea T.J. Bisgaier C.L. Williams K.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and they were used within 10 days of preparation. For some experiments, apoA-I was complexed with SUV as described by Davidson et al. (31Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In brief, dual-labeled SUV prepared as described above were incubated with apoA-I at an initial lipid to protein mole ratio of 170:1 at 24 °C for 12 h. Thereafter, apoA-I not associated with SUV was removed using gel filtration chromatography (1 × 30-cm Superdex 200 HR column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The typical final lipid to protein mole ratio was 500:1; assuming that a typical SUV contained about 2000 PC molecules (32McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 776: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), 3 to 4 apoA-I molecules were associated with each vesicle. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared with POPC:FC:CO (98:1:1 initial mol ratio) plus [3H]COE and [14C]SM in trace amounts (<1 mol %) using an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, B.C., Canada). The appropriate amounts of lipids were dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v), mixed with radioactive lipids, and dried completely onto the wall of a glass tube under nitrogen. TBS was then used to hydrate and form a MLV suspension. To ensure complete recovery of all lipids from the wall of the glass tube, samples were subjected to 3 min of water bath sonication. The resulting MLV were passed 10 times through the extruder using two 200-μm pore size filters at 100 pounds/square inch of nitrogen. This procedure yielded ∼90% LUV with a mean diameter of 185 ± 15 nm (30Rodrigueza W.V. Mazany K.D. Essenburg A.D. Pape M.E. Rea T.J. Bisgaier C.L. Williams K.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For experiments requiring the encapsulation of [3H]inulin, the procedure was modified slightly. POPC, FC, CO, and [14C]SM (5 μCi) in the appropriate amounts were dried onto the wall of a glass tube under nitrogen. Then, 500 μCi of [3H]inulin (dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to the glass tube and the resulting MLV were passed through the extruder as described. To separate the inulin trapped in the core of the LUV from unencapsulated material, BioGel A-1.5m (Bio-Rad) in a 1.6 × 100-cm gel filtration column was used. Liquid scintillation measurements of the collected void volume showed that the LUV peak corresponded with all of the lipid label ([14C]SM) and some of the [3H]inulin. The column retained the overwhelming majority of the [3H] counts (i.e.unencapsulated inulin). To ensure that [3H]inulin associated with the LUV was a good marker for the aqueous compartment of the vesicle, a portion of the [3H]inulin-containing LUV was disrupted by sonication. After gel filtration, liquid scintillation counting of the eluted LUV peak showed that at least 90% of the [3H]inulin counts associated with the LUV were released. We attempted to encapsulate [3H]inulin in SUV, but we were not able to achieve a sufficient level of incorporation for use in cell culture experiments. Lipid emulsion particles composed of POPC and a core of triolein were prepared as described (33Saito H. Minamida T. Arimoto I. Handa T. Miyajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15515-15520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, POPC and triolein (1:1, w/w) dissolved in chloroform were dried onto the wall of a glass tube along with either [3H]COE and [14C]SM or [3H]FC and [14C]SM. The lipids were resolubilized in TBS containing 10% sucrose initially at 60 °C. The lipid suspension was sonicated with a titanium flat tip (Branson Sonifier 350) for 5 min followed by a 5-min pause. This cycle was repeated 6 times after which the samples were centrifuged at a low speed for 30 min to remove titanium debris released from the tip. The sample was then placed in 12-kDa molecular mass cutoff dialysis tubing and dialyzed overnight to remove the sucrose. After this, the samples were centrifuged in a SW-40 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The middle milky emulsion layer was removed from the centrifuge tube, transferred to new tubes, and centrifuged for an additional 12 h under similar conditions. The top creamy layer was removed and used in lipid uptake experiments. A triolein to phospholipid ratio of 2:1 (w/w) was achieved and the lipid emulsion particle diameter was 35 ± 5 nm (33Saito H. Minamida T. Arimoto I. Handa T. Miyajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15515-15520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). rHDL containing [3H]COE and human apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, or E-3 were prepared by complexing the desired apolipoprotein with POPC, CO, and trace amounts (<0.01 mol %) of [3H]COE using the cholate dispersion method according to Sparks et al. (34Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of POPC and CO was dried into a film first under a light stream of N2,then under high vacuum. Subsequently, the lipids were hydrated in TBS, vortexed to generate MLV, and incubated with sodium cholate at 37 °C for 1.5 h to generate detergent-mixed micelles. The solution was mixed every 15 min during the incubation and after 30 min was sonicated for 5–10 min in a bath sonicator to clarify the initially turbid solution. The mixture was then allowed to incubate for the remainder of the 1.5 h. Next, apolipoprotein freshly dialyzed from 6m guanidine HCl into TBS was added to the detergent:lipid mixture at a POPC to protein ratio (mol:mol) of 100:1. The lipid-detergent-protein complexes were then aspirated into a syringe containing Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) and the solution was rotated for 3 h at 4 °C to facilitate the removal of cholate. Thereafter, the phospholipid-apoprotein discs formed were collected and separated from the Bio-Beads by ejecting the contents of the syringe through a 0.45-μm sterile filter. Native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (Phast System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to confirm the formation of reconstituted HDL particles. To obtain a homogenous population of rHDL particles each preparation was fractionated on a gel filtration column (1 × 30-cm Superdex 200 HR column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Identical size rHDL complexes (hydrodynamic diameters ∼12 nm) were isolated and used within 10 days of preparation. The final mole ratio of apo:POPC:CO was typically 1:65:0.3. To measure uptake of various lipids in COS cells, rHDL were dual labeled with 14C- and 3H-labeled lipids of interest. These rHDL particles contained apoA-I, POPC, CO, and FC in mole ratios of 1:96:1:1 and trace amounts (<1 mol %) of two lipid labels of interest. All preparations of rHDL were made in parallel. Nondenaturing electrophoresis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) showed a homogenous band of equal size for all preparations. The combinations of radioactive lipid in each preparation were as follows: [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (COE)/14C-free cholesterol (FC), [3H]COE/[14C]triolein (TO), [3H]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine/[14C]FC, [3H]COE/14C-brain PS, [3H]COE/14C-bovine sphingomyelin (SM), [3H]PI/[14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, [3H]COE/[14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. Phospholipids did not contain labels in the fatty acid portion of the molecule since the hydrolysis of the fatty acid by the cells could mask the uptake of phospholipids. In addition to the HDL lipids, two other sterols were included in the study; rHDL containing [3H]sitostanol/[14C]FC or [3H]sitosterol/[14C]FC were prepared. The purity of each radiolabeled lipid was verified by thin layer chromatography on a silica gel plate (16Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and they were >99.9% pure. Kidney COS-7 cells were maintained and transiently transfected with the cDNA for SR-BI or the vector DNA as described by Connelly et al. (14Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Concentration-dependent binding of [14C]SM-labeled POPC-SUV and PC/PS-SUV was conducted at 4 °C for 1 h in cells with and without SR-BI expression. After incubation, the cell monolayer was washed 3 times with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin plus one additional wash with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline alone. Then 0.1 n NaOH was used to solubilize the cells and an aliquot of the cell lysate was used to determine the cell associated radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting. Direct binding of ligand to COS-7 cells was analyzed using a nonlinear regression fitting to the equation,B=[ligand]Bmax[ligand]+Kd+C[ligand]Eq. 1 on Graph Pad Prism as described before (16Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Binding of rHDL and selective CE uptake from rHDL were studied using COS-7 cells with and without SR-BI expression. rHDL containing [3H]COE and 125I-labeled apoA-I, apoA-II, or apoE-3 were incubated at 30 μg of protein/ml with either SR-BI-transfected or vector-transfected cells for 2 h at 37 °C. The cell monolayer was washed and solubilized as described above. Selective uptake of the CE was calculated as described previously (16Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cellular uptake of various types of lipid from discoidal rHDL was measured in COS-7 cells with and without SR-BI expression. rHDL particles with 14C/3H-labeled pairs of lipids, prepared as described above, were incubated with the cells at 30 μg of protein/ml at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed as described above and lysed in 0.1 n NaOH. An aliquot of the lysate was taken to determine the cell associated lipid uptake, which was expressed as percent of label present in the incubation medium taken up by the cell per h/mg of cellular protein. Selective CE uptake from [3H]COE/125I-apoA-I rHDL is ∼95% in COS cells expressing SR-BI so that at least 95% of the cell associated [3H]COE is due to the selective uptake pathway and not whole particle uptake. TLC analysis of the extracellular medium after the incubation period did not show any detectable decomposition of the lipid labels used. Dual-labeled phospholipid vesicles and lipid emulsion particles prepared as described above were incubated with SR-BI-expressing and control COS-7 cells. For most experiments, the vesicles were incubated at 100 μg of PL/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed and lysed as described above. Control experiments were also conducted by varying the temperature, time of incubation, and concentration of the vesicles in the incubation medium. Our goal in this study was to examine the association between ligand binding and cellular accumulation of lipids mediated by SR-BI. There are numerous studies on SR-BI/ligand interaction indicating that the receptor can bind apolipoproteins as well as certain PL (for reviews, see Refs. 21Trigatti B.L. Rigotti A. Braun A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 35Rigotti A. Trigatti B. Babitt J. Penman M. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SR-BI was initially described as a receptor for anionic PL but not neutral PL (20Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1994067136,"We report here that in addition to a cytoplasmic copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a mitochondrial manganese-containing SOD, Candida albicans expresses a third SOD gene (SOD3). The deduced amino acid sequence contains all of the motifs found in previously characterized manganese-containing SODs, except the presence of a mitochondrial transit peptide. Recombinant Sod3p expressed and purified from Escherichia coli is a homotetramer with a subunit mass of 25.4 kDa. Mass absorption spectrometry detected the presence of both iron and manganese in purified Sod3p but, as determined by metal replacement experiments, the enzyme displays activity only when bound to manganese. Overexpression of SOD3 was shown to rescue the hypersensitivity to redox cycling agents of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacking the cytoplasmic copper-zinc-containing SOD. Northern blot analyses showed that the transcription of SOD3 is induced neither by the transition from the yeast to the mycelial form of C. albicans nor by drug-induced oxidative stress. In continuous cultures, the expression of SOD3 was strongly stimulated upon the entry and during the stationary phase, concomitantly with the repression of SOD1. We conclude that Sod3p is an atypical cytosolic manganese-containing superoxide dismutase that is involved in the protection of C. albicans against reactive oxygen species during the stationary phase.

No ill effect normally results from colonization, but subtle defects in host defenses lead to infection. Its ability to be maintained as commensal implies that it has evolved to: (i) resist the host defense mechanisms and (ii) survive for prolonged periods of time in a nonreplicative form. Although it is generally accepted that different defense mechanisms are operating in systemic as compared with mucocutaneous candidiasis, phagocytes are key components in protection against both types of infections, providing a first line of defense against superficial infections and dominating resistance to systemic infections (1Romani L. Mencacci A. Cenci E. Puccetti P. Bistoni F. Res. Immunol. 1996; 147: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fungicidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages involves the production of the superoxide anion (O⨪2), the first intermediate in the sequential univalent reduction of dioxygen (O2), and the primary reaction of the oxidative burst (2Vazquez N. Walsh T.J. Friedman D. Chanock S.J. Lyman C.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 145-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 is also known to affect the life span, and in fungi, mutants defective in the proper ROS detoxification have a poor viability during the stationary phase (3Melov S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This and the finding that C. albicans is more resistant to induced oxidative stresses than the nonpathogenic and closely related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Jamieson D.J. Stephen D.W. Terriere E.C. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1996; 138: 83-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prompted us to further investigate the components implicated in the C. albicans oxidant protection. Despite the existence of many nonenzymatic anti-oxidant compounds (i.e. lipid-soluble vitamin α-tocopherol, water-soluble vitamin ascorbate, glutathione), the most efficient way to eliminate ROS is through catalysis by antioxidant enzymes (i.e.superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase). The metalloenzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the primary enzyme involved, and it disproportionates the O⨪2 anion into O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (6Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). SODs belong to four major classes according to the metal cofactor utilized; these are copper and zinc (Cu/ZnSOD), nickel (NiSOD), iron (FeSOD), and manganese (MnSOD). FeSODs and MnSODs are closely related enzymes, whereas Cu/ZnSODs and NiSODs define separate families of SODs. Typically, eukaryotes express both a cytoplasmic Cu/ZnSOD and a MnSOD that is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (6Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). In C. albicans, the genes encoding the cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD (SOD1 gene product) and mitochondrial MnSOD (SOD2gene product) were recently identified (7Hwang C.S. Rhie G. Kim S.T. Kim Y.R. Huh W.K. Baek Y.U. Kang S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Rhie G.E. Hwang C.S. Brady M.J. Kim S.T. Kim Y.R. Huh W.K. Baek Y.U. Lee B.H. Lee J.S.

They were found to be orthologs of the well characterized S. cerevisiae SOD1 and SOD2 genes, respectively. S. cerevisiae sod1Δmutants grow poorly in air, are very sensitive to redox cycling agents, and die quickly in stationary phase, whereas sod2Δmutants are oxygen-sensitive when respiration is required (4Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar,9van Loon A.P. Pesold-Hurt B. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3820-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of a third C. albicansgene encoding a superoxide dismutase (SOD3). We show that the Sod3 enzyme utilizes manganese as cofactor, but, in contrast to most eukaryotic MnSODs, it is active within the cytosol rather than in the mitochondrial matrix. Expression studies suggest that C. albicans coordinates in the opposite direction the transcription of the SOD1 and SOD3 genes. Because the SOD3 gene is strongly induced upon and during the stationary phase, we propose that this gene may be part of a well orchestrated and distinct defense mechanism for survival in nutrient-limiting conditions. C. albicans ATCC 32354 was used for the construction of the genomic library (10Lamarre C. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and plasmid constructions. The C. albicans strain SC5314 was used for the SOD1 and SOD3 transcriptional studies. The S. cerevisiae strains used, all purchased from ResGen (Invitrogen Corporation), were: BY4741 (MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), BY4741 sod1Δ (same as BY4741 except sod1Δ::KAN), and BY4742 sod2Δ (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 sod2Δ::KAN). The Escherichia coli strains MC1061 and M15[REP4] were used for standard recombinant DNA work and the heterologous expression of SOD3, respectively. The C. albicansblastospores were routinely cultured at 28 °C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with glucose as described previously (11Deslauriers N. Michaud J. Carre B. Leveillee C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For the Northern analyses performed with the yeast and mycelial forms of C. albicans, blastospores were first grown overnight at 28 °C in the following media: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose (YPD); YPD supplemented with 10% serum; IMDM, pH 6.5; and Lee's medium at either pH 4.5 or 6.5. The precultures were then diluted to an A600 = 0.1 and incubated for 16 h in the same media at either 28 or 37 °C. For the SOD1 and SOD3 expression studies in continuous cultures, precultures of C. albicans blastospores grown in either YPD, YP supplemented with 2% galactose (YPGal), or 3% glycerol (YPG) were diluted to an A600 = 0.1 and incubated for 60 h at 30 °C in the same media. For the expression of the C. albicans SOD genes in response to induced oxidative stresses, a preculture of C. albicansblastospores grown in YPD was diluted to an A600= 0.1 and then further incubated for 24 h at 30 °C in the same media. Aliquots were removed every 2 h and further incubated for 1 h at the same temperature in YPD or in YPD supplemented with either hydrogen peroxide (0.4 mm), menadione (0.5 mm), or paraquat (0.5 mm). The S. cerevisiae strains were grown at 30 °C in either YPD or, when transformed, in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-ura) as described (12Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 201Google Scholar). The E. coli strains were cultured in 2YT medium containing 0.2% glucose supplemented with antibiotics as required (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). Screening of the C. albicans genomic library was done as described by Hanahan and Meselson (14Hanahan D. Meselson M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) using a radioactive 397-bp EcoRV DNA fragment derived from plasmid p4E1 that was labeled as described previously (10Lamarre C. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis, C. albicans blastospores grown in IMDM at mid-log phase were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g). Purification of total RNA was performed according to the procedure described by Kohrer and Domdey (15Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA synthesis was obtained by reverse transcription of the total RNA with the SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the oligonucleotide R1SOD3 following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and their sequences are presented in Table I. The single-stranded cDNA was then tailed at the 3′-end by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and dCTP according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting tailed cDNA was submitted to a first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the oligonucleotides R1SOD3 and AAP as primers. A second round of PCR was performed with a 100-fold dilution of the amplicons generated during the first PCR, but this time using the oligonucleotides R2SOD3 and AUAP as primers. The thermal cycling conditions for both PCR were the following: 94 °C for 2 min; then 94 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 3 min for 40 cycles (72 °C for 10 min at the last cycle); and 4 °C until use. Direct automatic DNA sequencing of the resulting amplicon was done as described previously (10Lamarre C. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. Mol.

The full-length coding sequence of SOD3 was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA essentially as described above, except that the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the AP primer were used. The single-stranded cDNA obtained was next amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides AUAP and FSOD3 as primers, and, following a 1000-fold dilution of the reaction mixture, a second round of PCR was performed using the oligonucleotides FSOD3 and RSOD3. In each case the thermal cycling conditions were: 94 °C for 2 min; then 94 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles (72 °C/10 min at the last cycle); and 4 °C until use. The resulting amplicon was then cut with BamHI and ligated to the BamHI-digested plasmids pQE30 (Qiagen) and pVT102U (16Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) to generate pSOD3r and pVTSOD3, respectively. In pSOD3r, a His6 tag coding sequence provided by pQE30 flanks the 5′-end of the SOD3 coding sequence. The LacI repressor regulates expression of the chimeric gene in pSOD3r, whereas pVTSOD3 provides constitutive expression through the strong ADH promoter. Northern analyses and radiolabeling of the probes were performed as described previously (10Lamarre C. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The probes for SOD1 and SOD3 were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides FSOD1-RSOD1 and FSOD3-RSOD3, respectively, along with cDNA clone as template (this study). Transformation of yeast using the lithium acetate salt was performed according to the rapid procedure described by Kaiser et al. (12Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 201Google Scholar). The CaCl2 protocol was used for the transformation of E. coli (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). E. coli M15[REP4] cells transformed with pSOD3r were grown in 2YT medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 25 μg ml−1 kanamycin to early log phase (A600 of 0.6) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The expression of SOD3r was then triggered either by the addition 1 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) followed by a further 5-h incubation (long induction) or by the addition of 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1 mm IPTG and a 15-min incubation (short induction). All of the purification steps were then performed at 4 °C. The cells were harvested at 4,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, 300 mmNaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. They were lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell (Amicon) at 8000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 30 min, and the recombinant protein was purified with 5 ml of an 50% aqueous suspension of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin has described by the manufacturer (The QIA expressionist; Qiagen). The unbound material was removed by 10 washes with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The bound recombinant Sod3 fusion protein was eluted with 2 × 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. The protein preparation was then dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8 for 16 h at 4 °C and stored at 4 °C or at −20 °C for prolonged periods. Superoxide dismutase activity of the purified Sod3pr was assayed by the nitroblue tetrazolium method of Beauchamp and Fridovich (17Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). For the in vivo assay, 100 μl of the indicated S. cerevisiaecultures grown overnight in SC-ura medium were mixed with 8 ml of molten top agar (0.7% w/v agar in SC-ura medium) maintained at 42 °C. The top agar was rapidly overlaid onto SC-ura plates and allowed to solidify. Sterile filter discs were deposited on the plates, and 10 μl of the indicated concentrations of either menadione or paraquat were spotted onto the filter discs. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The metal content of the purified Sod3pr enzyme was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The purified Sod3pr enzyme and commercial preparations of the E. coli FeSOD and MnSOD (Sigma Chemical Co.) used as controls were treated essentially as described by Gregory and Dapper (18Gregory E.M. Dapper C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for metal removal and replacement. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The column was calibrated with the following gel filtration calibration molecular mass markers (Sigma): bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17.5 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.4 kDa). Subunit molecular mass was estimated by 12% SDS-PAGE in denaturing conditions as described previously (10Lamarre C. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The CSA1 gene, which encodes an abundant mycelial surface antigen in C. albicans (11Deslauriers N. Michaud J. Carre B. Leveillee C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was recently sequenced from a 7.4-kilobase genomic DNA fragment cloned into plasmid YEp24 (10Lamarre C. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further sequencing reactions of this plasmid (p4E1) revealed the presence of an incomplete open reading frame in the opposite direction relative to CSA1. This open reading frame encodes a putative protein with sequence similarity to members of the manganese-containing SOD enzyme family. Because the recently characterized C. albicans cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD (7Hwang C.S. Rhie G. Kim S.T. Kim Y.R. Huh W.K. Baek Y.U. Kang S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial MnSOD (8Rhie G.E. Hwang C.S. Brady M.J. Kim S.T. Kim Y.R. Huh W.K. Baek Y.U. Lee B.H. Lee J.S. Kang S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were named Sod1p and Sod2p, respectively, we designated this novel gene and the corresponding enzyme as SOD3 and Sod3p. The full-length sequence of this gene was completed with plasmid p SOD3, obtained through colony hybridization of a C. albicans genomic library with a radiolabeled 397-bp EcoRV fragment derived from p4E1 (Fig.1). The complete 678-bp open reading frame is composed of two exons encoding, respectively, 35- and 171-amino acids segments separated by a 60-bp intron positioned between nucleotides 106 and 165. Typical fungal consensus sequences (20Ballance D.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) described for the 5′ ((g/G)TAHGTY) and 3′ (MYA(G/g)) intron/exon boundaries, along with the splice signal for lariat formation (WRCTRAC) were identified in the intervening sequence (Fig. 1). Splicing of the intron at these proposed sites was verified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Direct sequencing of the resulting amplicon gave the sequence 5′-CAAACACC-3′, hence confirming that nucleotides 105 and 166 were joined together in the cDNA. This analysis also identified the transcriptional start site that is located 9 bp upstream from the initiator ATG codon. The deduced amino acid sequence of SOD3 is a 206-residue protein with a molecular mass of 22.7 kDa (Fig. 1). The consensus pattern D XWEH XXY (i.e.Asp170 to Tyr177 in Sod3p) and the four characteristic residues involved in metal binding (i.e.His32, His81, Asp170, and His174) typical of the Mn/FeSOD family are present within Sod3p (21Parker M.W. Blake C.C. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Carlioz A. Ludwig M.L. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Steinman H.M. Touati D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Parker and Blake (21Parker M.W. Blake C.C. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) identified critically positioned amino acids that allow iron- and manganese-containing SODs to be distinguished based on their primary structure. The amino acids Gly75, Gly76, Gln155, and Asp156 found in Sod3p conform to the signature sequence for the MnSOD subfamily, suggesting that this third C. albicansSOD requires manganese at its catalytic site for activity. At the amino acid level, Sod3p displays significant sequence identity with several members of the eukaryotic MnSODs and bacterial MnSOD and FeSOD but is most closely related to the C. albicans Sod2p (63% identity) and S. cerevisiae Sod2p (60% identity) (Fig. 2). In sharp contrast to the C. albicans Sod2p and S. cerevisiae Sod2p enzymes, however, as well as to most eukaryotic MnSOD enzymes characterized so far, Sod3p does not possess an amino-terminal extension of ∼30 residues (transit peptide) that normally targets the enzyme to the mitochondria. It therefore predicts that the enzyme will be sequestrated within the cytosol. To biochemically characterize the C. albicans SOD3 gene product, its cDNA was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting plasmid (pSOD3r) expresses a histidine-tagged Sod3 enzyme, and a large amount of it (10–100 mg/liter) was purified in its native form by a single affinity chromatography step on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions, the highly purified preparation migrated as a single band of 25.4 kDa, in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 24.1 kDa for the His-tagged modified Sod3p subunit (Fig.3, inset). The molecular mass of the native enzyme was also evaluated by gel filtration (Fig. 3). The elution profile showed a prominent, nearly symmetrical, peak of ∼85 kDa and a minor peak of very low molecular mass. This is therefore consistent with a homo-tetrameric structure for native Sod3p, a result that further extends the similarity between the C. albicansSod2 and Sod3 enzymes to their quaternary structure (8Rhie G.E. Hwang C.S. Brady M.J. Kim S.T. Kim Y.R. Huh W.K. Baek Y.U. Lee B.H. Lee J.S. Kang S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A low level of dismutase activity was measured in initial experiments where Sod3p was purified from E. coli recombinants cultured in 2YT medium and induced for 5 h with IPTG (TableII). Consistent with its requirement for Mn2+ at the catalytic site, a nearly 7-fold increase in specific activity was observed (∼2100 units/mg versus∼350 units/mg; Table II) when Sod3p was purified from E. coli recombinants cultured in a manganese-supplemented medium and induced for a shorter period with IPTG (15 min). Atomic absorption spectrometry performed on these two enzyme preparations, while indicating the presence of both Fe2+ and Mn2+within Sod3p, also revealed a positive correlation between the manganese/iron ratio and the activity (the greatest manganese/iron ratio was found in the most active enzyme preparation). Finally, and in further support that Sod3p belongs to the MnSOD family, the activity of Sod3p was not affected by the presence of known inhibitors of either bacterial FeSODs (hydrogen peroxide) or Cu/ZnSODs (potassium cyanide). However, because neither enzyme preparation was filled exclusively with Fe2+ ions, these results could not rule out the possibility that Sod3p is a member of the so-called cambialistic SODs. These enzymes represent a special group of Mn/FeSODs that are active, albeit at variable levels, with either metal ion present at their active site (24Santos R. Bocquet S. Puppo A. Touati D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We directly tested this possibility by first denaturing Sod3p in the presence of a chelator to generate apoSod3p and subsequently allowed the enzyme to refold in the presence of either metal cofactor (Table III). As expected, the apo form of Sod3p, as well as bacterial apoMnSOD and apoFeSOD used as controls, was totally inactive. When renatured in the presence of Fe2+, Sod3p displayed a very low background activity (∼130 units/mg). This activity was similar to, although somewhat lower than, that measured for the E. coli apoMnSOD reconstituted with Fe2+(∼310 units/mg). In contrast, when apoSod3p was refolded in the presence of Mn2+, the activity of the reconstituted enzyme was significantly higher (∼3900 units/mg) than the native enzymes purified from E. coli (∼350 and ∼2000 units/mg; TableII). Similarly, the E. coli apoMnSOD and apoFeSOD reconstituted with their corresponding metal cofactor were more active than the commercial preparations. Collectively, we concluded from these experiments that the C. albicans Sod3p is a bona fide manganese-containing SOD, active as a tetramer, that is predicted to reside rather unusually into the cytosolic compartment.Table IIActivity, inhibitory profile, and metal content of the purified Sod3r enzymeSourceEnzymeSpecific activityInhibitionMetal content5 mm H2O22 mmKCNManganeseIronunits/mg protein%mol metal/mol proteinC. albicansSod3r (LI)2-aLI, long induction with IPTG (5 h); SI, short induction with IPTG (0.25 h).370ND2-bND, not determined.ND0.40.9Sod3r (SI)22407100.90.4E. coliFeSOD4840754NDNDMnSOD457067NDND2-a LI, long induction with IPTG (5 h); SI, short induction with IPTG (0.25 h).2-b ND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab The postulated cytosolic localization of Sod3p implies that its main function is to protect this cellular compartment against reactive oxygen radicals. To confirm this hypothesis and, in the positive, to evaluate whether the nature of the SOD expressed (i.e. Cu/ZnSOD versus MnSOD) might influence the efficiency by which the cell copes with induced oxidative stresses, the SOD3 cDNA was introduced into S. cerevisiae mutants lacking either the cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD (sod1Δ) or the mitochondrial MnSOD (sod2Δ) enzymes. Cell viability of the yeast transformants growing in the presence of either menadione or paraquat was then assayed (Fig.4). These drugs are redox cycling agents that generate superoxide ions either within the cytosol (menadione) or in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments (paraquat). Yeast killing was assessed by the presence of a clear zone (“halo”) surrounding the filter disc containing the drug deposited on a Petri dish seeded with the indicated transformant."

Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). β-Lactamases have been divided into four classes on the basis of their amino acid sequences and catalytic mechanisms (2Matagne A. Dubus A. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of class A, C, and D enzymes, which contain a nucleophilic serine side chain as a key component of their active site, have been extensively studied, due to their established clinical importance. Class B enzymes are metalloproteins that require one or two zinc ion(s) for their activity (3Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The first metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)1 to be discovered was produced by an innocuous strain of Bacillus cereus (4Kuwabara S. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 27C-30CCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in the last 20 years, MBL-mediated resistance has appeared in several pathogenic strains including Bacteroides fragilis,Aeromonas hydrophila, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, andSerratia marcescens (5Payne D.J. J. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 39: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Even more threatening is the rapid dissemination of some metallo-β-lactamase genes by horizontal transfer, involving both plasmid- and integron-borne genetic elements. For instance, the IMP enzymes that were first isolated in clinical isolates of S. marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been found in Klebsiella,Alcalinogenes, Acinetobacter, andShigella strains (6Laraki N.

These reveal a unique αβ/βα “sandwich” topology characteristic of this family of enzymes, distinct from other zinc enzymes such as thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A. Two zinc cations are present in the active site of the four MBLs for which crystal structures are available (although in the case of theB. cereus enzyme not in all reported structures); the zinc ligands are not fully conserved between the different subclasses, perhaps contributing to some of the observed differences in substrate profiles and zinc affinities. Considering only the subclass B1 enzymes, in site I the zinc is coordinated by the imidazole rings of three histidine residues (His86, His88, and His149 in the B. cereus enzyme; His116, His118, and His196according to the recently proposed standard numbering of MBLs (27Galleni M.

In the structures with two zincs, this water (or hydroxide) bridges to the zinc in site II, which is also coordinated by a histidine (His210 in the B. cereus enzyme), a cysteine, an aspartate, and a second water (or a carbonate ion). The bridging water molecule is believed to be the nucleophile responsible for lactam cleavage, but the precise role of the two metals in catalysis is still unclear; mechanisms have been proposed in which only site I plays a direct role in catalysis (28Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), or in which the two zinc ions are both involved, as a binuclear center (3Wang Z. Fast W.

Since MBLs are resistant to inactivators, such as clavulanic acid, of the serine enzymes, the spread of MBL-mediated bacterial resistance to β-lactams (including carbapenems) is a matter of real concern. No satisfactory inhibitors of MBLs are yet available for clinical use, and the range of active site architectures for the MBLs makes the discovery of useful broad spectrum inhibitors a challenging task. Work to date allows the identification of at least five major groups of potential MBL inhibitors. 1) Biphenyl tetrazoles are potent inhibitors of theB. fragilis MBL, although they are much less active toward other important MBLs such as IMP-1 (32Toney J.H. Fitzgerald P.M. Grover-Sharma N. Olson S.H. May W.J. Sundelof J.G. Vanderwall D.E. Cleary K.A. Grant S.K. Wu J.K. Kozarich J.W. Pompliano D.L. Hammond G.G. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 185-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); the crystal structure of a complex between B. fragilis MBL and a biphenyl tetrazole shows that the inhibitor binds to the zinc in site II, with the displacement of a water molecule (32Toney J.H.

Adachi Y. Imamura H. Yamada K. Hashizume T. Morishima H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2497-2503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but they behave as poor substrates of MBLs and may be too rapidly hydrolyzed by some of them to be effective therapeutic agents. 3) Inactivators of the A. hydrophila enzyme such as trifluoromethyl alcohols and ketones (34Walter M.W. Felici A. Galleni M. Paul-Soto R. Adlington R.M. Baldwin J.E. Frère J.M. Gololobov M. Schofield C.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Schofield C.J. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 35-40Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have been described, but the mechanism of inhibition is still unclear, and their activity against other MBLs is much lower. 4) Very recently, succinic acid derivatives with aromatic substituents have been shown to be potent inhibitors of the IMP-1 enzyme (36Toney J.H. Hammond G.G. Fitzgerald P.M.D. Sharma N. Balkovec J.M. Rouen G.P. Olson S.H. Hammond M.L. Greenlee M.L. Gao Y.-D. J. Biol.

Mori H. Ohta M. Arakawa Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) can be potent inhibitors of MBLs, either as free thiols or in the protected form of a thioester (38Payne D.J. Bateson J.H.

Crystal structures are available for the complex of the IMP-1 enzyme with a potent mercaptocarboxylate substrate analogue inhibitor (25Concha N.O. Janson C.A. Rowling P. Pearson S. Cheever C.A.

We now report kinetic studies of the inhibition of MBLs by one of the simplest potent mercaptocarboxylate inhibitors, thiomandelic acid (Fig.1; α-mercaptophenylacetic acid), and a number of analogues, together with NMR studies of thiomandelic acid binding to the B. cereus MBL, BcII, as a starting point for the design of broad spectrum MBL inhibitors. 4-Methoxyphenylacetic acid (1b), 4-nitrophenylacetic acid (1c), α-bromophenylacetic acid (2a), 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (9), and 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (10) were purchased from Aldrich. 4-Fluorophenylacetic acid (1d) and thiosalicylic acid (8) were from Acros Organics, and benzylmercaptan (11) was from Fluka. Compounds7a–c and g-h (Fig. 1) were generous gifts from Jean-Luc Boucher (CNRS, University Paris V) and were synthesized according to Eloy and Lenaers (45Eloy F. Lenaers R. Chem. Rev. 1962; 62: 155-183Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thiomandelic acid and a series ofpara-substituted analogues were synthesized in racemic form by a modified version of the procedure described by Bonner (46Bonner W.A. J. Org. Chem. 1968; 33: 1831-1836Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Starting from the readily accessible appropriate α-bromobenzeneacetic acids 2b–d and commercially available 2a, compounds 3a–d were synthesized by reaction with potassiumo-ethyldithiocarbonate, and 3aa-ab were synthesized with the corresponding cesium salt. Theo-ethyldithiocarbonate group was then converted into a thiol moiety via basic hydrolysis using concentrated ammonia in ethyl alcohol. The α-mercaptophenylacetic acids 4a-b, d were obtained as a mixture with the corresponding disulfide derivatives5a-b, d, whereas the nitro derivative 3c gave only undesired side products. The oxidation of the thiol groups by using catalytic ferric chloride and sodium iodide (47Iranpoor N. Zeynizadeh B. Synthesis. 1999; 1: 49-50Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) led to pure (>95% by 1H NMR analysis) disulfides 5a-b, d. The disulfide moiety is often a convenient protecting group, and thiols are easily obtained by the reduction of disulfides. Here, compounds5a-b, d were reduced with sodium borohydride to give pure (>95% by 1H NMR analysis) thiols 4a-b, d. The individual optical isomers, R- andS-thiomandelic acids (15a and 15b), were synthesized by the procedure of Strijtveen and Kellog (48Strijtveen B. Kellog R.M. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 3664-3671Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The ethyl esters 12a and 12b were prepared from the commercially available S- and R-mandelic acids. Methanesulfonates 13a and 13b were then obtained by reacting methanesulfonyl chloride with 12a and12b, respectively. Reaction of these mesylate derivatives with the cesium salt of thioacetic acid led to the thioesters14a and 14b, which were hydrolyzed. However, after 4 days in concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature, only starting material was recovered. Hydrolysis was thus carried out at 50 °C for 12 h to give the desired compounds 15aand 15b in an optical purity of 73–74%. Details of the synthesis and characterization of individual compounds are given in the Supplemental Material.

For the cysteine 158 to alanine mutant of IMP-1 (C158A), the pET9a construct bearing the entireblaIMP gene (6Laraki N. Franceschini N. Rossolini G.M. Santucci P. Meunier C. de Pauw E. Amicosante G.

The C158A enzyme was produced and purified as for the wild-type enzyme (6Laraki N. Franceschini N. Rossolini G.M. Santucci P. Meunier C. de Pauw E. Amicosante G. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 902-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determinations of catalytic activity were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 30 °C using a Uvikon XL (Bio-tek instruments) spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatically controlled cells. Substrate hydrolysis was followed by monitoring the change in absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (nitrocefin for BcII, CfiA, L1, IMP-1, and FEZ-1, Δε482= 17,500 m−1 cm−1; imipenem for IMP-2, BlaB, and CphA, Δε300 = −9000m−1 cm−1; meropenem for VIM-1, Δε297 = −6500 m−1cm−1), and the substrate concentrations used were chosen to be close to the Km value. For the screening of potential inhibitors, nitrocefin (20 μm) was used as a substrate, and the experiments were carried out at a final enzyme (BcII) concentration of 4.8 nm. The compounds to be tested were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 0.1 m and then diluted to 1 mm in the enzyme assay. The presence of 1% ethanol proved to be without effect on the BcII activity (data not shown). Quoted Ki values are derived assuming a competitive pattern of inhibition and plottingv0/vi = f([I]), where v0 is the initial rate in the absence of inhibitor, and vi is the initial rate in the presence of inhibitor. The slope of the resulting straight line is then given by Km /((Km + [S])·Ki ). The specific activity toward the thioesters 3aa and 3ab was also determined spectrophotometrically in the presence of 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (Sigma), a sensitive thiol-specific reagent that has an absorption maximum at 324 nm (ε = 19,800 m−1cm−1) after reaction with two equivalents of thiol (50Grassetti D.R. Murray J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Incubations contained 1 mm thioester, 2.5 mm4,4′-dithiodipyridine (0.1 m stock solutions of both compounds prepared in ethanol) and 0.6 μm BcII in 500 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Subtraction of the side reaction due to the nonenzymatic release of thiol from the thioester in the presence of 4,4′-dithiodipyridine was performed by using a double beam spectrophotometer in which the reference cuvette contained thioester and 4,4′-dithiodipyridine at the same concentration as in the sample cuvette but no enzyme. Control experiments with nitrocefin as substrate demonstrated that the presence of 4,4′-dithiodipyridine at the concentration used did not inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Samples of the inhibitor complexes of the BCII enzyme for NMR spectroscopy were prepared by the addition of microliter volumes of stock inhibitor solution (50 mm in 0.2 m MES buffer, pH 6.4) to a solution of 1.0 mm15N-labeled enzyme in the same buffer. Spectra were acquired at 298 K using Bruker DMX 500-MHz or DRX 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm inverse detection triple resonance probes with z axis gradient. Backbone amide NH resonances were observed using the 1H-15N HSQC experiment with gradient coherence selection and sensitivity enhancement (51Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). The assignment of these resonances by means of triple resonance experiments using2H,13C,15N-labeled enzyme is described elsewhere.3 The effects of inhibitor binding on the amide resonances were analyzed as follows. For each cross-peak in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the free protein, the nearest cross-peak (in terms of 1H and 15N chemical shifts) in the spectrum of the inhibitor complex was identified. The 1H and 15N chemical shift differences, ΔH and ΔN, between each such pair of cross-peaks were measured and used to calculate a “minimum shift index” (52Lian L.-Y. Barsukov I. Golovanov A.

The suggestion that the absence of HpPex14p interfered with pexophagy was further analyzed by mutational analysis. These studies indicated that deletions at the C terminus of up to 124 amino acids of HpPex14p did not affect peroxisome degradation. Conversely, short deletions of the N terminus (31 and 64 amino acids, respectively) of the protein fully impaired pexophagy. Peroxisomes present in these cells remained intact for at least 6 h of incubation in the presence of excess glucose, conditions that led to the rapid turnover of the organelles in wild-type control cells.

Methylotrophic yeast species, also including Candida boidinii and Pichia pastoris, have the advantage that the ultrastructural changes accompanying peroxisome development and degradation are much more pronounced, relative to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also, enhanced numbers of growth substrate-dependent peroxisome functions can be induced compared with bakers' yeast. In H. polymorpha highest peroxisome induction rates are observed during growth of cells on methanol. Under these conditions the organelles may occupy up to 80% of the cytoplasmic volume and are essential for growth as they contain the key enzymes of methanol metabolism, alcohol oxidase (AO),1 catalase, and dihydroxyacetone synthase. These enzymes all possess a C-terminal targeting signal and require the function of the PTS1 import machinery for sorting to peroxisomes (1Hansen H. Didion T. Thiemann A. Veenhuis M. Roggenkamp R.

Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recent data, however, indicate that the protein is not essential for import but most likely enhances the efficiency of the process (4Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Faber K.N. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12603-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peroxisome degradation may occur aselectively during general autophagy (5Bellu A.R. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) or in a selective way, when the organelles have become dysfunctional or, alternatively, redundant for growth. In H. polymorpha the selective degradation process is morphologically characterized by three subsequent steps, namely (i) tagging, followed by sequestration of the organelle to be degraded by multiple membranous layers, (ii) heterotypical fusion of the sequestering membranes with the vacuolar membrane, and (iii) hydrolysis of the organelle contents in the vacuole (6Veenhuis M. Douma A.C. Harder W. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This process, designated macropexophagy, is also observed in another methylotrophic yeast species, P. pastoris (7Tuttle D.L. Lewin A.S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this yeast, but not in H. polymorpha, a second mode of selective degradation is described, specifically induced by glucose, which involves uptake of clusters of peroxisomes by engulfment by the vacuole (micropexophagy). Selective peroxisome degradation has also been described in the yeasts S. cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica (9Gunkel K. van der Klei I.J. Barth G. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, the exact mode of degradation is as yet unknown. Various mutants affected in pexophagy have been isolated from P. pastoris (gsa and pag mutants) (10Yuan W. Tuttle D.L. Shi Y.J. Ralph G.S. Dunn Jr., W.A. J.

Yeast. 1999; 15: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The analysis of the corresponding genes has shown that pexophagy has several components in common with non-selective autophagy, vacuolar protein sorting, endocytosis, and the cytosol-to-vacuole transport pathway in bakers' yeast (16Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15 (., 1–32): 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69 (, 303–342): 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In H. polymorpha pex mutants, peroxisomal remnants are normally susceptible to glucose-induced selective degradation, except for those present in Δpex14 cells (18Veenhuis M. Komori M. Salomons F.A. Hilbrands R.E. Hut H. Baerends R.J.S. Kiel J.A. van der Klei I.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This raised the question whether Pex14p, besides being involved in matrix protein import, could have additional functions in the control of the susceptibility of individual organelles for selective degradation. This aspect was analyzed in cells of constructed mutants that contained peroxisomes that either completely lacked Pex14p or contained truncated forms of this peroxin. The results of this work are included in this paper. All H. polymorpha strains used in this study are derivatives of strain NCYC495 (leu1.1 ura3) (25Gleeson M.A.G. Sudbery P.E. Yeast. 1988; 4: 293-303Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar): Δpex14(leu1.1) (20Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A. Baerends R.J. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M.

H. polymorpha cells were grown in batch cultures at 37 °C on (a) selective minimal medium (YND) containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (DIFCO) supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose, (b) rich medium (YPD) containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 1% (w/v) glucose, or (c) mineral medium (26van Dijken J.P. Otto R. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1976; 111: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (v/v) methanol or a mixture of 0.1% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) methanol as a carbon source, together with 0.25% (w/v) ammonium sulfate as a nitrogen source. When required leucine (30 μg/ml) was added. For analysis of peroxisome degradation, cells were extensively precultivated to the mid-exponential phase on mineral medium with glucose and then shifted to mineral medium containing glycerol + methanol for a period of 16 h to induce peroxisome biogenesis. Subsequently 0.5% glucose was than added to induce selective peroxisome degradation. Escherichia coli DH5α (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pess, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) was used for plasmid construction and was grown on LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out essentially according to Sambrook et al.(27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pess, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Transformation of H. polymorpha was performed by electroporation as described previously (28Faber K.N. Haima P. Harder W. Veenhuis M. AB G. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and biochemicals were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and used as detailed by the manufacturer. Protein sequences were aligned with the program CLUSTALX (29Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). To express WT and truncated forms of PEX14 in Δpex14 cells under control of its endogenous promoter, we first constructed the expression vector pHIPX10, a derivative of pHIPX4-B (20Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A. Baerends R.J. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The PEX14 promoter was isolated by PCR using the PPEX14 primer (5′ GGG GAT CCG GTG AGG AAG AAA AAG AG 3′), the M13/pUC universal primer, and plasmid pBS3.2P14 (20Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A. Baerends R.J. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as template. The PCR fragment was digested withEcoRV and BamHI and inserted between theNotI (blunted) and BamHI sites of plasmid pHIPX4-B thus replacing the alcohol oxidase promoter. To obtain pX10-PEX14-WT we inserted the 1.5-kilobaseBamHI-EcoRV fragment of pPAOXPEX14 (20Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A. Baerends R.J. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) between the BamHI and SacI sites of pHIPX10. Plasmids expressing truncated versions of PEX14 were constructed as follows: pX10-PEX14-ΔC58 was constructed by filling in the EcoRI site in the PEX14 coding region followed by self-ligation. Similarly, pX10-PEX14-ΔC124 was obtained by blunting the PstI site in the PEX14 coding region followed by self-ligation. Plasmids pX10-PEX14-ΔN31 and pX10-PEX14-ΔN64 were constructed by PCR using the N31 primer (5′ AGA GGA TCC ATG GCC AAA AAG GTC GAA TTT C 3′) or the N64 primer (5′ AA GGA TCC ATG TCA CAG CAG TCC GTT GTA 3′) in combination with the M13/pUC sequencing primer and pBS1.3P14 as template. Subsequently, for pX10-PEX14-ΔN31, a BamHI +HindIII-digested PCR fragment was cloned between theBamHI and HindIII sites of pHIPX10. For pX10-PEX14-ΔN64 a BamHI + EcoRV-digested PCR fragment was cloned between the BamHI and SmaI sites of pHIPX10. Plasmids were transformed into H. polymorpha Δpex14 (leu1.1) (20Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A. Baerends R.J. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and produced Pex14p levels similar to those observed in WT cells. Crude extracts using trichloroacetic acid-precipitated H. polymorpha cells were prepared as described (30Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed by established procedures. Proteins on Western blots were detected using a chemiluminescent Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after decoration with polyclonal antibodies against various H. polymorpha proteins. In vivo phosphorylation of HpPex14p was determined as described (31Komori M. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); cells were pregrown on YPD, depleted for phosphate, harvested, and subsequently suspended in the same volume of phosphate-depleted glycerol/methanol medium containing [32P]orthophosphate for 16 h.32P-labeled H. polymorpha Pex14p was recovered from crude extracts by immunoprecipitation, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. Whole cells were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry as detailed before (32Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin section of unicryl-embedded cells, using specific antibodies against various proteins and gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In an initial series of experiments we have analyzed the fate of peroxisomes that had developed in cells of a pex14 deletion strain that overproduced Pex5p (Δpex14::PAOX.PEX5mc), (4Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Faber K.N. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12603-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), after a shift of cells from methanol to glucose-excess conditions. To this end cells were pre-grown on a mixture of glycerol and methanol until an optical density (OD663) of 1.5 before excess glucose (final concentration 0.5%) was added. As described before, glycerol-/methanol-grown Δpex14::PAOX.PEX5mccells contained several well developed peroxisomes (Fig.1 A) that lacked Pex14p but contained the bulk of two key enzymes in methanol utilization, AO and dihydroxyacetone synthase (data not shown), in conjunction with minor amounts of these proteins in the cytosol (4Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Faber K.N. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12603-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses revealed that, upon exposure of such cells to glucose-excess conditions, selective peroxisome degradation (pexophagy) was inhibited. Electron microscopy revealed that after the addition of glucose the initial event in peroxisome degradation, namely sequestration of the organelle to be degraded, was never observed (data not shown). Also, immunocytochemistry failed to demonstrate any AO protein in the vacuole, a typical morphological characteristic of pexophagy, in the same time interval (Fig.1 B). In WT control cells both phenomena were frequently observed (data not shown; see Ref. 6Veenhuis M. Douma A.C. Harder W. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments showed that the amount of Pex10p, an integral component of the peroxisomal membrane, had slightly increased 4 h after addition of glucose to Δpex14::PAOX.PEX5mccells whereas in WT controls this marker protein markedly decreased during this time period (Fig. 2). Taken together these data suggest that the peroxisomes present in Δpex14::PAOX.PEX5mccells were not susceptible to glucose-induced pexophagy. To delineate the region of Pex14p controlling peroxisome turnover, we constructed mutant genes that encoded various truncated Pex14ps and transformed these into aPEX14 deletion strain (Δpex14). These proteins lacked either the initial 31 or 64 N-terminal amino acids (designated ΔN31 and ΔN64, respectively) or the extreme 58 or 124 C-terminal amino acids (designated ΔC58 and ΔC124, respectively). A Δpex14 strain expressing full-length PEX14 was taken as control (designated WT). Cells of these strains were subsequently analyzed for growth on methanol, Pex14p synthesis and location, peroxisome development, and the susceptibility of these organelles to selective degradation. Cells of the various constructed strains were analyzed for their capacity to grow on methanol as the sole source of carbon. As shown in TableI only the WT control and mutant ΔC58 grew normally on methanol at WT rates, whereas the other strains showed no or severely retarded growth. The reason for this became clear from electron microscopy, which revealed that WT and ΔC58 cells displayed normal peroxisomes that were the sole site of AO protein, judged from immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3, Aand B). The three other strains contained several peroxisomes of smaller size (Table I). This most likely reflects the observation that only a portion of AO protein was present in peroxisomes, whereas the remaining portion resided in the cytosol (Fig.3, C and D). However, in these three mutants the amount of AO imported into peroxisomes was substantially higher compared with the residual import in peroxisomal remnants inΔpex14 cells. Because AO is a PTS1 protein, these data indicate that the long (124 amino acids) C-terminal deletion, as well as N-terminal deletions of HpPex14p, affect Pex5p-dependent protein import. We showed before that a minor amount of active cytosolic AO prevents growth of H. polymorpha cells on methanol (19van der Klei I.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cytosolic portion of AO protein in ΔC124, ΔN31, and ΔN64 cells most likely explains the failure of the cells to grow on methanol.Table IPhenotype of PEX14 mutantsStrainPex14p levelPex14p locationGrowth on methanolAO importPhosphorylationPexophagyWT+perox.++++ΔN31+perox.−+/−+−ΔN64+perox.−+/−+−ΔC58+perox.++++ΔC124+perox.−+/−−++, normal; +/−, reduced; −, absent; perox., peroxisomal. Open table in a new tab +, normal; +/−, reduced; −, absent; perox., peroxisomal. Subsequently, all constructed strains were analyzed for the presence of Pex14p by Western blotting, using α-Pex14p antibodies and crude extracts prepared from glycerol-/methanol-grown cells. These experiments revealed that all truncated Pex14ps were normally synthesized and were of the expected mass, judged from their migration pattern in the gel (Fig. 4 A). In these blots Pex14 protein is observed as a double band at ∼47 kDa, of which the upper band represents the phosphorylated state of the protein (20Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A. Baerends R.J. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As evident in Fig. 4 B, normal phosphorylation of Pex14p can also be observed in ΔN64 and ΔC58 cells but not in ΔC124 cells, in which phosphorylation of Pex14p was hardly detectable. This suggests that the putative phosphorylation site(s) of the protein are present within the region of amino acids 228 to 293. The subcellular location of these Pex14p variants was subsequently analyzed biochemically and immunocytochemically. Upon differential centrifugation of homogenized protoplasts, prepared from methanol-induced cells of the various strains, WT and mutant Pex14ps were predominantly found in the 30,000 × g organellar pellets (Fig. 5). This suggests that the proteins are indeed organelle-bound. Immunocytochemically, using α-Pex14p antibodies, the specific labeling was exclusively localized on the peroxisomal membrane (Fig. 6). From this we concluded that all truncated Pex14ps (WT, ΔC58, ΔC124, ΔN31, and ΔN64) were normally synthesized and sorted to the correct target membrane (summarized in Table I).Figure 6Immunocytochemical localization of Pex14p in WT and various mutant cells.

In all cases α-Pex14p-dependent labeling was localized at the membranes of peroxisomal profiles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells of the various strains were grown on glycerol/methanol mixtures and subsequently exposed to glucose-excess conditions. Electron microscopical analysis revealed that in the strain producing full-length Pex14p peroxisomes were normally degraded. A similar phenomenon was observed for ΔC58 and ΔC124 cells. 30 min after addition of glucose the first cells were observed that contained AO protein in the vacuole (Fig. 7), a characteristic feature for selective peroxisome degradation under these conditions (6Veenhuis M. Douma A.C. Harder W. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that the cytosolic portion of AO is not subject to degradation under these conditions (21van der Klei I.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. Yeast. 1991; 7: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and therefore cannot be the source of vacuolar AO protein. The above observations were confirmed by biochemical data. After Western blotting of crude extracts, prepared from the various strains at different time points after the addition of glucose, a rapid decrease in the levels of Pex10p and mutant Pex14ps were observed (Fig.8). Opposite results were obtained in identical experiments, using ΔN31 and ΔN64 cells. In these cells, electron microscopical analysis failed to resolve any sign of peroxisome turnover in the first 4 h after addition of glucose (Fig. 7, C and D), a time interval that is sufficient to remove the bulk of the peroxisomal population in WT control cells. Also, the levels of Pex10p and mutant Pex14p hardly diminished in this period (Fig. 8). From this we conclude that the N-terminal deletions of Pex14p prevent glucose-induced pexophagy inH. polymorpha. In this paper we have provided evidence that the H. polymorpha PEX14 gene product (HpPex14p) plays a role in the selective degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy). We showed that considerable portions of the C terminus of the protein could be deleted without affecting PTS1 protein import (ΔC58 cells) and pexophagy (ΔC58 and ΔC124 cells). In contrast, deletion of the first 31 N-terminal amino acids affected both peroxisome biogenesis (by reducing the rate of PTS1 protein import) and selective peroxisome degradation (pexophagy). The general function of Pex14p in PTS1 and PTS2 matrix protein import as a component of the docking site for the cytosolic receptors of the PTS1 and PTS2 targeting signals was demonstrated before (3Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Very recently, we showed, however, that in H. polymorpha Pex14p most likely is not essential for PTS1 protein import but enhances the efficiency of this process (4Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Faber K.N. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12603-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our current data imply that Pex14p may have multiple roles and functions in both the biogenesis and selective degradation of the organelle. This mode of controlling peroxisome biogenesis versus degradation (homeostasis) in one “switch” has obvious physiological advantages in that it enables the cell to rapidly adapt peroxisome numbers and function upon changes in the environment. This is particularly important in methanol-grown H. polymorpha cells, in which specific organelles have become dysfunctional through, e.g.chemically induced damage of their membrane (22Sepulveda S.J. van der Klei I.J. Keizer I. Lopez A.P. Harder W. Veenhuis M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 91: 207-212Crossref Google Scholar) resulting in the leakage of matrix proteins into the cytosol. It has been shown before that the presence of only minor amounts of enzymatically active AO protein in the cytosol prevents growth of cells on methanol because of the major energetic disadvantages related to cytosolic hydrogen peroxide metabolism (19van der Klei I.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In H. polymorpha pexophagy is a remarkable fast process; individual organelles can be degraded within a time interval of 15 min. Thus, a molecular switch controlling organelle homeostasis (both biogenesis and degradation) allows taking rapid decisions and consequently, may be of great value as a component in the control of cell viability. In surface plasmon resonance analyses Schliebs and colleagues (23Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the N terminus of human Pex14p could efficiently bind to the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p . This indicates that the N terminus of the protein may be a prime target for the PTS1 receptor-cargo complex. These data are in line with our observations that N-terminal deletions of both 31 or 64 amino acids resulted in a partial AO protein-import defect. However, the same stretch of N-terminal amino acids also appears to control pexophagy. The mechanisms on how the discrimination is made between these functions of HpPex14p are still largely speculative. One possible option is that this may be related to conformational changes of HpPex14p, for instance by oligomerization from monomers to dimers or even by alteration of the location of the N terminus of Pex14p from inside to outside the organellar matrix. On the topology of Pex14p in yeast nothing is known yet; only for human Pex14p has evidence been presented that the N terminus of the protein is (at least in part) exposed to the lumen of the organelle (24Will G.K. Soukupova M. Hong X. Erdmann K.S. Kiel J.A.K.W. Dodt G. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2265-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our experiments strongly suggest that modification of the protein by phosphorylation is most likely not discriminative in this respect. Sequence comparison of the various Pex14ps currently available, reveals that the similarity predominantly resides in the N-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 9). This similarity becomes even stronger when only the proteins of the methylotrophic yeast species H. polymorpha and P. pastoris are compared. We have now initiated further studies to analyze the significance of the conserved residues in peroxisome homeostasis in depth.

Frutiger F. Hughes G.J. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). P48 is the acinar cell-specific component of the PTF1 complex that binds many, if not all, of the promoters of the genes that encode the pancreatic digestive enzymes (2Cockell M. Stevenson B.J. Strubin M. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The PTF1 complex contains two additional bHLH proteins (3Krapp A. Knofler M.

Cell. 1991; 67: 987-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). P48 is required for the formation of pancreatic acinar and ductal cells; neonatal mice with both Ptf1-p48 alleles inactivated lack all exocrine tissue, although islet-like endocrine cell clusters still form (3Krapp A.

PDX1 is a HOX-like homeoprotein present selectively in the pancreas and rostral duodenum (6Wright C.V.E. Schnegelsberg P. De Robertis E.M. Development. 1988; 104: 787-794Google Scholar, 7Ohlsson H.

As a member of the Antennepedia class of homeodomain proteins, PDX1 contains the characteristic pentapeptide motif just amino-terminal to the homeodomain and forms heterodimers with PBX members of the TALE class of homeodomain proteins (18Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The interaction between PDX1 and PBX appears to be required for the normal expansion of the endocrine and exocrine compartments during pancreogenesis (20Datta S. Gannon M. Peers B. Wright C. Bonner-Weir S. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, PDX1 binds and participates in the activation of the elastase I gene (ELA1) enhancer as part of a trimeric complex with PBX1b and MEIS2, another TALE-class homeoprotein (19Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,21Liu Y. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17985-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ELA1 enhancer is a simple model for the control of pancreatic acinar cell-specific transcription. The minimal enhancer resides 100–200 bp upstream of the 5′ end of ELA1 and comprises just three functional elements (A, B, and C). The acinar cell activity of the enhancer resides in the A element, which is the binding site for PTF1. A homomultimeric repeat of the A element directs transgene transcription to pancreatic acinar cells of mice (22Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Within the context of the enhancer, however, the single A element requires the cooperation of either the B or the C element (23Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In acinar cells the B element binds the trimeric complex of PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2 (19Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17985-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The action of the B element within the context of the enhancer requires the homeoprotein complex, because mutations that eliminate binding of the complete trimer without affecting PDX1 binding block the activity of the B element. In this report we show that the actions of PTF1-P48 and PDX1 converge at the transcriptional enhancer of the acinar cell-specific ELA1 gene. The cooperative interaction of these two pancreatic factors can be recapitulated in a non-pancreatic cell line. Introduction of P48 and HEB into HeLa cells allows the formation of a bHLH complex that cooperates with the PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2b complex to activate transcription through an ELA1 minienhancer. To begin understanding the acinar specificity of Ptf1-p48, we also demonstrate that the 5′-flanking region of the mouse gene contains much of the regulatory information for acinar cell-specific transcription. RNA was isolated from cell lines and mouse tissues using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions, except that RNA from pancreas tissue was isolated by the procedure of Chirgwin et al. (24Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 24: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Conservative dissection protocols were devised to prevent pancreatic contamination of other dissected organs. RNase protection assays were performed with an Ambion RPAIII kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (19Swift G.H. Liu Y.

To help ensure the loading of equivalent amounts of protein, the protein concentrations of cell and tissue lysates were quantified by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad) and the relative amounts and quality were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells by a modification of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) as described (26Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from murine organs were prepared as described by Rose et al. (22Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as described by Sawada and Littman (27Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5620-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with 40 fm of a32P-labeled, 21-bp, double-stranded oligonucleotide (sense strand, 5′-GTCACCTGTGCTTTTCCCTGC-3′) spanning the A element of the ELA1 enhancer. For antibody supershift EMSA, 1 or 2 μl of antisera or immunoglobulin solution, optimized for each antibody, was preincubated with the nuclear extract and the mixture then added to the binding reactions. The rabbit antiserum against PTF1-P48 was raised for us by AnaSpec (San Jose, CA) against a synthetic amino acid peptide (C-KSFDNIENEPPFEFVS) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of mouse and rat P48. For immunization the peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through a cysteine included as the amino terminus of the peptide. Anti-HEB serum was the gracious gift of Dr. S. Sawada (27Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5620-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), anti-E2.2 was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and anti-E12/47 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In vitro translated proteins were synthesized with the TNT kit from Promega, Inc. (Madison, WI). The p48 cDNA was constructed by gene splicing by overlap extension (28Horton, R. M., Cai, Z. L., Ho, S. N., and Pease, L. R. (1990) BioTechniques 528–535.Google Scholar) of the two exons from the genomic DNA and incorporated the Xenopusβ-globin 5′-untranslated leader (29Falcone D. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The p48 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) containing the CMV enhancer/promoter. Dr. R. Baer provided the HEB cDNA (27Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5620-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The translation in vitro of PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2b has been described (21Liu Y. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol.

AF298116) and the rat PTF1-p48 gene from −5198 to −545 (GenBank™ accession no. AY043285), which extends the sequence from Knofler et al. (Ref. 31Knofler M. Krapp A. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. J.

A search of the human genome data bases with the nucleotide sequence of the mouse p48 mRNA identified a single locus (GA x2HTBKPJG32 from Celera (Ref. 32Venter J.C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1305-1351Crossref Scopus (10634) Google Scholar) and NT 024073.2 from the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (Ref. 33International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17821) Google Scholar)) containing the human p48orthologue. The human gene maps to 10p12 at ∼22 Mb. An open reading frame encoding 328 amino acids has 92 and 89% sequence identity with the mouse and rat protein sequences, respectively (the mouse and rat proteins are 97% identical), and is divided into two exons at the same site as the mouse and rat genes. The Celera and NCBI sequences for the 10-kb proximal 5′-gene flanking region differ by only 21 bp; none of the differences occur in the blocks conserved in the distal regulatory region among the rat, mouse, and human genes. Pairwise comparisons between the 5-kb proximal 5′ regions of the mouse, rat and human genes using the Bayesian Phylogenetic Footprint program (34Wasserman W.W. Palumbo M. Thompson W. Fickett J.W. Lawrence C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (www.wadsworth.org) identified three domains with high concentrations of conserved sequence blocks. Potential binding sites for known transcription factors were identified in the conserved domains using MatInspector Pro (35Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T.

A variety of acinar and insulinoma pancreatic tumor cell lines were used to distinguish transcriptional regulation between pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells. 266-6 (ATCC CRL-2151) is a differentiated acinar cell line derived from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma induced in a transgenic mouse line expressing an elastase-T-antigen fusion transgene (36Ornitz D.M.

Fordis C.M. Howard B.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3959-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fragments of the 5′ flanking region were linked to a lacZ reporter gene by standard recombinant techniques. The common fusion site at +211 of the p48 gene is a naturally occurring SfiI site 13 nucleotides upstream of the p48 initiator codon. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed with a Tropix Galacto-Light Plus kit. HeLa cells were transfected with Fugene (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The P48 expression plasmid is described above in the section detailing the EMSA protocols. The expression plasmids for PDX1, PBX1b, MEIS2b, and HEB have been described (21Liu Y. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17985-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All expression plasmids were based on pcDNA-3.1 or -1.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and driven by the CMV enhancer/promoter. The p48-hGH fusion transgene contained a 12.7-kb fragment of the p48 gene spanning from a NotI site at −12.5 kilobase pairs to the SfiI site at +211 bp fused to a 2.7-kb hGH reporter gene at +3. The 210 nucleotides of p48 transcribed region included in the transgene contained only untranslated sequence; the hGH reporter gene contained all introns and the five exons plus 0.5 kilobase pair of 3′ flanking DNA. A fragment containing the fusion transgene devoid of plasmid vector sequences was isolated and injected into fertilized mouse eggs to create transgenic mice as described previously (42Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1984; 38: 639-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Pancreatic tissue was fixed in Carnoy's fixative, embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 μm) onto polylysine-coated slides for immunolocalization of hGH. Rabbit anti-hGH antibody (Dako) was diluted 1:500. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, streptavidin-peroxidase, and AEC chromogen were from a Zymed Laboratories Inc. Histostain Plus kit and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 21-bp, acinar cell-specific A element of the ELA1 enhancer comprises an E-box characteristic of bHLH-binding proteins and a TC-box (Fig.1 A). Nuclear extracts from either rat pancreas or pancreatic acinar cell lines form a major acinar cell-specific complex on the A element (a doublet labeled PTF1, Fig.1 B) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutations in the TC-box or the E-box that disrupt this binding (Fig. 1 B) concomitantly abolish the transcriptional activity of the A element in transfected acinar cell lines (22Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Rose S.D. MacDonald R.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the E- and TC-boxes are required for binding the A-element complex and for the activity of the A-element in vivo. Wellauer and colleagues (2Cockell M. Stevenson B.J. Strubin M. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) originally described the acinar cell-specific binding activity termed PTF1, which binds the ELA1 A element and related elements containing E- and TC-boxes in the promoter regions of amylase and other pancreatic acinar cell-specific genes. PTF1 is a multisubunit bHLH complex containing a 48-kDa, pancreatic, acinar cell-specific bHLH protein called P48 (1Krapp A. Knofler M. Frutiger F. Hughes G.J. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To verify that the A-element gel shift complex is PTF1, we prepared an antiserum against a 16-residue peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal sequence identical in rat and mouse P48s. The P48 antiserum supershifted the PTF1 doublet (Fig. 1 C). To identify the bHLH partner(s) of P48 in the rat PTF1 complex, we examined the effect of antisera against the common (type A) bHLH proteins on formation of the complex. Antisera against HEB/REB 4PAN2 is the rat splice variant (50Nelson C. Shen L.-P. Meister A. Fodor E. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) equivalent to E12 of the human TCF3 gene (also known as E2A) (HomoloGene Hs.101047). HEB (46Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (also known as HTF4 (Ref. 51Zhang Y. Babin J. Feldhaus A.L. Singh H. Sharp P.A. Bina M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 25: 4555Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) is the human orthologue of TCF12; the rat orthologue is known as rat HTF4, SCBPA (52Lin H.H. Li W.Y. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10214-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and REB (53Klein E.S. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (HomoloGene Hs.21704). E2.2 (TCF4) is the third type A bHLH factor (HomoloGene Hs.192117). or PAN2/E124 supershifted a fraction of the total rat PTF1 complex, whereas anti-E2.2 had no effect. In other experiments with a different preparation of pancreatic nuclear extract, virtually all of the PTF1 was shifted by the anti-HEB antisera (data not shown); therefore, REB/HEB is the major type A bHLH protein in the rat PTF1 complex, with a small fraction of the complex containing PAN2/E12. In vitro translated P48 together with either HEB/REB or PAN2/E12 formed a complex that bound the A element (Fig.1 D). The electrophoretic mobilities of the P48-HEB and P48-PAN2/E12 complexes, however, were slightly greater than that of the PTF1 complex from pancreatic nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 D,middle panel). Binding reactions containing all three in vitro translated bHLH proteins formed the same two bands (one containing the HEB dimer and the other P48-HEB plus P48-PAN2) but no higher order complex (Fig. 1 D). Although PTF1 binding required both the E- and TC-boxes (Fig. 1 B), the P48-HEB and P48-PAN2 complexes required only the E-box (Fig.1 D, right panel). Therefore, under these conditions P48 and either HEB or E12 do not reconstitute a complex with the same DNA binding specificity or mobility as PTF1. Consequently, it appears that the natural PTF1 may contain an additional protein (or modified form of HEB or E12) that not only mediates binding to the TC-box but also imposes the need for a TC-box for PTF1 binding to DNA. The A element is active in pancreatic acinar cells in situ and acinar cell lines in culture, but it is inactive in pancreatic endocrine cells and non-pancreatic cells (22Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).p48 mRNA is present in all three independently derived pancreatic acinar cell lines examined and absent from both pancreatic β-cell lines (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the P48 protein has a similar distribution; it is present in acinar lines and absent from β-cell lines, a pancreatic ductal line (AR4-IP), and non-pancreatic cell lines such as Rat2 fibroblasts (Fig.2 B). The endogenous ELA1 genes as well as transgenes driven by multimers of the elastase A element are expressed in the stomach and parts of the intestine as well as the pancreas (22Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activity of the A element might be mediated by a P48-bHLH complex in each of these organs, we examined the distribution of p48 mRNA and protein. p48 mRNA was detected at moderate levels in total RNA preparations of mouse pancreas, which expresses high levels of elastase and the other acinar digestive enzymes, and at much lower levels in stomach and duodenum (Fig. 2 C), which express ∼100-fold lower levels of the acinar enzymes (22Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Davis B.P. Messing A. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26070-26077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p48 mRNA was absent from all other organs tested. The presence of P48 protein in pancreas and stomach was confirmed by Western analysis of nuclear extracts of these tissues (Fig. 2 D). These results are consistent with the role of P48 in the high level expression of elastase I, amylase, and other secretory enzymes in the pancreas and lower expression of these enzymes in the stomach and intestine (22Rose S.D.

To test whether the P48·HEB complex can cooperate with the PDX1 homeodomain complex, we have examined the ability of exogenously expressed P48 and PDX1 to activate a transfected reporter gene controlled by a tandem combination of the A and B elements in HeLa cells. The synthetic BA enhancer is inactive when transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 3), as expected because HeLa has neither P48 nor PDX1. Co-expression of P48 and its HEB partner had no discernible effect on the activity of the BA construct (Fig. 3). PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2b together increased the expression of the reporter gene 4-fold, consistent with the ability of the trimer to activate a homomultimeric repeat of the B element (21Liu Y. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17985-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Co-expression of both the P48-HEB and the PDX1-PBX1b-MEIS2 complexes increased expression of the BA construct 7-fold. The intermediate level of activity with the PDX1 trimer plus P48 but without exogenous HEB is likely the result of the presence of endogenous HEB in HeLa cells (46Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The cooperative activation required the presence of the bHLH binding site of the A element (data not shown). These results demonstrate cooperation between the P48-bHLH and the PDX1-homeodomain complexes on a control region that contains binding sites for both. Because the restricted expression of P48 protein appears to be responsible, in turn, for the cell-type and stage-restricted transcription of ELA1 and other acinar cell-specific genes, we analyzed the transcripti"

To define the nature of the “dominant negative” effect of the PS1 aspartate variants, we stably expressed PS1 harboring aspartate to alanine substitutions at codons 257 (D257A) or 385 (D385A), singly or in combination (D257A/D385A), in mouse neuroblastoma, N2a cells. Expression of the PS1 aspartate variants resulted in marked accumulation of intracellular and cell surface APP C-terminal fragments. While expression of the D385A PS1 variant reduced the levels of secreted Aβ peptides, we now show that neither the PS1 D257A nor D257A/D385A variants impair Aβ production. Surprisingly, the stability of both immature and mature forms of APP is dramatically elevated in cells expressing PS1 aspartate variants, commensurate with an increase in the cell surface levels of APP. These findings lead us to conclude that the stability and trafficking of APP can be profoundly modulated by coexpression of PS1 with mutations at aspartate 257 and aspartate 385.

Several lines of evidence, however, have lent strong support for the view that the PS1 and PS2 play an essential role in γ-secretase processing of APP and the signaling receptor, Notch 1. First, cells with genetic ablations of PS1 andPS2 do not exhibit γ-secretase activity (20Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat.

These observations have led to the suggestion that PS1 plays an indirect role in modulating γ-secretase activity, perhaps by affecting folding or trafficking of γ-secretase or its substrates. Supporting this notion are the observation that trafficking of APP, the tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkB, and the PS1-interacting protein, ICAM-5/telencephalin, are markedly affected in PS1-deficient neurons (51Naruse S.

While expression of the D385A PS1 variant reduced the levels of secreted Aβ peptides, we now show that neither the PS1 D257A nor D257A/D385A variants impair Aβ production. Surprisingly, the stability of both immature and mature forms of APP is dramatically elevated in cells expressing PS1 aspartate variants, commensurate with an increase in the cell surface levels of APP. These studies reveal an unpredicted activity of presenilin aspartate variants in the stability and trafficking of APP.DISCUSSIONA variety of genetic and biochemical studies have supported the conclusion that presenilins are γ-secretase, an activity responsible for intramembraneous processing of APP, Notch 1, and other transmembrane proteins (for a review, see Ref. 62Haass C. De Strooper B. Science. 1999; 286: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). An important contribution to these latter conclusions was the demonstration that expression of PS1 harboring alanine substitutions of two highly conserved aspartate residues at position 257 or 385 in Chinese hamster ovary cells led to reduced Aβ secretion and accumulation of APP CTFs (27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Because these aspartate residues are thought to reside within TM6 and TM7, respectively, it has been proposed that PS1 and PS2 are unusual transmembrane diaspartyl proteases that catalyze intramembraneous proteolysis of APP (27Wolfe M.S.

While the notion that PS are novel aspartyl proteases is attractive, there is currently no evidence that PS1 or PS2 exhibits proteolytic activity. Moreover, it does not seem obvious how the transmembrane aspartate 257 and aspartate 385 could catalyze proteolysis of APP near the middle of the bilayer (to generate Aβ40/42) and also process Notch 1 near the C terminus of the transmembrane segment. In this regard, intramembraneous processing of Notch occurs at a single site and has strict sequence requirements surrounding the scissile bond (50Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), whereas γ-secretase generates Aβ peptides with heterogenous C terminus, and the production of these species are largely insensitive to the sequence of the transmembrane domain (63Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent reports indicate that a peptide corresponding to “APP CTFγ” that is generated in vitroin cytosol-free membranes and detected in vivo is generated by proteolysis between the 21st (leucine 645) and 22nd (valine 646) amino acids of the 24-amino acid APP TM domain (64Sastre M.

Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Finally, and in view of the nonoverlapping subcellular distributions of PS and the sites of Aβ/NICD production (termed the “spatial paradox” (42Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. St. George-Hyslop P. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 44Cupers P. Bentahir M. Craessaerts K. Orlans I. Vanderstichele H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)), it is conceivable that PS plays an indirect role in facilitating intramembraneous processing by influencing the trafficking of γ-secretase or its substrates to compartments in which proteolysis occurs.Intrigued with the observation that mutant PS1 with substitution of two aspartate residues affect APP processing in a manner that reduces Aβ peptides, we asked whether these variants might influence the trafficking of APP or CTFs. In this report, we offer several important insights into the role of the PS1 Asp → Ala variants on APP trafficking and Aβ production.First, we reproduce the observation of Wolfe et al. (27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar) by showing that PS1 with a D385A substitution impairs secretion of Aβ peptides. However, we show that expression of the D257A aspartate mutant PS1 leads to the accumulation of APP CTFs, but this is not commensurate with a decrease in levels of Aβ peptides. While the latter observation is inconsistent with the report by Wolfe et al. (27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar), Capell et al. (59Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have previously reported that human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing D257A PS1 or a naturally occurring splice variant PS1ΔE8 in which aspartate 257 is substituted with alanine does not impair Aβ secretion. These findings have been confirmed by Morihara et al. (68Morihara T. Katayama T. Sato N. Yoneda T. Manabe T. Hitomi J. Abe H. Imaizumi K. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in N2a cells. At present, the discrepancies between the data obtained by Wolfeet al. (27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar) and others (see Refs. 59Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G.

Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; this report) have not been resolved. More importantly, we demonstrate that PS1 variants with substitutions of both aspartates 257 and 385 also fail to impair production of Aβ peptides despite the accumulation of APP CTFs. Thus, we argue that the conclusion that the transmembrane aspartates of PS1 are critical for catalysis within the APP transmembrane domain should be revised. Second, we now provide the entirely unexpected observation that PS1 aspartate variants have profound effects on APP trafficking. We show that in comparison with cells expressing wild type PS1, the half-life of full-length APP and the steady-state levels of APP on the plasma membrane of cells expressing any of the PS1 aspartate variants are markedly elevated. Moreover, the APP CTFs also accumulate on the plasma membrane of these cells, as has been previously reported (59Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). While the mechanism(s) underlying these fascinating observations remain to be determined, these studies support our earlier demonstration that the trafficking of a limited set of membrane proteins is significantly affected inPS1-deficient neurons. In these cells, the rate of secretion of APPsα is quantitatively increased, and APLP1 CTFs also accumulate. Moreover, the rate of acquisition and steady-state levels of complex oligosaccharide modifications of TrkB, the tyrosine kinase receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, are diminished in PS1-deficient neurons (51Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1213-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, the trafficking of a cell adhesion molecule, termed ICAM-5 or telencephalin (69Hayflick J.S. Kilgannon P. Gallatin W.M. Immunol. Res. 1998; 17: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), to the plasma membrane is abolished in PS1-deficient neurons (42Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. St. George-Hyslop P. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that SPE-4, a divergent member of the presenilin family in C. elegans, is required for proper localization of macromolecules that are subject to asymmetric partitioning during spermatogenesis (70Arduengo P.M. Appleberry O.K. Chuang P. L'Hernault S.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism(s) by which the aspartate 257 and aspartate 385 residues of PS1 regulate intramembraneous proteolysis and trafficking of APP and APP CTFs has not been determined. However, expression of PS1 with a deletion of the first two transmembrane domains (ΔTM1,2) also inhibits Aβ production (71Murphy M.P. Uljon S.N. Fraser P.E. Fauq A. Lookingbill H.A. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Lewis P.A. McLendon D.C. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26277-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), indicating that alterations of PS1 structure at sites relatively distant from the hypothesized “active” site aspartate residues can have an apparently dominant negative effect on γ-secretase activity. Moreover, the observation that expression of the PS1 aspartate mutants reduces the size of the PS1 complex (72Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D.M. Milman P. Fraser P.E. Haass C. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the aspartates are critical for assembly of the functional γ-secretase complex rather than for promoting catalysis, per se. Collectively, these data suggest that PS1 has a multiplicity of roles in regulating membrane trafficking and mediating intramembraneous proteolysis. Clarification of these enigmatic features of PS1 function will require the isolation and characterization of the constituents of PS1 “complex,” reconstitution of the γ-secretase reaction in vitro, and the development of cell biological strategies to assess the precise role of PS1 in the trafficking of selected membrane proteins. Mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1)1 and presenilin 2 (PS2) cause the autosomal dominant form of familial Alzheimer's disease. PS1 and PS2 are highly homologous proteins with eight transmembrane domains (1Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J. Seeger M. Gandy S.E. Price D.L.

We have cloned a gene,TgSUB1, encoding for a subtilisin-type serine protease found in T. gondii tachyzoites. TgSUB1 protein is homologous to other Apicomplexan and bacterial subtilisins and is processed within the secretory pathway of the parasite. Initial cleavage occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, after which the protein is transported to micronemes, vesicles that secrete early during host cell invasion. Upon stimulation of microneme secretion, TgSUB1 is cleaved into smaller products that are secreted from the parasite.

Although most cases of toxoplasmosis are asymptomatic, primary infection in the developing fetus and reactivation in immunocompromised hosts, particularly AIDS patients and transplant recipients, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Because there are limited numbers of effective anti-toxoplasma antibiotics and human intolerance to some of these agents, there is an acute need for identification of novel drug targets for treating toxoplasmosis. T. gondii has been studied as a model organism for other human and veterinary Apicomplexan pathogens, includingPlasmodium, the agent of malaria,Cryptosporidium, Neospora, and Eimeria(1Boothroyd J.C. Black M. Bonnefoy S. Hehl A. Knoll L.J. Manger I.D. Ortega-Barria E. Tomavo S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). T. gondii is easily cultured in vitro, and genetic techniques in T. gondii are well established. Particular interest has focused upon the functions of the three main secretory organelles: micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. During host cell invasion, these secrete in a temporally regulated fashion during formation and maturation of the parasitophorous vacuole (2Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Gliding motility, mediated through the parasite myosin and actin cytoskeleton, is a requirement for invasion (3Dobrowolski J.M. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Several secreted proteins have been cloned from T. gondii, but little is known about their role in host cell invasion. Proteolytic processing has been shown to play a role in invasion by Apicomplexan parasites. Protease inhibitors can block invasion byT. gondii (4Conseil V. Soete M. Dubremetz J.F. Antimicrob.

In addition, antibodies that block processing of the Plasmodiumsurface protein merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) also inhibit invasion (10Blackman M.J. Heidrich H.G. Donachie S. McBride J.S.

Although there are species differences, these studies strongly implicate serine and cysteine proteases in Apicomplexan invasion. However, the identity of the protease(s) responsible has not been elucidated, making further progress in this area difficult. Two subtilisin-type serine proteases have been cloned fromPlasmodium falciparum (11Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol.

PfSUB1 is localized to dense granules in the apical domain and is autocatalytically processed at two sites within the N-terminal pro domain with a cleavage specificity of VXXD (14Sajid M. Withers-Martinez C. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PfSUB2 is also localized apically and is proteolytically processed although the processing site is not known (12Barale J.C. Blisnick T. Fujioka H. Alzari P.M. Aikawa M. Braun-Breton C. Langsley G.

The physiological substrates for these proteases are unknown, but they are both hypothesized to be involved in invasion by the merozoite form of the parasite. Studies in Plasmodium have been hampered by the difficulty of genetic manipulation and the strong AT codon bias making expression in heterologous systems problematic. A subtilisin protease NcSUB1 has also been cloned from Neospora caninum, but its processing and localization have not been reported (15Louie K. Conrad P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Many T. gondii secreted proteins are proteolytically processed either during transit to maturing organelles or coincident with secretion. Proteins processed within the secretory pathway include microneme proteins MIC3 (16Garcia-Reguet N. Lebrun M. Fourmaux M.N. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Mann T. Beckers C.J. Samyn B. Van Beeumen J. Bout D.

Processing of parasite-secreted proteins is therefore likely to be important for successful host cell invasion by Apicomplexan parasites. Although there has been more description of proteolytic processing forT. gondii parasite proteins than for any other member of the phylum Apicomplexa, there have been no prior published reports on the molecular identification of proteolytic enzymes in this organism. Recent studies have identified T. gondii proteins that are trafficked as complexes to micronemes and act as potential bridges between the host and parasite during invasion (26Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 27Reiss M. Viebig N. Brecht S. Fourmaux M.N. Soete M. Di Cristina M. Dubremetz J.F. Soldati D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As invasion progresses, these proteins are proteolytically cleaved and shed from the parasite as it enters the host cell (24Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We now report the cloning and characterization of TgSUB1, a microneme subtilisin-like serine protease that is a candidate mediator of microneme protein processing. Tachyzoites of the RH strain were maintained by serial passage onto confluent human foreskin fibroblast monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were cultured at 37° in a 5% CO2atmosphere. The NCBI BLAST data base dbEST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) was searched using the tBLASTn algorithm with the predicted catalytic domain of PfSUB1 sequence (amino acids 370–624), and the T. gondii EST data base (ParaDB.cis.upenn.edu/toxo/index.html) was searched using the Prosite motif search for subtilase. One clone from the T. gondiitachyzoite cDNA library (TgESTzy93h10.r1, GenBankTMaccession number W66076) with significant homology was identified and obtained from Genome Systems (now Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). A polymerase chain reaction product from primers KK217 (GTACGCGACAGGTCAGAGAG) and KK219 (GCATACTCGACGCAGCGTT), based upon the EST sequence, was used to screen a λZAPII cDNA library from T. gondii RH strain (a gift of J. Ajioka, University of Cambridge). Colony hybridization procedures have been described previously (28Qin C.L. Tang J. Kim K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The longest clone contained 2241 bp of coding sequence, a predicted subtilisin catalytic domain, and 3′ sequence but did not contain a start codon. To obtain the 5′ coding sequence, additional clones were generated using SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with gene-specific primers KK326 (CGTCCACATGCCCGTTCAGCTCCTTTACA) and KK327 (ACCGTTGTTCGCCGTCCGCACCAC). A composite full-length version ofTgSUB1 was generated using consensus sequence from the 5′ RACE products and cDNA clones (GenBankTM accession number AY043483). Parasite lysates or subcellular fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes. Protein lysates from 2 × 106 T. gondii tachyzoites, 2 × 106 Eimeria tenella merozoites (a gift of M. White, Montana State University), 5 × 106 N. caninum tachyzoites (a gift of L. Weiss, Albert Einstein College of Medicine), or 2 × 105 Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (a gift of G. Widmer, Tufts University) were resolved by SDS-PAGE for cross-species Western blotting. Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween. Production of a rabbit antiserum to P. falciparum PfSUB1 (RαPfSUB1) has been previously reported (11Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RαPfSUB1 antiserum is a rabbit polyclonal serum containing antibodies to a fusion of glutathioneS-transferase with the PfSUB1 central catalytic domain and was used at 1:5000 dilution. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was diluted 1:10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk, 0.05% Tween. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using the Pierce SuperSignal® kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly lysed tachyzoites were harvested, filtered through Nucleopore® 3-μm filters (VWR Scientific Products, Bridgeport, NJ), and resuspended in methionine-free medium. For protease inhibitor experiments, parasites were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature after drug addition. 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN, Irvine, CA) was added in 10 μl, and parasites were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. For pulse-chase experiments, parasites were washed and resuspended in medium containing 5 mm methionine and 5 mmcysteine for the remainder of the chase. Parasites were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton ×100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 10 μmpepstatin A , 10 μm E-64, 100 μm bestatin) and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Lysates were precleared with Protein G before antibody addition. Protein G-agarose beads were added and washed extensively with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Protein was eluted from the beads using 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue), boiled, and run on SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, dried under vacuum, and exposed to film for autoradiography. Freshly lysed RH β1 strain tachyzoites stably expressing cytoplasmic β-galactosidase were syringe-released, purified though a 3-μm filter, and resuspended in invasion medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES, 3% fetal bovine serum). Aliquots were induced to secrete by the addition of 0.4 μmA23187 in the absence or presence of 100 μm BAPTA-AM. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and soluble ESA were collected. Western blotting with anti-β-galactosidase showed less than 1% inadvertent parasite lysis (data not shown). Microneme organelle contents were enriched as described (26Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) from T. gondii extracellular tachyzoites. ESA, microneme, and control samples were identical to those previously reported (17Brydges S.D. Sherman G.D. Nockemann S. Loyens A. Daubener W. Dubremetz J. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional-gel electrophoresis was performed using the Bio-Rad Protean®/Criterion® system according to the manufacturer's instructions. ESA from ∼6 × 109 tachyzoites (∼200 μg of protein) were separated in the first dimension on each of two pH 3–10 ReadyStrip®IPG strips, reduced with dithiothreitol and carboxymethylated with iodoacetic acid, and separate in the second dimension on 10–20% Criterion® SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins in one gel were electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for chemiluminescence Western blotting (29Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with RαPfSUB1 (1:10,000). Proteins in the other gel were electro-transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Spots corresponding to TgSUB1 were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation at the University of Texas at Austin Protein Microanalysis Facility. Extracellular tachyzoites were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in LR White resin (London Resin Co.). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E and placed onto nickel grids. Grids were wet with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween, 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibody (RαPfSUB1 1:1000, monoclonal antibody T34A11 (MαMIC2) 1:100 (a gift of J. F. Dubremetz, Pasteur Institute, Lille, France) and/or monoclonal antibody Tg17.43 (MαGRA1) 1:50 (a gift of L. Weiss, Albert Einstein College of Medicine)) in blocking solution. After washing with blocking solution, grids were incubated with secondary antibody (GαR IgG coupled to 15-nm gold beads 1:20 and/or GαM IgG coupled to 5- or 10-nm gold beads 1:20, Polysciences, Inc.), washed, and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde. Grids were stained with 4% uranyl acetate in 40% ethanol and 0.1% lead citrate. Samples were viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Analytical Imaging Facility. To identify subtilisin-like serine proteases in T. gondii, BLAST and motif searches were performed using the publicly available T. gondii EST data base (ParaDB.cis.upenn.edu/toxo/index.html). The sequences surrounding the catalytic aspartic acid, histidine, and serine residues are highly conserved in subtilisin proteases and can be used to predict catalytic function and inclusion in this class of proteins (30Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). A single sequence of 432 nucleotides from ME49 tachyzoite ESTs (TgESTzy93h10.r1) was identified with significant homology to subtilases. A polymerase chain reaction product based upon this EST was used as a probe to screen an RH strain tachyzoite cDNA library, and 9 clones were isolated. The longest of these contained an open reading frame of 2241 nucleotides but was truncated at the 5′ end and did not contain the start codon. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones did not reveal any evidence of alternative splicing. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using two gene-specific primers yielded products containing identical sequence at the 5′ end of the gene. The consensus sequence from 5′ RACE and cDNA clones was used to generate a composite gene sequence containing the complete open reading frame, namedTgSUB1 (Fig. 1). TheTgSUB1 gene predicts a protein product of 795 amino acids with a molecular mass of 84916 Da and pI of 5.15 (Fig.2). There is a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site after Gly23. Blast search of the deduced protein sequence revealed significant similarity to other known subtilases, particularly in the regions surrounding the catalytic triad residues Asp259, His315, and Ser490and the oxyanion hole residue Asn407. The C terminus of the protein contains a proline-rich region 5 consecutive repeats of a degenerate 11 amino acid motif (TPP(S/C)APSP(P/S)P(P/R)). A similar type of proline-rich region is also found in the NcSUB1 protein (15Louie K. Conrad P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although the primary sequence and length of the repeat differ significantly. There is no predicted transmembrane domain, although there is a potential glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition site at Ser769 (31Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted catalytic domain of TgSUB1 was aligned with other Apicomplexan subtilases and bacterial subtilisin BPN′ (Fig.3). T. gondii TgSUB1 was most similar to N. caninum NcSUB1 with 66% identity over this domain. P. falciparum PfSUB1 and PfSUB2 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin BPN′ were 40, 32, and 33% identical, respectively. As expected, a high degree of sequence conservation was observed around the catalytic residues with Apicomplexan subtilisins containing insertions relative to subtilisin BPN′ between these regions. TgSUB1 contains three insertions found in variable regions VR4, VR12, and VR14, predicted to form loops between structurally conserved core elements, and one 5- amino acid deletion in VR11 (32Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Overall, the sequence homology predicts peptidase function in each case and shows that Apicomplexan subtilases are more closely related to each other than to subtilisin BPN′. Because subtilisin proteases contain stretches of conserved residues within a similar overall structure, we reasoned that the rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the catalytic region of PfSUB1 (RαPfSUB1) might react with homologous subtilases from other Apicomplexan species. Western blotting of T. gondii parasite lysate using RαPfSUB1 revealed several bands with cross-reactivity (Fig.4 A). Relatively abundant 90- and 82-kDa bands were present in crude parasite lysate, and overexposure showed less abundant 120-, 70-, 47-, 34-, 32-, and 30-kDa bands. By comparison, this antiserum recognizes predominantly proteins of 54- and 47-kDa in a P. falciparum schizont lysate that are processed from an 82-kDa precursor (11Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It also binds a 43-kDa protein that is shed from the parasite. RαPfSUB1 also reacted strongly with N. caninum parasite lysate identifying proteins migrating at 95 and 70 kDa and a weak band at 63 kDa. This pattern is similar, but not identical, to that reported for NcSUB1 with a predominant reactivity of 65 kDa and several higher and lower molecular mass bands (15Louie K. Conrad P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The differences observed here could be because of slight variations in parasite lysis or gel electrophoresis conditions. No reactivity was observed with RαPfSUB1versus E. tenella merozoite or C. parvum oocyte lysates (data not shown). Isolated tachyzoites and enriched microneme protein preparations from T. gondii contained primarily the 90-kDa form of the major antigen recognized by RαPfSUB1 (Fig.4 A). Tachyzoites were extensively washed before lysis to remove adherent extracellular proteins. Extracellular parasites secrete constitutively from both micronemes and dense granules, although microneme secretion can be enhanced by the addition of calcium ionophores and reduced by membrane-permeable calcium chelators (33Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Collection of T. gondii ESA from extracellular parasite supernatant showed that the RαPfSUB1 antigen is secreted in response to calcium ionophore A23187 treatment. Upon secretion most of the protein is converted to 82- and 70-kDa forms although several lower molecular weight antigens are seen, including 65-, 44-, 34-, and 30-kDa proteins. Secretion of the RαPfSUB1-reactive antigen is dramatically reduced by the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM as expected for a microneme-secreted protein. Control immunoblots of these samples probed with antibodies against microneme, rhoptry, and dense granule components have been previously published (17Brydges S.D. Sherman G.D. Nockemann S. Loyens A. Daubener W. Dubremetz J. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that the RαPfSUB1-reactive antigen is present in micronemes and is proteolytically processed coincident with secretion from the parasite. Protein microsequencing was used to verify the identity of the RαPfSUB1-reactive antigen as the TgSUB1 gene product inT. gondii (Fig. 4, B and C). Because N-terminal sequencing of the 90- and 82-kDa bands resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE was not successful, we turned to analysis of parasite ESA. After separation by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, protein spots reacting with RαPfSUB1 were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The 70-kDa protein yielded no sequence. N terminal sequencing of the 44-kDa antigen yielded 16/19 residues matching TgSUB1 beginning at amino acid 216, slightly upstream of the catalytic domain (see Fig. 1 for location). Formation of the 44-kDa secreted protein occurred C-terminal to the sequence SVNTSS. N-terminal sequence for the 30-kDa protein was of lesser quality but had 12/19 matches to the same internal TgSUB1 sequence (data not shown). These results indicate that RαPfSUB1 binds to TgSUB1 as predicted by the similar sequence and domain structure of PfSUB1 and TgSUB1 proteins shown in Fig. 3. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that TgSUB1 is processed sequentially from an initial 120-kDa product (Fig.5). With a 1-min pulse time, the 90-kDa protein began to appear after a 2-min chase with kinetics of a precursor-product relationship. After 5 min of chase, half of the 120- to 90-kDa conversion had taken place, indicating relatively early cleavage in the parasite. In a longer time course experiment, the 82-kDa form was first detected after a 30-min chase, although conversion was not complete by 50 min. Small amounts of the 70-kDa form were seen after 50 min of chase. The 82- and 70-kDa forms of TgSUB1 appear to be identical to those proteins found in ESA, as extensive washing could remove these soluble proteins from the parasite surface (data not shown). Lesser amounts of a 47-kDa protein were immunoprecipitated after a 10-min pulse with gradual loss of this band and appearance of a 44-kDa form over the 50-min chase period. The subcellular location of TgSUB1 proteolytic processing within compartments of the parasite secretory pathway was examined. Conversion from the 90- to 82-kDa form is inhibited by brefeldin A, a disrupter of Golgi structure and endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking (34Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). Because the 120- to 90-kDa conversion event occurs rapidly and is not inhibited by brefeldin A, this initial processing is likely to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum immediately after signal peptide cleavage. Brefeldin A did not affect formation of the 47- or 44-kDa protein species. A similar result was seen when parasite proteins were labeled at the reduced temperature of 15 °C, although neither the 47- nor 44-kDa proteins were seen under these conditions. Low temperature has been shown to block transport at a pre-Golgi compartment in a number of eukaryotic systems (35Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), further indicating that the first cleavage of TgSUB1 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, with further processing later in the secretory pathway. Combined with the data presented in Fig. 4, these data suggest that TgSUB1 secondary processing is likely to occur either within the micronemes during secretion or in the extracellular environment on or near the parasite surface. To characterize the type of protease responsible for the cleavage events seen during the maturation of TgSUB1, we labeled and immunoprecipitated TgSUB1 after preincubation with general protease inhibitors of several classes of proteases including serine, aspartic, and metalloproteases. The serine protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and DFP blocked processing from the 90- to 82-kDa forms (Fig. 6 B). In addition, formation of the 44-kDa protein was blocked by these serine protease inhibitors. In contrast, none of the inhibitors of other protease classes had any effect on processing, including E-64, leupeptin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. Divalent cation chelators EGTA and EDTA had no effect (data not shown). Tritium-labeled DFP stably bound at least 3 proteins in tachyzoite lysate, including one at 85 kDa. However, we were unable to immunoprecipitate DFP-bound TgSUB1 or show binding of DFP to immunoprecipitated TgSUB1 (data not shown). The serine-dependent processing of TgSUB1 is consistent with an autocatalytic cleavage mechanism commonly seen for subtilisins or processing in trans by another member of the serine protease family.

We determined impacts of a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) on apoptosis induced by diquat (DQ), a ROS (superoxide) generator, and peroxynitrite (PN), a potent RNS. Hepatocytes were isolated from GPX1 knockout (GPX1−/−) or wild-type (WT) mice, and treated with 0.5 mm DQ or 0.1–0.8 mm PN for up to 12 h. Loss of cell viability, high levels of apoptotic cells, and severe DNA fragmentation were produced by DQ in only GPX1−/− cells and by PN in only WT cells. These two groups of cells shared similar cytochromec release, caspase-3 activation, and p21 WAF1/CIP1 cleavage. Higher levels of protein nitration were induced by PN in WT than GPX1−/− cells. Much less and/or slower cellular GSH depletion was caused by DQ or PN in GPX1−/− than in WT cells, and corresponding GSSG accumulation occurred only in the latter. In conclusion, it is most striking that, although GPX1 protects against apoptosis induced by superoxide-generator DQ, the enzyme actually promotes apoptosis induced by PN in murine hepatocytes.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that GPX1 is the metabolic mediator of body selenium to protect mice against pro-oxidant-induced death and oxidative injuries (17Cheng W.H.

Proc. 1975; 34: 2083-2089PubMed Google Scholar), the impact of GPX1 on RNS-mediated oxidative stress in various organisms is virtually unknown. Earlier, Sies et al. (20Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) showed that adding GPX1 in human fibroblast lysates was able to reduce PN to nitrite and thus attenuated the PN-mediated protein nitration in the presence of adequate glutathione (GSH). Because nitration of protein tyrosine residues may impair the tyrosine phosphorylation-related signaling and function (21Brito C. Naviliat M. Tiscornia A.C. Vuillier F. Gualco G. Dighiero G. Radi R. Cayota A.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3356-3366PubMed Google Scholar), their finding has physiological relevance. However, the metabolic role of GPX1 in intact cells in coping with PN might be different from that in cell lysates, because of a strong reactivity between PN and CO2 to form more active intermediates such as⋅NO2 or CO⨪3 (22Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), a possible inactivation of GPX1 by PN in oxidative state (23Padmaja S. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch.

Two key events in the induced apoptosis include cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of caspase-3 (29Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the early stage of apoptosis, the activated caspase-3 cleaves p21 WAF1/CIP1 , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that protects cells from apoptosis (30Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6654-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), at a specific aspartate residue (Asp-112) and causes the loss of its localization and function in nuclei (31Levkau B. Koyama H.

Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). It is unknown how GPX1 affects the DQ- and PN-induced apoptosis and related signaling. Intracellular GSH may play three roles in metabolism: as an independent antioxidant, as a presumed physiological substrate of GPX1 to be oxidized to GSSG and regenerated by NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) reaction (33Sies H. Gerstenecker C. Menzel H. Flohé L. FEBS Lett. 1972; 27: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

Trans. 2000; 28: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is fascinating to find out how GPX1 knockout affects the responses of cellular GSH/GSSG to ROS and RNS. Therefore, our objective was to dissect the metabolic role of GPX1 in cell death, apoptotic signaling, protein nitration, and GSH/GSSG responses induced by the ROS generator DQ and RNS donor PN in primary hepatocytes isolated from the GPX1−/− and the WT mice. Most strikingly, we found that GPX1 knockout did not attenuate, but enhanced hepatocyte resistance to the PN-mediated apoptosis, which was completely opposite to its impact on the DQ-mediated apoptosis or our expectation. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. We obtained antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), p38 MAPK, and phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); against JNK2 (D-2) and p21 (C-19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); against cytochrome cfrom PharMingen (San Diego, CA); against caspase-3 from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); and against nitrotyrosine from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).

After 20 h of culture, cells were incubated with superoxide generator DQ (diquat dibromide monohydrate, Chem Service, West Chester, PA; 0.5 mm dissolved in saline) or PN (0.1–0.8 mm in 4.7% NaOH, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for different lengths of time. Both DQ and PN were added as a bolus into the media and mixed thoroughly for 30 s. Cell viability was assessed by the reduction of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan. Actual values were read at 570 nm in a Microplate Reader (Elx15, Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT) and expressed as percentage of the untreated controls. DNA fragmentation was detected by ethidium bromide staining after the cellular DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and separated in 1.8% agarose gel. Apoptosis was quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Positive stained nuclei were counted in ∼80 cells from each of four random fields using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Seattle, WA). Cells were washed twice with saline and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.34 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). After the lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatant was used for nitrotyrosine and GPX activity analyses. For the detection of p38 MAPK and JNK activations, whole cell lysates were prepared in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 μg of aprotinin/ml). For the detection of cytochrome c, caspase-3, and p21 WAF1/CIP1, cytosolic and nucleic extracts were prepared as described by Bossy-Wetzel et al. (37Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Western blot analyses were conducted as described previously (17Cheng W.H. Fu Y.X. Porres J.M. Ross D.A. Lei X.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). Total (GSH + GSSG) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were measured as described by Anderson (38Anderson A.E. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Method for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 317-320Google Scholar) and expressed as nanomoles/mg of protein. Total GPX activity was measured by the coupled assay of reduced NADPH oxidation using H2O2 as substrate (39Lawrence R.A. Sunde R.A. Schwartz G.L. Hoekstra W.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 18: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The enzyme unit was defined as 1 nmol of GSH oxidized/min. Data were analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS (release 6.11, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Bonferronit test was used for mean comparisons. Compared with the untreated controls, viability of GPX1−/− hepatocytes was decreased by 0.5 mm DQ from 82% at 3 h to 4.9% at 12 h, whereas that of WT remained >84% throughout (Fig.1 A). In contrast, over 85% of GPX1−/− cells were viable after being treated with 0.2–0.8 mm PN for 12 h, whereas viability of WT cells was reduced to 30 and 10% by 0.4 and 0.8 mm PN, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, 0.4 mm PN caused only <16% reduction in viability of GPX1−/− cells at various time points, but it decreased viability of WT cells to 50% at 3 h and further to 12% at 12 h (Fig. 1 C). The PN vehicle alone, 4.7% NaOH, did not affect viability of either type of cells (data not shown). DNA fragmentation was produced by 0.5 mmDQ in only GPX1−/− cells and by 0.4 mm PN in only WT cells at 9 h, and the DNA ladder became pronounced at 12 h in these two groups (Fig. 2 A). TUNEL assay showed 53.8 and 43.6% apoptotic cells at 9 h in the DQ-treated GPX1−/− and the PN-treated WT hepatocytes, respectively (Fig. 2 B). However, there was no detectable DNA fragmentation and only <3.5% apoptotic cells in the untreated, the DQ-treated WT, or the PN-treated GPX1−/− hepatocytes.Figure 2Apoptosis in hepatocytes induced by 0.5 mm DQ and 0.4 mm PN.

At the following time points, cytochrome c was accumulated in the cytosolic fraction and cleavage of caspase-3 progressed further in these cells. There was no cytochrome c release or caspase-3 cleavage in the DQ-treated WT or the PN-treated GPX1−/− hepatocytes at any time point. After an initial increase at 3 h over the base line, p21 WAF1/CIP1 protein in the nucleic fraction of the DQ-treated WT and the PN-treated GPX1−/− cells continued to rise or was maintained at a fairly constant high level at 9 and 12 h (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, it was decreased to approximately the base line at 6 h and remained at a low level at 9 and 12 h in the DQ-treated GPX1−/− and the PN-treated WT cells. The up-regulation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 protein expression was also observed in the whole cell extracts of the DQ-treated WT and the PN-treated GPX1−/− hepatocytes (Fig. 4 B). However, there was no such initial increase in p21 WAF1/CIP1 in the DQ-treated GPX1−/− or the PN-treated WT hepatocytes. Instead, the protein showed significant decreases in these two groups at 6 and 3 h, respectively, and remained low thereafter. Although total p38 MAPK or JNK protein was unaffected by GPX1 knockout, DQ, or PN, both kinases were activated at 30 min in both types of cell by DQ and PN (Fig. 5). However, PN seemed to be a stronger stimulus than DQ and produced a greater level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in WT than in GPX1−/− cells.Figure 4Changes of p21 WAF1/CIP1 in hepatocytes induced by 0.5 mm DQ and 0.4 mm PN.

The blot is a representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A much more abrupt time-dependent decline in intracellular GSH was produced by 0.5 mm DQ in WT than in GPX1−/− hepatocytes (Fig.6 A). Compared with the untreated controls, the decrease was 31 and 88% in WT cells, but only 7.5 and 46% in GPX1−/− cells at 30 min and 3 h, respectively. Thus, intracellular GSH was higher (p < 0.05) in GPX1−/− than in WT cells at these time points. Although DQ produced no change in intracellular GSSG in GPX1−/− hepatocytes at all, it resulted in a 15.5-fold increase over the untreated controls at 30 min in WT cells (Fig. 6 B). That increase peaked at 1 h (18.2-fold), and declined to 9.3-fold at 6 h. In the PN-treated WT hepatocytes, intracellular GSH was decreased by 40.2% at only 5 min of the treatment (Fig. 6 C). The decrease progressed linearly to 66.7% at 30 min and reached 82.3% at 6 h with a slight rise at 1 h. In contrast, the only significant decrease of GSH (46.2%,p < 0.05) caused by PN in GPX1−/− cells was seen at 3 h, along with a nearly complete restoration to the untreated cell level at 6 h. Likewise, PN did not affect intracellular GSSG in GPX1−/− cells, but caused a 5.4-fold increase over the untreated controls at 5 min in WT hepatocytes (Fig. 6 D). That increase was progressively attenuated to 4.8-, 4.4-, and 1.9-fold at 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively, with a total disappearance at 1 h. In both DQ- and PN-treated GPX1−/− cells, ratios of intracellular GSH/GSSG were much higher than those in WT cells throughout or at most of the time points. Despite a PN-dose dependent protein nitrotyrosine formation in both types of cells at 12 h, the total band intensity was 64 and 76% greater in WT than GPX1−/− cells treated with 0.2 and 0.4 mm PN, respectively (Fig.7). Treating WT hepatocytes with 0.4 mm PN for 12 h decreased total GPX activity by 34% compared with the untreated controls (207 versus 316 units/mg of protein, p < 0.05). However, DQ alone did not induce protein nitration in either type of cells or significant reduction of GPX activity in WT cells (data not shown). It is remarkable that GPX1 knockout exerted completely opposite impacts on susceptibility of mouse hepatocyte to DQ and PN-induced apoptotic death. Because high levels of H2O2could be produced by DQ (3Farrington J.A. Ebert M. Land E.J. Fletcher K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), the substantial loss of cellular defense against DQ-induced apoptosis in GPX1−/− over WT cells is consistent with the whole body responses of the GPX1−/− mice challenged with ROS generators (18Fu Y.X.

However, the positive impact of GPX1 knockout on hepatocyte resistance to PN cytotoxicity is rather striking and does not agree with the notion that selenoproteins such as GPX1 (20Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and selenoprotein P (42Arteel G.E. Briviba K. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) may protect against PN-induced oxidative stressin vivo. Although PN is highly reactive with a short half-life, our results are reproducible and physiologically relevant. This is because we demonstrated a PN-dose dependent response of cell viability and nitrotyrosine formation, a reliable indicator of PN activity in the cell (6Haddad I.Y. Pataki G. Hu P. Galliani C. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Our selected PN dose (0.4 mm), similar to that used by others (20Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 43Go Y.M. Patel R.P. Maland M.C. Park H. Beckman J.S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1647-H1653PubMed Google Scholar), was the minimal level that distinguished GPX1−/− from WT cells. Comparable results were obtained by using different sources or manipulations of PN treatment (data not shown). The enhanced nitrotyrosine formation in WT cells over that in GPX1−/− cells treated with 0.2 or 0.4 mm PN reflects a promoting role of GPX1, similar to that of other peroxidases (44Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), in the PN-mediated protein nitration. A fundamental question is how GPX1 affects the PN-mediated apoptosis and protein nitration. In cell lysate, extrinsic GPX1 was able to reduce PN to nitrite using GSH in a two-electron catalysis (20Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, we did not see a difference in PN reduction or medium nitrite level between GPX1−/− and WT cells treated with 0–0.8 mmPN for 12 h (data not shown). Because of the strong reactivity between PN and CO2 (22Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), GPX1 in the cultured cells, unlike in the cell lysates (20Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), might be encountered with not only authentic PN, but also more reactive PN intermediates such as⋅NO2 or CO⨪3. As PN inactivated a good portion of GPX1 (23Padmaja S. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in WT cells, the projected enzymatic reduction of PN by GPX1 (20Sies H. Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) might not be as effective in competing against thiols or CO2 as for direct reactions with PN (42Arteel G.E. Briviba K. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) in these cells. However, this PN-mediated inactivation of GPX1 could not explain the enhanced sensitivity of WT cells to PN toxicity, because those cells still had much higher GPX activity than the GPX1−/−hepatocytes (207–316 versus 4.2 milliunits/mg of protein). More likely, GPX1 exerted its role by affecting H2O2 removal and thus cellular balances of ROS and RNS that could modulate PN toxicity (24Day B.J. Patel M. Calavetta L. Chang L.Y. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12760-12765Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 45Brune B. Gotz C. Messmer U.K. Sandau K. Hirvonen M.R. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The DQ-treated GPX1−/− and the PN-treated WT cells clearly underwent apoptosis and exhibited similar apoptotic signaling, because cytochromec release and pro-caspase-3 cleavages preceded the appearance of apoptotic cells and severe DNA fragmentation in these cells. As a critical step in stress-induced apoptosis, cytochromec release from mitochondria enables it to bind to Apaf-1 and caspase-9, leading to the activation of caspase-9 that in turn activates caspase-3 (29Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is an executioner of apoptosis with many target proteins, including p21 WAF1/CIP1 (31Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) that protects against apoptosis (30Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6654-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 mediated by caspase-3 and the consequent activation of cyclin A/Cdk2 have been shown as prerequisite for the execution of apoptosis in human hepatoma cells SK-HEP-1 induced by ginsenoside Rh2 (47Jin Y.H. Yoo K.J. Lee Y.H. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30256-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the present study, the initial up-regulation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 protein expression at 3 h over the base line was maintained later only in the DQ-treated WT cells and the PN-treated GPX1−/− cells that showed no induced apoptosis. In contrast, the DQ-treated GPX1−/− and the PN-treated WT cells exhibited significant decreases of p21 WAF1/CIP1 at 6 and 9 h over the levels at 0 or 3 h. Both p38 MAPK and JNK, two kinases involved in stress-induced apoptosis (32Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 48Park H.-S. Park E. Kim M.-S. Ahn K. Kim I.Y. Choi E.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2527-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), were activated by DQ or PN at 30 min, but their responses were not consistent with the changes of the three assayed apoptotic signal molecules. Seemingly, GPX1 exerted its role in the PN- or DQ-induced apoptotic events downstream or independent of activation of these two kinases. Inhibition of the PN-induced activation of p38 MAPK and JNK by selenite in the cultured rat liver epithelial cells has been suggested to be through selenium-containing proteins, including GPX (49Schieke S.M. Briviba K. Klotz L.-O. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In our study, activation of p38 MAPK was slightly stronger by DQ and much so by PN in WT than GPX1−/− cells. Thus, GPX1 promoted its activation mediated by ROS or RNS in mouse hepatocytes, indicating a possible cell-specific or GPX1-independent effect of selenite on these kinases. Distinct differences in the DQ-induced cellular GSH/GSSG changes between the GPX1−/− and WT cells in the present study support the idea that GSH is a physiological substrate of GPX1 in metabolism (33Sies H. Gerstenecker C. Menzel H. Flohé L. FEBS Lett. 1972; 27: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,34Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar). In the presence of GPX1, WT cells displayed a sharp decrease in GSH, along with an abrupt rise of GSSG, within 60 min after the DQ treatment. Although this GSH depletion attenuated after 60 min, probably because of the decrease in ROS production and(or) an accelerated regeneration of GSH from GSSG by glutathione reductase, GSH was indeed oxidized to GSSG by GPX1 to reduce the DQ-generated H2O2 and other hydroperoxides at a very high rate initially. In contrast, GPX1−/− cells responded to DQ or PN with much less and slower depletion of GSH than WT cells, without any GSSG accumulation at all. Clearly, lack of GPX1 spared the oxidation of GSH to GSSG and left it for direct and/or GPX1-independent protections (33Sies H. Gerstenecker C. Menzel H. Flohé L. FEBS Lett. 1972; 27: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,34Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar, 50Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). In the PN-treated WT cells, GSH seemed to act as a substrate of GPX1 initially and then became more like a GPX1-indpendent protector because a sharp rise in GSSG along with the GSH depletion was not seen after 60 min. In comparison with these distinct roles of GSH in functioning as a GPX1 substrate and a major antioxidant, the suggested necessity of certain amount of cellular GSH for cells to undergo apoptosis instead of necrosis (35Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was not fully shown in our study. Although apoptotic events occurred in the DQ-treated GPX1−/− cells in which cellular GSH was indeed greater than in WT cells, these events were also exhibited in the PN-treated WT cells in which cellular GSH was depleted to a very low level initially. Thus, cellular GSH alteration alone may not be sufficient to regulate apoptosis. Elucidating the opposite role of GPX1 in DQ- and PN-induced oxidative injury has broad implications. It teaches us that antioxidant protection for a given enzyme or protein such as GPX1 may not be a general property, but depends on the specific nature of oxidants. Although pro-oxidant properties of high levels of vitamin E or C (51Maiorino M. Zamburlini A. Roveri A. Ursini F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,52Podmore I.D. Griffiths H.R. Herbert K.E. Mistry N. Mistry P. Lunec J. Nature. 1998; 392: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) and overexpression of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (53Midorikawa K. Kawanishi S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have been reported previously, our study provides the first evidence to show the “double-edged sword” function of an “antioxidant” enzyme at its physiological expression level in metabolically normal primary cells. The potent role of GPX1 in turning off the DQ-induced and in switching on the PN-induced apoptosis will help us in elucidating mechanisms of ROS/RNS in regulating cell death and related signaling (54Hensley K. Robinson K.A. Gabbita S.P. Salsman S. Floyd R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), and in developing novel therapeutic strategies for the ROS and RNS involved diseases (55Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Our findings also caution the public that blind antioxidant supplementation in clinic or nutrition may not always be desirable. In line of our view, knockout of GPX1 enhanced mouse brain resistance to the kainic acid-induced epileptic seizure (56Jiang D. Akopian G. Ho Y.-S. Walsh J.P. Andersen J.K. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 164: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas overexpressing GPX1 promoted acetaminophen toxicity to mice (57Mirochnitchenko O.I. Weisbrot-Lefkowitz M. Reuhl K.

Likewise, vitamin C was able to induce decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides to endogenous geneotoxins (59Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A.

https://openalex.org/W2010312364,"The recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon by the action of microbial plant cell wall hydrolases is a fundamental biological process that is integral to one of the major geochemical cycles and, in addition, has considerable industrial potential. Enzyme systems that attack the plant cell wall contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that mediate attachment to this composite structure and play a pivotal role in maximizing the hydrolytic process. Anaerobic fungi that colonize herbivores are the most efficient plant cell wall degraders known, and this activity is vested in a high molecular weight complex that binds tightly to the plant cell wall. To investigate whether plant cell wall attachment is mediated by noncatalytic proteins, a cDNA library of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi was screened for sequences that encode noncatalytic proteins that are components of the cellulase-hemicellulase complex. A 1.6-kilobase cDNA was isolated encoding a protein of 479 amino acids with aMr of 52548 designated NCP1. The mature protein had a modular architecture comprising three copies of the noncatalytic dockerin module that targets anaerobic fungal proteins to the cellulase-hemicellulase complex. The two C-terminal modules of NCP1, CBM29-1 and CBM29-2, respectively, exhibit 33% sequence identity with each other but have no homologues in protein data bases. A truncated form of NCP1 comprising CBM29-1 and CBM29-2 (CBM29-1–2) and each of the two individual copies of CBM29 bind primarily to mannan, cellulose, and glucomannan, displaying the highest affinity for the latter polysaccharide. CBM29-1–2 exhibits 4–45-fold higher affinity than either CBM29-1 or CBM29-2 for the various ligands, indicating that the two modules, when covalently linked, act in synergy to bind to an array of different polysaccharides. This paper provides the first report of a CBM-containing protein from an anaerobic fungal cellulase-hemicellulase complex. The two CBMs constitute a novel CBM family designated CBM29 whose members exhibit unusually wide ligand specificity. We propose, therefore, that NCP1 plays a role in sequestering the fungal enzyme complex onto the plant cell wall.

A 1.6-kilobase cDNA was isolated encoding a protein of 479 amino acids with aMr of 52548 designated NCP1. The mature protein had a modular architecture comprising three copies of the noncatalytic dockerin module that targets anaerobic fungal proteins to the cellulase-hemicellulase complex. The two C-terminal modules of NCP1, CBM29-1 and CBM29-2, respectively, exhibit 33% sequence identity with each other but have no homologues in protein data bases. A truncated form of NCP1 comprising CBM29-1 and CBM29-2 (CBM29-1–2) and each of the two individual copies of CBM29 bind primarily to mannan, cellulose, and glucomannan, displaying the highest affinity for the latter polysaccharide. CBM29-1–2 exhibits 4–45-fold higher affinity than either CBM29-1 or CBM29-2 for the various ligands, indicating that the two modules, when covalently linked, act in synergy to bind to an array of different polysaccharides. This paper provides the first report of a CBM-containing protein from an anaerobic fungal cellulase-hemicellulase complex. The two CBMs constitute a novel CBM family designated CBM29 whose members exhibit unusually wide ligand specificity. We propose, therefore, that NCP1 plays a role in sequestering the fungal enzyme complex onto the plant cell wall. carbohydrate-binding module affinity gel electrophoresis acid swollen cellulose bacterial microcrystalline cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose non-catalytic protein 1 gene encoding NCP1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction The recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon, by the action of microbial plant cell wall hydrolases, is a pivotal biological process that is integral to one of the major geochemical cycles in the biosphere. This process is also of considerable industrial importance as it releases 1011 tons of monosaccharides annually, and these carbohydrates could be exploited in the chemicals and fuel industries (1Coughlan M.P. Bio/Technology and Genetic Engineering Reviews. 3. G. E. Russell, Intercept, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK1985: 39-109Google Scholar). The plant cell wall is a complex insoluble matrix that is highly recalcitrant to biological degradation. Thus, microbial enzymes that attack the plant cell wall need to be in intimate and prolonged contact with this composite structure. To facilitate this interaction, plant cell wall hydrolases expressed from aerobic microorganisms are generally modular in structure comprising a catalytic module appended to one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs; Ref.2Tomme P. Warren R.A.J. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).1 CBMs have been grouped into families based on primary structure similarities (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/cbm.html). Currently there are 27 CBM families, with the majority of these modules binding to cellulose, xylan, chitin, or starch. In anaerobic bacteria the plant cell wall degradative enzymes assemble into large multiprotein complexes that bind tightly to cellulose (3Bayer E.A. Chanzy H. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although some of the enzymes in this complex contain CBMs, the attachment of these complexes to the plant cell wall is thought to be mediated primarily by a high affinity family 3a CBM that is a component of the noncatalytic scaffolding protein (termed scaffoldin or cellulosome integrating protein; CipA) that plays a key role in complex assembly (4Béguin P. Alzari P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The most efficient plant cell wall degrading microorganisms known are anaerobic fungi that colonize the gastrointestinal tract of herbivores (5Lee S.S. Ha J.K. Cheng K.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3807-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These microbial eukaryotes synthesize a high molecular weight cellulase-hemicellulase complex that binds tightly to the plant cell wall (6Ali B.R.S. Zhou L.Q. Graves F.M. Freedman R.B. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 15-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is secreted into the culture medium (7Teunissen M.J. Lahaye D.H.T.P. Huis J.H.J. Vogels G.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 276-281Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and, thus, unlike the corresponding anaerobic bacterial complexes, is not cell-associated (8Leibovitz E. Bèguin P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3077-3084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes in the complex have a relatively simple molecular architecture comprising a catalytic module attached to noncatalytic 40-residue modules referred to as dockerins (9Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Orpin C.G. Xue G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These dockerins bind to a 100-kDa protein and are believed to play a key role in complex assembly (10Fanutti C. Black G.W. Ponyi T. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29314-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Currently no CBMs have been identified in anaerobic fungal enzymes that contain dockerins and are therefore part of the complex, and thus the mechanism by which the cellulase-hemicellulase complex interacts with the plant cell wall has remained elusive. In this report we describe, for the first time, the isolation and characterization of a CBM-containing noncatalytic protein, designated noncatalytic protein 1 (NCP1), that is a component of the anaerobic fungal cellulase-hemicellulase complex. The protein contains three dockerin modules and two copies of a novel CBM family, termed CBM29. The CBM29s exhibit wide ligand specificity, and their importance in the attachment of the fungal complex to the plant cell wall is discussed. Piromyces equi (strain IMI CC number 375061) was isolated from horse caecum (11Orpin C.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 123: 287-296PubMed Google Scholar) under anaerobic conditions in minimal medium (12Kemp P. Lander D.J. Orpin C.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 27-37PubMed Google Scholar) containing soluble oat spelt xylan (0.1%, w/v) and Sigmacell (0.5%, w/v) (both from Sigma) or 0.2% cellobiose only as carbon sources. Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and BL21:pLysS (Novagen) were cultured in LB broth. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to select for transformants. Plasmid vectors used were pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen), pET22b (Novagen), and pQE-30 (Qiagen). The cDNA library used in this study was previously constructed in λZAPII using mRNA extracted from P. equi grown in medium containing insoluble cellulose (Avicel) and soluble oat spelt xylan (6Ali B.R.S. Zhou L.Q. Graves F.M. Freedman R.B. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 15-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant phages were screened for the production of proteins immunoreactive with antibodies raised against purified P. equi multiprotein cellulase-hemicellulase complex and also with antibodies raised against a reiteration of a fungal dockerin as described by Fillingham et al. (13Fillingham I.J. Kroon P.A. Willamson G. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody screening of phage plaques was carried out essentially as recommended in the manual accompanying the picoBlueTM immunoscreening kit (Stratagene), with the following modifications. Isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.33 mm) was added directly to soft agar overlays containing recombinant λZAPII and host bacteria (E. coli XL1-Blue). The plaques were lifted onto Hybond-C filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blocking solution contained dried milk powder (4%, w/v) in place of bovine serum albumin. Anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and diluted 1:4000 was used as secondary antibody. Positive phage were screened for endoglucanase, mannanase, general esterase, xylanase, and aryl-β- and aryl-α-glycoside activity as described previously (6Ali B.R.S. Zhou L.Q. Graves F.M. Freedman R.B. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 15-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fillingham I.J. Kroon P.A. Willamson G. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from P. equias described previously (9Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Orpin C.G. Xue G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Plasmid and λ phage DNA were purified using Qiagen columns. Digestion of DNA with restriction endonucleases, ligation of DNA with T4 DNA ligase, agarose gel electrophoresis, and transformation of E. coli were carried out as described previously (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems Instruments 373 automated DNA sequencer, using the PRISMTM dye-deoxy terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Instruments). Custom-made primers were used where necessary to complete the sequences of both strands (Molecular Biology Facility, Babraham Institute). Northern hybridizations were performed as described previously (15Zhou L.Q. Xue G.P. Orpin C.G. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Konjac glucomannan (acetylated; glucose:mannose = 40:60), carob galactomannan (galactose:mannose = 20:80), wheat arabinoxylan (arabinose:xylose = 41:59), rye arabinoxylan (arabinose:xylose = 49:51), β-glucan, sugar beet arabinan, potato galactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were from Megazyme International. Locust bean gum galactomannan, larchwood arabinogalactan, laminarin, methyl glucuronoxylan, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan and oat spelt xylan (arabinose:xylose = 10:90) were from Sigma. Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) was from Aldrich. Bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC), acid swollen cellulose (ASC), and the soluble and insoluble fractions of oat spelt xylan were prepared essentially as described previously (16Gilkes N.R.

To produce pAF2, which encodes C-terminal His6-tagged CBM29-1–2 (residues 174–478 of NCP1; see Figs. 1 and 2), the region of ncp1 (encodes NCP1) from nucleotides 520 to 1437 (see Fig. 1) was amplified from pAF1 (a recombinant of pBluescript containing full-length ncp1; see Fig. 2) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: 5′-TTTATAAGGATCCGTTAGTGCTACTTACTCTGTTGTTTATGAAACTGG-3′ and 5-AACAGTTTCTAAGCTT TTAATTTATTGGGTCAACGAAATCATCAGCAGATCC-3′, which contain BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively (un- derlined). The three bases highlighted in bold type encode a stop codon. The amplified DNA sequences were restricted with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the similarly digested expression vector pQE-30. The plasmid pVM1, which encodes C-terminal His6-tagged CBM29-1 (resi- dues 174–317 of NCP1; see Figs. 1 and 2), was constructed as follows. Nucleotides 520–951 of the ncp1 gene (Fig. 1) were amplified from the plasmid pAF1 by PCR using the following primers: 5′-TAACATATGGTTAGTGCTACTTACTCTG-3′ and 5′-GGTTCTTGTGATGATTTCATCCTCGAGCTT-3′, which containNdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The amplified DNA was ligated into pCR-Blunt, excised with NdeI and XhoI, and cloned into similarly digested pET22b for expression. To produce pVM2, which encodes C-terminal His6- tagged CBM29-2 (residues 335–478 of NCP1; see Figs. 1 and 2), the region of ncp1 from nucleotides 1003 to 1434 (see Fig. 1) was amplified from the plasmid pAF1 by PCR with the following primers: 5′-TAACATATGAATGTCAGAGCCACTTACAC-3′ and 5′-GATTTCGTTGACCCAATAAATCTCGAGCTT-3′, which containNdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The amplified DNA was ligated into pCR-Blunt, excised using NdeI and XhoI, and cloned into pET22b. In all cases PCR was performed using PfuTurbo ®(Stratagene) DNA polymerase, and the amplified products were sequenced in pCR-Blunt to check for any mutations. The names of the plasmids used in this study and the molecular architecture of the recombinant proteins they encode is shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Molecular architecture of NCP1. The dockerin sequences are indicated by open bars, CBM29 modules are indicated by hatched bars, and the two longest linker sequences are defined by black bars. The plasmids and the derivatives of NCP1 are defined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) E. colistrains harboring recombinant plasmids (XL1-Blue for pQE-30 and BL21:pLysS for pET22b) were cultured in 400 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) in 2-liter conical flasks. Cultures were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C and 200 rpm and then transferred to 30 °C for 20 min. Expression of target proteins was induced by the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 0.5 (pQE30) or 1 mm (pET22b) and incubated for a further 2–4 h at 30 °C and 200 rpm. CBM29-1–2 and CBM29-2 were both produced in a soluble form in E. coli and were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as follows. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4500 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 140 volume 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl (Buffer A), and the cells were lysed by sonication before being centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml bed volume TALONTM column (CLONTECH), which was then washed with 30 ml of Buffer A, followed by a more stringent wash with 20 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, before the purified protein was eluted with 20 ml of Buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The CBMs were then dialyzed against 2 × 2 liters of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 4 °C before being concentrated using 5-kDa cut-off centrifugal concentrators (Vivascience) and stored at 4 °C with the addition of 0.02% sodium azide to prevent microbial contamination. CBM29-1 was predominantly insoluble when produced in E. coli and was purified from inclusion granules by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and refolded as described previously (19Xie H. Bolam D.N. Nagy T. Szabó L. Cooper A. Simpson P.J. Lakey J.H. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Some soluble CBM29-1 was produced when the cells were grown at 22 °C, and this was purified as described for CBM29-1–2 and CBM29-2 and was used in the affinity gel electrophoresis (AGE) experiments. As the soluble and refolded forms of CBM29-1 exhibited equal affinity for galactomannan as judged by quantitative AGE, the two forms of the protein displayed the same biochemical properties. The refolded form of the protein was used for the quantitative ligand binding assays because it could be produced at significantly higher levels than the soluble form. The capacity of NCP1 and its derivatives to bind soluble plant structural polysaccharides was evaluated by AGE. Qualitative assessment of binding was carried out as follows. Continuous native polyacrylamide gels were prepared consisting of 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide in 25 mm Tris, 250 mmglycine buffer, pH 8.3. To one of the gels 0.1% polysaccharide was added prior to polymerization. Approximately 5 μg of each CBM and bovine serum albumin (as a noninteracting negative control) were loaded on the gels and subjected to electrophoresis at 10 mA/gel for ∼2 h at room temperature. Quantitative assessment of binding was carried out as described previously (20Takeo K. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 187-195Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using the same gel system as described above. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed essentially as described by Bolam et al. (21Bolam D.N. Xie H. White P. Simpson P.J. Hancock S.M. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) except that the protein concentration used was 20 μm and the stock ligand concentration was 225 μm. Qualitative assessment of CBM29 binding to insoluble polysaccharides was carried out as follows. Pure protein (∼5 nmol) was mixed with insoluble polysaccharide (2 mg) in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes to a final aqueous volume of 250 μl. The tubes were incubated on ice for 1 h, with regular gentle mixing before being centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant, containing unbound protein, was carefully removed. The polysaccharide pellet was then washed twice in 250 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, before being resuspended in 250 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS and boiled for 10 min to release any bound protein. Controls with protein but no polysaccharide were included to ensure that no precipitation occurred during the assay period. The samples (equivalent volumes of start material, bound and unbound protein, and control supernatant) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Competition assays with soluble polysaccharides (carob galactomannan, konjac glucomannan, HEC, and rye arabinoxylan) were performed essentially as described above, except that 2 mg of each soluble polysaccharide was added to the start material immediately prior to the protein being mixed with the insoluble polysaccharide. Binding isotherms were used to quantify the affinity of the NCP1 derivatives for ASC and insoluble ivory nut mannan. The protocol used was essentially the same as that described by Bolam et al. (21Bolam D.N. Xie H. White P. Simpson P.J. Hancock S.M. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that the binding took place at 25 °C and 1–150 μm protein was used for each isotherm. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a standard single-site binding model (GraphPad Prism, version 2.01), and the N0 (binding capacity) andK a values were obtained from the regressed isotherm data. At least three separate binding isotherms were carried out for each protein. Antiserum against purified CBM29-1–2 was raised in Dutch rabbits as described previously (13Fillingham I.J. Kroon P.A. Willamson G. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the fungal proteins for Western analysis, P. equiwas grown for 48 h on medium in which cellobiose was the sole carbon source. The culture supernatant was freed from fungal biomass by filtration through four layers of muslin. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 with 5 m NaOH, BMCC was added (3 g/liter culture supernatant), and the mixture was incubated with constant stirring for 8 h at 4 °C. The cellulose was recovered by centrifugation at 13, 500 × g for 5 min and repeatedly washed with ice-cold 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The insoluble cellulose was harvested by centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded leaving a residual slurry of buffer and BMCC. Bound proteins were then released from the BMCC by removing 100 μl of the residual slurry, pelleting the insoluble polysaccharide, and resuspending the pellet in 30 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS containing 10% (v/v) mercaptoethanol. After incubating at 100 °C for 5 min, the proteins released from the BMCC were separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blots according to the protocol provided with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primary objective of this study was to identify and characterize noncatalytic protein(s) within the cellulase-hemicellulase complex synthesized by P. equi. The approach taken was to screen a cDNA library of P. equi cultured on cellulose and xylan using separate antisera raised against the cellulase-hemicellulose complex and the conserved dockerin module to identify DNA sequences encoding proteins that are located in the complex. The cDNAs were then screened to eliminate those that directed the synthesis of an enzyme involved in plant cell wall degradation. Details of these screens are provided under “Materials and Methods.” A single 1.6-kilobase cDNA (designated ncp1) was isolated that encoded a protein (defined as NCP1 (noncatalytic protein1) with no apparent catalytic activity. The nucleotide sequence of ncp1 revealed an AT-rich sequence at both the 5′ and 3′ ends, typical of the noncoding regions of anaerobic fungal DNA (9Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Orpin C.G. Xue G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Fanutti C. Black G.W. Ponyi T. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29314-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Northern analysis using ncp1as the probe revealed a single mRNA species of 1.6 kilobases (data not shown), indicating that the cDNA represented the full-length mRNA. The cDNA contained a single open reading frame of 1437 nucleotides coding for a protein of Mr 52548 (Fig. 1; GenBankTM accession number AY026754). Codon utilization of ncp1 was similar to other anaerobic fungal genes (9Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Orpin C.G. Xue G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Fanutti C. Black G.W. Ponyi T. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29314-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with 73% of codons showing a preference for A or T in the wobble position, with G rarely present in the third nucleotide position. Comparison of the deduced primary structure of NCP1 with sequences in current data bases revealed that the polypeptide was modular in structure and comprised five distinct modules preceded by a signal peptide (Fig.2). Between the three N-terminal and the two C-terminal modules was an unusual linker sequence containing four repeats of the motif R2T4–5. The three N-terminal modules exhibited extensive homology with each other and with a highly conserved 40-residue sequence, known as the dockerin module that is present in virtually all anaerobic fungal plant cell wall hydrolases characterized to date (10Fanutti C. Black G.W. Ponyi T. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29314-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the dockerin binds to a 100-kDa protein in the anaerobic fungal cellulase-hemicellulase complex, and this interaction is believed to be important in complex assembly (10Fanutti C. Black G.W. Ponyi T. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29314-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The two C-terminal 140-residue modules, designated CBM29-1 and CBM29-2, respectively, displayed 33% sequence identity with each other (Fig.3) but exhibited no significant similarity to any proteins found in databases using a tFASTA search program. The C-terminal portion of NCP1 (CBM29-1–2) containing CBM29-1 and CBM29-2 and also CBM29-1 and CBM29-2 individually were expressed in E. coli appended to C-terminal His6 tags. The three proteins were purified, and their biochemical properties were investigated. To confirm that NCP1 is a component of the P. equi cellulase-hemicellulase complex, polyclonal antiserum raised against purified CBM29-1–2 was used to probe the multi-protein complex in a Western blot. The cellulase-hemicellulase complex used in the Western analysis was purified from the culture supernatant by BMCC affinity chromatography. The data (Fig.4) revealed a single species of ∼62 kDa that was similar to the predicted size of NCP1, indicating that the protein was indeed part of the cellulase-hemicellulase complex and that NCP1, when expressed in P. equi, did not appear to be substantially glycosylated. The most common function of noncatalytic modules in cellulase-hemicellulase systems is to mediate binding to plant structural polysaccharides (22Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). To evaluate whether CBM29-1–2 comprises a novel CBM, the capacity of the protein and its two derivatives, CBM29-1 and CBM29-2, to bind to a series of soluble and insoluble polysaccharides was evaluated. The data, displayed in Table I, with examples in Fig. 5, showed qualitatively that all three proteins bound to soluble forms of β-mannan, glucomannan, β-glucan, and cellulose. CBM29-1–2 was also able to interact with arabinoxylan from rye and to a lesser extent with xylans from oat spelt and wheat, as well as glucuronoxylan. The same pattern of xylan binding was observed for CBM29-2 but at significantly lower apparent affinity, whereas CBM29-1 bound weakly to rye arabinoxylan but not to the other xylans tested. It is not readily apparent why the CBM29s should show a preference for rye arabinoxylan compared with the other xylans tested. NCP1 and its derivatives did not interact with any of the other soluble polysaccharides evaluated. Qualitative binding assays against insoluble polysaccharides revealed that all three proteins also interacted with Avicel, ASC, and ivory nut mannan, although they did not bind to BMCC (a highly crystalline form of cellulose) or to insoluble oat spelt xylan (example data shown in Fig. 6).Table ISemiquantitative binding of NCP1 derivatives to soluble polysaccharidesPolysaccharideLinkage of backboneRelative affinityCBM29–1–2CBM29–1CBM29–2Glucomannan (konjac)β-1,4-Mannopyranose and β-1.4-glucopyranose+++++1-aAn indication of relative affinity based on protein retardation at a single polysaccharide concentration (0.1%).+++++++Galactomannan (locust bean)β-1,4-Mannopyranose++++++++++Galactomannan (carob)β-1,4-Mannopyranose++++++++++β-Glucan (barley)β-1,4-Glucopyranose; some β-1,3-glucopyranose++++++++++HECβ-1,4-Glucopyranose++++++++++Arabinoxylan (rye)β-1,4-Xylopyranose++++1-bNB, no binding detected.++Arabinoxylan (wheat)β-1,4-Xylopyranose+++NB+4-O-Methyl-d-glucuronoxylanβ-1,4-Xylopyranose++NB+Xylan (oat spelt)β-1,4-Xylopyranose+++NB+α-Mannan (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)α-1,6-MannopyranoseNBNBNBRhamnogala"
https://openalex.org/W2117211947,"Tropoelastin is the soluble precursor of elastin, the major component of the extracellular elastic fiber. Tropoelastin undergoes self-association via an inverse temperature transition termed coacervation, which is a crucial step in elastogenesis. Coacervation of tropoelastin takes place through multiple intermolecular interactions of its hydrophobic domains. Previous work has implicated those hydrophobic domains located near the center of the polypeptide as playing a dominant role in coacervation. Short constructs of domains 18, 20, 24, and a mutated form of domain 26 were largely disordered at 20 °C but displayed increased order on heating that was consistent with the formation of β-structures. However, their conformational transitions were not sensitive to physiological temperature in contrast to the observed behavior of the native domain 26. A polypeptide consisting of domains 17–27 of tropoelastin coacervated at temperatures above 60 °C, whereas individually expressed hydrophobic regions were not capable of coacervation. We conclude that coacervation depends on the hydrophobicity of the molecule and, by inference, the number of hydrophobic domains. Tropoelastin mutants were constructed to contain a Pro → Ala mutation in domain 26, separate deletions of domains 18 and 26, and a displacement of domain 26. These constructs displayed unequal capacities for coacervation, even when they contained the same number of hydrophobic regions and comparable levels of secondary structure. Thus, the capability for coacervation is determined by contributions from individual hydrophobic domains for which function should be considered in the context of their positions in the intact tropoelastin molecule. Tropoelastin is the soluble precursor of elastin, the major component of the extracellular elastic fiber. Tropoelastin undergoes self-association via an inverse temperature transition termed coacervation, which is a crucial step in elastogenesis. Coacervation of tropoelastin takes place through multiple intermolecular interactions of its hydrophobic domains. Previous work has implicated those hydrophobic domains located near the center of the polypeptide as playing a dominant role in coacervation. Short constructs of domains 18, 20, 24, and a mutated form of domain 26 were largely disordered at 20 °C but displayed increased order on heating that was consistent with the formation of β-structures. However, their conformational transitions were not sensitive to physiological temperature in contrast to the observed behavior of the native domain 26. A polypeptide consisting of domains 17–27 of tropoelastin coacervated at temperatures above 60 °C, whereas individually expressed hydrophobic regions were not capable of coacervation. We conclude that coacervation depends on the hydrophobicity of the molecule and, by inference, the number of hydrophobic domains. Tropoelastin mutants were constructed to contain a Pro → Ala mutation in domain 26, separate deletions of domains 18 and 26, and a displacement of domain 26. These constructs displayed unequal capacities for coacervation, even when they contained the same number of hydrophobic regions and comparable levels of secondary structure. Thus, the capability for coacervation is determined by contributions from individual hydrophobic domains for which function should be considered in the context of their positions in the intact tropoelastin molecule. base pair(s) Elastin is a protein polymer that forms an integral part of the elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix. Following secretion to the cell surface, the soluble elastin precursor tropoelastin self-associates in a process called coacervation, which is an inverse temperature transition arising from multiple hydrophobic interactions (1Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Studies using panels of synthetic elastin peptides indicate that the temperature at which the inverse temperature transition occurs is determined primarily by the hydrophobicity of the molecule (2Rapaka R.S. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Rapaka R.S. Okamoto K. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept.

Chadwick D.J. Goode J.A. The Molecular Biology and Pathology of Elastic Tissues. Ciba Foundation Symposium 192. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1995: 4-30Google Scholar), whereas for full-length tropoelastin, optimal coacervation is obtained under conditions mimicking those found in the extracellular matrix. Coacervation has been proposed to concentrate and align tropoelastin molecules for cross-linking, as a key step in elastogenesis (6Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). During coacervation, tropoelastin undergoes a conformational transition from being predominantly unstructured to a more ordered state at both intramolecular and intermolecular levels (7Urry D.W. Starcher B. Partridge S.M. Nature. 1969; 222: 795-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Cox B.A. Starcher B.C. Urry D.W. Biochim. Biophys.

This is mainly because of the formation of β-structures, as the recurring PG sequences in hydrophobic domains form a series of type II β-turns that subsequently fold into β-spirals and twisted filaments (11Urry D.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1974; 43: 211-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ultrastructurally, tropoelastin coacervates are seen as parallel arrays of 5-nm wide filaments that are similar to the fibrous structure of mature elastin (12Cox B.A. Starcher B.C. Urry D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 997-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Giro M.G. Volpin D. Fornieri C. Ronchetti P. J. Ultrastruct.

Res. 1986; 94: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Domain 26, one of the large hydrophobic domains found in the central region of tropoelastin, plays an important role in coacervation. Domain 26 alone does not coacervate, but its presence is necessary for coacervation of truncated forms of tropoelastin that have N termini placed variably downstream of domain 25 (15). Other hydrophobic domains have also been implicated in coacervation. Identification of a putative cross-linking motif containing the hydrophilic domains 10, 19, and 25 has led to a model in which domains 19 and 25 are linked by a desmosine cross-link in an antiparallel fashion (16Brown-Augsburger P. Tisdale C. Broekelmann T. Sloan C. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17778-17783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This model may require direct interactions between domains 18 and 26 and between 20 and 24, which are the four largest PG-containing hydrophobic domains located near the center of the molecule (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest a role for these hydrophobic regions in coacervation. The uniquely defined position of each region would enable specific pairing of hydrophobic domains during coacervation, and, by inference, the alignment of cross-linking sites. The work presented here explores some of the properties of the central hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin and their contribution to coacervation in the context of position in the full-length molecule. Various tropoelastin constructs, including a naturally occurring isoform of tropoelastin (SHELΔ26A), its mutant forms, and short forms, were studied with respect to their secondary structures and coacervation abilities (Fig. 1). One mutant contained a Pro → Ala mutation that was chosen because of the importance of Pro in the structures of elastin peptides (5Urry D.W. Luan C.-H. Peng S.Q. Chadwick D.J. Goode J.A. The Molecular Biology and Pathology of Elastic Tissues. Ciba Foundation Symposium 192. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1995: 4-30Google Scholar, 17Tamburro A.M. Guantieri V. Gordini D.D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1992; 10: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two other mutants were made to lack domains 18 and 26, and the last mutant contained a displaced domain 26. All constructs displayed similar CD spectra and contained approximately the same amounts of secondary structures. A greater capacity for intermolecular interactions correlated with more hydrophobic domains. Yet tropoelastin mutants with comparable hydrophobicity to the native form displayed decreased ability to coacervate. These results indicate that coacervation is not merely a result of random interactions of hydrophobic domains but that it is caused by multiple and specific interactions of individual hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin. SHELΔ26A, a 60.1-kDa naturally occurring isoform of human tropoelastin lacking domain 26A (Fig. 1), was obtained by overexpression from the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as described previously (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). SHELΔ26A(P534A) is a 60.1-kDa mutant form of SHELΔ26A in which the proline residue at position 534 was replaced with an alanine residue (Fig. 1). The construction ofSHELΔ26A(P534A) was achieved with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A as a template and the oligonucleotides 5′-TCT GGG TGT AGG TGT TGG TGT TGC AGG CCT GGG TGT AGG TGC AGG G-3′ and 5′-CCC TGC ACC TAC ACC CAG GCC TGC AAC ACC AAC ACC TAC ACC CAG A-3′. SHELΔ(18,26A) is a 56.1-kDa mutant form of human tropoelastin lacking domains 18 and 26A (Fig. 1). Deletion of a 150-bp1 sequence corresponding to exon 18 was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A as a template and the oligonucleotides 5′-CGG CGA AAG CAG CTA AAT ACG TTG TAT CCC CGG AAG CGG C-3′ and 5′-GCC GCT TCC GGG GAT ACA ACG TAT TTA GCT GCT TTC GCC G-3′. SHELΔ(26,26A) is a 56.6-kDa mutant form of human tropoelastin lacking domains 26 and 26A (Fig. 1). The deletion of a 129-bp sequence corresponding to exon 26 was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A as a template and the oligonucleotides 5′-GAA GGT TGC TGC GAA AGC GCA GCT GCC GGG CGC GCT GGC TGC TGC GAA AGC GG-3′ and 5′-CCG CTT TCG CAG CAG CCA GCG CGC CCG GCA GCT GCG CTT TCG CAG CAA CCT TC-3′. SHELΔ(26,26A)+26 is a 60.0-kDa mutant form of human tropoelastin lacking domains 26 and 26A but with domain 26 transferred to the C terminus of the molecule (Fig. 1). TheSHELΔ(26,26A)+26 coding sequence was produced by a two-step DNA manipulation. First, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace a 9-bp sequence corresponding to three stop codons at the 3′ end of theSHELΔ(26,26A) sequence with a 12-bp sequence corresponding to BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTT GCG GCC GTA AAC GTA AAG GAT CCG AAT TCT CCG GCT GCT AAC AAA GCC C-3′ and 5′-GGG CTT TGT TAG CAG CCG GAG AAT TCG GAT CCT TTA CGT TTA CGG CCG CAA G-3′. Second, a 138-bp sequence corresponding to exon 26 of tropoelastin was removed from the plasmid pSHELex26 (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and was inserted into the BamHI site at the 3′ end of the sequence, thus producing theSHELΔ(26,26A)+26 coding sequence. The constructs of SHELΔ26A(P534A),SHELΔ(18,26A),SHELΔ(26,26A), andSHELΔ(26,26A)+26 were verified by DNA sequencing, and the proteins were prepared following the procedures used for SHELΔ26A. SHEL17–27 is a 25.5-kDa polypeptide corresponding to domains 17–27 of SHELΔ26A (Fig. 1) and was obtained by overexpression from the plasmid pSHEL17–27 in E. coliBL21(DE3) as described previously (19Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SHELex18, SHELex20, and SHELex24 correspond to constructs of isolated domains 18, 20, and 24, respectively, of human tropoelastin and were obtained by amplifying their respective sequences from the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A. The amplification of exon 18 used the primers 5′-GGA TCC GGT GCG GCA GCA GG-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC TTA TGG AAC CGC AGC GCC-3′; exon 20 used the primers 5′-GGA TCC GGA GCT CGT CCG GGC-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC TTA GGA GAT ACC TAC ACC TG-3′; and exon 24 used the primers 5′-GGA TCC GGA CTA GTT CCG GGC-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC TTA CGC AAC GCC ACC CGG-3′. SHELex26(P534A) corresponds to a construct of the isolated domain 26 of SHELΔ26A(P534A) and was produced by amplifying the required sequence using the same primers as those used in the construction of SHELex26 (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cloning, expression, and purification of SHELex18, SHELex20, SHELex24, and SHELex26(P534A) were carried out as described for SHELex26 (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. CD experiments were performed in a 0.5-mm cuvette using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp.) with an attached Neslab RTE-111 water bath. Wavelength scans between 184 and 260 nm were conducted at 20 °C, and spectra were reported as the average of 10 accumulations. Spectra of solvent were obtained in the same manner and were subtracted from the sample spectra. Temperature scans between 10 and 70 °C were performed at 200 nm. For each temperature scan, the ellipticity of solvent measured at 200 nm and 20 °C was subtracted from the sample data. Each tropoelastin construct was dissolved to ∼0.2 g/liter in water or in 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol. Data were expressed in mean residue ellipticities (degrees cm2/dmol), and the secondary structure was estimated using the Varselec program with 33 reference proteins (20Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Each tropoelastin construct was dissolved to 1–10 g/liter in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and spun in a bench-top centrifuge for 10 min at room temperature prior to placing the clear supernatant in a quartz cuvette. Coacervation was measured by monitoring light scattering at 300 nm over a period of 10 min using a Cary 3 UV-Visible spectrophotometer with an attached recirculating water bath and software package J-700 for Windows (Jasco) (6Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Following each time course, the cuvette was placed on ice so that the turbid solution became clear again. For each construct, the coacervation ability was derived by expressing the maximum change in solution turbidity at each temperature as a percentage of the overall maximum. SHELex18, SHELex20, and SHELex24 are constructs corresponding to isolated domains 18, 20, and 24, respectively, of human tropoelastin. SHELex26(P534A) corresponds to the isolated domain 26 except for a mutation at the second Pro residue. The properties of these constructs were compared with those of native domain 26. Like SHELex26 (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), these constructs were not capable of coacervation or self-association (results not shown). CD spectra revealed a random coil conformation at 20 °C for all four constructs as seen with the disordered molecule of SHELex26 (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These features included a negative band at 195 nm with a shoulder at 225 nm (Fig. 2 a). All four constructs became more structured as the temperature increased. CD spectra obtained at higher temperatures showed that the negative signal at 195 nm weakened, whereas the magnitude of the signal at 225 nm increased. Similar effects were seen when these constructs were dissolved in 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (Fig.3 a). Difference spectra showed that these changes were likely to be a result of an increase in β-conformation (Fig. 3 b). To test the effect of temperature, the ellipticity at 200 nm, measured between 10 and 70 °C, showed a transition to a more ordered state with increasing temperature (Fig. 2 b). Unlike SHELex26, which showed a transition with a notable plateau near 37 °C (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), these constructs exhibited a gradual rise that continued beyond 37 °C. SHEL17–27 corresponds to domains 17–27 of SHELΔ26A, which comprises the central region of human tropoelastin harboring hydrophobic domains 18, 20, 24, and 26. SHEL17–27 displayed CD profiles similar to those reported for the isolated hydrophobic domains, including an increase in structure with increasing temperature. Coacervation of SHEL17–27 began only when the temperature reached 60 °C (Fig.4 a), and maximal coacervation was achieved at 65–70 °C (Fig. 4 b). This was in contrast with the isolated hydrophobic domains that did not coacervate. Results from previous experiments proposed a nucleation-condensation model for coacervation of full-length tropoelastin SHELΔ26A at 37 °C (21Toonkool P. Regan D.G. Kuchel P.W. Morris M.B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28042-28050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This model, together with the putative dominant role for domains 18, 20, 24, and 26 during coacervation, suggested that even though SHEL17–27 did not coacervate at 37 °C, it may have been able to self-polymerize as part of the nucleation phase prior to coacervation. Sedimentation equilibrium studies at 37 °C showed that SHEL17–27 was soluble and existed predominantly in monomer form (data not shown). A monomer-dimer model also fitted the sedimentation data and returned a very weak association constant of ∼600m−1, in which monomer represented at least 97% of the total mass at the highest protein concentration (∼5.4 g/liter). This result did not provide evidence for a monomer-dimer association but suggested that SHEL17–27 may be able to form oligomers at 37 °C at substantially higher concentrations. Four mutant forms of tropoelastin, SHELΔ26A(P534A), SHELΔ(18,26A), SHELΔ(26,26A), and SHELΔ(26,26A)+26, were analyzed for their secondary structure and ability to coacervate compared with SHELΔ26A. CD spectroscopy revealed that all four mutants had CD spectra similar to those of SHEL and SHELΔ26A (6Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 22Wu W.J. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These spectra have an intense negative minimum at 200 nm and a shoulder near 220–225 nm (Fig.5). The minimum at 200 nm is typical of a largely unordered polypeptide, although a polypeptide rich in β-structure may exhibit a similar spectrum (23Wu J. Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Analysis of the CD spectra predicted that their secondary structure contents were dominated by contributions from β-structures (TableI). Noticeably, β-turns represented 18% of the overall secondary structure contents in SHELΔ26A(P534A) compared with ∼30% in other tropoelastin constructs. An increase in temperature from 10 to 70 °C caused a linear and gradual increase in structural content as measured at 200 nm for all tropoelastin forms (data not shown).Table ISecondary structure content of tropoelastin constructsSecondary structureα-HelixAntiparallel β-sheetParallel β-sheetβ-turnOthersTotal%SHELΔ26A6 ± 120 ± 13 ± 130 ± 139 ± 198SHELΔ26A(P534A)4 ± 131 ± 27 ± 118 ± 135 ± 294SHELΔ(18,26A)2 ± 128 ± 35 ± 127 ± 136 ± 198SHELΔ(26,26A)7 ± 119 ± 12 ± 131 ± 143 ± 1102SHELΔ(26,26A)+268 ± 218 ± 33 ± 134 ± 141 ± 2104 Open table in a new tab These four tropoelastin mutants were tested for their ability to coacervate relative to SHELΔ26A under the same conditions. These mutants are soluble at room temperature and coacervate reversibly when the temperature is raised. As seen for SHEL and SHELΔ26A, each mutant coacervated more rapidly at higher temperatures (Fig.6 a) and more rapidly at higher concentrations (Fig. 6 b). Their coacervation abilities at 5 g/liter were compared with that of SHELΔ26A (Fig. 6 c). Because these tropoelastin forms are of comparable sizes, their molar concentrations were similar. Table IIlists the temperatures for each tropoelastin form to achieve 50 and 100% coacervation. SHELΔ26A completed 50 and 100% coacervation at 28 and 35–37 °C, respectively, whereas the mutant constructs required higher temperatures to achieve the same levels of coacervation. It is apparent that those disruptions involving deletion, rearrangement, or a single amino acid mutation involving the hydrophobic domain(s) of tropoelastin had deleterious effects on coacervation. The tropoelastin forms tested here were ranked on the basis of their coacervation ability from the most efficient to the least efficient as follows: SHELΔ26A, SHELΔ26A(P534A), SHELΔ(18,26A), SHELΔ(26,26A)+26, and SHELΔ(26,26A).Table IITemperatures at which tropoelastin constructs achieved 50 and 100% coacervationConstructs50% Coacervation100% Coacervation°CSHELΔ26A2835–37SHELΔ26A(P534A)3340–45SHELΔ(18,26A)3640–45SHELΔ(26,26A)+263745–50SHELΔ(26,26A)3945–50 Open table in a new tab The aim of the work presented here was to examine the contextual roles of individual hydrophobic domains in the intact tropoelastin molecule. The CD spectra of individual hydrophobic domains SHELex18, SHELex20, and SHELex24 and a mutant form of domain 26, SHELex26(P534A), displayed structural characteristics similar to those reported for the native domain 26, SHELex26 (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Trifluoroethanol and, to a smaller extent, an increase in temperature induced conformational changes in all peptides, mainly in their β-content. While the structural transition in SHELex26 appeared to reach a plateau at 37 °C (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), none of the peptides described here showed the same effect. Therefore, the results from CD spectroscopy studies pointed to a lesser role in detecting the approach to 37 °C played by domains 18, 20, and 24 compared with domain 26. Furthermore, the Pro → Ala mutation in domain 26 caused structural and functional impairment as seen in SHELex26(P534A). SHEL17–27 represents the central region of tropoelastin with the four largest Pro-Gly-containing hydrophobic domains, 18, 20, 24, and 26. SHEL17–27 coacervated at high temperatures and showed a propensity to self-associate at 37 °C. These results indicated a greater capacity for intermolecular interactions by SHEL17–27 compared with individual hydrophobic domains. It is possible that at a sufficiently high concentration, SHEL17–27 could form a high molecular weight oligomer that may be representative of the nucleating species for the nucleation-condensation model described for tropoelastin (21Toonkool P. Regan D.G. Kuchel P.W. Morris M.B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28042-28050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These oligomers, however, may not necessarily be dimers and do not account for the coacervation of full-length tropoelastin under physiologically relevant conditions at 37 °C. Our experiments centered on the effect of mutations in the key hydrophobic domains on the coacervation of the full-length molecules. Although these mutants did not represent naturally synthesized tropoelastin splice variants, they allowed direct observations of the possible functions of the individual domains. Secondary structure analyses using CD spectroscopy showed that the four tropoelastin mutants, SHELΔ26A(P534A), SHELΔ(18,26A), SHELΔ(26,26A), and SHELΔ(26,26A)+26, were comparable with the native SHELΔ26A (22Wu W.J. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The CD spectra reported here are similar to those described for other elastin peptides, including bovine tropoelastin, α-elastin, κ-elastin, and chemically synthesized elastin polypeptides (24Tamburro A.M. Guantieri V. Daga-Gordini D. Abatangelo G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Urry D.W.

Overall, the tropoelastin constructs, regardless of their sizes or mutations, constituted very little α-helix and showed around 50% β-content. A reduction in the β-turn content in SHELΔ26A(P534A) compared with other tropoelastin constructs may suggest the disruption in the formation of type II β-turns in domain 26. Under more physiologically relevant conditions (such as at 37 °C, in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl), the tropoelastin constructs could assume distinct structural conformations that would be indicative of their coacervation ability. However, it was not possible to undertake CD studies under these conditions because the tropoelastin constructs would coacervate and chloride ions absorb strongly below 200 nm. Nevertheless, it appeared that disruptions to the hydrophobic domains did not have any significant effect on their overall secondary structure content in a normal aqueous environment. Coacervation experiments showed that the four mutants coacervated endothermically and reversibly in a manner similar to that reported for tropoelastin isoforms SHEL and SHELΔ26A (6Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol.

Increased protein concentrations sharpened the coacervation profiles and lowered the temperatures required for both the onset and the completion of coacervation, indicating the cooperative nature of their association. Despite the similarities in secondary structure content and in their coacervation profiles, it was clear that disruptions of the hydrophobic domains were detrimental to coacervation. These mutants required temperatures much higher than the normal physiological temperature to achieve full coacervation. Also, they displayed variable degrees of coacervation ability as judged by their midpoint coacervation temperatures. Domain 18 of tropoelastin is also referred to as the W4 sequence. This sequence in bovine or porcine tropoelastin is composed of 11 regular VPGVG repeats, whereas the human counterpart contains nine irregular VPGVG-like pentameric repeats. Yet the polymer of human W4 sequence was functionally and structurally equivalent to poly(VPGVG) and the polymers of bovine and porcine W4 (28Gowda D.C. Luan C.-H. Furner R.L. Peng S.Q. Jing N. Harris C.M. Parker T.M. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, this domain is likely to contribute to hydrophobic folding, possibly through the formation of type II β-turns and a β-spiral during coacervation (25Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Urry D.W. Long M.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 79: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This explains why the deletion of domain 18 in SHELΔ(18,26A) increased the midpoint coacervation temperature by 8 °C compared with SHELΔ26A. Domain 26 of tropoelastin consists of four nonapeptide repeats of the sequence XGXGXGVPG, where Xis either A, L, V, or I. It plays a dominant role in coacervation (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The complete removal of domain 26 in SHELΔ(26,26A) raised the midpoint coacervation temperature by 11 °C compared with SHELΔ26A. Evidently, the impact of the deletion of domain 26 in SHELΔ(26,26A) was more pronounced than the deletion of domain 18 in SHELΔ(18,26A), possibly because of the position of domain 26 on the surface of the molecule (15Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and its involvement in intermolecular interactions. In SHELΔ26A(P534A), the Pro → Ala mutation is in the second nonapeptide of domain 26, where it would be expected to interfere with the formation of a type II β-turn during coacervation. It is significant that a single amino acid mutation in the 699-residue polypeptide resulted in a higher midpoint coacervation temperature than that seen for native SHELΔ26A. This finding is consistent with the dominant role played by domain 26 (15). When domain 26 was placed at the C-terminal end of the molecule in SHELΔ(26,26A)+26, the midpoint coacervation temperature increased by 9 °C relative to that of SHELΔ26A. In comparison with the complete removal of domain 26 in SHELΔ(26,26A), the coacervation ability was improved; but it was not restored to the same level as that of native SHELΔ26A simply by the reinstatement of domain 26 at the C terminus. As shown here, both SHELΔ26A and SHELΔ(26,26A)+26 contain the same numbers of hydrophobic domains; yet the coacervation ability of SHELΔ(26,26A)+26 was significantly impaired because of the displacement of domain 26. This result argues for a contextual contribution of domain 26 in coacervation. One factor that determines a contextual capacity for intermolecular association is the number of hydrophobic domains. As shown here, the coacervation ability was lessened when the molecule lacked domains 18 and 26 (Fig. 7, a andd). By analogy, SHEL17–27, which contains four hydrophobic domains, coacervated at temperatures above 60 °C and showed a tendency to self-associate at 37 °C, whereas the individual hydrophobic domains remained completely monomeric. More significantly, the coacervation ability was also determined by the composition and position of these hydrophobic domains. Sequence mutation and/or rearrangements of these hydrophobic domains would adversely affect this ability even though the overall hydrophobicity was maintained (Fig. 7,a–c). The results support the important role of domain 26 and its precise location in the molecule. Furthermore, they demonstrate that coacervation very likely requires specific alignment of hydrophobic domains, which would also be a prerequisite for the juxtaposition of cross-linking sequences."

Here we investigated the role of cytoplasmically exposed tail sequences on two p24 proteins, Emp24p and Erv25p, in directing their movement and subcellular location in yeast. Studies on a series of deletion and chimeric Emp24p-Erv25p proteins indicated that the tail sequences impart distinct functional properties that were partially redundant but not entirely interchangeable. Export of an Emp24p-Erv25p complex from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) did not depend on two other associated p24 proteins, Erp1 and Erp2p. To examine interactions between the Emp24p and Erv25p tail sequences with the COPI and COPII coat proteins, binding experiments with immobilized tail peptides and coat proteins were performed. The Emp24p and Erv25p tail sequences bound the Sec13p/Sec31p subunit of the COPII coat (K d ∼100 μm), and binding depended on a pair of aromatic residues found in both tail sequences. COPI subunits also bound to these Emp24p and Erv25p peptides; however, the Erv25p tail sequence, which contains a dilysine motif, bound COPI more efficiently. These results suggest that both the Emp24p and Erv25p cytoplasmic sequences contain a di-aromatic motif that binds subunits of the COPII coat and promotes export from the ER. The Erv25p tail sequence binds COPI and is responsible for returning this complex to the ER.

Transport through this pathway depends on coat protein complexes that form vesicles and select specific cargo molecules for incorporation into vesicles. Current models suggest that transport between organelles is bi-directional, such that organellar constituents are recycled as secretory cargo advances. With regard to transport through the early secretory pathway, coat protein complex II (COPII)1 catalyzes anterograde transport between the ER and Golgi whereas coat protein complex I (COPI) acts in retrograde traffic between these compartments (1Mellman I. Warren G. Cell. 1999; 100: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition to coat-dependent export of secretory cargo from the ER, retrieval (2Semenza J.C.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) mechanisms operate to maintain overall compartmental organization. A related group of integral membrane proteins, referred to as the p24 family, are thought to act in concert with COPI and COPII to sort proteins during transport through the early secretory pathway. Initially identified on ER membranes (4Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W-J. Doherty J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol.

In yeast strains lacking certain p24 members, some secretory proteins accumulate in the ER (e.g. invertase and the GPI-anchored protein Gas1p), while ER resident proteins that contain an HDEL retrieval motif are secreted and the unfolded protein response pathway is activated (6Schimmoller F.

Based on these and other findings, the p24 proteins have been proposed to act as structural components of vesicles (10Bremser M. Nickel W. Schweikert M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Hughes C.A.

Deletion of EMP24and/or ERV25 produce the strongest phenotypes with regard to the transport and sorting defects; however, deletion of theERP1 and ERP2 genes also display similar but weaker phenotypes. Indeed, evidence suggests that Emp24p, Erv25p, Erp1p, and Erp2p function in a heteromeric complex (8Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Solari R.C.E. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). There are no apparent phenotypes associated with deletion of theERP3-ERP6 genes. Deletion of all eight p24-encoding genes in yeast produces viable cells with phenotypes that are indistinguishable from the single EMP24 or ERV25 deletions (15Springer S. Chen E. Duden R. Marzioch M.

The p24 proteins are composed of a lumenally oriented amino-terminal domain and a single transmembrane segment that is followed by a cytoplasmically exposed ∼12-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence. Many of the carboxyl-terminal tail sequences found in p24 proteins possess dilysine motifs that are predicted to interact with subunits of the COPI coat and localize these proteins to the early secretory pathway. Indeed, binding assays using immobilized tail sequences from p24 family members indicate a role for dilysine motifs in COPI binding and that a double phenylalanine sequence present in many of these tail sequences facilitates binding to both COPI and COPII. Furthermore,in vivo evidence indicates a role for these motifs in proper localization of p24 proteins (16Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

It remains to be determined how distinct cytoplasmic tail sequences function in localizing p24 complexes and directing them into specific coated vesicles. In this report we focus on the cytoplasmic tail sequences contained on the Emp24p and Erv25p proteins to define the requirements for bi-directional transport of the Emp24p-Erv25p complex. A series of tail deletions and chimeras were generated and then monitored throughin vivo and in vitro assays. Further, the coat-binding properties of these isolated tail sequences were determined. Our results suggest that both the Emp24p and Erv25p tail sequences interact with the COPII coat and direct this complex into COPII vesicles, whereas the Erv25p tail sequence is required in COPI binding and retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the restriction endonucleasesPstI and EcoRI to produce pRV306. TheEMP24 gene was obtained by PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FY834 (21Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides EM1 (5′-GGAATTCCTGAGAGATCGGGTCGC-3′) and EM2 (5′-CGGGATCCGTAAAAAGTATGAAACCG-3′), which correspond to nucleotides −121 to −103 and nucleotides 719 to 701, respectively. The oligonucleotides EM1 and EM2 were engineered to contain the restriction endonuclease recognition sites EcoRI and BamHI, respectively, which allowed for convenient insertion into the yeast shuttle vector pRS314 (20Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) producing pREM314. Additional 5′-DNA sequence was added to pREM314 by subcloning a 1.2-kilobase (kb)XhoI/SalI fragment from pSEY-BS22 (gift from H. Reizman) into the XhoI site, which is located in the multiple cloning region of pRS314, and the SalI site, which is located at nucleotide 394 in EMP24. An integrating version of this vector was constructed by transferring the 1.5-kbXhoI/BamHI fragment into pRS304 (20Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce pRMP304. The EME gene fusion was constructed using the geneSplicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) method (22Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). The 5′-portion of the gene fusion, termed Eme-Awhich spans amino acids 1–193 of Emp24p, was PCR-amplified using pRMP304 as a template with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the T3 promoter and TS2 (5′-GTTCTTAAGGTAGTATATCTGGAAAAG-3′). The 3′ portion of the gene fusion, termed Eme-B which spans amino acids 202–211 of Erv25p, was PCR-amplified using pRV306 as a template with oligonucleotides TS1 (5′-TACTACCTTAAGAACTACTTCAAAACG-3′) and an oligonucleotide corresponding to the T7 promoter. The restriction endonuclease recognition site AlfII was engineered into the homologous portion of TS1 and TS2 at the fusion junction. The SOE method was performed by mixing PCR-amplified fragments Eme-Aand Eme-B with oligonucleotides T3 and T7 followed by another round of amplification. The resulting 1.5-kb gene fusion was gel-purified and subcloned into pRS304 using the restriction endonucleases XhoI and BamHI generating pEME304. The truncated EMP24 gene product, which lacks the 10-amino acid cytoplasmic tail, was made by first digesting the pEME304 vector with the restriction endonuclease AlfII. Linearized DNA was gel-purified, and the 3′-recessed ends were filled-in with Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs) and ligated. The fill-in reaction created a stop codon at amino acid 194, and the vector was termed pEMS304. The EVE gene fusion was constructed using the SOE method. The 5′-portion of the gene fusion, termed Eve-A, that spans amino acids 1–201 of Erv25p was PCR-amplified using pRV306 as a template with oligonucleotides EV1 (5′-GGGAATTAGCGTACAAAGAGTTTCTG-3′) and TS4 (5′-TCTCCGGAGATAGTTGACTTGCCAAAC-3′). The 3′ portion of the gene fusion, termed Eme-B, which spans amino acids 194–203 of Emp24p, was PCR-amplified using pRMP304 as a template with oligonucleotides EM2 and TS3 (5′-AACTATCTCCGGAGATTCTTTGAGGTCACA-3′). The restriction endonuclease recognition site for BspEI was engineered into the homologous portion of TS3 and TS4 at the fusion junction. The SOE reaction was performed by mixing PCR-amplified fragmentsEme-A and Eme-B with oligonucleotides EV1 and EM2. The resulting 1.0-kb gene fusion was subcloned into pRS306 using the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI producing pEVE306. The EVS gene fusion also utilized the SOE method. The 5′-portion of the gene fusion termed EvsA was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides EV1 and EVS2 (5′-TAGTTACTTAAGATAGTTGACTTGCCA-3′) from pBEV2. The 3′-portion of the gene fusion, termed EvsB,was also PCR-amplified from pBEV2 using oligonucleotide EVS1 (5′-TATCTTAAGTAACTACTTCAAAACG-3′) and the T7 oligonucleotide. The SOE reaction was performed by mixing equal concentrations ofEvsA and EvsB with the oligonucleotides EV1 and T7. The resulting 1.0-kb PCR-amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pRS306 using the restriction endonucleases EcoRI andBamHI to produce pEVS306. CBY244 (Δ24-Emp24p), CBY245 (Δ24-EME), and CBY289 (Δ24-EMS) were made by transforming CBY99 (Δ24) with pRMP304, pEME304, or pEMS304 after linearization withSnaBI for targeting to the trp1Δ63 locus. CBY241 (Δ25-Erv25p), CBY243 (Δ25-EVE), and CBY242 (Δ25-EMS) were constructed by transforming CBY114 (Δ25) withStuI-linearized pRV306, pEVE306, or pEVS306 and targeted to the ura3–52 locus. CBY294 (Δ24/Δ25-EME,EVE) was made by first transforming CBY112 with linearized pEME304 and then transforming with linearized pEVE306. An isogenic set strains expressing the chimeric tail fusions and the sec13–1 temperature sensitive allele was generated by repeated backcrosses of RSY265 (23Kaiser C.A. Schekman R.

Reconstituted COPII budding reactions, measurement of Kar2p secretion, and intracellular accumulation of Gas1p were preformed as previously described by Belden and Barlowe (9Belden W.J. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the 11 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Emp24p and Erv25p with an amino-terminal cysteine residue were generated (Biosynthesis Inc. Louisville, TX) and linked to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia) as described (17Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Peptides with alanines substituted in Emp24p: FF-AA (CLRRAAEVTSLV), and SLV-AAA (CLRRFFEVTAAA): and Erv25p, YF-AA (CLKNAAKTKHII) were also generated. For the peptides corresponding to the Emp24p tails, the thiopropyl-Sepharose was swollen in 50% coupling buffer (CB) (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) with 50% DMF (CB-DMF) for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed two times in CB-DMF and brought up to a final volume of 80% beads in CB-DMF. The bead solution (500 μl) was transferred to a Microfuge tube with 2 mg of peptide and incubated overnight at room temperature with constant mixing. Coupled peptides were washed two times with CB-DMF and once with blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5.0 mm 2-mercaptoethonal, 50% DMF) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking buffer. The beads were washed four times in CB-DMF and brought up to final volume of 80% beads in CB-DMF. The synthetic peptides corresponding to the Erv25p tail were handled in a similar fashion except DMF was excluded. Peptide coupling efficiency was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 343 nm according to the manufacturer's specifications. The amount of synthetic peptide bound to beads was quantified by a Lowery protein assay (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 3.0.1-3.14.3Google Scholar) using the synthetic peptides as standards. In vitro binding reactions were performed in a 0.5-ml Microfuge tube for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. Equal amounts of individual COPII subunits, a COPII mixture, or a crude cytosol were incubated with equal amounts of peptide coupled to beads in 100 μl of reaction buffer (150 mm KOAC, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation, the beads were transferred to a new 1.5-ml Microfuge tube and washed six times with reaction buffer. After the final wash, the remaining buffer was removed with a Hamilton syringe, and the beads were resuspended in 15 μl of 2× sample buffer. Samples (7 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and bound proteins were detected by immunoblot. After quantifying bound protein by densitometry, equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were calculated from double reciprocal plots of the data. Multiple cytoplasmic targeting sequences are present on p24 complexes but it is not known how distinct sequences function in transport. We sought to define the functional roles of two specific tail sequences from Emp24p and Erv25p in directing movement of this p24 complex between the ER and Golgi compartments. A set of Emp24p and Erv25p deletion and tail swap chimeras were constructed and expressed at endogenous levels. These constructs were analyzed for complementation in vivo by monitoring Gas1p accumulation, Kar2p secretion, and suppression of sec13–1 temperature sensitivity. To assess more precisely the consequences of these alterations, we determined the subcellular distribution of these proteins and used a cell-free budding assay to measure their packaging efficiency into COPII vesicles. Finally, the in vitrobinding properties of Emp24p and Erv25p tail peptides with COPI and COPII subunits were determined. An isogenic set of yeast strains expressing tail deletions and chimeras of the Emp24p-Erv25p complex were constructed as illustrated in Fig. 1. For example, the Δ24-EME strain (Emp24p with the Erv25p tail) expresses a chimeric EMP24 containing the COOH-tail of Erv25p in an emp24Δ strain. The Δ24-EMS strain (Emp24p with Stop codon at amino acid 194) expresses a truncated form of Emp24p lacking the final 10 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end in an emp24Δ strain. Both Δ24-EME and Δ24-EMS express an endogenous copy of ERV25. Similar approaches were used to generate the Δ25-EVE (Erv25p with Emp24 tail) and Δ25-EVS (Erv25p with stop codon) strains. Finally, the double swap strain (Δ/Δ-EME,EVE) carriesemp24Δ and erv25Δ alleles and expresses chimeric proteins from constructs integrated at TRP1 andURA3. Immunoblot analyses of membranes prepared from these strains were performed to assess the degree of complementation and the expression levels of the Emp24p and Erv25p proteins (Fig.2). Yeast strains lacking a functional Emp24p-Erv25p complex accumulate the GPI-anchored secretory protein Gas1p in the ER as a 105-kDa species. In wild-type strains, mature Gas1p migrates as a fully glycosylated 130-kDa protein (6Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, no ER form of Gas1p was detected in the wild-type and Δ24-EME strains, whereas the other strains accumulated varying amounts of Gas1p in the ER. Densitometric scanning of these immunoblots indicated that ∼50% of the Gas1p contained in microsomes prepared from emp24Δ and erv25Δstrains migrated as the ER form. Similar levels were observed in the Δ25-EVE, Δ25-EVS, and Δ/Δ-EME,EVE strains. The Δ24-EMS strain accumulated an intermediate level of the ER form (∼35%) suggesting partial complementation. These results are summarized in TableII.Table IIPhenotypes of wild-type, p24 deletions, and chimerasWild-typeΔ24Δ24-EMEΔ24-EMSΔ25Δ25-EVEΔ25-EVSΔ/Δ-EME,EVEGas1p accumulation0%54%0%36%52%46%49%51%Kar2p secretion0%100%22%55%100%65%100%63%By-passsec13–1NOYESNOYESYESYESYESYESSubcellular localization (percent ER: percent Golgi) Sec61p74%:26%74%:26%80%:20%74%:26%88%:12%77%:23%76%:24%80%:20% Emp4732%:68%32%:68%28%:72%28%:72%27%:73%37%:63%26%:74%30%:70% Erv25p57%:43%63%:37%65%:35%60%:40%44%:56% Emp24p77%:23%45%:55%62%:38%Incorporation into COPII vesicles (percent of total packaged) Sec22p1213111113111112 Erv25p8.48.09.25.48.37.511 Emp24p8.88.84.84.05.26.54.5 Open table in a new tab We also monitored the expression levels of the Emp24p and Erv25p proteins.

Near wild-type levels were observed in the Δ24-EME strain, and the other truncation or chimeric proteins were expressed at variably lower levels. Sec61p, an ER membrane protein that functions in polypeptide translocation, served as a loading control in these experiments to ensure equal analysis of samples. Extracellualr secretion of ER resident proteins (e.g. Kar2p) is another phenotype associated with emp24Δ anderv25Δ strains (7Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, we quantified the amount of Kar2p secreted from these strains after a 3-h growth period, and a representative experiment is shown in Fig.3. Setting maximal Kar2p secretion levels at those observed for emp24Δ and erv25Δ, we found that the Δ25-EVS strain secreted near maximal levels, whereas Δ24-EMS, Δ25-EVE and Δ/Δ-EME,EVE secreted intermediate levels. The Δ24-EME strain secreted a low level of Kar2p that was near that of a wild-type strain. We next determined if our set of EMP24 and ERV25mutations could suppress the thermosensitivity of sec13–1strains. Previous studies showed that deletion of EMP24bypassed the requirement for SEC13 (7Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, we crossed the sec13–1 mutation into our strains and scored for growth at 37 °C. As expected, both the emp24Δ anderv25Δ mutations suppressed sec13–1 (TableII). Interestingly, all of the mutations except Δ24-EME suppressedsec13–1 indicating that a partial loss of function mutation in EMP24 or ERV25 was adequate for suppression. All of these assays used to evaluate Emp24p/Erv25p function appear to show a close correlation; however, the Kar2p secretion assay seemed most sensitive followed by Gas1p accumulation then sec13–1suppression. Based on these assays, we conclude that the EME fusion protein (Emp24p with the Erv25p tail) functioned at near wild-type levels and that the EMS and EVE proteins displayed partial function, whereas the EVS protein did not provide detectable activity.

The former activity was purified from cell extracts, and the N-terminal sequence was used to identify the encoding gene in the completely sequenced P. horikoshii genome. This gene, designated PH0927, and a gene immediately downstream (PH0926) were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant product of gene PH0927catalyzed the synthesis of α-mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate (MPG) from GDP-mannose and d-3-phosphoglycerate retaining the configuration about the anomeric carbon, whereas the recombinant gene product of PH0926 catalyzed the dephosphorylation of mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate to yield the compatible solute α-mannosylglycerate. The MPG synthase and the MPG phosphatase were specific for these substrates. Two genes immediately downstream from mpgs and mpgp were identified as a putative bifunctional phosphomannose isomerase/mannose-1-phosphate-guanylyltransferase (PH0925) and as a putative phosphomannose mutase (PH0923). Genes PH0927, PH0926, PH0925, and PH0923 were contained in an operon-like structure, leading to the hypothesis that these genes were under the control of an unknown osmosensing mechanism that would lead to α-mannosylglycerate synthesis. Recombinant MPG synthase had a molecular mass of 45,208 Da, a temperature for optimal activity between 90 and 100 °C, and a pH optimum between 6.4 and 7.4; the recombinant MPG phosphatase had a molecular mass of 27,958 Da and optimum activity between 95 and 100 °C and between pH 5.2 and 6.4.

Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 803-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Santos H. da Costa M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 336: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The accumulation of compatible solutes can be accomplished by specific uptake or by de novo synthesis of osmolytes. The uptake of organic solutes such as glycine betaine and trehalose, among other solutes, from the environment is preferred because it is energetically favorable (3Galinski E.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 273-328Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Many organisms, however, synthesize their own compatible solutes because specific solutes in the environment may not be freely available or do not fulfill the prerequisites of an osmolyte.Ectoine, hydroxyectoine, glycine betaine, trehalose, and glutamate are probably among the most common compatible solutes of bacteria and archaea (4da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinski E.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar). However, slightly halophilic thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea generally accumulate compatible solutes that are rare or unknown in mesophilic organisms. Moreover, these osmolytes usually have a negative charge that is neutralized by the accumulation of potassium (5Martins L.O. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Martins L.O. Huber R. Huber H. Stetter K.O. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ.

The archetypal compatible solutes of thermophiles and hyperthermophiles such as di-myo-inositol phosphate (DIP),1dimannosyl-di-myo-inositol phosphate, diglycerol phosphate, mannosylglyceramide, and mannosylglycerate (MG) have not been found in mesophilic bacteria and archaea. Mannosylglycerate appears to be a very common compatible solute in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms, namely in Pyrococcus furiosus, the slightly halophilic Thermococcus spp., Aeropyrum pernix,Thermus thermophilus, Rhodothermus marinus, and Petrotoga miotherma (6Martins L.O.

Borges N. Martins L.O. Wait R. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some of the compatible solutes of thermophiles and hyperthermophiles, of which MG deserves special mention, have been shown to protect enzymes in vitro against thermal denaturation and could also have an important role in thermoprotection of cell components in vivo (12Ramos A. Raven N.D.H. Sharp R.J. Bartolucci S. Rossi M. Cannio R. Lebbink J. Van der Oost J. De Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ.

(2001) Extremophiles, in press.Google Scholar).Basic knowledge of the biosynthesis of specific compatible solutes is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the events leading to salt and thermal tolerance, from water stress sensing to maintenance of the appropriate intracellular levels of compatible solutes (14Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The pathways for the synthesis of osmolytes in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms have only recently begun to be examined. Two pathways for the biosynthesis of MG exist in the thermophilic bacterium R. marinus. One pathway involves the single step conversion of GDP-mannose and d-glycerate to MG by mannosylglycerate synthase. An alternative pathway was also detected in R. marinus that leads to the synthesis of the phosphorylated intermediate, mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate which, in turn, is converted to MG by a phosphatase (15Martins L.O.

We deemed it important to investigate whether a similar strategy would hold in hyperthermophilic archaea, and the slightly halophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii (16Gonzalez J.M. Masuchi Y. Robb F.T. Ammerman J.W. Maeder D.L. Yanagibayashi M. Tamaoka J. Kato C. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was selected for this purpose.We identify the genes involved in the synthesis of MG in P. horikoshii and elucidate a pathway for the biosynthesis of this compatible solute, which involves a mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (MPG synthase) and a specific mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (MPG phosphatase). In addition, the genes for the synthesis of MG in P. horikoshii were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzymes were characterized in detail.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Culture ConditionsThe type strain of P. horikoshii (JCM 9974) was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Microorganisms (JCM), Saitama, Japan. The organism was cultivated as follows: the medium contained per liter, 5.0 g of peptone, 1.0 g of yeast extract, 25.0 g of NaCl, 1.0 mg of FeSO4·7H2O, 40.0 mg of KH2PO4, 19.6 ml of magnesium salts solution (180.0 g of MgSO4·7H2O and 140.0 g of MgCl2·6H2O/liter), 1.0 ml of solution A (4.0 g of trisodium citrate, 9.0 g of MnSO4·4H2O, 2.5 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 2.5 g of NiCl2·6H2O, 0.3 g of AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.3 g of CoCl2·6H2O, 0.15 g of CuSO4·5H2O/liter), 2.0 ml of solution B (56.0 g of CaCl2·2H2O, 25.0 g of NaBr, 16.0 g of KCl, 10.0 g of KI, and 4.0 g of SrCl2·6H2O/liter), 2.0 ml of solution C (50.0 g of K2HPO4, 7.5 g of H3BO3, 3.3 g of Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.15 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, and 0.005 g of Na2SeO3/liter), and 20.0 ml of solution D (0.1 g of citric acid, 0.75 g of nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.06 g of CoCl2·6H2O, 14.5 g of KCl, and 32.0 g of CaCl2·2H2O/liter). The final pH was adjusted to 7.0. The medium was gassed with N2 and sterilized by autoclaving. Sterile sulfur (3.0 g/l) was added to the medium after cooling to 90 °C. Cultures were grown in a 5-liter fermentor at 98 °C with continuous gassing of N2 and stirred at 80 rpm.To examine the effect of osmotic stress on the synthesis of intracellular solutes by P. horikoshii, 15–45 g of NaCl/liter was added to the medium. Biomass production for enzyme purification was carried out in medium containing 4.5% NaCl (w/v). Cell growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity at 600 nm.E. coli XL1-Blue was used as host for expression vectors pTRC99A, pKK223-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and for a plasmid isolated from E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene) that carries extra tRNA genes for codons commonly found in archaea but rarely used by E. coli. This organism was grown in YT medium, at pH 7.0 and 37 °C, containing 10.0 g of tryptone, 5.0 g of yeast extract, and 5.0 g of NaCl/liter. Ampicillin was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for selection of plasmids pKK223-3 and pTRC99A. Chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml for selection of plasmid carrying the tRNA genes. IPTG was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and added at a final concentration of 1 mm.Extraction and Determination of Intracellular SolutesCells of P. horikoshii were harvested during mid-exponential phase of growth by centrifugation (7000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed once with a NaCl solution identical in concentration to that of the medium where the cells were grown. Cell pellets were extracted twice with boiling 80% ethanol as described previously (6Martins L.O. Huber R. Huber H. Stetter K.O. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 896-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For solute quantification by 1H NMR, the final pH of the samples was adjusted to ∼8 by the addition of NaO2H. The protein content of the cells was determined by the Bradford assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) after lysis with 1 n NaOH (100 °C, 10 min) and neutralization with 1 nHCl.Preparation of Cell-free ExtractsCells were harvested by centrifugation (7000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C) during the late exponential phase of growth. The cell pellet was resuspended in Tris-HCl (20 mm(pH 7.6)) containing MgCl2 (5 mm), DNase I (10 μg), and protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (80 μg), leupeptin (20 μg), and antipain (20 μg) per ml of the suspension. Cells were disrupted in a French press, followed by centrifugation (130,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) to remove endogenous mannosylglycerate (MG) and other low molecular weight compounds prior to measuring enzyme activities and purification procedures.Enzyme AssaysTo determine the combined activity of mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (MPG synthase)/mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (MPG phosphatase) in the cell extracts, the reaction mixture contained 2.5 mmGDP-mannose (Sigma) and 2.5 mmd-3-phosphoglycerate (sodium salt, Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) with 10 mmMgCl2. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 90 °C for 30 min, and the MG produced was quantified by 1H NMR after freeze-drying and dissolving in 2H2O. Formate was used as an internal concentration standard. This protocol was also used to examine the kinetic parameters, temperature, and pH optima, the effect of NaCl, KCl, and divalent cations, and thermal stability of the recombinant MPG synthase, but in this case MPG was the final product that was quantified by 1H NMR.To detect the presence of MPG synthase, during the purification of the native enzyme, the same procedure was followed, but after incubation at 90 °C, unless otherwise stated, for 30 min, the reaction mixture was cooled to 37 °C, and 2 units of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was added. The mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, and the formation of MG was visualized by TLC.The activity of the purified recombinant MPG phosphatase was measured with 2 mm MPG in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm MgCl2 at 98 °C by monitoring the release of inorganic phosphate using the spectrophotometric method described by Ames (18Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3006) Google Scholar). All enzyme parameters of MPG phosphatase were examined using this reaction mixture, unless otherwise stated.MPG used for these assays was obtained from a reaction catalyzed by pure recombinant MPG synthase with 12.5 mm GDP-mannose, 12.5 mmd-3-phosphoglycerate as substrates, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 10 mmMgCl2 at 98 °C for 15–20 min. Quantification of MPG was carried out by incubating an aliquot of the reaction mixture with MPG phosphatase for 15–20 min to ensure complete dephosphorylation of MPG, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) with 10 mmMgCl2. Inorganic phosphate released was quantified by the Ames method. The concentration of MPG in the reaction mixture was calculated from the concentration of inorganic phosphate produced. All reactions were stopped by freezing in liquid nitrogen.Purification of Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerateMPG was partially purified from the reaction mixtures described above. Samples were loaded onto a QAE-Sephadex A-25 column previously equilibrated with 5.0 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0), and the elution was performed with 1 bed volume of the same buffer, followed by a linear gradient of 5.0 mm to 1 mNaHCO3. The eluted fractions were analyzed for carbohydrate by the method of Dubois et al. (19Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39927) Google Scholar). MPG was eluted at 0.5m NaHCO3. For a second chromatographic step, a column of activated Dowex 50W-X8 resin was used, and the elution was carried out with distilled water. Subsequently, the fractions were pooled and degassed under vacuum, and the pH was raised to 3.5 with 1.0m KOH. Samples were lyophilized and dissolved in2H2O prior to NMR analysis.NMR SpectroscopyThe identification of the phosphorylated intermediate, α-mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate, was accomplished using13C, 31P, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX300 or DRX500 spectrometers (9Lamosa P. Martins L.O. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Silva Z. Borges N. Martins L.O. Wait R. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For quantification of substrates and products of enzyme reaction mixtures, 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX300 spectrometer with a broadband inverse probe head with presaturation of the water. Spectra were acquired with a repetition delay of 45 s, and formate was used as an internal concentration standard. Proton, carbon, and phosphorus chemical shifts are relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propanesulfonic acid, methanol (at 49.3 ppm), or 85% H3PO4, respectively.Analysis of MG Formation by Thin Layer ChromatographyTLC was performed on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) with a solvent system composed of chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, and water (30:50:8:4, v/v). MG was visualized by spraying with α-naphtholsulfuric acid solution followed by charring at 120 °C (20Jacin H. Mishkin A.R. J. Chromatogr. 1965; 18: 170-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic standards of MG, mannose, guanosine, and GDP-mannose were used for comparative purposes.Purification of Native MPG SynthaseNative enzyme was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature from P. horikoshii cell extracts.Ion-exchange ChromatographyThe cell-free extract was applied to a column (XK50/30, bed volume 250 ml) packed with DEAE-Sepharose fast flow equilibrated with Tris-HCl (20 mm(pH 7.6)). All the purification steps were carried out at pH 7.6. Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0.0–0.6 and 0.6–1.0 m) in the same buffer. MPG synthase activity was found in the fraction eluting between 0.4 and 0.5 mNaCl. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl. The sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose fast flow column equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was carried out with a five-step discontinuous NaCl gradient (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 m). The fractions eluting at 0.4 and 0.6m NaCl contained MPG synthase activity. Fractions with MPG synthase activity were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl. This sample was applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column. Elution was carried out with a linear NaCl gradient (0.0–1.0m). Fractions eluted between 0.29 and 0.34 mcontained MPG synthase activity.Gel Filtration ChromatographyThe active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (30-kDa cutoff) and were applied to a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 0.2 mNaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl. The active MPG synthase fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa cutoff) and applied to a Superose column equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl. The purity of the active fraction was assessed by SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The sample was blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing at Microchemical Facility, Emory University School of Medicine, GA.DNA Techniques, Analysis, Cloning, and Functional Overexpression of mpgs (PH0927) and mpgp (PH0926) in E. coliMost DNA manipulations followed standard molecular techniques and procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). P. horikoshii chromosomal DNA was isolated according to Marmur (23Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8957) Google Scholar). Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified MPG synthase, a corresponding open reading frame (ORF), designated PH0927, was identified from the P. horikoshii OT3 complete genome sequence (24Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa H. Haikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. Sekine M. Baba S. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Nagai Y. Sakai M. Ogura K. Otsuka R. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Ohfuku Y. Funahashi T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y. Yamazaki J. Kushida N. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). ORF sequences surrounding PH0927 were also screened for homologies with known phosphatase genes using the (T)FASTA (25Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9345) Google Scholar) and (T)BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) algorithms. PCR amplifications were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 2400 in reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 100 ng of P. horikoshii DNA, 100 ng of each primer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 unit of Pwo DNA polymerase, and 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min. Annealing was performed at 60 °C for 1 min, and primer extension was at 72 °C for 2 min. The extension reaction in the last cycle was prolonged for 5 min. Amplification products were purified from agarose gels (Bio-Rad).Based on the complete gene sequence, mpgs was amplified by the forward primer (5′-GCGCCATGGTTCTAGAAGCTCC-3′) and adding a recognition sequence for NcoI (underlined) including the ATG start codon. The reverse primer (5′-GCGCTGCAGTCATAGCTCAAACCTCAG-3′) was constructed by adding an additional PstI recognition sequence (underlined) directly behind the TGA stop codon. Gene mpgp was amplified with the forward primer (5′-GCGGAATTCATGATTAGGTTAATATTC-3′) constructed with an additional EcoRI recognition sequence (underlined) immediately upstream of the ATG start codon, and the reverse primer (5′-GCGCTGCAGTCATTTGATCACCTCC-3′) with an additional PstI recognition sequence (underlined) directly behind the TGA stop codon. The PCR products were purified after digestion with NcoI and PstI for mpgsand with EcoRI and PstI for mpgp and ligated into corresponding sites of expression vectors pTRC99A and pKK223-3 to obtain plasmids pMPGS and pMPGP, respectively. Each construction was transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells previously transformed with the plasmid carrying tRNA genes for rare codons. Host cells containing pMPGS or pMPGP were grown to mid-exponential growth phase (A600 = 0.6), induced with IPTG, and grown further for 6–8 h. Cells were harvested and treated as described above for the preparation of cell-free extracts.Purification of Recombinant MPG SynthaseE. coli cell extracts containing MPG synthase were incubated for 20 min at 80 °C to denature the majority of the host proteins and centrifuged (25000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). MPG synthase activity assay was performed as described above, and the enzyme was purified.Ion-exchange ChromatographyThe supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (XK50/30), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0.0–0.6 and 0.6–1.0 m) in the same buffer. MPG synthase activity was found in the fraction eluting between 0.25 and 0.5 m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated to 20 mm Tris-HCl. The sample was applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m). Fractions with activity eluted between 0.2 and 0.6 m. Purity of the samples was determined by SDS-PAGE. Three different pools with different degrees of purity resulted from this purification step.Gel Filtration Chromatography (Superose 12)The purest pool was concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa cutoff). Fractions were applied to a gel Superose 12 column equilibrated with 0.35m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and eluted with the same buffer. Active fractions were subjected to dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).Anion-exchange Chromatography (Mono Q)The sample was loaded onto a Mono Q column that was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). The fraction with MPG synthase eluted between 0.55 and 0.6 m NaCl.Purification of Recombinant MPG PhosphataseExtracts for the purification of MPG phosphatase, as well as the assay for enzyme activity were as described above.Ion-exchange ChromatographyThe MPG phosphatase-containing supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column as described for the recombinant MPG synthase. Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0.0–0.5 and 0.5–1.0m). MPG phosphatase eluted between 0.2 and 0.35m NaCl. Active fractions were concentrated, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and loaded onto a Mono Q column that was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0.0–1.0m). The fraction with MPG phosphatase eluted between 0.25 and 0.3 m NaCl.Characterization of Recombinant MPG Synthase and MPG PhosphataseAll biochemical and kinetic parameters for these enzymes were determined using the assay conditions described above. The temperature profiles for activity of MPG synthase and MPG phosphatase were determined between 30 and 108 °C. The effect of pH on MPG synthase activity was determined at 98 °C in 50 mmBisTris/propane buffer (pH 6.5–9.5) and 50 mm CAPSO (pH 7.0–10.0). The effect of pH on MPG phosphatase activity was determined at 98 °C in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 3.4–5.4), 50 mm BisTris/propane buffer (pH 6.5–9.5), and CAPSO (pH 7.0–10.0). All pH values were measured at room temperature (25 °C); pH values at 98 °C were calculated using the conversion factor Δp Ka/ΔT °C = −0.015 for BisTris/propane and −0.018 for CAPSO. Enzyme thermostabilities were determined at 98 °C by incubating enzyme solutions (0.5 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). At appropriate times, samples were withdrawn and immediately examined for residual activities at 98 °C.Kinetic parameters for MPG synthase were determined in reaction mixtures containing GDP-mannose (0.1–5.0 mm) plusd-3-phosphoglycerate (5 mm) or GDP-mannose (5 mm) plus d-3-phosphoglycerate (0.1 to 5.0 mm). Reaction mixtures for the determination of the kinetic parameters of MPG phosphatase contained MPG (0.1–2.0 mm). Samples of MPG synthase and MPG phosphatase reactions were pre-heated for 3 and 2 min, respectively, and all reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme preparation. Kinetic parameters for all substrates were determined at 98 °C. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Values for Vmax and Km were determined from Hanes plots.DISCUSSIONMannosylglycerate serves as a compatible solute in several slightly halophilic or halotolerant bacteria and archaea that live at high temperatures, accumulating in direct response to an increase in the salinity of the medium (5Martins L.O. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Martins L.O. Huber R. Huber H. Stetter K.O. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ.

Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). P. horikoshii, like the other slightly halophilic species of the order Thermococcales examined, also produces progressively higher amounts of MG in response to salt stress.Here we propose that the pathway for the synthesis of MG in P. horikoshii proceeds via a two-step pathway where GDP-mannose andd-3-phosphoglycerate are converted to the phosphorylated intermediate, mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate, which in turn is dephosphorylated to α-mannosylglycerate (Fig.7). Thus, the synthesis of MG can be traced from the key glycolytic metabolite glucose 6-phosphate as follows: glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate by the action of a novel type of phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), recently identified in P. furiosus (27Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schonheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which exhibits extensive sequence homology to P. horikoshii ORF PH1956 (83% sequence identity). Fructose 6-phosphate can then be isomerized to mannose 6-phosphate by phosphomannose isomerase (PH0925), putatively identified as a bifunctional PMI/M1P-GT (28Koplin R. Arnold W. Hotte B. Simon R.

Most ERT studies have been performed with recombinant proteins that are mixtures of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme. Because different cell types use different receptors to take up phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated enzyme, it is difficult to determine which form of enzyme contributed to the clinical response. Here we compare the uptake, distribution, and efficacy of highly phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated β-glucuronidase (GUSB) in the MPS VII mouse. Highly phosphorylated murine GUSB was efficiently taken up by a wide range of tissues. In contrast, non-phosphorylated murine GUSB was taken up primarily by tissues of the reticuloendothelial (RE) system. Although the tissue distribution was different, the half-lives of both enzymes in any particular tissue were similar. Both preparations of enzyme were capable of preventing the accumulation of lysosomal storage in cell types they targeted. An important difference in clinical efficacy emerged in that phosphorylated GUSB was more efficient than non-phosphorylated enzyme at preventing the hearing loss associated with this disease. These data suggest that both forms of enzyme contribute to the clinical responses of ERT in MPS VII mice but that enzyme preparations containing phosphorylated GUSB are more broadly effective than non-phosphorylated enzyme.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These diseases are usually progressive in nature, and children often present with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. It has been shown previously that exogenous lysosomal enzymes can be taken up by affected cells and can correct the metabolic defect (2Neufeld E.F. Fratantoni J.C. Science. 1970; 169: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This process, referred to as “cross-correction,” forms the basis for several therapeutic approaches (2Neufeld E.F. Fratantoni J.C. Science. 1970; 169: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Uptake of lysosomal enzymes is mediated by either the mannose 6-phosphate or mannose receptors (3Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 4Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Sly W.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Conceptually, the simplest therapeutic approach involves the systemic injection of a recombinant lysosomal enzyme containing oligosaccharides with exposed mannose or mannose 6-phosphate residues. Macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase with exposed mannose residues has been shown to be highly effective for Gaucher's disease where the pathology is largely restricted to fixed tissue macrophages. It is generally believed that enzymes modified with mannose 6-phosphate would be more efficacious for most other lysosomal storage diseases. This is due to the fact that, unlike the mannose receptor, which is limited to cells of the reticuloendothelial system, the mannose 6-phosphate receptor is present on most cell types (5Senior P.V.

Like most other enzyme replacement studies, the recombinant enzyme used in the MPS VII mouse was produced in mammalian cells and was composed of a mixture of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme (12Sands M.S.

FASEB J. 1993; 7 (abstr.): 1255aGoogle Scholar). Therefore, it has been difficult to determine which form of the enzyme produced which aspects of the clinical improvements. Here we show that the biodistribution and clinical efficacy of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated murine GUSB are different following intravenous injection into MPS VII mice.DISCUSSIONDirect enzyme replacement therapy has been proposed as a form of therapy for lysosomal storage diseases. Intravenous injection of glucocerebrosidase, a non-phosphorylated lysosomal enzyme, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of Gaucher's disease (8Barton N.W. Brady R.O. Dambrosia J.M. Di Bisceglie A.M. Dopplet H.S. Hill S.C. Mankin H.J. Murray G.J. Parker R.I. Argoff C.E. Grenwal R.P., Yu, K.T. Collaborators N. Engl. J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disease that primarily affects cells of the RE system. To produce a therapeutic enzyme, glucocerebrosidase has to be treated with a series of exoglycosidases to expose mannose residues, which target it to the mannose receptor on RE cells (4Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Sly W.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Takahashi K. Donovan M.J. Rogers R.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, for the majority of lysosomal storage diseases where both RE and non-RE cells are affected, enzyme will have to be targeted to cells that do not express the mannose receptor (i.e. the majority of non-RE cells). The mannose 6-phosphate receptor may provide access to many of those cells.We previously showed that multiple injections of murine GUSB, containing ∼70% phosphorylated enzyme, prevented the accumulation of lysosomal storage in multiple tissues when initiated in newbornmps/mps mice (12Sands M.S.

However, most of these studies have been performed with enzyme produced in mammalian cells that contains a mixture of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme. Therefore, it has been difficult to determine which form of enzyme contributes to which component of the clinical response.It is known that insect cells do not contain the phosphotransferase activity required for the modification of terminal mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes, and relatively large quantities of enzymatically active lysosomal hydrolases can be produced in insect cells using the baculovirus system (35Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Prot. Exp. Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Aeed P.A. Elhammer A.P.

Gene. 1994; 144: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Murine GUSB produced in this system (NP-GUSB) has properties that would be expected of a non-phosphorylated enzyme. NP-GUSB is not taken up by human fibroblasts expressing the mannose 6-phosphate receptor but not the mannose receptor. On the other hand, NP-GUSB is taken up by alveolar macrophages, which express the mannose receptor, and this uptake is completely inhibited by yeast mannan. Its in vivobiodistribution is also typical of a macrophage-targeted enzyme in that it localizes primarily to tissues rich in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Liver provides the most striking example of this localization where the enzyme activity is largely restricted to sinus lining cells. Its absence in hepatocytes is striking (Fig.2).Highly phosphorylated enzyme produced in mammalian cells (P-GUSB) is efficiently taken up by human fibroblasts exclusively by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent mechanism. This enzyme is also taken up in vitro by alveolar macrophages but by both the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and mannose receptor systems. Uptake by both non-RE and RE cells is also observed in vivo, because both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells contain enzyme. The macrophages can recognize both the phosphorylated oligosaccharides (via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor) and the non-phosphorylated oligosaccharides on P-GUSB (via the mannose receptor). Interestingly, the half-lives of both forms of enzyme are similar in the tissues examined. This result suggests that the phosphorylation status of GUSB does not affect stability, and once the enzymes localize to the lysosome, they degrade at approximately the same rate in most tissues.The different tissue distributions of P-GUSB and NP-GUSB also result in different degrees of lysosomal storage reduction. The reduction of lysosomal storage in the liver mirrors the distribution of the different enzymes. For example, NP-GUSB is localized almost exclusively to RE cells of the liver, and those are the only cells that have reduced storage; hepatocytes still contain distended lysosomes. In contrast, P-GUSB localizes to both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, and both cell types are cleared of storage. P-GUSB also localizes in other tissues such as meninges and reduces lysosomal storage there. These data indicate that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzymes correct lysosomal storage in the cells they target. These data also suggest that, once NP-GUSB is taken up by cells of the RE system in the liver, the enzyme is not transferred to hepatocytes. In addition, because hepatocytes still have extensive lysosomal storage after multiple injections of NP-GUSB, the transfer of partially degraded GAGS from hepatocytes to Kupffer cells for further degradation does not represent a significant mechanism for GAG clearance.Improvements in the auditory function of treated mps/mpsmice were more complete in P-GUSB-treated than in NP-GUSB-treated mice. This may be due in part to improvements in the conductive component of hearing caused by more complete correction of the bony defects by P-GUSB. However, the hearing improvements observed with P-GUSB in this study are less impressive than those reported previously following treatment with an enzyme also produced in mouse l-cells but that was less highly phosphorylated (70%) (26O'Connor L.H. Erway L.C. Vogler C.A. Sly W.S. Nicholes A. Grubb J. Holmberg S.W. Levy B. Sands M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grubb J.H. Kyle J.W. Cody L.B. Sly W.S. FASEB J. 1993; 7 (abstr.): 1255aGoogle Scholar). In addition, the reduction in lysosomal storage by P-GUSB observed in neurons and osteoblasts in the current study was less complete when compared with previous studies (12Sands M.S. Vogler C. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Levy B. Galvin N. Sly W.S. Birkenmeier E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Sands M.S. Vogler C. Torrey A. Levy B. Gwynn B. Grubb J. Sly W.S. Birkenmeier E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One hypothesis that could account for this difference is that the most complete clinical response may actually be achieved with a mixture of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme. Alternatively, the smaller clinical response observed in this study could reflect other subtle differences between enzyme preparations that we are unable to detect in our in vitroassays.In summary, results from this study show that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of GUSB can contribute to lysosomal storage reduction in a murine model of MPS VII. However, highly phosphorylated GUSB reduces storage in a wider range of cell types and results in a more complete clinical response than that seen using completely non-phosphorylated enzyme produced in insect cells. Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited disorders usually caused by the lack of a single lysosomal enzyme activity (1Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These diseases are usually progressive in nature, and children often present with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. It has been shown previously that exogenous lysosomal enzymes can be taken up by affected cells and can correct the metabolic defect (2Neufeld E.F. Fratantoni J.C. Science. 1970; 169: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This process, referred to as “cross-correction,” forms the basis for several therapeutic approaches (2Neufeld E.F. Fratantoni J.C. Science. 1970; 169: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Uptake of lysosomal enzymes is mediated by either the mannose 6-phosphate or mannose receptors (3Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 4Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Sly W.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Conceptually, the simplest therapeutic approach involves the systemic injection of a recombinant lysosomal enzyme containing oligosaccharides with exposed mannose or mannose 6-phosphate residues. Macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase with exposed mannose residues has been shown to be highly effective for Gaucher's disease where the pathology is largely restricted to fixed tissue macrophages. It is generally believed that enzymes modified with mannose 6-phosphate would be more efficacious for most other lysosomal storage diseases. This is due to the fact that, unlike the mannose receptor, which is limited to cells of the reticuloendothelial system, the mannose 6-phosphate receptor is present on most cell types (5Senior P.V.

We previously showed that enzyme replacement prevents the accumulation of lysosomal storage in the murine model of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII),1 a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in β-glucuronidase (GUSB) activity (12Sands M.S.

If untreated, the deficiency in GUSB activity leads to the progressive accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) in many tissues of the body. The resulting clinical symptoms include cognitive deficits, auditory defects, visual impairment, skeletal dysplasia, and shortened life span. A murine model of MPS VII has been described that shares most of these clinical symptoms (20Birkenmeier E.H. Davisson M.T. Beamer W.G. Ganschow R.E. Vogler C.A. Gwynn B. Lyford K.A. Maltais L.M.

The reduced lysosomal storage following enzyme replacement therapy correlates with dramatic improvements in bone development, cognitive ability, hearing, immune function, and life span (26O'Connor L.H.

Like most other enzyme replacement studies, the recombinant enzyme used in the MPS VII mouse was produced in mammalian cells and was composed of a mixture of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme (12Sands M.S.

FASEB J. 1993; 7 (abstr.): 1255aGoogle Scholar). Therefore, it has been difficult to determine which form of the enzyme produced which aspects of the clinical improvements. Here we show that the biodistribution and clinical efficacy of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated murine GUSB are different following intravenous injection into MPS VII mice. DISCUSSIONDirect enzyme replacement therapy has been proposed as a form of therapy for lysosomal storage diseases. Intravenous injection of glucocerebrosidase, a non-phosphorylated lysosomal enzyme, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of Gaucher's disease (8Barton N.W. Brady R.O. Dambrosia J.M. Di Bisceglie A.M. Dopplet H.S. Hill S.C. Mankin H.J. Murray G.J. Parker R.I. Argoff C.E. Grenwal R.P., Yu, K.T. Collaborators N. Engl. J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disease that primarily affects cells of the RE system. To produce a therapeutic enzyme, glucocerebrosidase has to be treated with a series of exoglycosidases to expose mannose residues, which target it to the mannose receptor on RE cells (4Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Sly W.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Takahashi K. Donovan M.J. Rogers R.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, for the majority of lysosomal storage diseases where both RE and non-RE cells are affected, enzyme will have to be targeted to cells that do not express the mannose receptor (i.e. the majority of non-RE cells). The mannose 6-phosphate receptor may provide access to many of those cells.We previously showed that multiple injections of murine GUSB, containing ∼70% phosphorylated enzyme, prevented the accumulation of lysosomal storage in multiple tissues when initiated in newbornmps/mps mice (12Sands M.S.

Its absence in hepatocytes is striking (Fig.2).Highly phosphorylated enzyme produced in mammalian cells (P-GUSB) is efficiently taken up by human fibroblasts exclusively by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent mechanism. This enzyme is also taken up in vitro by alveolar macrophages but by both the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and mannose receptor systems. Uptake by both non-RE and RE cells is also observed in vivo, because both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells contain enzyme. The macrophages can recognize both the phosphorylated oligosaccharides (via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor) and the non-phosphorylated oligosaccharides on P-GUSB (via the mannose receptor). Interestingly, the half-lives of both forms of enzyme are similar in the tissues examined. This result suggests that the phosphorylation status of GUSB does not affect stability, and once the enzymes localize to the lysosome, they degrade at approximately the same rate in most tissues.The different tissue distributions of P-GUSB and NP-GUSB also result in different degrees of lysosomal storage reduction. The reduction of lysosomal storage in the liver mirrors the distribution of the different enzymes. For example, NP-GUSB is localized almost exclusively to RE cells of the liver, and those are the only cells that have reduced storage; hepatocytes still contain distended lysosomes. In contrast, P-GUSB localizes to both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, and both cell types are cleared of storage. P-GUSB also localizes in other tissues such as meninges and reduces lysosomal storage there. These data indicate that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzymes correct lysosomal storage in the cells they target. These data also suggest that, once NP-GUSB is taken up by cells of the RE system in the liver, the enzyme is not transferred to hepatocytes. In addition, because hepatocytes still have extensive lysosomal storage after multiple injections of NP-GUSB, the transfer of partially degraded GAGS from hepatocytes to Kupffer cells for further degradation does not represent a significant mechanism for GAG clearance.Improvements in the auditory function of treated mps/mpsmice were more complete in P-GUSB-treated than in NP-GUSB-treated mice. This may be due in part to improvements in the conductive component of hearing caused by more complete correction of the bony defects by P-GUSB. However, the hearing improvements observed with P-GUSB in this study are less impressive than those reported previously following treatment with an enzyme also produced in mouse l-cells but that was less highly phosphorylated (70%) (26O'Connor L.H. Erway L.C. Vogler C.A. Sly W.S. Nicholes A. Grubb J. Holmberg S.W. Levy B. Sands M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grubb J.H. Kyle J.W. Cody L.B. Sly W.S. FASEB J. 1993; 7 (abstr.): 1255aGoogle Scholar). In addition, the reduction in lysosomal storage by P-GUSB observed in neurons and osteoblasts in the current study was less complete when compared with previous studies (12Sands M.S. Vogler C. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Levy B. Galvin N. Sly W.S. Birkenmeier E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Sands M.S. Vogler C. Torrey A. Levy B. Gwynn B. Grubb J. Sly W.S. Birkenmeier E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One hypothesis that could account for this difference is that the most complete clinical response may actually be achieved with a mixture of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme. Alternatively, the smaller clinical response observed in this study could reflect other subtle differences between enzyme preparations that we are unable to detect in our in vitroassays.In summary, results from this study show that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of GUSB can contribute to lysosomal storage reduction in a murine model of MPS VII. However, highly phosphorylated GUSB reduces storage in a wider range of cell types and results in a more complete clinical response than that seen using completely non-phosphorylated enzyme produced in insect cells. Direct enzyme replacement therapy has been proposed as a form of therapy for lysosomal storage diseases. Intravenous injection of glucocerebrosidase, a non-phosphorylated lysosomal enzyme, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of Gaucher's disease (8Barton N.W. Brady R.O. Dambrosia J.M. Di Bisceglie A.M. Dopplet H.S. Hill S.C. Mankin H.J. Murray G.J. Parker R.I. Argoff C.E. Grenwal R.P., Yu, K.T. Collaborators N. Engl. J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disease that primarily affects cells of the RE system. To produce a therapeutic enzyme, glucocerebrosidase has to be treated with a series of exoglycosidases to expose mannose residues, which target it to the mannose receptor on RE cells (4Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Sly W.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Takahashi K. Donovan M.J. Rogers R.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, for the majority of lysosomal storage diseases where both RE and non-RE cells are affected, enzyme will have to be targeted to cells that do not express the mannose receptor (i.e. the majority of non-RE cells). The mannose 6-phosphate receptor may provide access to many of those cells. We previously showed that multiple injections of murine GUSB, containing ∼70% phosphorylated enzyme, prevented the accumulation of lysosomal storage in multiple tissues when initiated in newbornmps/mps mice (12Sands M.S.

This reduction of lysosomal storage correlated with improvements in bone length, longevity, hearing, immune function, and cognitive ability (26O'Connor L.H. Erway L.C. Vogler C.A. Sly W.S.

We also showed that enzyme injections in adult animals reduced established lysosomal storage in many tissues with the exception of the brain (12Sands M.S. Vogler C. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Levy B.

However, most of these studies have been performed with enzyme produced in mammalian cells that contains a mixture of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme. Therefore, it has been difficult to determine which form of enzyme contributes to which component of the clinical response. It is known that insect cells do not contain the phosphotransferase activity required for the modification of terminal mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes, and relatively large quantities of enzymatically active lysosomal hydrolases can be produced in insect cells using the baculovirus system (35Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Prot. Exp. Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Aeed P.A. Elhammer A.P.

Gene. 1994; 144: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Murine GUSB produced in this system (NP-GUSB) has properties that would be expected of a non-phosphorylated enzyme. NP-GUSB is not taken up by human fibroblasts expressing the mannose 6-phosphate receptor but not the mannose receptor. On the other hand, NP-GUSB is taken up by alveolar macrophages, which express the mannose receptor, and this uptake is completely inhibited by yeast mannan. Its in vivobiodistribution is also typical of a macrophage-targeted enzyme in that it localizes primarily to tissues rich in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Liver provides the most striking example of this localization where the enzyme activity is largely restricted to sinus lining cells. Its absence in hepatocytes is striking (Fig.2).

TheArabidopsis H+/cation exchangers, CAX1 and CAX2, were identified by their ability to suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+transport. CAX1 has a much higher capacity for Ca2+transport than CAX2. An Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of CAX1, CAX3, is 77% identical (93% similar) and, when expressed in yeast, localized to the vacuole but did not suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport. Chimeric constructs and site-directed mutagenesis showed that CAX3 could suppress yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport mutants if a nine-amino acid region of CAX1 was inserted into CAX3 (CAX3-9). Biochemical analysis in yeast showed CAX3-9 had 36% of the H+/Ca2+ exchange activity as compared with CAX1; however, CAX3-9 and CAX1 appear to differ in their transport of other ions. Exchanging the nine-amino acid region of CAX1 into CAX2 doubled yeast vacuolar Ca2+transport but did not appear to alter the transport of other ions. This nine-amino acid region is highly variable among the plant CAX-like transporters. These findings suggest that this region is involved in CAX-mediated Ca2+ specificity.

The transient Ca2+signal is determined by two opposing fluxes, Ca2+ influx via channels and Ca2+ efflux via active transporters (4Sze H. Liang F. Hwang I. Curran A.C. Harper J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of Ca2+ channel function and Ca2+ pumps that are directly energized by ATP hydrolysis (Ca2+-ATPase) have been previously investigated (5MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

H+/Ca2+ antiporters have been cloned from bacteria, fungi, and plants (7Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

H+/Ca2+antiporters in general have 10–14 membrane-spanning domains with about 400 amino acid residues (10Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.-L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1646-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The H+/Ca2+antiporters contain a central hydrophilic motif rich in acidic amino acid residues (the acidic motif) that bisects the polypeptide into two groups of approximately equal length; however, little is known regarding the relationship between the primary sequence of any of these proteins and their biochemical properties. The Escherichia coli H+/Ca2+ antiporter, chaA, contains an acidic motif possessing striking sequence similarity to the calcium-sequestering protein calsequestrin (7Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this region has never been shown to mediate Ca2+ transport. In the yeast vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter,VCX1, amino acid residues within membrane-spanning domains appear to help mediate ion transport. A glycine to alanine change in the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain may modify H+/Ca2+ transport (8Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In another study, a point mutation in a central membrane-spanning domain has been implicated in altering the Mn2+ transport of VCX1 (11Del Pozo L. Osaba L. Corchero J. Jimenez A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In sum, these findings only hint at structural motifs involved in H+/cation specificity. Two Arabidopsis thaliana H+/Ca2+transporters, CAX1 (cation exchanger 1), and CAX2, were identified (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Hirschi K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 100-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) by their ability to sequester Ca2+ into yeast vacuoles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants deleted for the vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase (PMC1) and H+/Ca2+antiporter. Experiments utilizing vacuolar membranes from yeast cells expressing CAX1 or CAX2 demonstrate that CAX1 is a H+/Ca2+ exchanger and CAX2 is a H+/heavy metal cation antiporter (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the different cation transport properties between these gene products is difficult to discern in yeast because both gene products suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+transport. A CAX homolog has recently been cloned from Arabidopsis. The putative protein is 77% identical (93% similar) to CAX1 and has been previously termed AtHCX1 for A. thaliana homolog ofCAX1 (13Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently the name of this gene was changed to CAX3 (10Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.-L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1646-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). CAX3 is more similar to CAX1 than CAX2 is to CAX1. Unlike CAX1 and CAX2, CAX3 fails to suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport despite high level expression of the protein (13Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis genome contains numerous open reading frames that are similar to these CAX genes and apparently do not function in yeast vacuolar Ca2+transport (10Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.-L.

The CAX homologs, particularly CAX3, in conjunction with yeast functional expression analysis, may serve as valuable tools with which to dissect the structural determinants of CAX1-mediated Ca2+ specificity. The utility of yeast as an experimental tool to study amino acid residues involved in ion specificity is well documented (14Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To identify Ca2+ domains within the CAX gene family, we localized CAX3 and CAX1 in yeast. We then interchanged regions of CAX1 and CAX3 and assayed for function. We mapped the minimal changes in CAX3 that confer yeast vacuolar H+/Ca2+exchange. Similar modifications in CAX2 increased the Ca2+transport properties of this protein. These findings represent the first clues as to the structural basis of H+/Ca2+ exchange from any organism. K667(cnb1::LEU2 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1) was the yeast strain used to express chimeric and mutant genes (8Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The clones were propagated in either pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI), and inserts were transferred to the shuttle vector piHGpd (15Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) for their expression in the yeast. The plasmids were introduced into yeast by lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol transformation (16Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), and standard techniques were used to manipulate DNA (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). The coding sequences ofCAX1 and CAX3 were divided into four regions defined by unique internal restriction sites and the restriction sites on the vector. The chimeric clones were mobilized into the yeast expression vector and transformed into yeast.

Monoclonal mouse IgG against HA (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA), yeast vacuolar alkaline phosphatase (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and yeast dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (an endoplasmic reticulum indicator, Molecular Probes) were used at a 1:3000, 1:300 and 1:250 dilution, respectively.

Vacuolar membrane-enriched microsomes were prepared as previously described (21Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Measurements of the time dependence of Ca2+ uptake were done as previously described (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol.

The inhibition of uncoupler-sensitive Ca2+ uptake by other metals was determined from measurements of single samples taken 10 min after the addition of 10 μm45Ca2+ in the absence or presence of 100 μm CaCl2, CdCl2, or MnCl2. These ion concentrations are approximately 10 times the K m for Ca2+ of CAX1. Previously we have shown that CAX3 does not suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+transporters despite high level expression of CAX3 in these yeast cells (13Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Potentially, CAX3 and CAX1 may differ in their biochemical properties in yeast because of localization on different membrane fractions. To test this hypothesis, we HA-tagged both CAX1 and CAX3 at similar regions of the N terminus. The HA-CAX1 suppressed yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration, and HA-CAX3 expressed protein of the predicted molecular weight (data not shown). The colocalization of CAX1 and CAX3 is supported by the comigration of the two proteins in sucrose density gradients of membrane preparations obtained from yeast cells expressing the tagged proteins (Fig. 1). The sedimentation behavior of the membrane fraction containing both proteins is consistent with that of a vacuolar compartment. The two expressed plant transporters co-migrate with the yeast vacuolar marker alkaline phosphatase. CAX1 and CAX3 are highly similar throughout their deduced amino acid sequences. Thus, we made a series of chimeric constructs between the two open reading frames to determine which domains conveyed the different properties of vacuolar Ca2+ transport. The CAX variants used in this study do not contain the first 36 amino acids of the CAX open reading frame. The CAX1 and CAX2 open reading frames initially isolated by their function in yeast and used in this study do not contain this 36-amino acid N-terminal region. Compared with this CAX1 variant, the N terminus of the CAX3 open reading frame contains an additional 36 amino acids. If we delete this region, CAX3 still does not suppress the yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport (Fig.2 A, 1). The chimeric constructs were created with the N-terminal 36 amino acids of CAX3 not present. Thus, the CAX1 and CAX3 constructs used here initiate at amino acid 37. The N terminus of CAX1 and CAX3 appeared to convey the different properties of Ca2+ transport (Fig. 2 A,2–3). The N terminus of CAX1 fused in-frame to CAX3 (CAX3-α) conferred vacuolar Ca2+ transport properties onto K667 yeast cells (deleted in the yeast vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase and vacuolar H+/Ca2+exchanger). Alternatively, if the N terminus of CAX3 is fused in-frame to CAX1 (CAX1-α), K667 strains expressing this transporter did not suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity. If the central or C terminus of CAX3 was fused in-frame to CAX1 (CAX1-β/CAX1-γ or CAX1-δ, respectively), the phenotype of K667 cells expressing these hybrid proteins was indistinguishable from CAX1-expressing cells. Conversely, if the central or C terminus of CAX1 was fused in-frame to CAX3 (CAX3-β/CAX3-γ or CAX3-δ, respectively), these hybrid proteins did not suppress the K667 cells. In total, these findings showed that a region at the N terminus of these open reading frames determined the differences in vacuolar Ca2+ transport. We then took the N terminus of CAX1 and CAX3 and divided this region in two. We demonstrated that the region between amino acids 74 and 149 defined the majority of the differences between CAX1 and CAX3. That is, if the region from 74–149 of CAX1 was fused in-frame to CAX3 (CAX3-α2), this hybrid transporter suppressed the K667 yeast cell Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 2 A, 4). Meanwhile, if the region from 37 to 73 of CAX1 was fused in-frame to the CAX3 open reading frame (CAX3-α1), the hybrid CAX3 protein did not strongly suppress the yeast mutant. Expression of this chimeric protein weakly suppressed the Ca2+ sensitivity of the yeast strains but only after multiple days of growth on the Ca2+-containing media. Once we had defined the region between 74 and 149 as important for vacuolar Ca2+transport, we decided to specifically exchange the polymorphic 9-amino acid regions (amino acid residues from 87–95) in CAX1 and CAX3. The nine-amino acid region of CAX1 fused in-frame to CAX3 (termed CAX3-9) conferred Ca2+ suppression when expressed in yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport (Fig. 2 A,5). The nine-amino acid region of CAX3 fused in-frame to CAX1 (termed CAX1-9) inhibited ability of CAX1 to suppress the K667 Ca2+-sensitive phenotype. We have termed this nine-amino acid region of CAX1 the “Ca2+ domain.” We proceeded to focus on CAX3. Expression of CAX3 chimeras containing the first six amino acids from the Ca2+ domain of CAX1 suppressed the K667 Ca2+ sensitivity; however, CAX3 chimeras expressing the last six amino acids of the Ca2+domain of CAX1 did not suppress the yeast mutant (data not shown). Expression of a CAX3 hybrid that expressed the first three amino acids from the CAX1 Ca2+ domain (termed CAX3-ICT) suppressed the yeast mutant (Fig. 2 A, 6). This suppression was not as pronounced as that seen with the exchange of the entire nine-amino acid region; it usually took 2 days to observe significant colony growth on Ca2+-containing media. Meanwhile, expression of hybrid CAX3 containing the second three amino acids or the last three amino acids from the Ca2+ domain of CAX1 did not suppress the K667 strain. In total, these observations specifically identified a three-amino acid region as an important determinant for CAX3 vacuolar Ca2+ transport in yeast. We proceeded to individually substitute each of the three CAX3 amino acids for the corresponding amino acids found in the CAX1 Ca2+ domain (L87I, A88C, N89T). Only the CAX3 variant containing the leucine-to-isoleucine change (termed CAX3-I) conferred Ca2+ tolerance on the K667 yeast strain (Fig.2 A, 7). This suppression was not as pronounced as that seen with the exchange of the entire 9-amino acid Ca2+domain, but substantial growth could be seen after 2 days on the Ca2+-containing media. To demonstrate that the changes in Ca2+ transport were not due to alteration in protein expression or stability, we assayed the yeast strains for expression of the CAX transporters. All yeast cells transformed with various CAX constructs appeared to express approximately equal amounts of CAX protein (Fig. 2 B; data not shown). The assay of yeast growth on Ca2+-containing media does not allow us to make precise measurements about changes in H+/Ca2+ antiport activity. CAX1 has been shown to restore vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiport activity to yeast strains deficient in this transporter (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Presumably, CAX3 fails to suppress yeast strains deficient in vacuolar Ca2+transport due to the inability of this transporter to drive Ca2+ transport into the yeast vacuole. It stands to reason that variants of CAX3 that suppress the vacuolar Ca2+transport-deficient strains do so by H+/Ca2+antiport activity. To directly test H+/Ca2+antiport activity, we isolated yeast endomembrane vesicles purified from vector control, CAX1-, CAX3-, CAX3-9- and CAX3-I-transformed K667 cells, and examined their capacity forΔpH-dependent Ca2+ uptake. The addition of MgCl2/ATP and establishment of a steady-state ΔpH by the V-ATPase associated with the vacuolar membrane before the addition of Ca2+ resulted in uptake by membrane vesicles from the CAX1-, CAX3-9-, and CAX3-I-transformed cells (Fig.3 A). The CAX1-, CAX3-9-, and CAX3-I-expressing vesicles had the uptake capabilities of ∼2.60, 0.95 (36.5% of CAX1), and 0.19 (7.1% of CAX1) nmol/mg of protein, respectively. Although the rates varied between various membrane preparations, the CAX3-9 yeast vesicles always had less than 40% of the Ca2+ uptake capacity compared with CAX1 (data not shown). The CAX3-expressing vesicles showed no H+/Ca2+ antiport activity. In CAX1-, CAX3-9-, and CAX3-I-expressing K667 vesicles, the inclusion of gramicidin in the uptake medium decreased 45Ca2+ uptake to a level similar to that seen in the absence of MgCl2/ATP (data not shown). The low rate of uptake found in vesicles from K667 cells transformed with control vector or CAX3 was not inhibited by gramicidin or by the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin (data not shown). These results together with the release of45Ca2+ seen with the addition of the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, to CAX1, CAX3-9, and CAX3-I vesicles versus the small increase seen in45Ca2+ uptake with vector control and CAX3 vesicles demonstrate that CAX1-, CAX3-9-, and CAX3-I-generated uptake is concentrative. Inhibition of ΔpH-dependent Ca2+uptake by other metals was compared between CAX1- and CAX3-9-expressing vesicles. CAX1 was significantly inhibited by the presence of excess Ca2+ and Cd2+ but not Mn2+, whereas CAX3-9 was only inhibited by Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B). Regardless of whether antiport activity was assayed as V-ATPase-dependent (bafilomycin A1-sensitive)45Ca2+ uptake (data not shown) orΔpH-dependent (gramicidin-sensitive) uptake, the initial rate for vacuolar membrane-enriched vesicles purified for CAX3-9- and CAX3-I-transformed vesicles increased as a simple hyperbolic (Michaelian) function of Ca2+concentration to yield an apparent K m value of 20 ± 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig.4). CAX2 suppresses yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport but has a lower capacity for Ca2+ transport than does CAX1 (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this nine-amino acid Ca2+ domain confers different transport properties in vacuolar Ca2+ transport onto these transporters, we moved the nine-amino acid domain from CAX1 into CAX2 (termed CAX2-9). Yeast cells harboring the CAX2-9 gene grew better in Ca2+-containing media than did CAX2-containing cells (Fig.5). We then purified endomembrane vesicles from vector control, CAX2-, and CAX2-9-transformed K667 cells and examined their capacity forΔpH-dependent Ca2+ uptake. The yeast cells expressing CAX2-9 were capable of H+/Ca2+ transport at a rate approximately twice that of yeast cells expressing CAX2 (Fig. 5 B). We also verified that equal amounts of CAX protein were expressed in the CAX2-9- and CAX2-expressing cells (data not shown). It has been previously demonstrated that CAX2 is able to transport Cd2+ and Mn2+ as well as Ca2+ (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,22Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V. Wilganowski N. Wagner G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to determine whether theΔpH-dependent uptake of45Ca2+ into CAX2-expressing endomembrane vesicles could be inhibited by excess concentrations of Ca2+, Cd2+, or Mn2+. CAX2-dependent Ca2+ uptake was significantly inhibited by all metals (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether this inhibition was altered by swapping the nine-amino acid domain of CAX1 into CAX2, this experiment was repeated with endomembrane vesicles from CAX2-9-transformed cells. CAX2-9-dependent Ca2+uptake was inhibited by the various metals in a manner indistinguishable from CAX2 (Fig. 5 C). The deduced amino acids that constitute this nine-amino acid Ca2+domain populate one of the most polymorphic regions within the CAX group of putative transporters (Fig.6) (13Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). None of the amino acids are identical in this region of CAX1, CAX2, and CAX3. The regions flanking this region are quite similar to each other within each region. In the first putative membrane-spanning domain, 35% (7/20) of the CAX1, CAX2, and CAX3 amino acids are identical. In the second putative membrane-spanning domain 67% (10/15) are identical. However, this region is not the only domain that varies among the CAX open reading frames. The region between the putative fifth and sixth membrane-spanning domain shares only 11% (2/18) identity among CAX1, CAX2, and CAX3. Furthermore, although the amino acids in the acidic motif are quite similar, they are less than 10% identical among these genes (13Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In plants, fungi, and bacteria control of cytosolic Ca2+ levels has been attributed in part to a low affinity, high capacity H+/Ca2+ exchanger. These transporters have been biochemically characterized, and many of the open reading frames have been identified (7Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S.

Emerging genomic studies indicate common motifs among the characterized transporters and a burgeoning number of H+/Ca2+ exchanger homologs (10Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.-L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1646-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, computer modeling studies, which attempt to ascribe transport function based on primary sequence information, are hindered by the lack of any biological studies focusing on the functional domains required for H+/Ca2+ exchange. Utilizing theArabidopsis CAX transporters and a robust yeast suppression screen, we have probed the structural basis of H+/Ca2+ exchange. Recently, we have shown that CAX1 may contain an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain (23Pittman, J. K., and Hirschi, K. D. (2001) Plant Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). CAX2 and CAX3 may also contain N-terminal autoinhibitory domains. Thus, there may be additional elements that modulate plant H+/Ca2+ exchange; however, in the experiments detailed here, we have uniformly used CAX variants (CAX1 37–463) that do not contain this regulatory region. Utilizing a yeast screen, a region of 9 amino acids (residues 87–95 in the CAX1 construct utilized here) can account for a large portion of the vacuolar Ca2+ transport differences between CAX1 and CAX3 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The fact that CAX1 and CAX3 both appear to be highly expressed in yeast and localize at the yeast vacuole (13Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig.1) suggests that we have identified a domain involved in transport and not protein stability or membrane targeting. Furthermore, the chimeric constructs differed significantly in their transport properties (Figs.2 and 3) but were all expressed at approximately equal levels (Fig.2 B). The acidic motif (residues 264–282 in CAX1), which has been implicated in Ca2+ transport (7Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not define the majority of differences between the Ca2+ transport properties of CAX1 and CAX3 (Fig. 2). In yeast assays, when the 9-amino acid region from CAX1 was mobilized into CAX3, the chimeric gene product had a low K m for Ca2+ and 36.5% of the Ca2+ transport capabilities of CAX1. The CAX3-9 construct differed from CAX1 in terms of ions that could compete with Ca2+ transport (Fig. 3 B). Ca2+uptake by CAX1 was inhibited by Ca2+ and Cd2+, indicating that it is able to transport both of these metals, whereas it appears that CAX3-9 can transport Ca2+ but not Cd2+; this suggests that interchanging this domain does not significantly alter the transport of other ions. Although these experiments certainly imply that this region is important in Ca2+ specificity, the inability to fully confer CAX1-like phenotypes on CAX3 suggests that other regions in CAX1 affect some elements of Ca2+ transport. However, consistent with the premise that this region defines an important component of the Ca2+ recognition differences between CAX1 and CAX3, when the nine-amino acid region from CAX3 was placed into CAX1, it totally inhibited CAX1-mediated vacuolar Ca2+ transport (Fig. 2). Given these findings, we labeled this nine-amino acid region the Ca2+ domain. The mechanism by which the Ca2+ domain regulates ion transport is unknown. This region appears to be a hydrophilic loop that separates membrane-spanning domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 6). The CAX1 hydrophobicity plot predicts that the N-terminal regulatory region and the Ca2+ domain are located on opposite sides of the membrane (orientation unknown). Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest that the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain does not directly interact with the Ca2+domain. 2J. K. Pittman and K. D. Hirschi, unpublished observations. Thus, these two domains may act independently to regulate ion transport. Given the regulatory role of the N terminus, we favor a model in which the N terminus is cytoplasmic. This orientation would be consistent with the regulatory C terminus for animal Na+/H+antiporters (24Wiebe C.A. DiBattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem.

Given that Ca2+binding or transport sites are usually acidic amino acids and no acidic amino acids are within this domain, it is unlikely the Ca2+domain directly binds Ca2+ ions. This region may restrict the movement of the transmembrane-spanning domains so that a Ca2+ ion can either enter or be blocked from the “pore.” The modifications of the CAX2 Ca2+ domain further support the role of this region in Ca2+ selectivity. Expression of CAX2 in yeast demonstrates that this transporter has a lower capacity for Ca2+ transport than does CAX1 (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In our assay conditions in yeast, we found the apparent K m for Ca2+ of both CAX1 and CAX2 to be ∼20 ± 10 μm (data not shown); thus, the difference between these transporters appears to lie in their capacity to transport Ca2+. In plants, CAX2 localizes to the plant vacuolar membrane and transports metals and Ca2+ into the vacuoles (22Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V. Wilganowski N. Wagner G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). When the Ca2+ domain of CAX1 was fused to CAX2, the result was an increase in vacuolar Ca2+ transport with no noticeable change in transport of other ions (Fig. 5). A single leucine-to-isoleucine change in the Ca2+ domain allowed the CAX3 gene product to weakly suppress the yeast vacuolar transport mutant (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, this single amino acid change conferred a relatively low apparent K m for Ca2+ to the chimeric CAX3 (Fig. 4). This isoleucine may interact with side chains of specific amino acids from various transmembrane segments of CAX3 to aid in co-ordination of Ca2+ or H+. Thus, the CAX transporters may contain several Ca2+ domains that collectively coordinate ion transport. Given that our experimental procedure compared the CAX transporters to each other, we may have simply identified the Ca2+ domain that is the most polymorphic between these transporters. Although structure/function studies of H+/Ca2+exchangers are limited, other cotransporters such as Na+/H+ antiporters have been extensively studied (25Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Williams K.A.

A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Histidine residues are candidates for H+-sensing amino acids in Na+/H+antiporters, and these face the cytoplasmic side. CAX1 contains only six histidine residues, but their role in transport has not been evaluated. Structural studies demonstrate a novel membrane-protein motif for the E. coli Na+/H+antiporter, NhaA. Other studies identify the mechanisms involved in pH sensitivity and cation binding and transport by Na+/H+ antiporters (24Wiebe C.A. DiBattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fundamental mechanism of cotransporters may be conserved, so insights from those studies may help direct future work related to H+/Ca2+ exchangers. Only in relatively few structure/function studies of Ca2+and heavy metal transporters have some of the amino acid residues that determine ion specificity, binding, or transport been identified (5MacLennan D.H.

This study identified residues in one particular domain of a H+/Ca2+ exchanger that may be important for Ca2+ ion specificity. This type of approach may allow researches to alter the duration of cytosolic Ca2+ pulses in different organisms. Some microbial antiporters appear to be able to mediate both Na+ and Ca2+ transport (7Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

Using the appropriate yeast suppression screens, it may be feasible to map the substrate-determining regions for these transporters. In plant systems, the ability to modulate CAX-mediated transport and ectopically express these modified genes in plants offers the potential to manipulate both nutrient content and signal transduction events.

We have recently reported that a number of features associated with this G protein inhibition are dependent on the G protein β subunit isoform (Arnot, M. I., Stotz, S. C., Jarvis, S. E., Zamponi, G.

Here, we have examined the abilities of different types of ancillary calcium channel β subunits to modulate the inhibition of α1B N-type calcium channels by the five known different Gβ subunit subtypes. Our data reveal that the degree of inhibition by a particular Gβ subunit is strongly dependent on the specific calcium channel β subunit, with N-type channels containing the β4 subunit being less susceptible to Gβγ-induced inhibition. The calcium channel β2asubunit uniquely slows the kinetics of recovery from G protein inhibition, in addition to mediating a dramatic enhancement of the G protein-induced kinetic slowing. For Gβ3-mediated inhibition, the latter effect is reduced following site-directed mutagenesis of two palmitoylation sites in the β2aN-terminal region, suggesting that the unique membrane tethering of this subunit serves to modulate G protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels. Taken together, our data suggest that the nature of the calcium channel β subunit present is an important determinant of G protein inhibition of N-type channels, thereby providing a possible mechanism by which the cellular/subcellular expression pattern of the four calcium channel β subunits may regulate the G protein sensitivity of N-type channels expressed at different loci throughout the brain and possibly within a neuron.

It is now well established that this inhibitory mechanism occurs via a direct interaction between the G protein βγ dimer and the calcium channel α1 subunit (Refs. 1Ikeda S.R.

Upon Gβγ binding, the channels experience an increase in first latency to opening (4Patil P.G. de Leon M. Reed R.R. Dubel S. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2509-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is seen as a decrease in peak current amplitude, a slowing of the time course of activation, and a slowed macroscopic time course of inactivation at the whole cell level. The inhibition can be relieved by application of a strong depolarizing voltage prepulse (5Bean B.P. Nature. 1989; 340: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), which causes a transient dissociation of the G protein complex from the channel (6Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The overall degree of inhibition is strongly dependent not only on the nature of the calcium channel α1 subunit (7Bourinet E. Soong T. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The notion of a Gβ subunit isoform dependence of this G protein effect is also supported by the observation that protein kinase C is able to antagonize the inhibition of N-type calcium channels by Gβ1 subunits, but not that mediated by other Gβ subunit isoforms (13Cooper C.B.

It is now widely accepted that Gβγ physically interacts with the domain I–II linker (14Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P.

In view of this target site overlap, it may not be surprising to note that the presence of the calcium channel β subunit has been shown to antagonize G protein action (7Bourinet E. Soong T. Stea A.

Four different types of calcium channel β subunits (β1b, β2a, β3, and β4) (22Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) are expressed in rat brain and have been shown to differentially affect dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of cloned N-type calcium channels in Xenopus oocytes (20Canti C. Bogdanov Y. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 419-432Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, use of receptor-coupled inhibition of the channels does not permit access to the detailed effects of the calcium channel β subunit on the inhibition profile of the five known types of G protein β subunits. Here, we have utilized transient coexpression of α1B calcium channels with specific combinations of calcium channel β subunits and Gβ isoforms to address this issue. Our data show that G protein modulation of N-type calcium channels is dependent on the β subunit and varies with the Gβ subunit isoform present. Moreover, the β2a subunit modulates G protein action in a unique manner by slowing the interaction rates between the channel and the G proteins as well as by mediating a dramatic enhancement of the abilities of Gβ subunits to stabilize the closed conformation of the channel. Thus, the nature of the calcium channel β subunit is an important determinant of G protein efficacy and may give rise to substantial heterogeneity in the susceptibility of native N-type channels to G protein inhibition. Wild-type calcium channel cDNA constructs were supplied by Dr. Terry Snutch. The wild-type G protein cDNA constructs used were the same as those described by us previously (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fluorescently tagged Gβ proteins were created using the Living ColorsTM C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which attaches a GFP tag to the N terminus of the protein of interest. Each Gβ subunit was excised from the pMT2 vector using previously engineered (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar)XhoI and KpnI restriction sites flanking the inserts, subcloned in frame into the EGFP vector, and sequenced. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the full-length β2a construct contained in the pMT2 expression vector using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by us previously (23Stotz S.C. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33001-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis primers included a diagnostic silent restriction enzyme site (SacI) that was used to confirm the presence of the mutation. A 2.9-kilobase ApaI-EagI fragment was excised from the original, non-mutated, full-length construct and substituted into the construct that had undergone mutagenesis. The remaining ∼600 base pairs of coding sequence of the “mutated” construct were entirely sequenced to rule out mutagenesis errors and to confirm the presence of the mutation. Human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells were grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) as described previously (23Stotz S.C. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33001-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After splitting with trypsin/EDTA, the cells were plated on glass coverslips at 5–10% confluence and transfected (after a 12-h recovery period) with calcium channel subunits (α1B + α2δ + β), the reporter gene pEGFP (CLONTECH), and with various combinations of Gβ and Gγ2 as appropriate. Approximately 12 h after transfection, the cells were washed, allowed to recover for 12 h, and then moved to 28 °C and maintained for 24–72 h before electrophysiological characterization or fluorescence confocal microscopy. Imaging was carried out at the Seaman Family MR Research Center Confocal Microscopy and Imaging Facility. Coverslips containing cells of interest were placed in a glass-bottom Petri dish and visualized with an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope (magnification × 40). Confocal images were created using an Olympus Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope (confocal aperture 2). Cells were stimulated with an argon 488-nm laser, and settings for laser power, photo multiplier tube gain, and offset were chosen such that pixel densities were just below saturation levels. Visualization of the transmitted images was done with differential interference contrast/Nomarski interference contrast. Whole cell recordings were carried out as described in detail by Arnot et al. (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were bathed in a recording solution consisting of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, and 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Whole cell patch clamp recordings utilized an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) and pCLAMP Version 7.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF150-86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 puller and fire-polished using a Narashige Microforge, yielding pipettes with resistances of 3–4 megaohms. The internal pipette solution contained 108 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 4 mmMgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, and 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Data were filtered at 1 kHz and recorded directly onto the hard drive of the computer. Series resistance and capacitance were compensated, but no on-line leak subtraction was used. Currents were evoked by stepping from −100 mV to a test potential of +20 mV. The degree of tonic voltage-dependent G protein inhibition was assessed by the degree of current facilitation that occurred after application of a 50-ms depolarizing prepulse to +150 mV 5 ms prior to the test depolarization. For Fig. 1, the degree of prepulse relief was determined by integrating the area under the current records obtained before and after the prepulse up to an arbitrary time point of 5 ms, thus reflecting the effect of G proteins on net charge entry (24Lu O. AtKisson M.S. Jarvis S.E. Feng Z.-P. Zamponi G.W. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of development of facilitation,I(+PP)/I(−PP) peak current ratios as a function of prepulse duration were fitted monoexponentially as described (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), where I(−PP) and I(+PP) are the peak current amplitudes before and after the prepulse (see Fig. 2 for pulse paradigms). The time constant for recovery from facilitation after the prepulse was determined by monoexponential fits toI(+PP)/I(−PP) peak current ratios obtained at various time points after the termination of the prepulse (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The time constants for activation (before and after the prepulse) were estimated from monoexponential fits to the late rising phase of the whole cell currents. The raw data were analyzed using Clampfit and Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific) software. All figures were generated using Sigmaplot Version 4.0.

Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody to the bovine G protein β1 subunit was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (catalog no. G29629). Immunoblots were subjected to chemiluminescence analysis using ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected on Eastman Kodak BioMax film. Upon coexpression of N-type calcium channels with G protein βγ subunits, the channels undergo a tonic G protein inhibition and enter a reluctant gating mode that is seen at the whole cell level as a slowed time course of current activation (termed kinetic slowing) and a decrease in peak current amplitude (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both the kinetic slowing and the reduction in peak current amplitude can be conveniently removed by application of a strong depolarizing prepulse to reveal the control (i.e.non-inhibited) current waveform. The increase in peak current amplitude following the prepulse (termed facilitation) is commonly used as an indication of the degree of voltage-dependent inhibition mediated by the G proteins. Fig. 1 A displays a family of current records obtained with α1B (+α2δ) calcium channels coexpressed with Gβ3γ2 and one of the four individual types of calcium channel β subunits. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the degree of facilitation seen with Gβ3 was dependent on the nature of the calcium channel β subunit in at least two ways. First, in the presence of the β2a subunit, Gβ3 induced a dramatic slowing of the activation kinetics such that activation remained incomplete 150 ms into the test depolarization (note the expanded time scale in Fig.1 A). Second, the degree of prepulse facilitation seen with Gβ3 was less pronounced in the presence of the calcium channel β3 and β4 subunits. Thus, the calcium channel β subunit appears to be an important determinant in regulating Gβ3 modulation of N-type calcium channel activity. To obtain a quantitative measure of the degree of facilitation, we integrated the areas under the first 5 ms of the current waveforms obtained before and after the prepulse for various calcium channel β subunit/Gβ combinations (Fig. 1, B–D). As shown in Fig.1 B, in the absence of exogenously expressed G proteins, little if any facilitation was seen in the presence of the calcium channel β1b or β3 subunit, whereas slightly higher background levels were observed with β2a. In the presence of exogenously expressed Gβ1, Gβ3, or Gβ4, significant facilitation was observed for all calcium channel β subunits examined, but the total degree of facilitation appeared to vary with both the Gβ subtype and the nature of the calcium channel β subunit. For example, with the calcium channel β1b subunit, a significantly larger degree of facilitation (p < 0.05) was seen with Gβ3 compared with the other Gβ isoforms. By contrast, for the other three types of calcium channel β subunits, the degree of facilitation did not differ significantly among the three Gβ isoforms. To provide a better indication of the effects of the four calcium channel β subunits on the modulation by a particular Gβ subunit, the data shown in Fig. 1 B were plotted in a three-dimensional format in Fig. 1 C. As shown for Gβ3, there was no significant difference among the facilitation ratios obtained following coexpression of β1b, β2a, and β3, whereas facilitation was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) in the presence of the calcium channel β4 subunit. For Gβ1, a slightly different pattern became apparent, with facilitation being significantly greater in the presence of the calcium channel β2a subunit compared with β1b(p < 0.05). The responses observed with Gβ2 and Gβ5 are illustrated in Fig. 1 D on an expanded scale. Gβ2, which we had previously found to mediate only weak effects on β1b-containing α1B channels (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), did not appear to affect α1B calcium channels coexpressed with any of the other three channel β subunits. Perhaps more interestingly, Gβ5, which we had shown previously not to affect α1B + β1b calcium channels (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), induced a significant inhibition of N-type calcium channels containing the β2a subunit (Fig. 1 C), indicating that this structurally unique Gβ subunit is capable of interacting with the N-type calcium channel under certain circumstances. Overall, the data in Fig. 1 show that the inhibitory effects of various Gβ isoforms are differentially modulated by the four different calcium channel β subunits. To unequivocally interpret the experiments shown in Fig. 1, it is important to ensure appropriate expression levels of the five G protein β subunits to rule out the possibility of a mixed population of G protein-bound/unbound channels. We have previously shown via Western blot analysis that Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4 can be effectively exogenously expressed in tsA-201 cells and at levels that are well beyond endogenous background Gβ subunits (13Cooper C.B.

Moreover, we obtained similar results with Gβ5subunits. 2M. I. Arnot and G. W. Zamponi, unpublished data. To determine whether the G proteins are also appropriately targeted to the plasma membrane, we generated EGFP-conjugated versions of the five Gβ subunit subtypes in which a GFP tag was fused to the Gβ N terminus. These were then expressed in tsA-201 cells to confirm their appropriate expression and targeting. As shown in Fig.2 A, all of the five G protein β subunit isoforms were effectively targeted to the plasma membrane and appeared at comparable levels. To rule out the possibility that one of the four calcium channel β subunits might negatively affect Gβ expression, we carried out Western blot analysis on tsa-201 cells transfected with Gβ1, α1B, α2δ, and each of the four calcium channel β subunits. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the exogenous expression of Gβ1 resulted in a dramatic increase in Gβ protein that did not appear to be affected by the nature of the calcium channel β subunit. Together with our previous findings (13Cooper C.B. Arnot M.I. Feng Z.-P. Jarvis S.E. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40777-40781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these results indicate that all five G protein β subunits are effectively expressed and targeted in tsa-201 cells and that the expression occurs independently of the type of calcium channel β subunit that is present. To examine the dependence of the G protein kinetics (Fig.3) for various calcium channel β subunit/Gβ subunit combinations, we used the paradigms described in detail by Arnot et al. (10Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Varying the duration of the prepulse yields the time constant for development of facilitation, which reflects the kinetics of the dissociation of the G protein-channel complex. In contrast, varying the interval between the prepulse and the test depolarization yields the time constant for recovery from facilitation, which is a reflection of the kinetics of reassociation between the G protein and the channel (6Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Assuming a 1:1 interaction between the G protein and the channel (6Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Bertram R. Behan M. J. Comput. Neurosci. 1999; 7: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the former will be independent of G protein concentration and thus independent of the absolute levels of Gβ expression. However, the recovery from facilitation is dependent on the absolute levels of Gβ, which are not known in a given cell and must therefore be cautiously interpreted. For these experiments, we focused on Gβ1, Gβ3, and Gβ4 because the inhibitory effects of Gβ2 and Gβ5 could be observed only with a single calcium channel β subunit. Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the calcium channel β subunit on the time constant for recovery from facilitation (Fig. 3 A) and on the time constant for development of facilitation (Fig. 3 B) by the three active Gβ subunit isoforms. For Gβ1, the time constant for recovery from facilitation was similar for all calcium channel β subunits, whereas that seen with Gβ3 and Gβ4 was dramatically slowed in channels containing the β2a subunit. A similar effect of the calcium channel β2a subunit could be observed with the time constant for development of facilitation; however, here, primarily responses by Gβ1 and Gβ4 were affected. Interpreted mechanistically, these data suggest that the calcium channel β2a subunit induces a channel conformation in which G proteins might encounter a reduced access to their site of action on the channel, but once associated with the channel, are more tightly bound compared with channels containing other types of calcium channel β subunits. We reiterate that the kinetics of recovery from facilitation are expected to be dependent on the free concentration of Gβγ. However, we note that for each of the three Gβ isoforms, the only variable is the type of calcium channel β subunit; and hence, for a particular Gβ subunit isoform, the effects observed with β2a are likely due to a direct effect of this subunit on G protein access to its binding site on the channel, rather than due to a diffuse concentration effect. Overall, these data indicate that the nature of the calcium channel β subunit is important in determining the rate of unbinding (and possibly binding) between certain G protein β subunit isoforms and the channel, consistent with a partial overlap of the binding sites for the calcium channel β subunit and Gβγ on the α1B subunit. Fig.4 examines the effects of different Gβ subunit isoforms on the activation kinetics of α1Bcalcium channels, coexpressed with different ancillary calcium channel β subunits, in the form of ratios of activation time constants obtained before and after application of the prepulse. Although a slowing of the activation kinetics was seen with every calcium channel β subunit/Gβ isoform combination, the kinetic slowing induced by the three Gβ isoforms was dramatically enhanced in channels coexpressed with the β2a subunit such that G proteins were able to slow the activation kinetics of the α1B/β2a/α2δ heteromultimer by as much as 25-fold (see also Fig. 1 A). A subset of these experiments was repeated using the EGFP-coupled Gβ1subunit to ensure high G protein expression levels in cells chosen for patch recordings. Compared with wild-type Gβ1, the GFP-fused constructs resulted in slower kinetics for development of and recovery from facilitation (data not shown), which is perhaps not surprising given the relative sizes of the GFP tags and the G protein subunit (23 and 35 kDa, respectively). And yet, with regard to the ability of β2a to enhance the G protein-induced kinetic slowing, the pattern seen with the GFP-tagged Gβ1 subunit closely paralleled that observed with the wild-type protein (Fig.4 C), suggesting that the unique effects of β2aare not skewed by cells expressing low amounts of Gβ. Perhaps more importantly, the activation time constants obtained before and after the prepulse could in every case (i.e. for both wild-type and GFP-fused Gβ subunits) be fitted monoexponentially (Fig.4 A). The absence of biphasic (i.e. mixed fast and slow) activation components prior to application of the prepulse indicates that all of the channels are tonically in a reluctant mode and consequently must be associated with a G protein. This lends additional support to our contention that we are not dealing with a heterogeneous population of G protein-bound and -unbound channels in our experiments. Finally, we note that there was no significant difference in the activation time constants obtai"
https://openalex.org/W1993165787,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae can accumulate iron through the uptake of siderophore-iron. Siderophore-iron uptake can occur through the reduction of the complex and the subsequent uptake of iron by the high affinity iron transporter Fet3p/Ftr1p. Alternatively, specific siderophore transporters can take up the siderophore-iron complex. The pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can also take up siderophore-iron. Here we identify a C. albicans siderophore transporter, CaArn1p, and characterize its activity. CaARN1 is transcriptionally regulated in response to iron. Through expression studies in S. cerevisiae strains lacking endogenous siderophore transporters, we demonstrate that CaArn1p specifically mediates the uptake of ferrichrome-iron. Iron-ferrichrome and gallium-ferrichrome, but not desferri-ferrichrome, could competitively inhibit the uptake of iron from ferrichrome. Uptake of siderophore-iron resulting from expression of CaARN1 under the control of the MET25-promoter in S. cerevisiae was independent of the iron status of the cells and of Aft1p, the iron-sensing transcription factor. These studies demonstrate that the expression of CaArn1p is both necessary and sufficient for the nonreductive uptake of ferrichrome-iron and suggests that the transporter may be the only required component of the siderophore uptake system that is regulated by iron and Aft1p."

We presently investigate the interactions between STAT5b and hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factors (HNFs) that contribute to regulation of GH pulse-inducible, male-specific liver cytochrome P-450 (CYP) genes. STAT5 binding sites were identified in the 5′-flank of the adult male-expressed genesCYP2A2 (nucleotides −2255 to −2247), CYP4A2(nucleotides −1872 to −1864), and CYP2C11 (nucleotides −1150 to −1142).

This STAT5b inhibitory effect could be reversed by HNF1α and reflects a functional antagonism between STAT5b and HNF3β, as evidenced by the inhibition of HNF3β DNA binding and transcriptional activity by STAT5b. HNF3β, in turn, inhibited STAT5b by a novel mechanism that leads to suppression of GH-inducible STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding activity, and transcriptional activity.

Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and humans (2Veldhuis J.D. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In male rats, GH is released into circulation every ∼3–3.5 h, giving a repeated, pulsatile plasma hormone pattern (3Tannenbaum G.S. Martin J.B. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), which contrasts to the more frequent, nearly continuous profile of pituitary GH secretion seen in adult females. These sexually dimorphic plasma GH patterns directly regulate the sexually dimorphic pattern of liver gene expression, in particular, liver cytochrome P-450 (CYP) gene expression (4Shapiro B.H. Agrawal A.K. Pampori N.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Waxman D.J. Chang T.K.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 391-417Google Scholar). Well studied examples of sex-specific, GH-regulated liver CYPs include the male-specific androgen 16α- and 2α-hydroxylase CYP2C11, which is strongly induced at puberty in male but not female rat liver, and the steroid sulfate 15β-hydroxylase CYP2C12, which is exclusively expressed in adult female rat liver (6Waxman D.J.

The sexual dimorphism of liver with respect to expression of these and other sex-dependent liver CYPs, including CYP2A2 and CYP4A2 (both male-specific in their expression), is regulated by GH at the level of transcription initiation (8Sundseth S.S.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GH signaling is initiated by GH receptor dimerization at the cell surface, leading to activation of the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. JAK2, in turn, activates multiple intracellular signaling proteins (10Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 11Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J.

Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The intermittent stimulation of liver cells by successive plasma GH pulses triggers a rapid and repeated tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT5b in adult male rats. By contrast, in adult female rats, the more continuous pattern of GH exposure down-regulates GH receptor-JAK2 activity, leading to a low steady-state level of the transcriptionally active, nuclear STAT5b (14Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5126-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Choi H.K. Waxman D.J.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4599-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A close correlation between STAT5b nuclear translocation and sex-specific liver gene expression is also seen in mouse liver (17Sueyoshi T. Yokomori N. Korach K.S. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Targeted gene disruption studies establish that STAT5b, but not the closely related (>90% identical) STAT5a, plays a critical role in the physiological, sex-dependent responses of the liver to GH (18Davey H.W. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 959-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, STAT5b-deficient male mice exhibit a loss of sexually dimorphic liver CYP gene expression in addition to a loss of pulsatile GH-stimulated pubertal growth (19Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G.

By contrast, STAT5a is a principal and obligate mediator of mammopoietic and lactogenic signaling stimulated by prolactin in the mammary gland (22Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Liu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7567-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the above studies demonstrate an important role for STAT5b in maintaining the male-specific pattern of liver gene expression, the molecular details of the gene regulatory mechanisms whereby STAT5b contributes to the sexual dimorphism of the liver have remained elusive. In the case of the female-specific CYP2C12 gene, GH-activated STAT5b is proposed to interfere with the strong, synergistic trans-activation of promoter activity effected by two liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF6 and HNF3β (23Delesque-Touchard N. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34173-34182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms contributing to the GH-regulated, sexual dimorphic expression of CYP2C12 have also been proposed (24Waxman D.J. Zhao S. Choi H.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37117-37124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of the male-expressedCYP2C11, an initial promoter analysis revealed the presence of two negative regulatory regions (“silencers”) (28Strom A. Equchi H. Mode A. Legraverend C. Tollet P. Stromstedt P.E. Gustafson J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 805-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the identification of other functional elements and the potential role of STAT5b and specific liver transcription factors in regulating either basal on hormone-dependent transcription of this gene have not been described. Several liver transcription factors contribute to the liver-specific expression of hepatic CYPs. These include the variant homeodomain protein HNF1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), the winged helix factor HNF3, the nuclear receptor HNF4, and the one-cut homeoprotein HNF6 (29Gonzalez F.J. Lee Y.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These liver transcription factors function in unique combinations, often synergistically, to activate liver-expressed genes via a complex array of interactions. For example,HNF6 expression is stimulated by HNF4 and inhibited by C/EBPα (30Rastegar M. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas HNF3β positively regulates the expression ofHNF4 and HNF1α and their downstream targets (31Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the HNF6 gene can be regulated by GH, resulting in its sex-dependent expression by a mechanism involving STAT5b and HNF4 (32Lahuna O. Rastegar M. Maiter D. Thissen J.P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As noted above, GH-dependent and liver-specific expression ofCYP2C12 in adult female rats is proposed to reflect cooperative regulation by HNF3β and HNF6 (23Delesque-Touchard N. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34173-34182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as by HNF4 and HNF6 (27Sasaki Y. Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Kamataki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37117-37124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the general importance of these transcription factor cascades in liver-specific gene expression is well established, only limited information is available regarding their particular role in the GH-regulation of sex-specific liver CYP gene transcription. Unique combinations of factors and interactions between GH-regulated STAT and liver-expressed regulators appear likely and may be required to establish and maintain the liver-specific and sexually dimorphic profiles of CYP gene expression. The present study investigates the influence of GH-activated STAT5b on the expression of CYP2C11 and its regulation by liver-enriched transcription factors. Our findings demonstrate that2C11 gene expression is subject to regulation by GH-activated STAT5b in a manner that is modulated by two liver transcription factors that trans-activate the2C11 promoter, HNF3β and HNF1α. Moreover, novel inhibitory cross-talk between HNF3β and GH-activated STAT5b is described. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of current models for the sex-dependent regulation of CYP2C11 expression by plasma GH pulses.

The STAT5 ntcp reporter plasmid 4x-pT109-Luc, containing four copies of a naturally occurring STAT5 response element, and the HNF3 reporter (6xHNF3)-Cdx-2-Luc were respectively provided by Drs. M. Vore (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) and R. Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Segments of the 2C115′-flank were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Fischer 344 rat genomic DNA as template and then subcloned into theSacI and XhoI sites of the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega) with the assistance of D. Ding of this laboratory. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out for 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Sense primers were as follows: 5′-GGC ATA AAG TGG TGG AT-3′ (nts −1769 to −1753), 5′-GGA GGT GCC TGT TCT GG-3′ (nts −1208 to −1194), 5′-GTC ACT TCA GAG GTT-3′ (nts −1182 to −1168), 5′-GTT ATT CCC GCA TTC TC-3′ (nts −968 to −952), and 5′-GGG GGT GCC TTA GTT GG-3′ (nts −633 to −617). Sense primers were paired with a common antisense primer, 5′-GCA GCC TTC CTC AGG GAG-3′ (nts +22 to +5), to generate five corresponding 2C11 promoter reporter constructs: −1769/2C11-Luc, −1208/2C11-Luc, −1182/2C11-Luc, −968/2C11-Luc, and −633/2C11-Luc. −1533/2C11-Luc was generated from −1769/2C11-Luc by digestion with SacI and SacII, followed by filling in and religation. Sequence analysis of the2C11 promoter constructs revealed the presence of only one of the two GCTA repeats at nts −47 to −40 reported in GenBankTM (accession number XB79081). This sequence was present in amplified genomic DNA from three independent Fischer 344 rat genomic DNA polymerase chain reactions. 2C11 promoter nucleotide positions were numbered according to GenBankTMXB79081 after removing the four nucleotides corresponding to the extra GCTA sequence. Luciferase reporters containing a single copy of the wild-type or mutated 2C11 STAT site (STAT5/2C11-Luc and STAT5mut/2C11-Luc, respectively) were prepared as follows. Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to wild-type or mutated2C11 nts −1159 to −1138 (see Fig. 2 A) and containing XbaI and BglII site adapters were subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the luciferase reporter pGL3 promoter. A reporter plasmid containing two tandem copies of the 2C11 STAT5 site subcloned into pGL3 promoter 2x STAT5/2C11-Luc was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Jounaidi of this laboratory. Wild-type and mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Untreated adult Fischer 344 rats and hypophysectomized rats treated with rat GH, rat prolactin, or lipopolysaccharide were described earlier (13Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol.

HepG2 human hepatoma and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 × 105cells/well in 24-well plates. The cells were transfected with FuGENE 6TM reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FuGENE 6-DNA complexes were prepared as described in the manufacturer's protocol at a ratio of 1.3 to 1 (FuGENE 6:DNA, v/w). Typically, each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate received a total of 800 ng of DNA: 50–200 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid (200 ng of 2C11promoter-Luc or 50 ng of either STAT5/2C11-Luc, 4x-pT109-Luc, or (6x-HNF3)-Cdx-2-Luc), 100 ng of GH receptor, 200 ng of STAT5b, and 200 ng HNF expression plasmid. pRL-tk-Luc plasmid (Renillaluciferase; 50 ng) was included in all transfections as an internal control for transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, the cells either were treated with 200 ng/ml rat GH for 18–20 h or were left untreated. Cell lysates were prepared by shaking the cells in 150 μl of 1× Promega lysis buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual reporter assay system (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminesence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Firefly luciferase activity values were divided by Renillaluciferase activity values to obtain normalized luciferase activities (mean ± SD values for n = 3 separate transfections, unless indicated otherwise). Relative luciferase activities were then calculated to facilitate comparisons between samples within a given experiment. Individual group comparisons were examined for statistical significance using the two-tailed Student'st test (p < 0.05). Cell extracts were prepared for EMSA and Western blot analysis as follows. COS-1 and HepG2 cells were seeded on 35-mm tissue culture dishes at ∼60% confluency and incubated overnight. A total of 3.2 μg of plasmid DNA containing GH receptor, STAT5b, and/or HNF3β expression plasmid and Renilla luciferase was transfected using FuGENE 6, as specified in each figure legend. 36 h later, the cells were either stimulated with 200 ng/ml GH for 30 min or were left untreated. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with 100 μl of 1× Promega lysis buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell extracts were incubated in a cold room for 30 min with shaking and then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatants were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad Dc detergent protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell extract (10 μg) was incubated for 10 min in EMSA reaction buffer, consisting of 3% glycerol, 700 μm MgCl2, 350 μm EDTA, 350 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 10 fmol of32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (∼30,000 cpm) was then added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature then 10 min on ice, followed by the addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol). For STAT5b supershift analysis, rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT5b antibody was added 10 min after addition of the 32P-labeled DNA probe, followed by an additional 10-min incubation. For HNF3β supershift/complex disruption analysis, goat polyclonal anti-HNF3β antibody was incubated with the sample for 10 min prior to addition of the labeled DNA probe. The samples were electrophoresed for 3–4 h at 4 °C through a 5.5% nondenaturing gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (for the2C11 STAT5 site probe; see below) or in 0.25× TBE buffer (for the 2C11 HNF3-STAT5 probe) following a 30-min pre-electrophoresis step. The gels were exposed to PhosphorImager plates overnight and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA). EMSA analysis was performed using the following DNA probes: STAT5 site probes from rat CYP2C11, CYP2A2, andCYP4A2 genes, as listed in Fig. 1 A; theβ-casein STAT5 probe used earlier (13Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); ratCYP2C11 HNF3-STAT5 site, nts −1174 to −1138 (sense: 5′-(g)aga ggt taa tta aat gca aac aat TTC CAT GAA aaaa-3′; antisense: 5′-(g)tttt TTC ATG GAA aat gtt tgc att taa acc tct-3′); and mutated HNF3-STAT5 probe. Mutations were introduced either in the HNF3 binding site (aa tgc aaa catt to aa tgaattgatt-3′) or the STAT5 binding site (TTC CAT GAA to Tat CAT GAA) of the wild-type HNF3-STAT5 probe. Nucleotides corresponding to a STAT5 consensus site are shown as capital letters; those corresponding to an HNF3 consensus site are shown in bold type, with the mutated residues underlined. Cell extracts (20 μg) were electrophoresed on 7.5% Laemmli SDS gels, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with anti-Tyr(P)699 STAT5b antibody, as described in the manufacturer's protocol, or with anti-STATb5 antibody. For immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT5b antibody, cell extract (70 μg) was preimmune-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 200 μl of IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads and 1 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and anti-STATb5 antiserum was added to the precleared cell lysate and incubated for 3 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation after a further 1 h of incubation with 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C, washed three times with 300 μl IP buffer, and resuspended in 30 μl of 1.5× SDS gel sample buffer. The samples were then analyzed on Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 using blocking and probing conditions described earlier (13Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was visualized on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To reprobe with rabbit polyclonal HNF3β antibody, nitrocellulose membranes were heated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 50 °C. Membranes were blocked in Solution I (0.3% Tween 20 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HNF3β serum (diluted 1:4000 dilution in blocking solution). The results are presented in figures prepared from gray scale scans of portions of the x-ray films of each blot. Scans were obtained using a Cannon IX-4015 scanner and Ofoto scanning software. Computer analysis revealed the presence of STAT5 consensus sites (TTC NNN GAA) in the 5′-flanking DNA ofCYP genes 2A2, 2C11, and 4A2 (Fig.1 A). Each of theseCYPs is expressed in rat liver in a male-specific manner and is regulated by the temporal pattern of pulsatile plasma GH stimulation (see the introduction). No STAT5 consensus sites were found in the 5′-flank of numerous other rat CYP genes, including CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A1, 2B2, 2C6, 2E1, and 4A1, which are not subject to male-specific, GH pulse regulation (data not shown). To ascertain whether the CYP STAT5 sites are functional in STAT5 binding, EMSA analyses were carried out using liver nuclear extracts prepared from adult male rats killed at the time of a plasma GH pulse when STAT5b is active and nuclear (15Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the formation of a single DNA-protein complex by the CYP2A2(lanes 1 and 4) and CYP4A2 STAT5 site probes (lanes 14 and 17). These complexes were strongly competed by unlabeled probe (lanes 2 and15) and were supershifted by anti-STAT5b antibody (lanes 3 and 16). Little or no specific complex was formed with liver nuclear extracts prepared from female livers (lanes 7–9 and lanes 20 and 21) or from livers of male rats killed between GH pulses (lanes 6and 19) when STAT5b is primarily cytoplasmic and inactive (15Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes of the same mobility were formed by male liver nuclear extracts incubated with an establishedβ-casein STAT5 probe and with extracts of GH-treated COS-1 cells transfected with STAT5b and GH receptor (lanes 13 and12, respectively, and data not shown). These complexes were distinguished from the complex formed by STAT5a, which migrates more slowly (e.g. lane 11 versus lanes 1,4, and 12). STAT5a is much less abundant than STAT5b in liver tissue (20Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast to the discrete STAT5b-containing complex formed by theCYP2A2 and CYP4A2 STAT5 site probes, theCYP2C11 STAT5 site probe formed a diffuse protein-DNA complex when incubated with male rat liver nuclear extract (Fig.1 B, lane 23). Supershift analysis confirmed the presence of STAT5b protein in the complex (lane 25). Formation of the STAT5 supershifted complex was male-specific (lane 25 versus lane 28) and could be induced by treatment of hypophysectomized rats with a pulse of GH (lane 27 versus lane 26 and lane 30 versus lane 29). Complex formation was not induced by treatment of rats with lipopolysaccharide or prolactin (lanes 31 and 32), neither of which activates liver STAT5 (13Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mutation of the core STAT5 binding site abolished STAT5 binding to the 2C11 promoter probe, whereas mutation of the adjacent upstream sequence was without effect (Fig.2 A). To determine whether the STAT5 site is functional in mediating GH-stimulated reporter gene activity, luciferase reporter constructs driven by the 2C11 STAT5 site were transfected into HepG2 cells together with expression plasmids for GH receptor and STAT5b. GH stimulated a 1.8-fold increase in luciferase reporter activity driven by the wild-type 2C11 STAT5 site but not when the STAT5 core sequence contained a mutated STAT5 site (Fig. 2 B, left panel). This modest increase was observed in three independent experiments but did not reach statistical significance. However, GH-stimulated reporter activity was significantly increased, by ∼3-fold, by adding a second copy of the isolated 2C11STAT5 site. GH had no effect in cells transfected with the inactive STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation site mutant, STAT5b-Y699F (Fig.2 B, right panel). We conclude that GH-activated STAT5b binds to the STAT5 site of 2C11 in a functional, transcriptionally active manner. To further characterize the GH dependence of2C11 transcriptional activity, we prepared six luciferase reporter constructs containing various lengths of 2C11promoter sequence, ranging from 1769 to 633 nts of 5′-flanking DNA and extending to nt +22 relative to the transcription start site. These constructs were individually transfected into HepG2 cells together"

Here we present evidence that eIF3j/Hcr1p is an RNA binding protein that enhances a late step in 40 S ribosome maturation involving cleavage of the 20 S precursor of 18 S rRNA in the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence staining shows that eIF3j/Hcr1p is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. The hcr1Δ mutant exhibits a decreased amount of 40 S subunits, hypersensitivity to paromomycin, and increased levels of 20 S pre-rRNA. Combining the hcr1Δ mutation withdrs2Δ or rps0aΔ, deletions of two other genes involved in the same step of 40 S subunit biogenesis, produced a synthetic growth defect. p35, the human ortholog of eIF3j/Hcr1p, partially complemented the slow growth phenotype conferred byhcr1Δ when overexpressed in yeast. heIF3j/p35 was found physically associated with yeast eIF3 and 43 S initiation complexesin vitro and in vivo. Because it did not complement the 40 S biogenesis defect of hcr1Δ, it appears that heIF3j can substitute for eIF3j/Hcr1p only in translation initiation. We conclude that eIF3j/Hcr1p is required for rapid processing of 20 S to 18 S rRNA besides its role in translation initiation, providing an intriguing link between ribosome biogenesis and translation. eIF3j/Hcr1p, a protein associated with eIF3, was shown to bind to, and stabilize, the multifactor complex containing eIFs 1, 2, 3, and 5 and Met-tRNA iMet, whose formation is required for an optimal rate of translation initiation.

The assembly of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits occurs primarily in a specialized subnuclear compartment termed the nucleolus, but the final steps occur in the cytoplasm. A large number of proteins and small nuclear RNAs participate in ribosome biogenesis (for review see Ref. 1Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the process of translation initiation, several translation initiation factors (eIFs)1 orchestrate the assembly of an 80 S initiation complex containing methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA iMet) located in the P site of the ribosome and based paired with the AUG start codon in the mRNA (for review see Ref. 2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Correct completion of this process is crucial for further decoding of the genetic information during the elongation phase of translation. In general, proteins acting in the ribosome assembly process do not participate in translation and vice versa. Here we describe a protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is involved in the maturation of 40 S subunits and also in assembly of the 43 S preinitiation complex, an important intermediate in translation initiation. These findings may indicate that ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation are more closely coordinated processes than was previously thought. The 9.1-kb rDNA unit encoding all four rRNAs occurs in about 100–200 copies repeated on chromosome XII of S. cerevisiae. Ribosome biogenesis begins by transcription of the rRNA genes by RNA polymerase I to produce the 35 S rRNA precursor. The 35 S pre-rRNA is processed into the 20 S and 27 S pre-rRNA species, the direct precursors of 18 S rRNA, found in the 40 S subunit, and the 25 S and 5.8 S rRNAs found in the 60 S subunit, respectively. The third rRNA (5 S), found in the 60 S ribosome, is transcribed independently by RNA polymerase III (1Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Maturation of the 35 S pre-rRNA, involving 10 known processing sites, is closely coordinated with ribosomal assembly and requires many different trans-acting factors and small nuclear RNAs as well as ribosomal proteins (rps). In addition, many specific nucleosides in the rRNA are covalently modified shortly after transcription (1Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). During the assembly process, pre-rRNAs associate with many rps and other nonribosomal proteins in the nucleolus to form preribosomal particles (3Trapman J. Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most of the rps assemble into subunits in the nucleolus, although some final steps of maturation take place after transport of subunits to the cytoplasm (4Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1412-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the pre-rRNA processing pathway has been extensively studied over the past few decades, the cytoplasmic phase of the ribosome maturation process is still poorly understood (1Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Hcr1p, a yeast ortholog of the j/p35 subunit of the human translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (5Block K.L. Vornlocher H.P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was identified as a high copy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive (Ts−) phenotype of the rpg1-1 allele of TIF32/RPG1, encoding the largest subunit of yeast eIF3 (eIF3a) (6Valášek L. Trachsel H. Hašek J. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21253-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Valášek L. Hašek J. Trachsel H. Imre E.M. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27567-27572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The eIF3 complex stimulates several steps in the translation initiation pathway, including dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into 40 S and 60 S subunits, binding of a ternary complex (TC) consisting of Met-tRNA iMet, eIF2, and GTP to the small subunit (forming the 43 S preinitiation complex) and recruitment of mRNA to the 43 S complex to produce the 48 S complex (2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently that a network of interactions physically links eIF3j/Hcr1p to the two largest subunits of eIF3, eIF3a/Tif32p, and eIF3b/Prt1p (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). eIF3j binds to an RNA recognition motif (RRM) in eIF3b and makes multiple contacts with eIF3a. Interestingly, eIF3a contains an internal domain related to eIF3j, which is part of its binding domain for the eIF3b RRM. Moreover, eIF3j and eIF3a can bind simultaneously to the eIF3b RRM. These findings, plus the fact that overexpressing eIF3j suppresses the Ts− phenotype of mutations in eIF3a and eIF3b, suggest that eIF3j enhances one or more critical functions of the eIF3 complex in translation initiation (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We also showed recently that yeast eIF3, together with eIF1, eIF5, and the TC, comprise a multifactor complex (MFC) that occurs free of the ribosomes and is an important intermediate in translation initiation (9Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A portion of eIF3j associated with eIF3 also resides in the MFC. The elimination of eIF3j did not prevent binding of MFC components to 40 S ribosomes but affected the stability of the MFC and impeded a step later in the pathway prior to 60 S subunit joining. Consistently, eIF3j was found stably associated with 43–48 S preinitiation complexesin vivo (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Presumably, it binds to the 40 S ribosome in association with the MFC and remains bound to the initiation complex until 60 S subunit joining occurs. There is also evidence that eIF3j can interact with 40 S ribosomes independently of eIF3 and other components of the MFC. A temperature-sensitive mutation in the eIF3b subunit of eIF3 (prt1-1) led to dissociation from 43–48 S complexes of the majority of eIFs 1, 2, and 5 and the subunits of eIF3 in a heat-treated cell extract; by contrast, the majority of eIF3j remained bound to the 40 S ribosomes (10Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2954-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of HCR1 also reduced the abundance of 40 S ribosomes, indicating that eIF3j has a second function in ribosome biogenesis or maintenance. This may account for the ability of eIF3j to interact with 40 S subunits independently of eIF3 (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we present several lines of evidence implicating eIF3j in the 40 S ribosome assembly pathway. Deletion of HCR1 reduced the rate of processing of 20 S pre-rRNA to mature 18 S rRNA, the final step in assembly of the 40 S subunit, taking place in the cytoplasm. Consistently, eIF3j was found to be predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The hcr1Δ mutation also conferred hypersensitivity to the drug paromomycin, which binds specifically to 40 S subunits, and it showed synthetic slow growth (Slg−) phenotypes when combined with null alleles of two other genes implicated in 20 S pre-rRNA processing. Interestingly, the human ortholog of eIF3j partially suppressed the Slg− phenotype of hcr1Δ but did not reduce the defect in 40 S ribosome biogenesis. Apparently heIF3j/p35 can supply only the function of eIF3j involved in translation initiation in yeast cells. We conclude that eIF3j is a unique protein with separable functions in translation initiation and 40 S ribosome biogenesis. Table I contains brief descriptions of all plasmids employed in this study.

BecauseBamHI cleaves twice in the middle of hTIF32,SalI-cut YCpLV718 was digested partially withBamHI to isolate the hTIF32 open reading frame (ORF) intact. To insert the TIF32 ORF behind the T7 promoter, the 2.9-kb NdeI-PstI fragment of pGAD-TIF32 (13Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was inserted between the NdeI andPstI sites of pT7-7 (14Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

BecauseNdeI cuts in the middle of TIF32, intact ORF DNA was obtained by partial NdeI digestion of pGAD-TIF32. An integrating plasmid expressing p35 (human eIF3j) from the constitutive GPD promoter was constructed as follows. A 0.75-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment bearing cDNA encoding human p35 was isolated from YCpMETp35-T (see above) and inserted between the BamHI and HindIII sites of p426-GPD (American Type Culture Collection). The resulting p426-GPDp35 vector was digested withSacI-HindIII, and the 1.6-kb fragment carrying human p35 cDNA behind the GPD promoter was inserted between the SacI and HindIII sites of YIplac211 (11Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) to produce YIpGPDp35. As a last step, the latter integrative plasmid was EcoRV-digested and introduced into the YLVH13 strain. To create pLVT7–18 S rRNA, we first generated a fragment encoding 18 S rRNA by polymerase chain reaction using S. cerevisiaegenomic DNA as a template and the following primers, which introducedNdeI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively: LV18 S1 (5′-GGAGGCATATGTATCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGT-3′) and LV18 S2 (5′-CCAGGAAGCTTTAATGATCCTTCCGCAGGTTC-3′). The fragment was then digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated with NdeI- and HindIII-digested pT7-7 (14Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Strain W303 (MAT a ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3) was obtained from A. Hopper. We purchased the following haploid deletion strains made by the Saccharomyces Deletion Project (Research Genetics): BY4741 (MAT a his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), 16704 (MATα hcr1Δ::KanMX his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), 4844 (MAT a rps0aΔ::KanMX his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and 382 (MAT a drs2Δ::KanMX his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), and crossed them to obtain HCR1/hcr1Δ DRS2/drs2Δ and HCR1/hcr1Δ RPS0A/rps0aΔ diploid strains. After sporulation, the tetrads were dissected on YPD media, and the spores were scored for kanamycin resistance (deleted alleles carrykanR cassette), further analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and tested for growth at 30 °C on YPD media. The resulting strains were as follows: YLVh-r (MAT a hcr1Δ::KanMX rps0aΔ::KanMX his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and YLVh-d (MAT a hcr1Δ::KanMX drs2Δ::KanMX his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0). The strain YLH13-G35 (MATαhcr1Δ::LEU2 ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3::URA3::GPDp35) was produced by transforming strain YLVH13 with YIpGPDp35 DNA digested withEcoRV. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (15Hašek J. Kovarik P. Valášek L. Malinská K. Schneider J. Kohlwein S.D. Ruis H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that rabbit polyclonal anti-Hcr1p antibody (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was applied at a 1:1000 dilution in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/PEMI (0.1m PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 6.9) at 25 °C for 60 min. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma Chemical Co.) diluted 1:200 were used as secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were pre-adsorbed overnight at 4 °C on fixed spheroplasts permeabilized with acetone. To diminish background fluorescence in yeast cells due to unbound antibodies, all incubation and washing steps were done in suspension in a test tube. Before observation the cells were resuspended in TBS (Tris-buffered saline: 0.05 m Tris, 150 mm NaCl2, pH 10.5) containing 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and 0.01% (w/v) p-phenylenediamine (Sigma). Samples were visualized with the Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope equipped with standard filter sets (FITC: excitation 490–495 nm, emission 523 nm; Cy3: excitation 540–552 nm, emission 570 nm) using a 100×/1.4 N.A. (numeric aperture) oil immersion objective. Images were recorded at 1280 × 1024 pixel resolution using a Fluoview-cooled charge-coupled device camera using analySIS software. Purified recombinant GST fusion proteins (approximately 2 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex), which was prewetted in 100% methanol. The membrane was washed several times in a renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated in a large volume of the latter buffer overnight at 4 °C. The filter was then blocked in a binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% I-Block (Tropix)) and incubated for 4 h in a small volume of the same buffer containing 50 pmol of biotinylated 18 S rRNA, synthesized in vitro from pLVT7–18 S rRNA using the T7/SP6 MAXIscript kit (Ambion). The bound 18 S rRNA was detected using the nonisotopic BrightStar BioDetect kit (Ambion) according to the vendor's instructions. Polysome profile analysis and subsequent Western blot analysis of gradient fractions, preparation of whole cell extract, immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down experiments were conducted as described previously (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase labeling of pre-rRNA and Northern blot analysis were conducted according to (16Kressler D. de la Cruz J. Rojo M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7283-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We showed previously that deletion of HCR1 leads to a reduction in the level of 40 S ribosomal subunits (8Valášek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valášková V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To analyze this defect in greater detail, we examined ribosomal profiles of isogenic hcr1Δ and wild-type strains. Both strains were grown in YPD medium (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar), and cycloheximide was added to one-half of each culture at 5 min prior to harvesting to arrest translating ribosomes and preserve the polysomes. The cells from these portions of the culture were lysed in a buffer containing cycloheximide and Mg2+, and polysomes were resolved by velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients. As observed previously, deletion of HCR1 led to a reduction in the abundance of free 40 S subunits and a marked increase in the pool of free 60 S subunits (Fig. 1 A). A sizable proportion of inactive ribosomal subunits normally occurs as 80 S couples (18Foiani M. Cigan A.M. Paddon C.J. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3203-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); hence, the presence of a large excess of free 60 S subunits most likely indicates a deficiency in 40 S subunits. To test this prediction, the untreated portions of the two cultures were lysed in the absence of Mg2+ to permit dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into free 40 S and 60 S subunits (Fig. 1 B). Quantification of the A254 level in the 40 S and 60 S peaks in this and two other replicate experiments revealed a 60 S/40 S ratio of 2.24 with a standard error of 0.09 for the mutant compared with a value of 1.92 with a standard error of 0.07 for the wild-type. These figures correspond to a reduction of ∼14% in the amount of 40 S subunits in the hcr1Δ mutant compared with wild-type. We calculated that the increase in free 60 S subunits observed for the hcr1Δ mutant in Fig. 1 Arepresents ∼10% of the total 60 S subunits present in the gradient. Thus, the accumulation of free 60 S subunits seen in thehcr1Δ mutant in Fig. 1 A can be accounted for by the ∼14% reduction in total 40 S subunits calculated from Fig.1 B. Integration of the HCR1 gene into the genome of the hcr1Δ strain restored the 60 S/40 S ratio to the wild-type value (data not shown). These data confirm that eIF3j is required for a normal level of 40 S subunits. To obtain additional evidence that 40 S ribosome biogenesis is defective in the hcr1Δ mutant, we tested it for sensitivity to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin, which is known to inhibit strongly the growth of mutants with defects in biogenesis of 40 S ribosomes. (16Kressler D. de la Cruz J. Rojo M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7283-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The hcr1Δ strain grows more slowly than the wild-type on minimal SD medium (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar), but this difference in growth rate was greatly accentuated on SD medium containing 0.5 μg/ml paromomycin (Fig. 1 C). Therpg1-1 (eIF3a) and hcr1Δ mutations impair the growth rate on SD medium by similar amounts at 30 °C; however, the difference in growth rate between rpg1-1 mutant and wild-type colonies was nearly the same in the presence or absence of paromomycin (Fig. 1 C). Thus, inactivation of eIF3j substantially increased sensitivity to paromomycin, whereas the defect in eIF3a conferred by rpg1-1, known to reduce translation initiation in vivo (6Valášek L. Trachsel H. Hašek J. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21253-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), produced only a subtle increase in drug sensitivity. These findings are consistent with the idea thathcr1Δ impairs 40 S ribosome biogenesis in addition to reducing eIF3 function. To explore whether eIF3j might be involved in early steps of 40 S maturation, which take place in the nucleolus, or in the final processing events occurring in the cytoplasm, its subcellular localization was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. eIF3j antibodies stained intensely the cytoplasm of wild-type cells (Fig. 2 A) but stained weakly both the nuclei, visualized by DAPI staining (Fig.2 C), and the vacuoles, visualized by Nomarski optics (Fig.2 G). No overlap in the staining with eIF3j antibodies and DAPI was evident when the two images were merged (Fig. 2 E). As expected, the eIF3j antibodies did not stain hcr1Δ cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, eIF3j is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, consistent with a role in the final steps of 40 S biogenesis occurring in this compartment. The direct precursor of 18 S rRNA is 20 S rRNA, which is processed at cleavage site D after being transported from nucleolus to cytoplasm. To address whether eIF3j is involved in this event, we examined the kinetics of pre-rRNA processing in hcr1Δ cells by a pulse-chase experiment. Cells were grown in SC medium (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar) lacking methionine, and the pre-rRNA was pulse-labeled for 1 min with [methyl-3H]methionine and chased with cold methionine for 2, 5, and 15 min. The processing of pre-rRNA to mature 18 S and 25 S rRNAs occurs very rapidly and is nearly complete after a 2-min chase in the wild-type strain (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–3). After a 2-min chase in the hcr1Δ mutant, by contrast, a considerable amount of 20 S pre-rRNA remained, and there was a commensurate reduction in the accumulated amount of 18 S rRNA. The ratio of 18 S to 20 S signals after a 2-min chase in the mutant was ∼1.5, compared with the corresponding ratio for the wild-type of ∼10 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and6). By 5 min of chase, 20 S to 18 S processing was complete in both mutant and wild-type. This experiment was repeated three times, in some cases adding time points of 1.5 and 3.5 min, with results very similar to those shown in Fig. 3 A. Taken together, these experiments showed that processing of 20 S to 18 S rRNA was nearly complete by 1.5 min in wild-type cells but not until 3.5 min in thehcr1Δ mutant. Thus, we conclude that processing of 20 S to 18 S rRNA is delayed in the hcr1Δ mutant. This is the final processing step for the 40 S subunit, which occurs in nascent subunits exported to the cytoplasm. We did not detect an accumulation of 35 S or 32 S precursors, or the 23 S aberrant product, in thehcr1Δ mutant, which would indicate defects in nucleolar steps of 18 S rRNA biogenesis. Generally, the 35 S and 32 S precursors are detectable only in mutants where an early step of pre-rRNA processing is delayed. Surprisingly, we did observe a delay in 27 S pre-RNA to 25 S rRNA process"

Recent evidence from animal models suggests that the vasoactive peptide, endothelin (ET-1), may be an important negative regulator of ENaC in vivo. We investigated the signaling pathway involved in endothelin-mediated ENaC inhibition. Experiments were performed in NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing genes for the three (α, β, and γ) ENaC subunits. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, we found that ET-1 treatment induced a dose-dependent decrease in amiloride-sensitive currents. Using receptor-specific antagonists, we determined that the effects of ET-1 were attributed to activation of the ETB receptor. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of ET-1 on ENaC could be completely blocked when cells were pretreated with the selective Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2. Further studies revealed that basal Src family kinase activity strongly regulates ENaC whole cell currents and single channel gating. These results suggest that Src family kinases lie in a signaling pathway activated by ET-1 and are components of a novel negative regulatory cascade resulting in ENaC inhibition.

Although this activation is generally thought to mediate the mitogenic effects of endothelins, acute activation of NHE3 via ET-1 is blocked ∼50% by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (17Chu T.S.

The function of ETB has been examined in rats with naturally occurring mutation of the ETB gene. These studies indicate that ETB plays an essential role in development of enteric neurons because absence of functional ETB receptors causes perinatal lethality resulting from megacolon (20Hosoda K.

These data indicate that endothelin, acting on ETB receptors, mediates tonic inhibition of ENaC, and that this inhibition may be required for the maintenance of blood pressure. ENaC, the product of three distinct genes (α, β, and γ), is a low conductance Na+-selective channel that provides the rate-limiting step in electrogenic Na+ transport across the apical membrane of many epithelial tissues including the distal nephron (24Canessa C.M.

Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Garty H. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1270-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, aldosterone acts on cytosolic mineralocorticoid receptors to potently stimulate the absorption of Na+ across cells of the distal nephron and colon (32May A. Puoti A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this stimulation is accomplished in part via increased transcription of ENaC subunits, aldosterone also induces the transcription of the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), which activates ENaC (33Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37834-37839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, vasopressin and insulin are known to stimulate the activity or expression of ENaC in some model systems (35Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Canessa C.M. Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F454-F461PubMed Google Scholar, 37Marunaka Y. Hagiwara N. Tohda H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F392-F400PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, few hormonal pathways that potently inhibit ENaC activity have been described. Evidence that rats and mice lacking functional ETBreceptors develop salt-sensitive hypertension supports a role for ET-1 inhibition of ENaC activity. In A6 cells, a Xenopus model of the distal nephron, ET-1 dramatically down-regulates ENaC activity, although the pathway linking ETB receptors to ENaC was not identified (38Gallego M.S. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F451-F460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to identify the signaling pathway linking activation of ET receptors to inhibition of ENaC in mammalian cells. We found that ETB receptors act via Src family kinases to potently inhibit ENaC open probability. This provides a novel mechanism of ENaC regulation and explains the inhibitory influence of ETB on ENaC activity. The identification of signaling proteins that potently inhibit Na+ absorption in the distal nephron could potentially provide additional therapeutic targets for the treatment of human hypertension. Experiments were performed using NIH 3T3 cells infected with retrovirus encoding cDNAs for rat αβγ ENaC subunits (39Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Clones stably expressing ENaC subunits were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% bovine calf serum, 10 μm amiloride, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 300 μg/ml G418, and 1 μg/ml puromycin. Cells for patch clamp experiments were grown on 35-mm culture dishes in standard media and were treated with 2 mm sodium butyrate and 1 μm dexamethasone 24 h prior to recording to induce ENaC expression (39Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cells used for biochemical experiments were maintained at subconfluent states and were moved into serum-free media at least 24 h prior to study. NIH 3T3 cells expressing αβγ rat ENaC subunits were used in patch clamp analyses. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillary tubes using a microelectrode puller and fire-polished to achieve electrode resistances of 5–8 megohms. Pipette (intracellular) solutions for whole cell patch clamp experiments contained, in mm: 120 Tris aspartate, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.3 ADP, 0.1 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, and 1 EGTA. Additionally, phosphorylated (activating) or nonphosphorylated peptides (control; Calbiochem) modeled on the amino acid sequence of the Src kinase carboxyl terminus (amino acid residues 521–533) were used where indicated, to modulate the activity of endogenous Src family kinases (40Roussel R.R. Brodeur S.R. Shalloway D. Laudano A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10696-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The peptides were dissolved in the whole cell pipette solution at a final concentration of 10 μm. The standard bath solution for whole cell experiments was composed of, in mm: 150 lithium aspartate, 5 TES, 2 MgCl2, and 1 CaCl2. As indicated, amiloride (final concentration of 10 μm) was added to the bath solution during whole cell recordings. Whole cell and single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 1C amplifier (Axon Instruments). Data was acquired at 2 kHz and filtered at 200 Hz during whole cell recordings (50 Hz for single channel recordings) using a low pass four-pole Bessel filter. Data acquisition and subsequent analyses for both whole cell and single channel experiments were performed using the pClamp 8.0 software package (Axon Instruments). For whole cell patch clamp experiments, cells were voltage-clamped at 0 mV and pulsed to −40 mV every 100 ms for 400-ms intervals. This sequence was repeated for 180 s. Next, cells were voltage clamped at 0 mV and pulsed for 600 ms from −160 mV to +20 mV, in 20-mV increments. Current-voltage (IV) curves were generated from average current measurements starting 200 ms after each voltage pulse. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents (Iamil) were calculated from the difference in current in the presence and absence of 10 μm amiloride. Single channel traces were recorded in the cell-attached conformation. The pipette solution for single channel studies contained, in mm: 280 lithium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 5 TES, and 0.1 CaCl2. The bath solution contained, in mm: 150 Tris gluconate, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, and 5 TES with CsOH. Cells were preincubated with the Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2; 1 μm) or with an inactive control, 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP3; 1 μm) for several minutes prior to study (41Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Channel open probability (Po), mean open time (MOT), and mean closed time (MCT) were calculated from patches containing only single channel events. Single channel analysis was performed using the pClamp 8.0 software package. To calculate the single channel MOT, the following equation was used.MOT=(T·Po)/(n/2)Eq. 1 T is recording time, Po is the open probability, and n is the number of channel transitions during the recording time (38Gallego M.S. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F451-F460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Yue G. Edinger R.S. Bao H.F. Johnson J.P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C81-C88Crossref Google Scholar). The single channel MCT was calculated with the following equation, where the variables are defined as for Equation 1.MCT=[(T)/(n/2)]−MOTEq. 2 NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in media without serum for 24 h prior to study. Cells were treated with 10 nm ET-1 or vehicle control for 10 min, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, pH 8.0) with serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates were passed several times through a 27.5-gauge needle to shear chromosomal DNA. Homogenates were spun at 313,000 × g, and the soluble fraction was used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitations. For phosphotyrosine Western blots, lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and blotted with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology). Kinases were immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 cell lysates using an antibody directed against the conserved COOH terminus of the Src family kinase sequence that recognizes all Src kinase family members (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Santa Cruz), or using antibodies to specific Src family kinases (α-Src kinase, Oncogene; α-Yes kinase, Wako). Lysates were incubated with antibody at 4 °C for 3–4 h before a 1:1 mixture of Protein A/G-agarose was added. After 1 h of incubation with Protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and resuspended in a modified pipette solution/kinase assay buffer (150 mm Tris aspartate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm orthovanadate, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) with an exogenous Src family kinase substrate, rabbit muscle enolase (10 μg, Sigma). Additionally, we tested whether ENaC cytosolic domains were substrates for Src family kinases. GST-ENaC fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the cDNAs encoding the NH2- and COOH-terminal subunits of human α, β, and γ ENaC into the pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression vector, which contains an engineered PKA phosphorylation site. Purified fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in the standard kinase assay buffer described above and incubated with purified PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) or purified Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimage analysis. We used a previously described NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell model system that stably expresses αβγ ENaC subunits (39Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Similar to those reports, we observed ENaC current density that ranged from 10 to 30 pA/pF (at −160 mV) under whole cell patch clamp conditions. Specific ENaC currents were detected as the difference current (Iamil) in the presence and absence of 10 μm amiloride, a selective ENaC channel blocker (Fig. 1 A). Generally, treatment with amiloride decreased whole cell currents by 50–70%, reflecting the expression level and activity of ENaC in these cells. ET-1 treatment markedly inhibited amiloride-sensitive current. Full inhibition of Iamil was observed in cells treated with 10 nmET-1 (Fig. 1 B). Concentrations of ET-1 in the range of 1 pm to 10 nm produced a dose-dependent inhibition of Iamil (Fig. 1 C). The ET-1 concentration that resulted in 50% inhibition of Iamil was ∼50 pm, in a range consistent with ET-1 activation of ETB receptors. To test this possibility, cells were pretreated with 1 μm BQ-788, a selective ETBreceptor antagonist. Under these conditions, BQ-788 prevented the inhibition of ENaC currents by 100 pm ET-1 (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, 100 pm ET-1 was fully inhibitory in the presence of 1 μm BQ-123, a selective ETA receptor antagonist (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that, in NIH 3T3 cells, ETB receptor signaling is responsible for ET-1 inhibition of ENaC. We have demonstrated previously that Src family kinases potently inhibit ENaC when coexpressed in Xenopusoocytes. 2Donaldson, S. H., Boucher, R. C., and Stutts, M. J., unpublished observations. Therefore, we investigated whether Src family kinases were involved in mediating the effects of ET-1 on ENaC. We used a cell-permeable specific Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, in whole cell patch clamp experiments. PP2 competes with ATP for binding to Src family kinases (41Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). In in vitro kinase assays, purified Src kinase did not phosphorylate a known substrate, enolase, in the presence of 1 μm PP2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The negative control compound PP3 shares a similar structure but does not affect Src kinase activity and did not inhibit the phosphorylation of enolase (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Cells were incubated in bath solutions containing 1 μm either PP2 or PP3 and subsequently treated with 100 pm ET-1. In cells incubated in PP3, ET-1 inhibited Iamil as observed previously (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, in cells pretreated with PP2, Iamil was not inhibited by 100 pm ET-1. This observation implicates Src family kinase activity in the inhibition of ENaC by ET-1. To demonstrate biochemically that Src family kinases are involved in ET-1 signaling, we examined changes in phosphotyrosine levels in response to ET-1 stimulation. Cells were treated with 10 nmET-1 for 10 min, lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to membranes. Total cell lysates were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (monoclonal antibody clone 4G10; Fig. 3 C). We observed a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ET-1. In particular, tyrosine phosphorylation of ∼85-, 65-, 48-, and 43-kDa proteins were enhanced by ET-1 treatment. Additionally, in vitro kinase assays measuring the activity of Src family kinases show a significant increase in kinase activity in cells treated with 10 nm ET-1 (72 ± 20% increase over control;p < 0.05; Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that ET-1 signaling activates tyrosine kinase pathways that include Src family kinases. To further show that activation of Src family kinases mediates inhibition of ENaC, we used peptides modeled on the conserved Src family kinase COOH terminus to activate the endogenous kinases. c-Src is inactivated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 527, by COOH-terminalSrc kinase (CSK; Ref. 43Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Intramolecular interactions between the Src homology 2 domain and this phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr527) maintain c-Src kinase in an inactive state. Introduction of phosphorylated peptides containing the sequence of the Src carboxyl terminus disrupts the intramolecular interactions that hold the kinase in the folded, inactive state. Addition of activating phosphorylated peptide to c-Src and c-Yes kinase-specific immunoprecipitates significantly increased phosphorylation of enolase in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 4 A). As a control, immunoprecipitates incubated with the nonphosphorylated peptide, which does not compete for Src homology 2 binding, show a low level of phosphorylation. These assays demonstrate that c-Src and c-Yes kinase can be activated by the introduction of phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tail peptides. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, activation of endogenous Src family kinases resulted in a significant decrease in amiloride-sensitive currents (Fig. 4 B). Dialysis of cells with the nonphosphorylated, control peptide did not alter ENaC activity. These experiments reveal that the cell's endogenous Src family kinases are poised to potently inhibit ENaC when activated by appropriate signals. We have shown that activation of Src family kinases can dramatically reduce Iamil (Fig. 4 B). However, it is evident that Src family kinase activity exists at a basal level in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 D). To examine whether this basal level of kinase activity influences ENaC currents, we measured Iamil in the presence of PP2 and PP3. We found that treatment of cells with 1 μm PP2 significantly increased Iamil over control (PP3) (Fig. 5). These results suggest that basal Src family kinase activity mediates tonic inhibition of ENaC in this model system. Previous work in A6 cell lines describes the inhibition of ENaC by ET-1 (38Gallego M.S. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F451-F460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, ET-1 inhibited ENaC Po and enhanced mean closed time. Therefore, to test whether Src family kinases could mediate similar effects on ENaC in mammalian cells, we studied ENaC in cell-attached single channel patches in the presence of PP2 or PP3. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 6 A. Channel openings, represented by upward deflections in the trace, reveal classical ENaC characteristics, e.g. low amplitude and slow gating channel transitions (44Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Patches from PP2-treated cells contained ENaC that were open for extended periods (up to tens of seconds), compared with patches from PP3-treated cells. The all-points histograms in Fig. 6 A are examples of analyses generated from continuous traces from cells treated with PP2 or PP3 and represent the distribution of time that single channel patches resided in the closed or open conformation. Integration of the all-points histograms from the entire data set (1001 s for PP2, 484 s for PP3) shows that cells incubated in PP3 display a low ENaC open probability (Po = 0.0475 ± 0.0249) as compared with cells treated with PP2 (Po = 0.531 ± 0.150; p < 0.02; Fig. 6 B). A careful analysis of the channel gating kinetics reveals that incubation with PP2 causes shorter mean closed times (3.42 ± 1.52 s for PP2; 13.7 ± 3.02 s for PP3, p < 0.02) between channel events. Additionally, we observed an increase in mean open time under PP2 conditions, but this increase did not reach statistical significance (3.69 ± 1.83 s for PP2; 0.531 ± 0.257 s for PP3, p = 0.125). These data suggest that Src family kinase inhibition enhances ENaC Po by decreasing the closed time between channel opening events. In several instances, Src family kinases regulate ion transport by direct phosphorylation of the ion channel or transporter (53MacFarlane S.N. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility as a mechanism for the regulation of ENaC by Src family kinases, we incubated purified GST fusion proteins encoding the ENaC subunit cytosolic domains with purified Src kinase (Fig. 7). The fusion proteins were generated in-frame with GST from the pGEX-2TK expression vector, which contains an engineered PKA phosphorylation site. As expected, each of the immobilized NH2- and COOH-terminal ENaC fusion proteins were phosphorylated by exogenous PKA. However, purified, active Src kinase failed to phosphorylate any of the ENaC cytosolic domain fusion proteins. These results demonstrate that ENaC subunit cytosolic domains do not serve as Src family kinase substrates in vitro. We have identified Src family kinases as intermediate signaling proteins in a negative regulatory path for ENaC. Previous reports linked ET-1 signaling to inhibition of ENaC, but no information existed concerning the signaling pathway involved (22Gariepy C.E. Ohuchi T. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A.

Bungarus fasciatus fraction IX (BF9), which consists of 65 amino acid residues with three disulfide bridges, is the fraction IX component isolated from the venom of B. fasciatus. It is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor that possesses inhibitory action only against chymotrypsin and belongs to the BPTI-like superfamily (17Liu C.S. Wu T.C. Lo T.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the sequence alignments of BF9 with seven other proteins in the BPTI-like superfamily, including three small Kunitz-type inhibitors (BPTI, C5, and S. helianthus proteinase inhibitor), three BPTI-like toxins (dendrotoxin I, DTK, and calcicludine), and a soft tick anticoagulant protein (TAP). The sequence identity of BF9 to the Kunitz-type inhibitors and BPTI-like toxins is ∼35–50%, but the sequence identity between BF9 and TAP is much smaller (13.3%). Laskowski and Kato (18Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar) pointed out that the P1 site residue in the trypsin inhibitor is a positively charged residue (Arg or Lys) and in the chymotrypsin inhibitor usually is a large hydrophobic residue (Leu, Phe, or Tyr). The P1 reactive-site residue of BF9 has been identified, however, to be Asn17 (17Liu C.S. Wu T.C. Lo T.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, the P1 site residues His and Asn for chymotrypsin binding were also reported (19Scheidig A.J. Hynes T.R. Pelletier L.A. Wells J.A. Kossiakoff A.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1806-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting to know the structural differences that are responsible for the distinct biological functions among the proteins in the BPTI-like superfamily. The Kunitz-type protease inhibitor possessing specific chymotrypsin inhibition is very rare, and the detailed three-dimensional structure of this kind of protease inhibitor has not yet been reported. In this work, we used surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry to obtain the binding constant for BF9 and α-chymotrypsin. In addition, we applied CD and NMR techniques to determine the solution structure of BF9. We then made a structural comparison between BF9 and BPTI, DTK, and TAP to shed some light on structure-function relationships in these homologous proteins with distinct functions. BF9 was isolated and purified from the snake venom of B. fasciatus by ion-exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (17Liu C.S. Wu T.C. Lo T.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and solvents were obtained commercially as reagent grade and used without further purification. Association and dissociation of BF9 and α-chymotrypsin were measured with a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). BF9 was coupled to a carboxymethyl-dextran CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit containingN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl, ethanolamine HCl, and N-hydroxysuccinimide. After the chip was activated by 35 μl ofN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl/N-hydroxysuccinimide mixture, BF9 was coupled to the CM5 sensor surface using 35 μl of BF9 (5 μm) in BIAcore binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) containing 0.005% surfactant P2O). The binding assay was performed with a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C with α-chymotrypsin concentrations in the range of 10–500 nm. 5 m NaCl was used to regenerate the chip. For fitting of the binding kinetics, BIAevaluation Version 3.0 software (BIAcore AB) was applied, and the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was chosen. Titration calorimetry experiments were performed with a VP-ITC titration calorimetric system (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). 0.04 mm BF9 solution in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) in the calorimetric cell was titrated with 0.3 mm α-chymotrypsin dissolved in the same buffer in a 250-μl injection syringe at 30 °C. The raw calorimetry data were collected and analyzed by Origin Version 5.0 data analysis software (Microcal Inc.). The binding isotherms were fitted to the one-site binding model, giving values for the stoichiometry (N) of the interaction, the enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and the binding constant (K). CD experiments were carried out using an Aviv 202 instrument (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 25 °C. In general, a 2-mm path-length cuvette with 20 μm BF9 peptide in 20 mmphosphate buffer was used for CD experiments, and all protein solutions were made up to 1 ml. The CD spectra of BF9 at different temperatures and pH values were recorded. Each of the CD spectra was obtained from an average of three scans with 1-nm bandwidth. The spectra were recorded from 180 to 260 nm at a scanning rate of 38 nm/min with a wavelength step of 0.5 nm and a time constant of 100 ms. After background subtraction and smoothing, all the CD data were converted from CD signal (millidegree) into mean residue ellipticity (degrees cm2 dmol−1). The secondary structure content was estimated from the CD spectra according to the methods of CONTIN-LL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR (20Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker AMX-500 or AVANCE-600 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Samples for NMR experiments contained 0.35 ml of 2 mm BF9 in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 3.0, 3.9, and 7.0. pH values were measured with a dissolved-oxygen (DO) microelectronic pH-vision Model PHB-9901 pH meter equipped with a 4-mm electrode. All reported pH values were direct readings from the pH meter without correction for isotope effect. For monitoring the exchange rates of labile protons, the concentrated sample in H2O was lyophilized only once and redissolved in D2O (99.99% D). NMR spectra were acquired immediately and thereafter at appropriate time intervals. All chemical shifts were externally referenced to the methyl resonance of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (0 ppm). Double quantum filtered COSY (21Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), TOCSY (22Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and NOESY (23Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) spectra were collected with 512t1 increments and 2048 complex data points. All spectra were recorded in time-proportional phase-sensitive mode (24Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Low temperature studies employed a temperature-controlled stream of cooled air using a Bruker BCU refrigeration unit and a B-VT 2000 control unit. Water suppression was achieved by 1.4 s of pre-saturation at the water frequency or by the gradient method (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). All spectra were collected with 6024.1- and 7788.16-Hz spectral widths for AMX-500 and AVANCE-600, respectively. The data were transferred to an SGI O2 200-MHz R5000SC work station (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA) for all processing and further analysis using the Bruker XWINNMR and AURELIA software packages. All data sets acquired were zero-filled to equal points in both dimensions prior to further processing. A 60°-shifted skewed sine bell window function was used for all NOESY and TOCSY spectra and a 20°- or 30°-shifted skewed sine bell function was used for all COSY spectra. To help with resolving spectral overlap, data were collected at different temperatures. The 3 JNHαcoupling constants were estimated from the residual intensity of the anti-phase cross-peak in double quantum filtered COSY spectra recorded in H2O. φ torsional restraints of −130 ± 30° for3 JNHα coupling constants >8 Hz and −60 ± 30° for 3 JNHαcoupling constants <6 Hz were used for structure calculation. We obtained a total of 20 φ torsional restraints mainly located in the α-helix and β-strand regions. The φ torsional restraints were used for structure generations starting from the early stage when NOE correlations were also consistent. The stereospecific assignments were derived using the method of Hyberts et al. (26Hyberts S.G. Marki W. Wagner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The stereospecific assignment of β-methylene allowed us to assign the χ1 torsional angle restraints to 60 ± 30°, 180 ± 30°, or −60 ± 30°. To ensure the accuracy of stereospecific assignments, we obtained only 13 prochiral assignments with certainty. We found that the stereospecific assignments agreed well with our generated structures in the early stage. Thus, in the later stage of structure generation, we also added χ1 and prochiral assignments as restraints in the structure calculation. The amide proton exchange rates were identified from residual amide proton signals observed in several TOCSY spectra recorded at 310 K and pH 3.0 and 7.0. The first spectrum was recorded within 5 h after the lyophilized sample was redissolved in D2O. The amide proton exchange rates were categorized into three classes: fast, medium, and slow. Hydrogen bond formation or solvent exclusion from the amide protons was assumed to account for the slow and medium exchanging amide protons. Most of these protons have been identified to be associated with particular secondary structures. For better convergence, a number of hydrogen bonds involved in the secondary structure were included as distance restraints in the final stage of structure generation,i.e. an O–N distance of between 2.5 and 3.3 Å and O–HN distances of 1.8 and 2.5 Å between NH protons and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms were assigned to the slow and medium exchanging protons, respectively, in the latter stage of structure determination. In the final stage of structure calculation, the hydrogen bonds between NHi and OCj in the β-sheet structures were included as restraints only if the β-sheet inter-strand NHi /NHj , NHi /CαHj +1, and CαHi −1/CαHj +1NOE cross-peaks were observed. The disulfide bonds used in the structure calculation were Cys7–Cys57, Cys16–Cys40, and Cys32–Cys53. Covalent bonds between the sulfur atoms of disulfide bridges were modeled by restraining the distances between the two sulfur atoms to 1.80–2.30 Å. Distance restraints of BF9 were derived primarily from the 200-ms NOESY spectrum recorded in the aqueous solution at 310 K and pH 3.0. Comparison was made with the 100-ms NOESY spectrum to assess possible contributions of the NOEs from spin diffusion. Peak intensities were classified as large, medium, small, and very small, corresponding to upper bound inter-proton distance restraints of 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 6.0 Å, respectively. An additional correction of 1.0 Å was added for methylene and methyl groups. Backbone dihedral restraints were inferred from3 JNHα coupling constants, with φ restrained to −130 ± 30° for3 JNHα > 8 Hz and −60 ± 30° for 3 JNHα < 6 Hz. The structure determination was performed using 517 distance restraints, of which 127 were intra-residue, 172 were sequential, and 218 were medium- and long-range inter-proton distances; and 63 were additional restraints, including 32 hydrogen bonds, 20 φ torsional angles, and 13 χ1 torsional angles. All simulated minimization and dynamic annealing calculations were carried out with the program X-PLOR Version 98 (27) on an SGI O2 work station. The Insight II (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA), MOLMOL (28Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), and GRASP (29Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) programs were used to visually observe sets of structures and to calculate and make the electrostatic surface potential of the final three-dimensional models. The distributions of the backbone dihedral angles of the final converged structures were evaluated by the representation of the Ramachandran dihedral pattern, revealing the deviations from the sterically allowed (φ, ψ) angle limits using MOLMOL and PROCHECK-NMR (30Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). To determine the dissociation constant for BF9 with α-chymotrypsin, surface plasmon resonance measurements were carried out. BF9 was coupled to a carboxymethyl-dextran CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit. Binding was observed upon injection of different concentrations of α-chymotrypsin (Fig. 2). The plateau values reached after completion of the association reaction were analyzed by a Langmuir binding isotherm. A dissociation constant of 5.8 × 10−8m was obtained. Another complementary method used to study the binding of BF9 to α-chymotrypsin was isothermal titration calorimetry. Fig.3 shows the experimental data for titration of BF9 with α-chymotrypsin using isothermal titration calorimetry. The analysis of the data revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry of the two binding partners, a Kd value of 2.3 × 10−7m, and an apparent ΔH of −6.45 kcal/mol. There is apparently no binding between BF9 and trypsin as measured by the same assay system.Figure 3Isothermal titration calorimetry data of BF9 titrated with α-chymotrypsin. Experiments were carried out in an VP-ITC system at 30 °C with stirring at 300 rpm.

The best values of the fitting parameters are 0.95 for N, 4.3 × 106m−1 for K, and −6.45 kcal/mol for ΔH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We performed CD experiments on BF9 at different pH values (pH 3.5–7.0) and at different temperatures (0–80 °C). We found that BF9 possessed similar conformations at different pH values. The CD spectra from 0 to 80 °C at pH 3.5, as shown in Fig. 4, revealed a decrease in negative band intensity when the temperature was increased, whereas the minimum stayed almost the same at 203 nm. This indicated that the majority of the secondary structure still existed even at 80 °C. Thus, BF9 is a highly thermostable protein, similar to BPTI, which has a denaturation temperature ≥95 °C at pH 4.6 (6Zweckstetter M. Czisch M. Mayer U. Chu M.L. Zinth W. Timpl R. Holak T.A.

Open table in a new tab With high thermostability and well dispersed NMR data, BF9 is an excellent candidate for NMR structural studies. Initially, we carried out NMR studies at neutral pH. We could not obtain confident and complete resonance assignments due to several missing backbone and side chain amide protons, presumably due to their fast exchange with H2O. To lower the exchange rate, we performed NMR experiments at pH 3.9 and 3.0, and the missing protons all appeared and were identified. Based on the NMR data acquired at different pH values and temperatures, the resonance assignments were accomplished using the standard procedures (31Wüthrick K. NMR of Protein and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar), in which spin systems were identified based on COSY and TOCSY experiments, and sequential connectivities were obtained from NOESY experiments. The fingerprint region of a well resolved TOCSY spectrum with partial annotation is shown in Fig. 5. We met with several difficulties when assigning resonance due to the presence of the same chemical shifts for both CαH and CβH in Thr5 and of a higher CβH chemical shift (4.03 ppm) than a CαH chemical shift (3.77 ppm) in Ser27. Table II lists the nearly complete chemical shift assignments for BF9 at 310 K and pH 3.0. We found several unusual chemical shifts. For example, CαH protons of Cys53 and Ile50possessed upfield shifts at 1.89 and 3.05 ppm, respectively. We observed the amide proton of Tyr25 at a downfield shift of 10.55 ppm and identified CβH2 (0.24 and 0.47 ppm) and CγH2 (0.38 and 0.67 ppm) of Pro11 in the upfield regions. Interestingly, we also found these unusual shifts, with the exception of HN(Phe26) and CβH2(Tyr52) in TAP, in the corresponding residues of other BPTI-like proteins.Table II1 H chemical shifts for BF9 in aqueous solution at 310 K and pH 3.0, using 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate resonance (0.00 ppm) as a referenceResidueChemical shiftNHCαHCβHCγHOthersppmLys14.021.92, 1.921.48, 1.48CδH2, 1.74, 1.74; CɛH2, 3.03, 3.03Asn28.714.732.68, 2.77Arg38.284.251.63, 1.631.41, 1.47CδH2, 2.85, 3.03; NɛH, 7.01Pro44.270.90, 0.901.72, 1.90CδH2, 3.54, 3.78Thr58.523.873.871.32Phe67.134.553.10, 3.22CδH2, 7.01, 7.01; CɛH2, 7.41, 7.41; CζH, 7.36Cys77.214.352.06, 2.80Asn87.454.982.76, 3.04NδH2, 6.86, 7.48Leu97.454.391.92, 1.921.64CδH3, 0.95, 1.06Leu108.304.361.47, 1.621.85CδH3, 0.99, 0.99Pro114.280.24, 0.470.38, 0.67CδH2, 3.06, 3.36Glu127.494.741.75, 2.022.33, 2.33Thr138.924.494.321.40Gly148.554.03, 4.31Arg158.174.431.76, 1.911.62, 1.62CδH2, 3.18, 3.18; NɛH, 7.13Cys168.564.552.80, 3.35Asn178.044.812.70, 2.81NδH2, 6.73, 7.41Ala188.004.311.20Leu197.824.351.40, 1.531.26CδH3, 0.71, 0.82Ile208.404.541.970.94, 0.94CδH3, 1.05; CγH3, 1.40Pro214.561.88, 2.131.99, 2.22CδH2, 3.74, 3.83Ala228.524.550.97Phe239.175.862.75, 2.88CδH2, 6.82, 6.82; CɛH2, 7.38, 7.38; CζH, 7.36Tyr249.695.232.71, 2.75CδH2, 6.92, 6.92; CɛH2, 6.61, 6.61Tyr2510.554.302.74, 3.60CδH2, 7.19, 7.19; CɛH2, 6.34, 6.34Asn267.894.652.15, 2.95NδH2, 7.32, 7.72Ser278.443.774.03, 4.03His288.124.453.35, 3.35Cδ2H, 7.28, Cɛ1H, 8.62Leu297.294.171.44, 1.471.13CδH3, 0.75, 0.83His307.753.923.34, 3.52Cδ2H, 7.20; Cɛ1H, 8.56Lys317.054.671.58, 1.781.11, 1.11CδH2, 1.18, 1.18; CɛH2, 2.94, 2.94Cys328.995.452.61, 3.50Gln339.274.821.63, 1.632.05, 2.14NɛH2, 6.91, 7.59Lys348.424.821.62, 1.690.98, 0.98CδH2, 1.19, 1.19; CɛH2, 2.90, 2.90Phe359.334.853.04, 3.19CδH2, 7.02, 7.02; CɛH2, 7.13, 7.13; CζH 6.86Asn368.344.852.21, 2.60NδH2, 6.75, 7.34Tyr378.844.732.39, 2.66CδH2, 7.27, 7.27; CɛH2, 6.72, 6.72Gly388.443.44, 4.23Gly398.024.20, 4.20Cys407.724.893.10, 3.53Gly418.973.90, 4.01Gly428.703.84, 4.38Asn438.634.822.78, 3.07NδH2, 7.61, 7.80Ala447.853.910.61Asn457.964.862.99, 3.18NδH2, 7.90, 7.91Asn466.554.852.44, 2.44NδH2, 6.82, 7.18Phe479.785.022.74, 3.33CδH2, 7.28, 7.28; CɛH2, 7.80, 7.80; CζH, 7.59Lys488.954.632.09, 2.091.75, 1.78CδH2, 1.64, 1.64; CɛH2, 3.07, 3.07Thr497.314.834.471.24Ile508.163.050.650.91, 1.00CδH3, 0.76; Cγ2H3, 0.76Asp517.844.282.58, 2.63Glu527.583.922.25, 2.252.56, 2.56Cys536.941.892.92, 3.22Gln548.613.701.96, 2.162.32, 2.55NɛH2, 6.77, 7.16Arg558.113.921.71, 1.781.53, 1.53CδH2, 3.11, 3.11; NɛH, 7.25Thr567.474.033.921.56Cys577.834.661.90, 2.19Ala587.614.281.43Ala597.854.181.27Lys607.924.191.60, 1.651.29, 1.29Tyr618.044.592.86, 3.12CδH2, 7.02, 7.02; CɛH2, 7.13, 7.13Gly628.193.93, 3.93Arg637.844.231.74, 1.851.63, 1.63CδH2, 3.18, 3.18; NɛH, 7.13Ser648.494.463.92, 3.92Ser658.354.513.90, 3.90 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6 shows the summary of the NMR parameters for BF9 at pH 3.0.

Based on the α-helical NOEs, we observed a regular α-helix in the C-terminal Ile50–Cys57segment, which was in good agreement with chemical shift index results.

Signal transduction in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, measured by nuclear factor κB activation, was observed in cells expressing soluble trimeric CD40 cytoplasmic domain and to a lesser extent in cells expressing dimeric CD40 cytoplasmic domain. Nuclear factor κB activation was strongest in cells expressing myristoylated trimeric CD40 cytoplasmic domain. Signal transduction through trimeric CD40 cytoplasmic domains with various point mutations in the TRAF binding sites was similar to signal transduction through analogous full-length receptors. Transiently expressed soluble trimeric CD40 cytoplasmic domain was isolated as complexes that contained TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, TRAF6, and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (c-IAP1). Association of c-IAP1 with the CD40 cytoplasmic domain complex was indirect and dependent on the presence of an intact TRAF1/2/3 binding site. These results suggest that extracellular ligation of CD40 can be bypassed and that soluble trimerized CD40 complexes can be isolated and used to identify components that link CD40 with signaling pathways.

Recent x-ray crystallographic structures of TRAF2·CD40 and TRAF3·CD40 peptide complexes also demonstrate that the TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF3 form trimers where the geometrical spacing of the CD40c peptides closely matches that of the extracellularly ligated CD40 receptor (20McWhirter S.M.

Biochemical experiments suggest that the requirement for CD40c trimerization in the recruitment of TRAF proteins is solely avidity-driven. As an alternative to dimerization, receptor trimerization may regulate initiation of CD40 signaling by providing a higher degree of discrimination between liganded and unliganded receptors (22Ni C.-Z.

However, minimum multimerization requirements for CD40c to initiate signaling have not been defined in cells. The TRAF domain of TRAF2 has been reported to associate with a number of signaling and apoptosis-regulating proteins including NIK, RIP, RIP2, GCK, ASK-1, and Casper (27Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P.

Because the association of many of these signaling proteins in native receptor complexes with TRAFs has been confirmed in systems in which the TRAFs or signaling proteins are overexpressed, components in native receptor complexes have not been well characterized. Additionally, the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, were identified as components of TNFR2 complexes which bound to the receptor via TRAF1 and TRAF2 (33Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In particular, the formation of native TRAF·CD40 complexes is well documented (34Kuhne M.R. Robbins M. Hambor J.E. Mackey M.F. Kosaka Y. Nishimura T. Gigley J.P. Noelle R.J. Calderhead D.M. J. Exp.

We present here a system for defining the minimal multimerization requirements for initiating CD40 signal transduction and for isolating and characterizing components in CD40 signaling complexes. Soluble or myristoylated stable monomers, dimers, or trimers of CD40c were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and their ability to initiate signal transduction was assessed. Expression of soluble trimeric CD40c in HEK 293 cells was sufficient to activate NF-κB. NF-κB activation through soluble or myristoylated trimeric CD40c was similar to that found through full-length CD40 receptors. Transiently expressed, soluble, trimeric CD40c could be isolated as complexes with TRAF proteins and c-IAP1. This system establishes a means to study endogenous CD40 signaling intermediates which will provide insight into the mechanisms by which multimerized CD40 receptors propagate signals. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and an NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid, pNF-6B-Luc, were from Stratagene. Western Blue stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase and a luciferase assay system were from Promega. 10% NuPage polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gels, running buffers, and the pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vector were from Invitrogen. Superfect transfection reagent was from Qiagen, and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Streptavidin-rhodamine was from Molecular Probes. GEL/MOUNT was from Biomeda Corp. HEK 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate at 10% CO2. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. A mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the trimeric GCN4 coiled coil mutant (IZIP) was generated as described previously (23Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H.

The cDNA construct encoding a fusion of a trimeric, GCN4 coiled coil mutant with the 62-amino acid CD40c (23Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J.

This construct (pcDNA3.1/CD40/3) was mutated using Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate a dimeric coiled coil CD40c construct (pcDNA3.1/CD40/2) containing the amino acid sequence MARIKQLEDKIEELLSKNYHLENEIARLKKLIGERSMA N-terminal to CD40c. The cDNA encoding CD40c alone was also cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) between the HindIII and XbaI sites to generate pcDNA3.1/CD40. The Src tyrosine kinase myristoylation sequence, ATGGGTTCCTCCAAATCCAAGCCCAAG, encoding the amino acids MGSSKSKPK (37Silverman L. Sudol M. Resh M.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 475-482PubMed Google Scholar), or a second myristoylation sequence, ATGGGTAAGTCC, encoding MGKS, was added to the 5′-end of the inserts in pcDNA3.1/CD40, pcDNA3.1/CD40/2, and pcDNA3.1/CD40/3 to generate the myristoylated constructs pcDNA3.1/MCD40, pcDNA3.1/MCD40/2, and pcDNA3.1/MCD40/3. Point mutations that reduced or enhanced TRAF binding in vitro (T254A, TRAF123−; P233G/E235A, TRAF6−; T254A/P233G/E235A, TRAF123−TRAF6−; and N237D, TRAF6++) were incorporated into the trimeric CD40 constructs by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (38Pullen S.S.

The sequences of all mutant constructs were verified by automated DNA sequence analysis. HEK 293 cells (3 × 106 or 6 × 106) were seeded in 75-cm2 or 225-cm2 tissue culture flasks, grown overnight, and transfected with Superfect-DNA complexes according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of each pcDNA3.1 plasmid DNA used for each transfection was adjusted to achieve equivalent levels of protein expression. The cells were harvested by scraping either 18 h or 36 h post-transfection, lysed on ice in 0.5 ml of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer) for 30 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (1 h on ice) prior to immunoprecipitation of the dimeric and trimeric CD40 molecules. The dimeric and trimeric coiled coils have identical amino acids in the solvent-exposed regions (39Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and are both recognized by the anti-IZIP monoclonal antibody. Anti-IZIP IgG (1 μg) and 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and eluted in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 40 mm dithiothreitol at 95 °C. The samples were resolved on 10% NuPage polyacrylamide BisTris gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 1 × TBST containing 1 × Genosys blocking buffer and 5% w/v sucrose, and the CD40/2, MCD40/2, CD40/3, and MCD40/3 proteins were detected by incubation with anti-CD40 (C-20) (1/200), anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (1/200), and Western Blue alkaline phosphatase substrate solution. HEK 293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/CD40/3 were harvested after 36 h and lysed by Dounce homogenization in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g. The soluble CD40/3 complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed with antibodies described above to ASK1, GCK, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, RIP, RIP2, TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, or TRAF6. HEK 293 cells (1 × 106) were seeded in 60-mm dishes and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected with Superfect-DNA complexes. For each transfection, 0.5 μg of pNF-κB-Luc and the indicated amounts of pcDNA3.1/CD40 plasmids were used to achieve equal levels of CD40c protein expression. The total amount of DNA transfected was 2 μg. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity with the Promega luciferase assay system. Purified anti-IZIP mouse monoclonal IgG1, 5D10, was biotinylated (40Jackson S. Sogn J.A. Kindt T.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 48: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells (1 × 105) were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips and transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1/CD40/3, or pcDNA3.1/MCD40/3 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After 24 h the cells on the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated anti-IZIP for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml streptavidin-rhodamine for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted with GEL/MOUNT. Slides were examined under a Nikon E-800 microscope using oil immersion and either a 40× or 100× objective and photographed. Overlapping oligonucleotides encoding helix 3 from the Drosophila melanogaster antennapedia protein which contained a proline substitution (MNRQIKIWFPNRRMKWKK) were fused to the 5′-end of CD40/3 at the NcoI site in pET23d (23Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The resulting AntpCD40/3 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3pLysS, and lysates were prepared as described previously (12Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Protein in clarified extracts (150,000 × g for 10 min) was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. AntpCD40/3 protein was purified (∼90%) by chromatography on a Resource S15 column. The identity of the protein was verified by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. Purified AntpCD40/3 protein was diluted to 75 μm in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm Pefablock, 1 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and sterile filtered. Human DND39 B cells (41Ichiki T. Takahashi W. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5408-5417PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with 75 μm AntpCD40/3 at 37 °C for 2 h, harvested, washed in PBS, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining as described above. Alternatively, after 2 h, the AntpCD40/3-containing medium was removed and replaced with fresh RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, and cells were returned to 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by three consecutive freeze/thaw cycles and lysates clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g). AntpCD40/3 was immunoprecipitated from lysates using anti-IZIP as above and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-TRAF3. Engagement of CD40 with its trimeric ligand is expected to form intracellularly trimerized CD40 cytoplasmic domains. To ascertain the minimal multimeric state required for initiating CD40 signal transduction, we bypassed ligand binding by constructing monomeric and multimeric CD40c from the 62-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of human CD40. Our previous biochemical studies on purified CD40c monomers and trimers defined their stable multimeric states and demonstrated that trimeric CD40c has a significantly higher affinity than monomeric CD40c for TRAF2 (23Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Dimeric and trimeric CD40c were constructed as N-terminal fusion proteins to stable dimeric and trimeric α-helical coiled coils derived from the yeast GCN4 transcription factor (23Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T.

A second set of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric CD40c constructs was produced by fusing the 9-amino acid Src myristoylation sequence (37Silverman L. Sudol M. Resh M.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 475-482PubMed Google Scholar) to the N termini. Myristoylation of this sequence is predicted to localize the molecules to the plasma membrane. Multimeric CD40c constructs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells for 24 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody that recognized both the dimeric and trimeric forms of the α-helical coiled coil (anti-IZIP; Fig. 1). Equivalent levels of protein expression were achieved by adjusting the amount of DNA used in each transfection (Fig. 1). The expression levels were not altered upon exchanging the Src myristoylation sequence with an alternative myristoylation signal, MGKS (data not shown). To determine whether monomeric, dimeric, or trimeric CD40c was capable of activating signaling pathways, each construct was cotransfected into HEK 293 cells with an NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid, and luciferase activity was quantified after 24 h. Expression of equivalent levels of dimeric and trimeric CD40c forms was confirmed by analyses as in Fig. 1. The highest amount of plasmid DNA used was also chosen as the amount of monomeric CD40c plasmid DNA to use for each transfection. Expression of monomeric soluble CD40c did not result in an increase in NF-κB activation. In contrast, expression of the soluble trimeric CD40c resulted in an ∼8-fold increase in NF-κB activation over expression of empty vector controls, whereas soluble dimeric CD40c afforded a ∼4-fold increase in NF-κB activation over background (Fig. 2 A). Expression of myristoylated trimeric CD40c resulted in a larger increase in NF-κB activation compared with soluble trimeric CD40c. Myristoylated trimeric CD40c containing the MGKS myristoylation sequence produced a 46-fold increase in NF-κB activation over empty vector control (Fig. 2 B). A 250-fold increase in NF-κB activation was observed upon expression of myristoylated trimeric CD40c containing the Src myristoylation sequence (Fig. 2 C). NF-κB activation observed in cells expressing myristoylated monomeric or dimeric CD40c was weak (Fig. 2, B and C). In two independent time course experiments, the soluble and myristoylated CD40c constructs each demonstrated maximal signaling between 18 and 42 h after transfection (data not shown). These results suggest that in HEK 293 cells, trimerization of the CD40 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and that membrane-proximal CD40c trimerization provides maximal NF-κB activation. To localize the expressed trimeric CD40c proteins, HEK 293 cells were transfected with either soluble or myristoylated (Src) CD40c trimers, permeabilized, stained with biotin-anti-IZIP and streptavidin-rhodamine, and analyzed for fluorescence. HEK 293 cells expressing soluble trimeric CD40 displayed fluorescence distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm with increased uniform fluorescence in the cell nucleus (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, HEK 293 cells expressing myristoylated trimeric CD40c exhibited intense fluorescence in the cytoplasm and finely defined plasma membrane processes, with minimal expression in the nucleus (Fig.3 B). Although a fraction of myristoylated trimeric CD40c appeared to be in the cell cytoplasm, a significant portion was also localized to the plasma membrane. This dual distribution of CD40c containing the Src myristoylation sequence may result from the high expression levels obtained in the transient expression system coupled with a limitation in the efficiency of myristoylation of overexpressed proteins (37Silverman L. Sudol M. Resh M.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 475-482PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with empty expression vector and stained with biotin-anti-IZIP exhibited background fluorescence (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that myristoylation enhances signaling by CD40c trimers (Fig. 2) by promoting their localization to the cell membrane. Point mutations in the two TRAF binding sites in CD40c have been characterized previously for their effects on CD40 signaling (35Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.E. J.

Mutations in CD40c which greatly reduce interactions with either TRAF1/2/3(T254A) or TRAF6(P233G/E235A) significantly reduced but did not eliminate NF-κB activation by full-length CD40 receptor in stable cell lines (35Hostager B.S.

Vertebrates require retinoids for the development of numerous embryonic structures (e.g.limbs, nervous system, heart, kidney), the immune response, and control of intermediary metabolism (1Chytil F. ul-Haq R.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Retinol metabolites serve as endocrine factors that bind to and activate the RARα, -β, and -γ, and the RXRα, -β, and -γ members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (5Glass C.K. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mechanisms for the pleiotropic actions of retinoids are provided by the number of retinoid receptors, their many cell-specific isoforms (generated by differential promoter use and alternative splicing), and heterodimerization of RXR with several other nuclear receptors (7Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). Receptor expression patterns alone, however, do not explain fully the complex temporal and spatial effects of retinoids during embryogenesis and during postnatal development and growth (8Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Wendling O. Dupe V. Mascrez B. Kastner P. Chambon P. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1999; 58: 609-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolism activates vitamin A (retinol) by producing atRA,1 an endogenous RAR ligand generated both centrally and locally (9Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5610-5616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Kurlandsky S.B. Gamble M.V. Ramakrishnan R. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17850-17857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Two sequential reactions produce atRA from all-trans-retinol; they are reversible and rate-limiting dehydrogenation into all-trans-retinal catalyzed by RDH and irreversible and perhaps rate-determining dehydrogenation of all-trans-retinal catalyzed by RALDH. Members of two classes of alcohol dehydrogenases have been proposed to serve as RDH (11Napoli J.L. Biophys. Biochem. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 12Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The medium chain dehydrogenases, ADH classes I and IV, convert retinol into retinal in vitro. These enzymes belong to a family that largely detoxifies xenobiotics and have kinetic characteristics more consistent with xenobiotic clearance than for producing endocrine factors (13Crosas B. Allali-Hassani A. Martinez S.E. Martras S. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Farrés J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25180-25187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ADHI expression first appears at e10.5 and does not correlate well with sites of atRA synthesis in the mouse embryo, prompting the conclusion that its involvement appears unlikely in embryonic atRA biosynthesis (14Vonesch J.-L. Nakshatri H. Philippe M. Chambon P. Dollé P. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ADHIV shows more widespread expression than ADHI, but it is not expressed in diverse areas of atRA biosynthesis and use in the adult (15Ang H.L. Deltour L. Hayamizu T.F. Zgombic-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). ADHIV is expressed episodically during mouse embryogenesis; it is notably absent at various loci and times of atRA need. These considerations indicate that ADH1 and ADHIV do not function universally to generate endocrine levels of atRA. Pursuit of universal RDH candidates has identified several previously unknown members of the SDR superfamily (11Napoli J.L. Biophys. Biochem. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This phylogenetically diverse enzyme family consists of numerous mammalian members that regulate the concentrations of estrogens, androgens, glucocorticoids, and prostaglandins (16Baker M.E. Steroids. 1994; 59: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Three SDR isozymes, RoDH1, -2, and -3, have been identified as RDH candidates in the rat. Each shares similar substrate specificities and has greater activity for all-trans-retinol than for cis-retinols (17Napoli J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each has a distinct pattern of mRNA expression. The precise functions of each have not been established in part because mouse orthologs have not been identified. As for retinoid-specific receptors and binding proteins, an RDH physiologically significant in atRA biosynthesis should be expressed across species with high amino acid sequence homology and ligand/substrate specificity. Attempts to identify RDH in mice have resulted in the cloning and characterization of either cis-retinoid preferring SDR or retinal reductases rather than mouse RoDH orthologs (18Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Su J. Chai X. Kahn B. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

This suggests that mouse enzymes significant to the atRA endocrine system have not been identified or that the mouse generates atRA fundamentally differently from the rat. This work reports the cDNA cloning, enzymatic characterization, and mRNA expression patterns in tissues and cells of a mouse RDH, RDH1. RDH1 functions as a dehydrogenase for atRA biosynthesis in intact cells and has greater activity with all-trans-retinol than with cis-retinols, in contrast to the previously described mouse CRAD isozymes. RDH1 represents the all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase of most widespread mRNA expression in mouse starting as early as e7 and continuing expression in multiple tissues of the adult. RDH1 functions in intact cells in conjunction with any one of three RALDH isozymes to generate atRA from all-trans-retinol. No cDNA sequence for RDH1 has been found in any public data base, and reverse transcription-PCR with mouse embryo and adult mRNA using several sets of degenerate primers failed to identify related SDR with activity for all-trans-retinol. These data suggest that RDH1 contributes to atRA biosynthesis in the mouse starting early during gestation and that the rat and mouse may differ in SDR use for RA biogeneration. Degenerate primers for reverse transcription-PCR were designed from conserved amino acid sequences of rat RoDH and mouse CRAD members of the SDR superfamily. The sense primer F1 (5′-GGN(C/T)TNTGGGGN(C/T)TNGTNAA(C/T)AA(C/T)GCNGGN) corresponds to amino acids 105–114, G(L/F)WG(L/F)VNNAG. The antisense primer R1 (5′-(A/G)TCCCANCCNG(C/G)NGA(A/G)TANC(G/T)NGTNCGNGG) corresponds to amino acids 277–286, PRT(R/S)YS(A/P)GWD. Reverse transcription was done with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase system (Life Technologies, Inc.) with random hexamers primer (Promega) and mouse e17 mRNA. PCR used 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. The ∼550-bp PCR product was gel-purified and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). To obtain a full-length cDNA, RACE was done with the antisense/sense primer pair R2 (5′-CTTGTCCCAGATCATCTTGGTG) and F2 (5′-GTAGTGACAGGCTATCATCAAAC) with PCR conditions: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1.5 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 3 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 70 °C for 3 min; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 68 °C for 3 min; followed by 68 °C for 5 min. The antisense and sense primer pair R3 (5′-CACCAAAGAAAGACATTCGG) and F3 (5′-CTGGGACAAGGCCAGCTCGGAAG) was used for nested RACE with the first RACE products as templates. The PCR program was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1.5 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 61 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Additional sense primers used for 3′-RACE included F4 (5′-AAGTCACCTGAGACCATGGTGTAG), F5 (5′-GGACAAAGTATGAGGTCATCTCCTG), F6 (5′-AGTCCACTGGATGCCTGAGAGCAC), and F7 (5′-AGACAGCTTTATCAAGTTCCTGTCAG) with the PCR conditions described immediately above. RACE products were gel-purified, cloned into pGEM-T, and sequenced. A cDNA of the coding region was amplified with sense primer F8 (5′-GCAGCTGTGTAAACCATGTGGC) and antisense primer R4 (5′-CTCTCTCACACTCTACCTACATC) using mouse e17 mRNA (Sigma) reverse transcription product. Reverse transcription was done with the SUPERSCRIPTTM II RNase H− reverse transcriptase system (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. The PCR program had 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1.5 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; followed by 72 °C for 5 min. This PCR product was used as template with the sense primer F9 (5′­CCGGAATTCGCCGCCACC¯¯ATGTGGCTCTACC) (underlining indicates the EcoRI site; double underlining indicates the Kozak sequence) and the antisense primer R5 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGAGGGCTTTCTCA) (the XhoI site is underlined). The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to construct pcDNA3/RDH1. Additional primers used (explained under “Results”) included: F10 (5′-T(C/T)AT(A/C/T)AC(A/C/G/T)GG(A/C/G/T)TG(C/T)GA(C/T)TC(A/ C/G/T)GG(A/C/G/T)TT(C/T)GG(A/C/G/T)), corresponding to SDR amino acids FITGCDSGFG; F11 (5′- GG(A/C/G/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)TT(C/T)GG(A/C/G/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)), corresponding to amino acids G(L/F)FG(L/F)VNNAG; R6 (5′-A/G)TC(A/C/G/T)GA(A/G)AA(A/C/G/T)GC(C/T)TC(A/C/G/T)A(A/C/G/T)(A/C/G/T)CC(A/G)(A/T)A(C/T)TT(A/C/G/T)GA), corresponding to SK(Y/F)G(I/V/L/F/M)EAFSD; R7 (5′-(A/G)TCCCA (A/C/G/T)CC(A/C/G/T)G(C/G)(A/G)TC(A/G)TA(A/C/G/T)C(G/T)(A/C/G/ T)GT(A/C/G/T)CG(A/C/G/T)GG)), corresponding to PRT(R/S)YS(A/P) GWD; R8 (5′-(A/C/G/T)G(A/C)(A/C/G/T)GT(A/C/G/T)AG(A/C/G/T)GC (A/G)TG(C/T)TCCAT(A/G)CA), from CMEHALT(A/S); R9 (5′-A/C/G/ T)GC(A/C/G/T)GT(A/C/G/T)AG(A/C/G/T)GC(A/G)TG(C/T)TC(A/C/G/ T)AG(A/G)CA) from CLEHALTA. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 8 μg/100-mm plate of pcDNA3/RDH1 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and harvested 24 h later. Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The supernatant obtained from centrifuging the lysate at 800 × g for 10 min was used for enzyme assays. Similar supernatants from CHO-K1 cells transfected with pcDNA3 served as controls. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with combinations of pcDNA3, pcDNA3/RDH1, and pcDNA3/AHD2 or pcDNA3/RALDH2 or pcDNA3/ALDH6. Twenty-four h after transfection the medium was replaced with 5 ml of fresh medium. All-trans-retinol was added in 5 μl of Me2SO, and incubation was continued for 30 min. Cells and medium were analyzed by HPLC to quantify atRA (24Napoli J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were generated from retinoids with 5 μg of CHO cell supernatant protein for 5 min and with steroids using 1 μg of protein and 3 min. These values were in the linear ranges of protein and time (initial velocity conditions) and produced easily quantifiable amounts of products. Kinetic data were fit with the nonlinear regression program GraphFit 4. RDH assays were done in triplicate at 37 °C in 0.25 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmNAD+, pH 8. Reactions were quenched by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with 0.3 ml of 0.1 m o-ethylhydroxylamine in 0.1 m Hepes. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with 2.5 ml of hexane. The organic phase was evaporated with nitrogen, and residues were dissolved in 0.1 ml of hexane. Retinal oximes were quantified by HPLC as described (18Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Steroid dehydrogenase assays were done with [3H] steroids (40–101 Ci/mmol, 20,000 dpm/reaction) under the same conditions. Reactions were quenched with dichloromethane (3 ml), and steroids were extracted as described (18Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Organic phases were evaporated with nitrogen, and the residues were dissolved in 30 μl of ethanol and applied to 1) aluminum oxide thin-layer chromatography plates developed with chloroform/ethyl acetate (3/1, v/v) to analyze conversion of androsterone into androstanedione, 3α-adiol into dihydrotestosterone, dihydrotestosterone into androstanedione, and testosterone into androstanedione; 2) silica plates developed with the same mobile phase to analyze conversion of β-estradiol into estrone; 3) silica plates developed with chloroform/ethanol (96/4; v/v) to analyze conversion of corticosterone into 11-dehydrocorticosterone. [3H]Steroids were detected by autoradiography. Radioactive zones were excised and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Mouse liver and kidney total RNA were extracted with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and ∼25 μg from each were run on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with the 3′-UTR probe described below. Prehybridization was done in 10 ml of prehybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 42 °C overnight. Hybridization was done with labeled cDNA probe at 42 °C for 24 h. The blot was washed three times in 1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) with 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C followed by 2 washes in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C and was exposed to x-ray film. After stripping the mRDH1 probe, the blot was reprobed with a β-actin probe (CLONTECH). Northern blots also were done with the mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot, which contains 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA per lane on a Nylon membrane (CLONTECH). Two cDNA probes were hybridized to the blot separately according to the manufacturer's protocol. One probe was the same 3′-UTR probe described below. The second was a 5′-end probe corresponding to nucleotides 6–298. Both hybridizations were done at 68 °C for 1 h. Each time the blot was washed three times in 2× SSC with 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 min followed by two washes in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Blots were reprobed with β-actin. A 3′-UTR probe corresponding to nucleotides 2392–2679 was labeled with 32P using the RadPrime DNA-labeling system (Promega). The probe was purified by a Micro Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad) and hybridized with a mouse RNA Master BlotTM according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). Briefly, the membrane was prehybridized for 30 min at 65 °C in 10 ml of Expresshyb solution. Hybridization was done at 65 °C overnight with a cDNA probe mix that included 30 μg of Cot-1 DNA and 150 μg of sheared salmon testes DNA. The blot was washed 5 times in 2× SSC (0.3 mNaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate) with 1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min followed by two 20-min washes in 0.1× SSC with 0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. The dot blot was exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for 48 h with an intensifying screen. Mouse embryos (NIH Swiss, Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were used. The morning of plug detection was designated e0.5. In situhybridization was done on paraformaldyhyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using 35S-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes as described (25Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). The RDH1 probe spanned nucleotides 1–1199. After their development, tissue sections were counterstained with propidium iodide, and images were documented under dark-field and epifluorescent illumination. To obtain mouse RDH1, degenerate reverse transcription-PCR was done with mRNA from e17 mice. Primers were designed from conserved regions of RoDH/CRAD members of the SDR superfamily. A 550-bp cDNA (fragment A) amplified by primers F1 and R1 had 89 and 85% nucleotide identity, respectively, with mouse CRAD1 and rat RoDH2 (Fig. 1). The sequence of this partial cDNA was used to design primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE. The two 5′-RACE primers, R2 and R3, produced a ∼700-bp product (fragment B). The two 3′-RACE primers, F2 and F3, produced a 900-bp product (fragment C). Additional primers, F4 and F5, extended the 3′-UTR ∼1.5-kb (fragment D), whereas primers F6 and F7 extended the cDNA out to poly(A) mRNA (fragment E). Primers F8 and R4 then were used to amplify a 1020-bp cDNA with a 951-base pair open reading frame that encoded 317 amino acid residues (fragment F). The insert to construct pcDNA3/RDH1 was amplified from fragment F with primers F9 and R5. None of these constructs nor any of the fragments was found in any public data base. To determine whether additional all-trans-retinol recognizing SDR occur, five primer pairs (F1/R1; F1/R7; F10/R1; F11/R1; F11/R7) were used independently for reverse transcription-PCR with e17 mouse embryo mRNA. Note that although the PCR conditions were not varied, two different degenerate forward primers, F1 and F11, were designed from the “signature” SDR motif (G XWG XVNNAG). In addition, two different degenerate reverse primers, R1 and R7, were designed from the same RoDH/CRAD motif (PRT XYS XGWD). A third forward primer, F10, was designed from the SDR cofactor binding motif (FITGCDSGFG). Seventy-three of the clones generated were sequenced, 13–16 produced by each primer pair. Thirty-seven of the 73 clones sequenced encoded SDR. Only three encoded RDH1. Twenty-one encoded CRAD2; two encoded 17β-HSD9; two encoded RDH4; five encoded two previously unknown SDR with no activity for retinol 2M. Zhang, W. Chen, S. M. Smith, and J. L. Napoli, unpublished data.; two encoded a previously unknown enzyme, CRAD3, with activity for 9- and 11-cis-retinol but little or no activity for all-trans-retinol. 3R. Zhuang and J. L. Napoli, submitted for publication.To probe further for additional RDH candidates, nested PCR was done with mRNA from e7 and e11 embryos, embryonic heart, adult testis, and adult small intestine. The first round was done with the primer mixture F10 (designed from the SDR cofactor binding motif), R1 and R9. The two degenerate reverse primers, R1 and R9, were designed from the C XEHALT X sequence conserved in RoDH/CRAD. The second round was done with the mixture of degenerate primers: F10, F11, R8, and R9. Sixty-seven of the clones produced were sequenced. RDH1 was amplified from e7 embryo (5 of 30 clones sequenced), e11 embryo (4 of 10 clones sequenced), and testis (2 of 10 clones sequenced). RDH1 was not amplified from embryonic heart or from adult small intestine. RDH4, a 9- and 11-cis-retinol-metabolizing SDR, accounted for 22 of the 30 clones sequenced from e7 mice, 5 of the 10 sequenced from e11 mice, and all 10 sequenced from embryonic heart. The remaining clones sequenced encoded CRAD2, CRAD3, and 17β-HSD9. No other SDR were found that were active with all-trans-retinol. The protein deduced from pcDNA3/RDH1 has a calculated molecular mass of ∼36 kDa and includes 6 peptides with high sequence similarity (73–100%) to the 6 motifs characteristic of SDR (26Bailey T.L. Baker M.E. Elkan C.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 2: 29-44Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nineteen of the 23 amino acids conserved in ∼70% of SDR occur within these 6 motifs. These motifs include the conserved cofactor binding region, G36 X3G XG, and catalytic residues S164 X11Y X3K (Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence also shares similarity with other members of the RoDH/CRAD subfamily of SDR but less similarity with PR-RDH, retSDR, 3β-HSD, and 11β-HSD (Table I). RDH1 has an 18-amino acid hydrophobic sequence at its N terminus bounded by four hydrophilic amino acids, R19ERQ, in common with other SDR that metabolize retinoids/steroids (17Napoli J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This sequence targets the enzymes to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for enzymatic activity. 4J.

Under these conditions, the supernatant generated 745 ± 90 pmol of all-trans-retinal, 292 ± 6 pmol of 9-cis-retinal (mean ± S.D., n = 3) (Fig. 3), and no detectable 13-cis-retinal (not shown) from 5 μmall-trans-, 9-cis-, or 13-cis-retinol and 2 mm NAD+, respectively. RDH1 had 8–11-fold higher activity with NAD+ versusNADP+ and had greater activity with all-trans-retinol than rat RoDH1, assuming equivalent transfection efficiencies. Both mouse RDH1 and rat RoDH1 had higher activity with all-trans-retinol versus9-cis-retinol, but RoDH1 showed greater discrimination. RDH1 reached maximum activity at pH 8 and retained the same activity at pH values of 8.5 and 9. Activity at pH 7.5 was 54% that at pH 8 (data not shown). The most active steroid substrate tested was 3-adiol. RDH1 first converted 3-adiol via 3α-HSD activity into DHT (290 ± 73 pmol) and then converted the DHT via 17β-HSD activity into androstanedione (35 ± 4 pmol). The second most active steroid substrate tested was androsterone, which RDH1 converted via 3α-HSD activity into androstanedione (175 ± 15 pmol). 17β-HSD activity of RDH1 was much less than 3α-HSD activity, as shown by much lower catalysis of DHT, testosterone, and estradiol into their 17-oxo products androstanedione (44 ± 14 pmol), androstanedione (33 ± 10 pmol), and estrone (26 ± 6 pmol), respectively. 11β-HSD activity with corticosterone was detectable, but low, producing dehydrocorticosterone (19 ± 2 pmol). Kinetic values for the four most actively metabolized substrates were obtained under linear conditions of protein and time. The average Km value with all-trans-retinol was 2.6 μm (2.6 ± 0.1 and 2.7 ± 0.2, means ± S.E. of nonlinear regression analysis of two transfections) and with 9-cis-retinol was 2.2 μm (2.5 ± 0.3 and 1.8 ± 0.3). The average Vm values were 6.7 (7 ± 0.1 and 6.4 ± 0.2) and 3.3 (3.5 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1) nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively for all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal production (Fig.4, upper panel). The average Km values for 3α-adiol and androsterone were 3.1 (2.3 ± 0.3 and 4 ± 1.3) and 3.5 μm (2.2 ± 0.3 and 4.8 ± 1), respectively, with average Vm values of 97 (109 ± 4.6 and 86 ± 10) and 66 (56 ± 2.5 and 74 ± 6) nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively (Fig. 4, lower panel). The reaction with DHT was not saturated kinetically with substrate concentrations to 55 μm. These data indicate RDH1 efficiencies (V/Km) of 31 (3-adiol), 19 (androsterone), 3 (all-trans-retinol) and 1.5 (9-cis-retinol) (nmol/min/mg)/μm. To determine whether RDH1 contributes to RA biosynthesis in intact cells, cotransfections were done with RDH1 and three mouse RALDH isozymes, AHD2, RALDH2, and ALDH6 (27Dockham P.A. Lee M.O.

Mock transfections with pcDNA3 or transfection with RDH1 alone or with any one of the RALDH cDNAs alone produced no detectable RA from all-trans-retinol (data not shown). Combination of RDH1 with any one of the RALDH isozymes generated atRA from all-trans-retinol (Fig.5). RA biosynthesis increased with increasing amounts of transfected DNA; small increases in vector amounts resulted in substantial increases in RA biosynthesis. Mouse RALDH2 seemed somewhat more efficient than the mouse ortholog of human ALDH6, whereas AHD2 was less efficient. Consistent with its activity in whole cells, purified recombinant RALDH1/AHD2 functions about 20% as efficiently (V/K0.5) as RALDH2 in vitro (11Napoli J.L. Biophys. Biochem. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).

The determinants of drug sensitivity, however, are only partially understood. Earlier studies of the drug-sensitive NHE1 isoform have shown that residues within the fourth membrane-spanning helix (M4) (Phe165, Phe166, Leu167, and Gly178) and a 66-amino acid segment encompassing M9 contribute significantly to drug recognition. In this report, we have identified two residues within M9, one highly conserved (Glu350) and the other non-conserved (Gly356), that are major determinants of drug sensitivity. In addition, residues in the second exomembrane loop between M3 and M4 (Gly152, Phe157, and Pro158) were also found to modestly influence drug sensitivity. A double substitution of crucial sites within M4 and M9 of NHE1 with the corresponding residues present in the drug-resistant NHE3 isoform (i.e. L167F/G356A) greatly reduced drug sensitivity in a cooperative manner to levels nearing that of wild type NHE3. The above mutations did not appreciably affect Nao+ affinity but did markedly decrease the catalytic turnover of the transporter. These data suggest that specific sites encompassing M4 and M9 are critical determinants of both drug recognition and cation translocation.

Na+/H+ exchanger 5- (N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE)1 are present at the cell surface and various organellar compartments of mammalian cells and mediate the electroneutral exchange of Na+ for H+, a process driven by the relative concentration gradients of the respective cations. To date seven distinct isoforms (NHE1 to NHE7) have been isolated that share ∼20–70% amino acid identity (calculated Mr ranging from ∼74,000 to 93,000) and exhibit similar membrane topologies, with 12 predicted N-terminal membrane-spanning (M) α-helices and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic region (1Orlowski J.

They show considerable differences in their patterns of tissue expression, membrane localization, kinetic properties, sensitivity to pharmacological antagonists, and responsiveness to various signaling pathways. Consistent with their molecular diversity, the exchangers participate in a broad spectrum of physiological processes, including the regulation of intracellular pH (pHi), maintenance of cell volume, and transepithelial transport of electrolytes. In addition, activation of certain exchangers appear to facilitate cellular growth and proliferation in response to numerous growth factors and other mitogens and are associated with events leading to apoptosis (6Shrode L.D.

Membr. Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Amiloride analogues containing hydrophobic substituents on the 5-amino group of the pyrazine ring, such as 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), have higher affinity and specificity for NHE relative to other ion transporters. Comparison of the NHE isoforms in heterologous expression systems show that they have varying affinities for amiloride and its analogues that span more than 2 orders of magnitude, with the following order of sensitivity: NHE1 ≥ NHE2 > NHE5 > NHE3 (10Orlowski J.

NHE4 also has an apparent low affinity for many of these antagonists, but its activity in transfected fibroblasts can only be detected under specialized experimental conditions (13Bookstein C.

Recently, novel benzoyl guanidinium compounds (e.g. HOE694, HOE642 or cariporide, and EMD85131) have been developed that inhibit the NHE isoforms with a similar rank order but over a larger concentration range (3–4 orders of magnitude) (15Counillon L.

More recently, a preferential antagonist (S3226) of NHE3 has been synthesized that may also facilitate functional studies of this isoform in renal and intestinal epithelia (24Schwark J.R. Jansen H.W.

Physiol. 2000; 278: F375-F379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses indicate that inhibition by amiloride compounds (26Mahnensmith R.L. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12586-12592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HOE694 (15Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouysségur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar) is reduced by high external Na+(Nao+). This competitive inhibition suggests they bind near the Nao+transport site and may also share a common site. However, under chloride-free buffer conditions, amiloride and its derivatives also inhibit transport noncompetitively, suggesting that the Nao+ and amiloride binding sites may not be identical (27Ives H.E. Yee V.J. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9710-9716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Warnock D.G. Yang W.-C. Huang Z.-Q. Cragoe Jr., E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7216-7221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Nao+- and amiloride-binding sites can be altered independently of each other using genetic selection techniques (29Franchi A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14614-14620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that amiloride and other antagonists probably interact with multiple sites on the exchanger. Consistent with the above notion, mutational analyses have identified residues in the predicted fourth membrane-spanning helix (M4) of NHE1 (Phe161, Leu163, and Gly174 of human NHE1) that confer sensitivity to amiloride and its analogues but do not seemingly affect Nao+ affinity (30Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Counillon L. Noël J. Reithmeier R.A. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutation of a neighboring residue, Phe162, was found to decrease affinities for both Nao+ and HOE642 (32Touret N. Poujeol P. Counillon L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, pharmacological analyses of chimeras of rat NHE1 and NHE3 defined a 66-amino acid segment encompassing M9 and its adjacent loops (residues 327–392 of rat NHE1) as a major determinant of the differential drug sensitivity between these two isoforms (16Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Homologous substitution of this region between NHE1 and NHE3 caused a reciprocal change in their drug sensitivities by 1–3 orders of magnitude, with the greatest effects observed for the more NHE-selective drugs, EIPA and HOE694. A role for this region in drug recognition is further supported by observations of Wang et al. (33Wang D. Balkovetz D.F. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who serendipitously found that mutation of His349 in the putative M9 domain of human NHE1 produced either a modest 2-fold increase (H349Y or H349F) or 2-fold decrease (H349G or H349L) in amiloride sensitivity, although other amino acid substitutions had no effect. Although this site is unlikely to account for the large changes observed for the NHE1/3 chimeras, it does implicate the involvement of other nearby sites as critical determinants of drug sensitivity. The objective of the present study was to define specific residues that may contribute to the large difference in drug sensitivity between NHE1 and NHE3. The results show that sites within transmembrane α-helix M9 as well as between helices M3 and M4 are significant determinants of drug recognition. These sites were also found to be important for optimal cation translocation. These data provide additional insight in NHE drug interactions and may aid in the design of more potent isoform-specific drugs with therapeutic potential. Carrier-free 22NaCl (radioactivity, 5 mCi/ml) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Amiloride and ouabain were purchased from Sigma, and the amiloride derivative EIPA was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). HOE694 ((3-methylsulphonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl) guanidine methanesulfonate) was generously provided by Dr. Hans J. Lang (Hoechst AG). α-Minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, kanamycin sulfate, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Life Technologies. Polyclonal antibodies to NHE1 were generated by injecting rabbits with a fusion protein containing Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase linked to the C-terminal 157 amino acids (658) of the human exchanger and subsequently affinity-purified as previously described (34Grinstein S.

The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Cell culture dishes and flasks were purchased from Becton Dickinson and/or Corning (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). All other chemicals and reagents used in these experiments were purchased from British Drug House Inc. (St. Laurent, Quebec) or Fisher Scientific and were of the highest grade available. The rat NHE1 and NHE3 cDNAs, engineered to contain a series of unique restriction endonuclease sites to create convenient DNA cassettes for mutagenesis, were inserted into a mammalian expression vector under the control of the enhancer/promoter region from the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus (modified cDNAs called NHE1′ and NHE3′, respectively) as previously described (16Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These nucleotide changes either preserved the native amino acid sequence or, in a few cases, resulted in substitution of an amino acid present in one isoform with the equivalent residue of the other isoform and had no obvious effect on their respective functional properties. Substitution of various amino acids was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using the unique site elimination method (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal.

The cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and to ensure that other random mutations were not introduced. Chemically mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary (AP-1) cells devoid of endogenous NHE activity (36Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected with plasmids containing the various NHE constructs by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation technique of Chen and Okayama (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Starting 48 h after transfection, the AP-1 cells were selected for survival in response to repeated (5–6 times over a 2-week period) acute NH4Cl-induced acid loads (i.e. H+-killing technique) (10Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Franchi A. Perucca Lostanlen D. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The positive clones for each transfectant were pooled and used for subsequent analyses. The cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. NHE activity was determined by preloading the cells with H+ using the NH4Cl technique (39Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), then measuring the initial rates of22Na+ influx essentially as described (10Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell culture medium was aspirated and replaced by isotonic NH4Cl medium (50 mm NH4Cl, 70 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmglucose, 20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated in this medium for 30 min at 37 °C in a nominally CO2-free atmosphere. After acid loading, the monolayers were rapidly washed twice with isotonic choline chloride solution (125 mmcholine chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 20 mmHEPES-Tris, pH 7.4). 22Na+ influx assays were initiated by incubating the cells in isotonic choline chloride solution containing 1 mm ouabain and 1 μCi of 22NaCl (carrier-free)/ml (∼120 nm NaCl). The assay medium was K+-free and included ouabain to prevent the transport of22Na+ by the Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter and the Na+,K+-ATPase. Influx of22Na+ was terminated by rapidly washing the cell monolayers three times with four volumes of ice-cold isotonic saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). The washed cell monolayers were solubilized in 0.25 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, and the wells were washed with 0.25 ml of 0.5 n HCl. Both the solubilized cell extract and wash solutions were added to vials, and radioactivity was assayed using a liquid scintillation counter. Under the conditions of H+ loading used in this study, uptake of22Na+ was linear with time for 8–10 min (at low Na+ concentrations, 22 °C). Therefore,22Na+ uptakes were measured after 5 min except when examining the kinetics of NHE activity as a function of the extracellular Na+ concentration. We found that22Na+ influx was linear with time for only 4 min when Nao+ was increased to 40 mm. Hence, an uptake time of 1 min was chosen for this set of experiments, i.e. when the extracellular Na+concentration ranged from 1.25 to 40 mm. Measurements of22Na+ influx specific to the Na+/H+ exchanger were determined as the difference between the initial rates of H+-activated22Na+ influx in the absence and presence of 2 mm amiloride or 100 μm EIPA (concentrations sufficient to inhibit NHE1 or NHE3 under these experimental conditions). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay procedure. To examine NHE activity as a function of the intracellular H+ concentration, the pHi was clamped at different concentrations over the range of 5.4–7.4 by suspending the cells in media of varying K+ concentrations containing the K+/H+ exchange ionophore nigericin as previously described (40Aharonovitz O. Zaun H.C. Balla T. York J.D. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes and lysed with 1% Triton X-100. Total cellular protein extracts (30 μg) were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were briefly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked with 5% nonfat skim milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20), and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-NHE1 antibody (dilution 1:5,000). After extensive washes with PBST, the blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:2,000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) recorded on x-ray film. For quantitation of protein levels, the amount of protein was titrated in preliminary experiments, and the film exposure times were selected to ensure that the chemiluminescent signals were within the linear range of the x-ray film. Earlier studies have identified sites within M4 (Phe165, Phe166, Leu167, and Gly178, numbered according to the rat NHE1 sequence) and a 66-amino acid segment encompassing M9 (residues 327–392) as important elements of NHE drug recognition. The location of these sites are depicted in a secondary structural model of rat NHE1 (Fig. 1), as defined by recent topological mapping studies (41Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The region surrounding M9 is of particular interest because it appears to account for large differences (2–3 orders of magnitude) in the differential drug sensitivity of NHE1 (high affinity) and NHE3 (low affinity) (16Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and is proposed to form part of the pore-lining region with M4 (41Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These two isoforms share ∼50% amino acid identity in this region, but the precise amino acids that confer this differential drug sensitivity are unknown. To identity these sites, 14 divergent amino acids distributed throughout this region of NHE1 were individually substituted with the corresponding residues present in NHE3 by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.2 A; mutated sites are boxed in gray and black shading). The modified constructs were then transfected in Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells that lack endogenous plasmalemmal NHE activity and stably selected for functional NHE1 activity. All the mutants yielded stable transfectants with varying levels of plasmalemmal NHE1 activity, as assessed by measuring rates of H+-activated22Na+ influx (summarized in TableI).Figure 2Determination of non-conserved sites encompassing transmembrane helix M9 that confer differences in drug sensitivity between NHE1 and NHE3.

The shaded boxes indicate sites in NHE1′ that were mutated to the equivalent residues in NHE3′. The gray and black shading indicates those sites that, when mutated, had either no effect or had significantly altered drug sensitivity, respectively. B–D, AP-1 cells stably expressing either wild type NHE1′, wild type NHE3′, or mutant NHE1′/G356A were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. Before22Na+ influx measurements, the cells were loaded with H+ using the NH4Cl prepulse technique. Cells were washed with Na+-free isotonic choline chloride solution and then incubated in assay medium containing carrier-free 22NaCl (1 μCi/ml) and increasing concentrations of amiloride (B), EIPA (C), or HOE694 (D) (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Data were normalized as a percentage of the maximal rate of Hi+-activated22Na+ influx in the absence of inhibitor.

To characterize their drug sensitivity, concentration-response measurements were performed with amiloride and the more selective NHE antagonists, EIPA and/or HOE694. As an initial screen, mutations that did not alter the apparent half-maximal inhibition (K0.5) for EIPA by more than 2-fold were considered wild type in behavior and not examined further. Of these mutations, only the G356A substitution significantly altered the drug sensitivity of NHE1′, effectively reducing its apparent half-maximal inhibition by amiloride, EIPA, and HOE694 by ∼5-, 32-, and 342-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, B–D and TableII). To further examine the molecular nature of this interaction, other non-polar (Leu) and polar (Ser, Asp, and Lys) amino acids were substituted at this site. Stable transfectants were generated for all four mutants, but only the G356S and G356D mutants yielded transporters with sufficient activity to reliably measure their drug inhibition profiles (Table I). Like the G356A substitution, both G356S and G356D significantly decreased EIPA sensitivity by comparable extents (72- and 33-fold, respectively) (Fig. 3 and Table II). These data suggest that increases in side-chain length rather than polarity are detrimental to drug recognition. The length of the side-chain group, however, did not closely correlate with the extent of inhibition. It was also noted that the G356S mutant displayed a modest but reproducible biphasic response to EIPA, with transport activity stimulated (10–15%) in the presence of low drug concentrations. To further establish the importance of this site, the reciprocal substitution was made in NHE3′. As shown in Fig.4, replacement of alanine with glycine at the analogous position of NHE3′ (i.e. A305G) caused a modest 4-fold gain in its sensitivity to inhibition by EIPA. Taken together, these data indicate that this site in M9 is an important determinant of drug recognition of the NHEs, with the greatest effects observed for the more NHE-selective drugs.Table IIComparison of drug inhibition constants of wild type and mutant rat Na+/H+ exchangersInhibition constants (K0.5)AmilorideEIPAHOE694mNHE1′2.5 ± 0.1 × 10−61.1 ± 0.2 × 10−81.2 ± 0.3 × 10−7NHE1′/G152AND3.2 ± 0.4 × 10−8NDNHE1′/P157S/P158FND7.9 ± 0.8 × 10−8NDNHE1′/L167F7.5 ± 1.6 × 10−63.2 ± 0.8 × 10−74.5 ± 0.9 × 10−6NHE1′/E350Q5.0 ± 0.7 × 10−51.4 ± 0.4 × 10−6NDNHE1′/E350DND5.0 ± 3.5 × 10−6NDNHE1′/E350NND6.3 ± 1.2 × 10−7NDNHE1′/G356A1.2 ± 0.1 × 10−53.6 ± 0.3 × 10−74.1 ± 2.6 × 10−5NHE1′/G356SND7.9 ± 2.6 × 10−7NDNHE1′/G356DND3.6 ± 0.4 × 10−7NDNHE1′/L167F/G356AND1.8 ± 0.3 × 10−6NDNHE3′/A305GND7.9 ± 0.8 × 10−7NDNHE3′1.1 ± 0.2 × 10−43.2 ± 0.3 × 10−66.3 ± 1.5 × 10−4Values for half-maximal inhibition (K0.5) were determined from the logit transformation of the sigmoidal inhibition data presented in Figs.

https://openalex.org/W2006119115,"Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are composed of three structurally related subunits (α, β, and γ). Each subunit has two transmembrane domains termed M1 and M2, and residues conferring cation selectivity have been shown to reside in a pore region immediately preceding the M2 domains of the three subunits. Negatively charged residues are interspersed within the M2 domains, and substitution of individual acidic residues within human α-ENaC with arginine essentially eliminated channel activity in oocytes, suggesting that these residues have a role in ion permeation. We examined the roles of M2 residues in contributing to the permeation pore by individually mutating residues within the M2 domain of mouse αENaC to cysteine and systematically characterizing functional properties of mutant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp. The introduction of cysteine residues at selected sites, including negatively charged residues (αGlu595, αGlu598, and αAsp602) led to a significant reduction of expressed amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents. Two mutations (αE595C and αD602C) resulted in K+-permeable channels whereas multiple mutations altered Li+/Na+ current ratios. Channels containing αD602K or αD602A also conducted K+ whereas more conservative mutations (αD602E and αD602N) retained wild type selectivity. Cysteine substitution at the site equivalent to αAsp602 within β mENaC (βD544C) did not alter either Li+/Na+ or K+/Na+ current ratios, although mutation of the equivalent site within γ mENaC (γD562C) significantly increased the Li+/Na+ current ratio. Mutants containing introduced cysteine residues at αGlu595, αGlu598, αAsp602, or αThr607did not respond to externally applied sulfhydryl reagent with significant changes in macroscopic currents. Our results suggest that some residues within the M2 domain of αENaC contribute to the channel's conduction pore and that, in addition to the pore region, selected sites within M2 (αGlu595 and αAsp602) may have a role in conferring ion selectivity.

This channel is a member of the ENaC/degenerin gene superfamily and is composed of three structurally related subunits, termed α, β, and γ (1Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I.

Members of the ENaC/degenerin family are homo- or hetero-oligomeric proteins whose subunits share a common topology of two membrane spanning domains (M1 and M2) and intracellular amino and carboxyl termini.

Hydropathy analyses of ENaC subunits have identified two large hydrophobic domains consisting of about 45 residues. The second hydrophobic domain contains two regions that are distinct in structure and function. The amino-terminal region is functionally similar to the pore region of many cation channels and is a key element determining pore properties of ENaC, including selectivity, gating, conductance, and the binding of channel blockers (2Schild L.

On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal regions of the second hydrophobic domains of ENaC subunits are predicted to have an α helical structure, similar to the sixth transmembrane domains (S6) of voltage-gated K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels and to the second transmembrane domains of inward rectifier K+ channels. Recent work suggests that M2 domains of ENaC also contribute to the formation of the pore. Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that mutations of the negative-charged amino acids within the M2 domains of human αENaC (E568R, E571R, and D575R) nearly eliminated channel activity, although these mutations did not alter the levels of protein expression at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, mutations of positively charged residues immediately following the α-subunit M2 domain altered cation selectivity of human ENaC (10Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the functional roles of residues within the M2 domains of ENaC, 18 residues (αVal593-αMet610) within M2 of the α subunit of mouse ENaC (mENaC) were individually mutated to cysteine. These mutant α-subunits were co-expressed with wild type β and γ mENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes and analyzed using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Our results suggest that M2 residues participate in formation of the ENaC pore and that several negatively charged residues may have a role in restricting K+ permeation through the pore. Single point mutations within M2 domains of mouse α, β, or γ ENaC subunits were generated by polymerase chain reaction as previously described (6Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Target mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing at the University of Pennsylvania DNA sequencing facility. Capped complementary RNAs (cRNAs) for mutant and wild type mENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) from linearized DNA templates. Stage V and VI Xenopus laevisoocytes were injected with 2–4 ng of cRNA for each subunit in 50 nl of H2O. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, pH 7.4). Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed at room temperature (20–24 °C) 24–72 h following cRNA injection. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and filled with 3 m KCl. Pipettes with tip resistance of 0.5–3 MΩ were chosen for experiments. Three bath solutions were used to determine the cation selectivity of the wild type or mutant mENaCs. The solutions contained 110 mm NaCl or LiCl or KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH, LiOH, or KOH, respectively. For each bath solution total macroscopic currents and remaining currents in the presence of 100 μm amiloride were measured at the clamping voltage of −100 mV. Amiloride-sensitive currents were calculated by subtracting the latter from the total currents. Cation selectivity is presented as the ratio of amiloride-sensitive current in K+ or Li+ bath solution relative to the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (IK/INa and ILi/INa). Accessibility of external sulfhydryl reagent to mENaCs was examined as previously described (7Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mm[(2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) was prepared in the bath solution freshly and delivered to the recording chamber at the flow rate of 5–6 ml/min. Ratios of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents recorded at −100 mV at 2 min after starting perfusion of MTSET and before perfusion were used to define the effects of this reagent on wild type and mutant channels. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Student's t test was performed to statistically compare the differences between wild type and mutant channels using Microsoft Excel 97. Our previous analyses of the secondary structure of the pore region of αmENaC suggested that residues Ser592-Leu612 (or up to Phe615) form the α-helical membrane-spanning domain (6Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the three ENaC subunits share only limited overall sequence homology at amino acid level (33–37%), the M2 domains within the three ENaC subunits share greater than 50% sequence similarity (Fig.1 A). This region is also highly conserved within other members of the ENaC/degenerin family. Polar residues are interspersed throughout the M2 domains of α, β, and γ mENaC and are predicted to line one face of the α helix (Fig.1, B, C, and D). All αβγ mENaCs containing substituted cysteine residues within the M2 domain of αmENaC expressed amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents, although levels of current expression varied (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, all mutants with cysteine substitutions of negatively charged residues displayed smaller currents than wild type, consistent with the observations of Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because levels of Na+ current expression vary between different batches of oocytes, we compared current expression of wild type and mutant mENaCs in a paired manner. Wild type or mutant αmENaC together with wild type β and γ mENaC cRNAs were co-injected into oocytes obtained from a single batch of oocytes. Amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+ currents were determined in oocytes expressing wild type αβγ mENaC, αE595Cβγ, αE598Cβγ, αD602Cβγ, or αT607Cβγ. As shown in Fig. 2 B, expression of αE595Cβγ, αE598Cβγ, or αD602Cβγ led to a significantly reduced amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+currents when compared with wild type. Furthermore, substitution of αAsp602 with E, K, or N, or substitution of a cysteine residue at the analogous sites within β (βAsp544) or γ (γAsp562) mENaC led to a significant reduction in amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+ currents (Fig.2 C). The reduction of expressed whole cell Na+currents observed with channels containing conservative substitutions of αAsp602 (αD602E, αD602N) was modest, when compared with channels with non-conserved substitutions (αD602C and αD602K). No detectable amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were observed in oocytes injected with double (αβD544C γD562C) or triple mutants (αD602C βD544C γD562C). Although the exact role of the negatively charged residues within M2 domains of ENaC subunits is not clear, these results suggest that polar residues in M2 domains have an important role in the functional expression of ENaC, as suggested by Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M2 domains likely form part of the ENaC conduction pore in a manner similar to S6 of voltage-gated cation channels and M2 of inward rectifier K+ channels. Furthermore, residues within M2 may have a role in maintaining the cation-selective characteristics of ENaC. We examined whether mutations within the M2 domain of αmENaC result in alterations in the cation-selective phenotype by determining the amiloride-sensitive Li+/Na+ and K+/Na+current ratios. Wild type channels have an ILi/INa of 1.98 ± 0.06 (n = 12), and an IK/INa of −0.03 ± 0.01 (n = 12). Two mutant channels, αE595Cβγ and αD602Cβγ, exhibited measurable inward amiloride-sensitive K+ currents at the clamping voltage of −100 mV with K+/Na+ current ratios of 0.11 ± 0.02 (n = 12) and 0.12 ± 0.06 (n = 8), respectively. The IK/INaof αM610Cβγ was statistically higher than that of wild type (0.02 ± 0.01, n = 7, p < 0.01), however, the mutant channel was still highly selective for Na+ over K+ (50:1). αMet610 of mENaC is aligned to αMet583 of human ENaC that is located in proximity to residues αArg586-Arg587 (Fig.6 B). It has been shown that αR586E-R587E significantly increased K+ and Li+ permeabilities relative to Na+ (10Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutations (αV593C, αV594C, αM596C, αA597C, αE598C, αI600C, αF601C, D602C, L603C, L604C, and αT607C) led to a moderate increase in ILi/INa, whereas αE595C resulted in a moderate decrease in ILi/INa (Fig.3).Figure 3Cation selectivity of wild type and mutant mENaCs. A, ratios of K+ and Na+currents. Oocytes were injected with αβγ mENaC cRNAs or α mutant together with wild type βγ mENaC cRNAs. Inward currents were measured at −100 mV from oocytes bathed in Na+ or K+ bath solution. The ratios of IK/INa were calculated from amiloride-sensitive currents measured in the presence of a K+ or Na+ bath solution. B, ratios of Li+ and Na+ currents.ILi/INa was determined from amiloride-sensitive currents measured at −100 mV in the presence of a Li+ or Na+ bath solution. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from 13 oocytes for wild type and 6–14 oocytes for mutants. Open bars represent current ratios of wild type or mutant channels whose values were not significantly different from that of wild type. Filled bars indicate that the current ratios of mutant channels were statistically different from that of wild type at the significance level of 0.01 for IK/INa or 0.05 for ILi/INa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of αAsp602 in contributing to the cation selectivity of ENaC was further examined by introducing several different amino acid residues at this site. αD602Kβγ and αD602Aβγ exhibited K+/Na+ current ratios that were significantly greater than wild type. In contrast, conservative mutations (αD602N and αD602E) did not alter IK/INa (Fig.4). Moreover, mutations at the sites corresponding to αAsp602 within β or γ mENaC (βD544C or γD562C) did not alter IK/INa. Although αD602C and γD562C led to small but significant increases in ILi/INa, the other mutants (αD602K, αD602A, αD602N, αD602E, and βD544C) displayed Li+/Na+ current ratios (measured at −100 mV) similar to that of wild type (Figs. 4). Representative voltage clamp recordings and current-voltage curves for wild type and selected mutant mENaCs are shown in Fig.5. As shown in Fig. 5 D(right panel), αD602Kβγ channels displayed inward rectification when bathed in solutions containing Na+ or Li+ as the primary cation, whereas wild type channels did not show obvious rectification (Fig. 5 A, right panel).Figure 5Representative two-electrode voltage clamp recordings and current-voltage curves of wild type and mutant mENaCs. Oocytes expressing wild type αβγ (A), αE595Cβγ (B), αD602Cβγ (C), or αD602Kβγ (D) were bathed in Na+, Li+, and K+ bath solutions sequentially and clamped from −140 mV to 60 mV in 20-mV increments. Current traces obtained in Na+, Li+, and K+solutions from the same oocyte are displayed from left to right with scale bars below each current trace in K+ solution. Dashed lines indicate zero current level in all traces. Current-voltage curves on the right were generated by plotting average amiloride-sensitive currents in K+ (○), Na+ (▪), or Li+ (▴) against clamping voltages in the range as displayed without curve fitting. Currents were not normalized, and the data were collected from 7–9 oocytes in each group. For αE595C, αD603C, and αD602K, oocytes with whole cell Na+currents larger than 200 nA at −100 mV were used for ion selectivity studies. Vertical error bars are standard errors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The two mutants (αE595Cβγ and αD602Cβγ) that expressed measurable K+ currents happened to be mutants that expressed very low levels of amiloride-sensitive Na+current (Fig. 2 A). We examined whether the low levels of expressed Na+ currents compromised the measurements of IK/INa. Injection of a reduced amount of wild type αβγ mENaC cRNA (0.3 ng/subunit) resulted in expression of amiloride-sensitive inward Na+currents in the range of 0.2–0.6 μA, similar in magnitude to that observed with αE595Cβγ and αD602Cβγ. As expected, the ILi/INa and IK/INa of the wild type mENaC were 1.81 ± 0.12 (n = 4) and 0 ± 0 (n = 4), respectively, and did not differ from the ILi/INa and IK/INa we observed for wild type channels from oocytes injected with 2–4 ng of cRNA/subunit. This indicated that the increased K+/Na+current ratios from αE595Cβγ and αD602Cβγ mENaCs were not due to the low levels of expressed Na+ currents. We probed the accessibility of cysteine substitutions at positions αGlu595, αGlu598, αAsp602, or αThr607 within αmENaC M2 to an externally applied sulfhydryl reagent (MTSET). None of the mutant channels responded to MTSET with a change in amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+currents that differed significantly from wild type (data not shown). These results suggest that these residues are not accessible to external MTSET, as expected given their location within M2. We cannot exclude the possibility that MTSET reacted with these cysteine residues but resulted in no change in channel activity. The last transmembrane domains of most cation-selective ion channels (i.e. S6 or M2) form a component of the channel pore (11Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that ENaC M2 residues contribute to the formation of the pore, based on the findings that selected mutations within M2 alter whole cell currents and cation selectivity. Negatively charged residues are interspersed in a conserved manner within the M2 domains of ENaC subunits (Fig. 1). Our results indicate that point mutations at any of the three negatively charged residues in the M2 domain of αmENaC subunit significantly reduced amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents, and expression of channels with either double (αβD544C γD562C) or triple (αD602C βD544C γD562C) mutations of the negatively charged residues with ENaC M2 domains failed to produce measurable amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in agreement with observations of Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction in whole cell Na+currents observed with point mutations of polar residues within mENaC M2 domains, as well as the reduction in single-channel Li+conductance previously reported with αD575Rβγ hENaC (human αAsp575 and mouse αAsp602 are at equivalent positions within αENaC), are consistent with the notion that these acidic residues may line the conduction pore and their side chains may provide ion-binding sites (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, these charged residues may have a role in maintaining proper channel conformation, and mutations within M2 domains may disrupt or destabilize the conformation of the channel pore, leading to a reduction of ion conduction. Membrane proteins with charged residues within helical transmembrane domains are common and are often neutralized by residues with countercharges within other membrane-spanning domains of the same protein or interacting proteins. For example, positive charges in S4 domains of voltage-gated K+ channels are thought to be neutralized by negative charges in S2 and S3 domains through ion pairing, providing a mechanism of voltage-dependent channel gating (18Keynes R.D. Elinder F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 266: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Lin M. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The interdomain electrostatic interactions between transmembrane domains have also been suggested to mediate folding of voltage-gated K+ channels (20Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mutations that alter the channel conformation may interfere with its assembly or trafficking to the plasma membrane, although Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that reversal of the three negatively charged residues within human αENaC does not significantly alter the surface expression of the mutant channels based on confocal images of oocytes expressing mutant αhENaC with green fluorescence protein-tagged β or γ hENaC (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of whole cell Na+ currents observed with mutations within the M2 domain may also reflect changes in channel open probability, although Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that channel gating is not significantly altered by mutations of negatively charged M2 residues. The M2 domain may have a role in the regulation of channel gating, because ENaC M2 chimeras exhibited alterations in channel open probability (21Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36415-36421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and a track within M2 of rat βENaC (Leu535-Glu540) affected gating properties of αβ rENaC (22Zhang P. Fyfe G.K. Grichtchenko I.I. Canessa C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3043-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms may account for the current reduction we observed with point mutations within mENaC M2 domains. Mutation of a residue within Kir channels (Asp172 of Kir 2.1; Asn171 of Kir 1.1; and Glu158 of Kir 4.1) has been shown to affect ion permeation, selectivity, inward rectification, and sensitivity to channel modulators (23Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24Abrams C.J. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol.

For many cation-selective ion channels, ion selectivity is largely governed by a selectivity filter that is formed by a conserved sequence of amino acid residues within a pore region (or “P” loop) preceding the M2 or S6 domains (26Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar, 27Armstrong C.M. Hille B.

ENaC has an analogous 3-residue tract ((G/S)XS) preceding M2 within each subunit that has been identified as a key component of the pore region that confers cation selectivity (3Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that there are other sites beyond the pore region of ENaC where mutations result in measurable amiloride-sensitive K+ currents. The residues αGlu595 and αAsp602 within M2 may have a role in restricting K+ permeation through ENaC (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Although Langloh et al. (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not observe K+-permeable channels when arginine was substituted at the corresponding residues within αhENaC, the whole cell Na+currents measured in oocytes expressing these mutant hENaCs were very small (46–93 nA at −100 mV) (9Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: C277-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and measurement of even smaller inward K+ currents would be difficult. Furthermore, our results suggest that multiple residues within M2 of αmENaC affect Li+/Na+ selectivity (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). How do mutations at αE595 or αD602 within mENaC M2 alter channel selectivity? We previously suggested that the ENaC pore might be arranged in a manner similar to the KcsA K+ channel pore (6Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This would place αGlu595 and αAsp602 in close proximity to the putative selectivity filter formed by (G/S)XS track and adjacent residues and allow for side-chain interactions between αGlu595, αAsp602, and selectivity filter residues. These side-chain interactions may have an important role in maintaining the precise structure of the filter. Alternatively, αAsp602may contribute to a secondary selectivity filter that is located internal to the main selectivity filter. A second “internal” selectivity filter has been proposed for the K+ channel Kir 2.1, because mutations of Ser165 and Asp172within the M2 domain of Kir 2.1 alter cation selectivity (15Thompson G.A. Leyland M.L. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 231-240Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Abrams C.J. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 643-649Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Reuveny E. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 754-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A point mutation within S6 of the voltage-gated ShakerK+ channel (A463C) decreased K+ affinity from the micromolar to millimolar range (30Ogielska E.M. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This residue can be aligned with αAsp602 within the ENaC M2 domain (Fig.6 B). By analogy, mutations of αAsp602 might modify cation ENaC selectivity by altering Na+ and/or K+ affinity for a site within the channel pore. Our data cannot distinguish among these possible explanations for K+ permeation observed with the αGlu595 and αAsp602 mutations. However, homology modeling of αENaC M2 and models of Kir 2.1 M2 (based on the structure of KcsA) suggest that αAsp602 aligns with Ser165 within the M2 of Kir 2.1 (Fig. 6 B). We propose that αAsp602 is a pore-lining residue and a ring of four aspartate residues (2 from α, 1 from β, and 1 from γENaC) form an additional cation binding site (or secondary selectivity filter) in the ENaC pore. Although mutation of the corresponding residues within βmENaC (βD544C) or γmENaC (γD562C) did not result in K+-permeable channels, γD562C significantly increased the Li+/Na+ current ratio. The absence of K+ permeation through channels containing βD544C or γD562C, and K+ permeation through αD602Cβγ, may reflect the channel subunit stoichiometry (i.e. 2α, 1β, 1γ) (31Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 32Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type mENaC, whole cell currents measured in oocytes expressing αD602Kβγ displayed voltage dependence (inward rectification) when oocytes where bathed with either Li+ or Na+ (Fig. 5 D). Amiloride-inhibitable outward currents were not observed with clamping voltages up to +60 mV. Interestingly, the introduction of a cysteine residue at αAsp602 did not induce a similar voltage-dependence (Fig.5 C). The current rectification observed with αD602Kβγ is reminiscent of the inward rectification observed with Kir 2.1, where Asp172 serves as blocking site for intracellular Mg2+ (33Lu Z. MacKinnon R. Nature. 1994; 371: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 34Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 35Oliver D. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5824-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The introduction of positively charged lysine or histidine at Asp172 within Kir 2.1 results in permanent rectification (36Lu Z. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13133-13138Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Lu Z. MacKinnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is possible that the introduction of a positive charge at αAsp602 of mENaC caused inward rectification of Li+ and Na+ currents as a result of blocking outward currents due to electrostatic interaction between the charged amino group of αD602K and permeant Li+ or Na+. Residue αD602K may re-orientate its side chain toward extracellular space during depolarization, and as a result the pore diameter at this site is slightly reduced. Outward ion flow therefore is blocked while inward ion flow occurs at negative membrane potentials. Alternatively, αD602K may enhance the voltage dependence of ENaC open probability. It has been demonstrated that ENaC open probability increases during hyperpolarization (38Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to elucidate the behavior of the current-voltage relationship of the mutant channel. Although the resolved structure of KcsA K+ channel pore revealed an elegant explanation for the mechanism of cation selectivity, the ion selectivity process may not be accomplished exclusively by the selectivity filter. Mutations within K+channel S6 or M2 domains affect ion selectivity, unitary conductance, gating, and inhibition by cytoplasmic blockers. Recent studies have shown that non-pore region domains may also contribute to the ion selectivity process (15Thompson G.A. Leyland M.L. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 231-240Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Immke D. Kiss L. LoTurco J. Korn S.J. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar, 41Choe H. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. J.

Mutations outside of the pore region affect cation selectivity of ENaC, suggesting ENaC selectivity may involve multiple sites. Mutations of two arginine residues (K504E and K515E) near the carboxyl terminus of the extracellular domain of bovine αENaC alter Na+/K+ selectivity, amiloride sensitivity, and gating behavior (43Fuller C.M.

Mutations of arginine residues (αR586E-R587E) near the carboxyl-terminal end of human αENaC M2 also resulted in significant changes in K+/Na+ and Li+/Na+ selectivity (10Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A stretch of residues within the amino terminus (preceding the first transmembrane domain) of an acid-sensing ion channel type 2, a member of the ENaC/degenerin family, was identified as a region that has a role in determining K+/Na+ selectivity (44Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All these domains may work together in a concerted manner to achieve the unique cation-selective profile of ENaC. On the basis of secondary structural predictions and mutagenesis studies, it is likely that ENaC M2 domains are α helical. Whether the M2 helices are arranged similarly to the resolved M2 structures within the other two transmembrane domain ion channels is unclear. In KcsA K+ channel, M2 domains consisting of 27 residues traverse the membrane at an angle of 25° relative to the membrane normal. Their amino termini are packed against pore helixes and the selectivity filter, and carboxyl termini form the inner vestibule of the channel pore (26Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). The S6 helices of voltage-gated K+ channels have a conserved Pro-X-Pro motif near the carboxyl terminus that induces a kink in the helix (45del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). ENaC M2 domains lack proline residues, and helical wheel analyses of ENaC M2 domains indicate that all polar M2 residues align with one face of the helix. We propose that ENaC M2 domains exist as straight helices without a kink. Furthermore, the changes in selectivity observed with mutations at αAsp602 suggest that the ENaC M2 residues may be located in close proximity to the pore axis, thus forming a second selectivity or cation-binding site. A structural model for αmENaC M2 is illustrated in Fig. 6 A. The two αmENaC M2 helices face each other and are tilted with respect to the membrane normal, forming an “inverted teepee” shape, similarly to KcsA. The three charged residues within αmENaC M2 face the pore. In summary, our results suggest that that residues within the M2 domain of αENaC contribute to the conduction pore and that, in addition to the selectivity filter preceding M2, selected sites within M2 (αGlu595 and αAsp602) may have a role in conferring ion selectivity."

We have purified the AOH1 protein to homogeneity in its catalytically active form from mouse liver. Twenty tryptic peptides, identified or directly sequenced by mass spectrometry, confirm the primary structure of the polypeptide deduced from theAOH1 gene. The enzyme contains one molecule of FAD, one atom of molybdenum, and four atoms of iron per subunit and shows spectroscopic features similar to those of the prototypic molybdo-flavoprotein xanthine oxidoreductase. The AOH1 andAOH2 genes are 98 and 60 kilobases long, respectively, and consist of 35 coding exons. The AOH1 gene has the potential to transcribe an extra leader non-coding exon, which is located downstream of exon 26, and is transcribed in the opposite orientation relative to all the other exons. AOH1 and AOH2map to chromosome 1 in close proximity to each other and to the aldehyde oxidase gene, forming a molybdo-flavoenzyme gene cluster. Conservation in the position of exon/intron junctions among the mouseAOH1, AOH2, aldehyde oxidase, and xanthine oxidoreductase loci indicates that these genes are derived from the duplication of an ancestral precursor.

In mammals, this family was originally thought to consist of two members, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)1 and aldehyde oxidase (AO) (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Although XOR is the key enzyme in the catabolism of purines, oxidizing hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid (7Kurosaki M. Zanotta S. Li Calzi M. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Kurosaki M. Li Calzi M. Scanziani E. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the physiological function of AO is still unknown, although the enzyme is involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics of toxicological importance (9Fabre G. Seither R. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Cates L.A. Jones Jr., G.S. Good D.J. Tsai H.Y. Li V.S. Caron N. Tu S.C. Kimball A.P. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). AO and XOR have similar primary and secondary structure (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar) and utilize an overlapping set of substrates (11Krenitsky T.A. Neil S.M. Elion G.B. Hitchings G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recently, we suggested that the family of mammalian molybdo-flavoproteins extends beyond XOR and AO and includes at least two other members, which we provisionally named AOH1 and AOH2 (Aldehyde Oxidase Homologs 1 and 2) (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cDNAs coding for AOH1 and AOH2 were identified and cloned because of their remarkable nucleotide sequence similarity to both AO and XOR (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Like AO and XOR, AOH1 and AOH2 are characterized by the presence of two highly conserved domains encoding non-identical 2Fe-2S redox clusters and the fingerprint sequence found in all molybdo-proteins (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). In addition, the length of the predicted translation products of the AOH1 and AOH2 cDNAs is similar to that of AO and XOR. The two cDNAs code for predicted polypeptides that are structurally more related to AO than to XOR. This led us to propose that the products of the AOH1 and AOH2 cDNAs represent isoenzymatic variants of aldehyde oxidase acting on a non-identical but overlapping set of substrates. AOH1 is expressed in the same tissues and cell types as AO and is synthesized predominantly in the liver. Although AO is expressed only in adult liver, AOH1 is also present in embryonic and neonatal liver. The distribution of AOH2 is strictly limited to keratinized epithelia in the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, and skin (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this article, we provide a first characterization of the native AOH1 protein, which was purified to homogeneity from mouse liver. Mass spectrometric analysis of purified AOH1 confirms the amino acid sequence deduced from the corresponding gene and cDNA. The enzyme has spectroscopic characteristics similar to those of other molybdo-flavoproteins, contains FAD as the cofactor, and oxidizes benzaldehyde and phthalazine, two substrates of aldehyde oxidase (13Holmes R.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 61B: 339Google Scholar,14Beedham C. Bruce S.E. Critchley D.J. Rance D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, we report the molecular cloning, structural characterization, and chromosomal mapping of the mouse AOH1 and AOH2 genetic loci. Unless otherwise stated, all the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Male mouse livers were homogenized in 3 volumes of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with an Ultraturrax homogenizer (Omni 2000, Omni International, Waterbury, CT). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to obtain cytosolic extracts. Extracts were heated at 55 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove precipitated proteins. An equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-glycine buffer, pH 9.0. Solubilized proteins (equivalent to 10 g of fresh liver) were mixed with 5 ml of benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) pre-equilibrated in 100 mmTris-glycine buffer, pH 9.0. Following 2 h of incubation, the resin was washed four times with 10 ml each of the equilibration buffer to remove unbound proteins. Adsorbed proteins were eluted twice with 5-ml aliquots of equilibration buffer containing 5 mmbenzamidine (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO). The eluate was concentrated to ∼1 ml with Centriplus YM-100 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and diluted to 10 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The solution was applied to a 5/5 FPLC Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. AOH1 protein was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient (30 ml) from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The purification of AOH1 was monitored by determination of phthalazine oxidizing activity, as described below, or by quantitative Western blot analysis (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the case of phthalazine oxidation, one unit of enzymatic activity corresponds to 1 nmol of phthalazine oxidized/min. A specific anti-AOH1 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of the protein (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used for Western blot analysis, which was carried out with a chemiluminescence-based protocol, as already described (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For quantitative Western blot analysis, an equivalent volume (10 μl) of protein solution, at each purification step, was loaded onto the same gel and processed for analysis. Chemiluminescence signals corresponding to AOH1 bands were quantitated with a scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The total amount of AOH1-immunoreactive protein in the various experimental samples is expressed in arbitrary units and is calculated on the basis of the intensity of the Western blot signal in optical density (OD) multiplied by the total volume of each purification step. One arbitrary unit of immunoreactive protein corresponds to 1.0 OD (optical density) of the specific AOH1 band in each experimental sample. Zymographic analysis of benzaldehyde oxidizing activity was performed following electrophoresis on cellulose acetate plates, as already described (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard techniques (15Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were measured according to the Bradford method with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, VA). The mass of purified AOH1 was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MALDI-MS). An aliquot of pure AOH1 in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, was mixed with the matrix (sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and analyzed by MALDI-MS. MALDI-MS and Electrospray Ionization (ESI-MS) tandem mass spectrometric analyses of AOH1 tryptic peptides were performed according to standard protocols following in situ or in gel tryptic digestion (16Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins or Coomassie Blue-stained gel slices were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mmammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 30 min to reduce disulfide bridges. Thiol groups were alkylated upon reaction with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Tryptic digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted twice in 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid. The combined extracts were lyophilized and re-dissolved in 0.5% formic acid and desalted using ZipTip (Millipore). Peptides were eluted in 50% methanol/0.5% formic acid. The eluate was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 1:3 (v/v). Mass mapping of tryptic peptides was performed with a Bruker Biflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Data generated were processed with the Mascot program (www.matrixscience.com) (18Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J,. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar) allowing a mass tolerance of ≤0.4 Da. Direct sequence analysis was carried out via collision-induced dissociation (CID) on an electrospray mass spectrometer API 3000 (Applied Biosystems, San Diego, CA). The program MS-Tag (prospector.ucsf.edu) (19Clauser K.R. Baker P.R. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) was used to correlate the experimental CID spectra to the theoretical CID spectra of tryptic peptides derived from proteins present in data bases. Following purification of AOH1 to homogeneity, the molybdenum content was determined on an inductive-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (model ELAN 5000, PerkinElmer Sciex, Foster City, CA) equipped with a Coolflow CFT-75 NESLAB device and a Cross-Flow nebulizer. The iron content was determined in standard conditions (20Triplett E.W. Blevins D.G. Randall D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on a PerkinElmer Zeeman 30/30 atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a graphite furnace. The absorbance spectra of AOH1 in its native state and of the cofactors released following heat denaturation of the protein (100 °C for 10 min) were recorded at 20 °C with a Hewlett-Packard HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer interfaced to a Vectra XA personal computer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Identification of the flavin cofactor bound to AOH1 was carried out fluorometrically as described previously (21Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of AOH1 preparations (∼2–2.5 μm) were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. After removal of the denatured protein by centrifugation, the intensity of light emitted at 524 nm on excitation with light at 450 nm was recorded before and after addition of snake venom phosphodiesterase (2 μl, 6 milliunits, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). An increase in fluorescence emission of ∼10 is expected for a homogeneous solution of FAD being converted into FMN + AMP by phosphodiesterase. Fluorescence measurements were performed in a Jasco FP777 (OmniLab Ltd. & OmniLab Biosystems Ltd., Mettmenstetten, Switzerland) thermostatted at 20 °C. The initial reaction velocity of AOH1-dependent phthalazine oxidizing activity was measured at 25 °C in 50 mmHepes/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmferricyanide, 0.04 μm AOH1, and variable concentration of phthalazine (1 μm to 1 mm). Ferricyanide reduction was monitored at 420 nm using a Cary219 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Activities are expressed as apparent turnover numbers (i.e. micromoles of phthalazine oxidized per second per micromole of AOH1) taking into account that 2 mol of ferricyanide (extinction coefficient of 1.04 mm−1 cm−1) are reduced per mole of oxidized phthalazine. The AOH1 concentration is calculated considering a subunit mass of 150,000, following determination of the protein concentration with the Bradford method. Estimates of the apparent maximum velocity and K m values were obtained by fitting the initial velocity to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) as a function of phthalazine concentration, after visual inspection of double-reciprocal plots (Equation 2) allowed us to detect a phthalazine concentration range that did not give substrate inhibition,v=(V×S)/K+S)Equation 1 1/v=1/V+(K/V)×1/SEquation 2 where v is the initial velocity measured at a given substrate concentration (S); V is the apparent maximum velocity extrapolated at infinite substrate concentration, andK is the apparent Michaelis constant (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). The Grafit version 4.0 (Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK) was used for data analysis. Mouse metaphase chromosomes were prepared as previously described (23Saccone S. Cacciò S. Perani P. Andreozzi L. Rapisarda A. Motta S. Bernardi G. Chromosome Res. 1997; 5: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In situ hybridizations were performed using the following biotin- or digoxigenin-labeled probes: the ∼3-kb AOH1 cDNA fragment contained in AOH1–24/1 (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); the ∼2-kb AOH2 cDNA fragment contained in AA79991 (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); the AOH1-containing PAC 2 DNA; the AOH2 containing PAC3 DNA; and the AO containing lambda phage DNA 9m (12Terao M.

Following labeling by nick translation, the probes were ethanol-precipitated with a 50-fold excess of yeast tRNA and salmon sperm DNA (carrier DNAs), and a 50-fold excess of mouse Cot1 (competitor DNA). The nucleic acid mixtures were resuspended in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, to have a probe concentration of 5–20 ng/μl. A pre-annealing step was performed by incubating the hybridization mixtures at 37 °C for 30–60 min. Hybridization, detection with fluoresceinated avidin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and chromosome G-banding were performed as described previously (23Saccone S. Cacciò S. Perani P. Andreozzi L. Rapisarda A. Motta S. Bernardi G. Chromosome Res. 1997; 5: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of co-hybridization of two different probes labeled with biotin (Lambda phage DNA 9m) and digoxigenin (PAC2 or PAC3 DNA), detection was performed using rhodamine-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and fluorescein conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY). A genomic library from Sv/129 mice arrayed on nylon filters at high density was obtained from the Human Genome Mapping Program (HGMP, Oxford, UK). The library was sequentially screened with32P-labeled full-length mouse AOH1 and AOH2 cDNAs (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions were as indicated by the filter manufacturer. This resulted in the isolation of 14 AOH1 and 5 AOH2 hybridizing clones. Three overlapping clones, PAC1 to PAC3, were further characterized according to their hybridization profile with AOH1, AOH2, and AO cDNA probes. The distance between adjacent exons was established by long-range PCR analysis on either PAC DNA preparations or genomic DNA fragments, using specific couples of amplimers. Appropriate DNA fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript plasmid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. Alternatively, DNA fragments containing one or more exons and the corresponding introns were PCR-amplified and subcloned as above or directly sequenced, according to the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method using double-stranded DNA as template and T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) or Sequenase (Upstate Biotechnology, Cleveland, OH). Exons and exon/intron junctions were sequenced in both directions. Oligodeoxynucleotide primers were custom-synthesized by M-Medical srl (Florence, Italy). Computer analysis of the DNA sequences was performed using the GeneWorks sequence analysis system (IntelliGenetics, San Diego, CA). A search of potential binding sites for transcription factors in the 5′-flanking region of the AOH1 and AOH2 genes was performed using the MatInspector algorithm and the TRANSFAC data base (24Wingender E. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Karas H. Heinemeyer T. Dietze P. Knuppel R. Romaschenko A.G. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures (15Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) on DNA extracted from PAC clones or high molecular weight genomic DNA derived from various animal species. The probes used were fragments of the mouse AO, AOH1, and AOH2 cDNAs. Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver and skin, and the poly(A+) fraction of the RNA was selected according to standard protocols (15Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed with the commercially available Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to the nested PCR protocol included and using the following amplimers: SP1, 5′-ACTGATCCTTTTGGAGATGGGG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 388–409 of the AOH1 cDNA); NP1, 5′-CCTAGCAAAGGGCGTATATGATGATA-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 51–76 of the AOH1 cDNA); NP2, 5′-TAAGCTCATCTGACTCCTTAGAAGGA-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 205–230 of the AOH1 cDNA); SP2, 5′-TTGATGCTCCCCACACCTTCCA-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 380–401 of the AOH2 cDNA); NP3, 5′-GGTGTCAATGGGGAGCCAGAAGCACAAATT-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 76–105 of the AOH2 cDNA); 5′-CCTGGTGTAGAACAGTAGATTC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 189–210 of the AOH2 cDNA). PCR products were subcloned in pBluescript, and multiple clones were sequenced to determine the 5′-end of the AOH1 and AOH2 transcripts. HEK-293 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). To determine the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking regions of exons 1bis and 1 of the AOH1 and exon 1 of theAOH2 genes, we constructed the plasmids:p5FR1/1bis-Luc, p5FR1/1-Luc, andp5FR2-Luc. To obtain p5FR1/1bis-Luc, a 0.9-kbXbaI-PstI fragment, containing 583 bp of the 5′-flanking region of AOH1 exon 1bis, exon 1bis and 221 bp of the corresponding intron, was subcloned in pBluescript (p5FR1/1bis-blue). The insert was released from p5FR1bis-blue by KpnI-XhoI cleavage and inserted into the pGL-Basic Vector (CLONTECH) pre-digested with the same endonucleases. To construct p5FR1-Luc, a 1.7-kbEcoRI-HincII fragment, containing 1.2 kb of the 5′-flanking region of AOH1 exon 1, exon 1 and 483 bp of the corresponding intron, was subcloned in pBluescript (p5FR1/1-blue). The plasmid was digested withEcoRI, blunted, and digested with XhoI. The resulting fragment was inserted into the pGL-Basic Vector pre-digested with NheI and XhoI. To preparep5FR2-Luc, a 1.4-kb XbaI-ApaI fragment, containing 695 bp of the 5′-flanking region ofAOH2 exon 1, exon 1 and 588 bp of the corresponding intron, was subcloned in pBluescript (p5FR2-blue). The resulting plasmid was digested with NotI-ApaI, blunted, and inserted into the pGL-Basic Vector, which was pre-digested with XhoI and blunted. The constructs were transfected in HEK-293 cells using cationic liposomes as already described (25Demontis S. Kurosaki M. Saccone S. Motta S. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochim. Biophys.

Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and cell extracts were used for the determination of luciferase activity using an already described protocol (25Demontis S.

Typical results obtained from one of six AOH1 purification experiments are shown in Table I. The procedure yields ∼2% of AOH1 and results in more than 150-fold enrichment of the protein relative to liver cytosolic extracts. Interestingly, similar final yields and purification factors are calculated from the immunological data described under “Experimental Procedures.” This indicates that almost all mouse liver phthalazine-oxidizing activity can be accounted for by AOH1 and suggests that the majority of the enzyme is in its catalytically active form.Table IPurification scheme of mouse liver AOH1StepVolumeProteinPhthalazine-oxidizing activityAOH1 immunoreactive proteinTotalSpecific activityPurification factorYieldTotalSpecific activityPurification factorYieldmlmgunitsunits/mg-fold%unitsunits/mg-fold%Extract25104162506.31.010010901.01.010055 °C2070163609.11.41029411.31.386(NH4)2SO42042040909.71.5658121.91.974Benzamidine-Sepharose10.54520963.0152.88.33972.2723.6Mono Q0.50.111101000158.71.819172.71731.7Ten grame of mouse liver was isolated, homogenized in 30 ml of buffer, and ultracentrifuged to obtain a cytosolic extract (Extract), which was processed as indicated.

This mutation was observed in a Japanese population at an allele frequency of 7.8%. To delineate the functional consequences of this structural alteration, Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with constructs encoding either wild-type or A224D mutated PAFR. No significant difference was observed in the expression level of the receptor or the affinity to PAF or to an antagonist, WEB2086, between the cells transfected with wild-type and mutant PAFR. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing A224D mutant PAFR displayed partial but significant reduction of PAF-induced intracellular signals such as calcium mobilization, inositol phosphate production, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and chemotaxis. These findings suggest that this variant receptor produced by a naturally occurring mutation exhibits impaired coupling to G-proteins and may be a basis for interindividual variation in PAF-related physiological responses, disease predisposition or phenotypes, and drug responsiveness.

PAFR is linked to intracellular signal transduction pathways, including turnover of phosphatidylinositol, elevation in intracellular calcium concentration, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Concomitantly, PAFR couples with various phospholipases, such as phospholipase A2, Cβ, and D, and kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases, thus exerting pleiotropic effects (3Ishii S.

For example, a bronchoprovocation test of aerosolized PAF induced bronchial and vascular responses in healthy subjects, but some subjects almost completely lack these responses (4Rodriguez-Roisin R.

Such variation can be explained by the genetic polymorphisms in the receptor itself, its cognate G-proteins, or downstream intracellular targets. Because the PAF-PAFR system is important in the physiology of reproductive, cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems and in the pathophysiology of allergy, inflammation, shock, and thromboembolic diseases (3Ishii S.

The substitution occurs in the putative third cytoplasmic loop and might be expected to affect the interaction with G-proteins. We therefore analyzed the ligand binding and signal transduction properties of the mutant receptor by expressing it in mammalian cell lines.DISCUSSIONPAFR activates multiple signaling pathways in response to its agonist PAF and exhibits numerous biological activities (3Ishii S.

We analyzed the human PAFR gene in search for the host genetic factors that modify the biological phenotypes related to PAF-PAFR system and identified a single amino acid substitution (A224D) in the third cytoplasmic loop of human PAFR. This DNA variant was relatively common in the Japanese population with an allele frequency of 7.8%. Thein vitro analysis of this variant demonstrated significant impairment of the receptor functions in terms of intracellular calcium mobilization, phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, the cells expressing the variant receptor showed decreased chemotactic activity to PAF compared with the cells expressing the wild-type receptor.The third cytoplasmic loop has been considered essential for receptor-G-protein coupling in various seven-transmembrane receptors (14Strader C.D.

Using a mutagenesis approach, two separate portions of the third cytoplasmic loop of PAFR have been identified as the region possibly involved in G-protein interaction and activation/inactivation of the receptor (20Parent J.L.

(19Carlson S.A. Chatterjee T.K. Murphy K.P. Fisher R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) proposed the presence of an amphipathic α-helix encompassing the amino acids 209–220 in the third cytoplasmic domain of PAFR and proposed that the disruption of either the polar or hydrophobic faces of this putative amphipathic α-helix completely diminished PAF-induced inositol phosphate accumulation. Another candidate region for the coupling of PAFR with G-proteins is the C-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop. Studies of the α1-, α2-, and β2-adrenergic receptors have demonstrated that the substitution of a specific amino acid residue in this region resulted in the constitutively active receptors (21Small K.M.

Human PAFR with an artificial mutation at position 231 from leucine to arginine in the C terminus of the third cytoplasmic loop is also constitutively active with the higher affinity to PAF (20Parent J.L.

In contrast, substitution of alanine at position 230 to glutamic acid of human PAFR caused unresponsiveness to PAF assessed by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and a marked decrease in the receptor affinity to the agonist (20Parent J.L.

Since the naturally occurring A224D variant identified in the Japanese population is located between the putative amphipathic α-helix and the C-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop, this residue is unlikely to be directly associated with G-protein coupling. The alanine 224 is conserved among human, mouse, and guinea pig PAFR and is replaced with noncharged proline in rat PAFR. Thus, the introduction of negatively charged aspartic acid in A224D variant may modify the conformation of the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix or the C-terminal portion or both, resulting in exerting an indirect effect on the PAFR coupling to G-proteins. Furthermore, our data showed that this mutation attenuated both PAFR couplings to pertussis toxin-sensitive (probably Gq/G11) and -insensitive (probably Gi/Go) G-proteins. Calcium transient, inositol phosphate accumulation, and cAMP production by the mutant PAFR suggest the reduction of PAF-evoked Gα subunit activity. The impaired chemotactic activity of mutant PAFR, however, may be due to an inefficient PAF-triggered dissociation of the βγ-subunit complex from the Gα subunit, because release of the βγ-subunit from the heterotrimeric G-proteins is reported to be absolutely required for the G-protein-coupling receptor-mediated chemotaxis (24Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).The biological significance of the PAF-PAFR system has been well established using genetically engineered mice. Overexpression of PAFR in mice resulted in bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine and increased endotoxin lethality (25Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a disrupted PAFR gene showed attenuated anaphylactic responses to allergen exposure and pulmonary damage induced by acid (26Nagase T. Ishii S. Kume K. Uozumi N. Izumi T. Ouchi Y.

The diversity in the PAF-PAFR system in the human population may be correlated with interindividual variability in physiological responses, susceptibility and clinical phenotypes of PAF-related diseases, and responses to drugs. Interestingly, genetic deficiency of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, a PAF-degrading enzyme, has been identified in the Japanese population (28Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y. Sakata S. Araki Y. Matsumoto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Substitution of valine 279 with phenylalanine (V279F) of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase impairs the extracellular secretion of this protein and also completely abolishes the enzyme activity (29Stafforini D.M.

In contrast, the impaired PAFR function caused by A224D variation may be protective to these PAF-related diseases.In summary, we delineated the signaling phenotypes of a polymorphism of PAFR with a substitution of an aspartic acid for an alanine residue in the third intracellular loop. This polymorphism had a significant impact on agonist-promoted signaling to calcium mobilization, inositol phosphate accumulation, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and also on cell physiology such as chemotaxis. This phenotype may be considered a basis for interindividual variation in physiological response, disease predisposition or modification, and drug responsiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first naturally occurring mutation in the human PAFR gene to affect G-protein-mediated signaling pathways.

Using a mutagenesis approach, two separate portions of the third cytoplasmic loop of PAFR have been identified as the region possibly involved in G-protein interaction and activation/inactivation of the receptor (20Parent J.L.

Another candidate region for the coupling of PAFR with G-proteins is the C-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop. Studies of the α1-, α2-, and β2-adrenergic receptors have demonstrated that the substitution of a specific amino acid residue in this region resulted in the constitutively active receptors (21Small K.M.

Human PAFR with an artificial mutation at position 231 from leucine to arginine in the C terminus of the third cytoplasmic loop is also constitutively active with the higher affinity to PAF (20Parent J.L.

In contrast, substitution of alanine at position 230 to glutamic acid of human PAFR caused unresponsiveness to PAF assessed by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and a marked decrease in the receptor affinity to the agonist (20Parent J.L.

Since the naturally occurring A224D variant identified in the Japanese population is located between the putative amphipathic α-helix and the C-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop, this residue is unlikely to be directly associated with G-protein coupling. The alanine 224 is conserved among human, mouse, and guinea pig PAFR and is replaced with noncharged proline in rat PAFR. Thus, the introduction of negatively charged aspartic acid in A224D variant may modify the conformation of the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix or the C-terminal portion or both, resulting in exerting an indirect effect on the PAFR coupling to G-proteins. Furthermore, our data showed that this mutation attenuated both PAFR couplings to pertussis toxin-sensitive (probably Gq/G11) and -insensitive (probably Gi/Go) G-proteins. Calcium transient, inositol phosphate accumulation, and cAMP production by the mutant PAFR suggest the reduction of PAF-evoked Gα subunit activity. The impaired chemotactic activity of mutant PAFR, however, may be due to an inefficient PAF-triggered dissociation of the βγ-subunit complex from the Gα subunit, because release of the βγ-subunit from the heterotrimeric G-proteins is reported to be absolutely required for the G-protein-coupling receptor-mediated chemotaxis (24Jin T.

The diversity in the PAF-PAFR system in the human population may be correlated with interindividual variability in physiological responses, susceptibility and clinical phenotypes of PAF-related diseases, and responses to drugs. Interestingly, genetic deficiency of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, a PAF-degrading enzyme, has been identified in the Japanese population (28Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y.

In contrast, the impaired PAFR function caused by A224D variation may be protective to these PAF-related diseases.In summary, we delineated the signaling phenotypes of a polymorphism of PAFR with a substitution of an aspartic acid for an alanine residue in the third intracellular loop. This polymorphism had a significant impact on agonist-promoted signaling to calcium mobilization, inositol phosphate accumulation, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and also on cell physiology such as chemotaxis. This phenotype may be considered a basis for interindividual variation in physiological response, disease predisposition or modification, and drug responsiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first naturally occurring mutation in the human PAFR gene to affect G-protein-mediated signaling pathways. PAFR activates multiple signaling pathways in response to its agonist PAF and exhibits numerous biological activities (3Ishii S. Shimizu T. Prog.

We analyzed the human PAFR gene in search for the host genetic factors that modify the biological phenotypes related to PAF-PAFR system and identified a single amino acid substitution (A224D) in the third cytoplasmic loop of human PAFR. This DNA variant was relatively common in the Japanese population with an allele frequency of 7.8%. Thein vitro analysis of this variant demonstrated significant impairment of the receptor functions in terms of intracellular calcium mobilization, phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, the cells expressing the variant receptor showed decreased chemotactic activity to PAF compared with the cells expressing the wild-type receptor. The third cytoplasmic loop has been considered essential for receptor-G-protein coupling in various seven-transmembrane receptors (14Strader C.D. Dixon R.A. Cheung A.H. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D.

We previously characterized the CBS −1b minimal promoter (−3792 to −3667) and found that Sp1/Sp3, nuclear factor Y, and USF-1 were involved in the regulation of basal promoter activity (Ge, Y., Konrad, M.

In this study, the critical cis-elements and transcription factors in the CBS −1b upstream region (−4046 to −3792) were examined in HT1080 and HepG2 cells, which differ ∼10-fold in levels of CBS transcripts transcribed from the CBS −1b promoter. In DNase I footprint and gel shift analyses and transient transfections of mutant CBS −1b promoter constructs into HT1080 and HepG2 cells, transcriptionally important roles for Sp1/Sp3 binding to three GC boxes and one GT box and for binding of myeloid zinc finger 1-like proteins to two myeloid zinc finger 1 elements were indicated. In gel shift assays, very low levels of Sp1/Sp3 DNA-protein complexes were detected in HT1080 cells compared with HepG2 cells despite comparable levels of nuclear factor Y and USF-1 binding and similar levels of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins on Western blots. Mixing of HT1080 and HepG2 nuclear extracts resulted in no difference in total Sp factor binding in gel shift assays, thus excluding a role for an unknown activator or inhibitor in the disparate Sp1/Sp3 binding between the lines. Increased Sp1/Sp3 binding in gel shift assays was observed upon treatment of HT1080 nuclear extracts with protein kinase A, and decreased Sp1/Sp3 binding resulted from treatment of HepG2 nuclear extracts with calf alkaline phosphatase, suggesting a role for changes in Sp1/Sp3 phosphorylation in transcription factor binding and transactivation of the CBS −1b promoter.

The human CBS gene encodes multiple mRNAs differing in their 5′-untranslated regions, resulting from the use of five alternative noncoding exons (designated −1a to −1e) and a constant exon 0. Transcripts containing exons −1a and −1b appear to be the most abundant and are found in an assortment of adult and fetal tissues (6Bao L. Vlcek C. Paces V. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem.

There are at least two GC-rich TATA-less promoters upstream of exons −1a and −1b, containing numerous putative transcription elements (Sp1 (specificityprotein 1), AP1, AP2, etc.) (5Kraus J.P.

Biophys. 1998; 350: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple transcripts have been reported for CBS (6Bao L. Vlcek C. Paces V. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Five distinct 5′-noncoding exons have been described, the most frequent termed −1a and −1b, each encoded by its own unique GC-rich TATA-less promoter (5Kraus J.P. Oliveriusová J. Sokolová J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovská G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V. Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we defined a minimal transcriptional region (positions −3792 to −3667) of the CBS −1b promoter by 5′- and 3′-deletions and transient transfections in HepG2 cells, a cell line characterized by high levels of CBS transcription exclusively from the −1b promoter (7Ge, Y., Konrad, M. A., Matherly, L. H., and Taub, J. W. (2001) Biochem. J. 97–105.Google Scholar). Included in this 125-base pair CBS −1b minimal promoter region are three GC boxes (termed GCa, GCb, and GCc), an inverted CAAT box, and an E box. In gel shift and supershift assays, binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the GC box elements, USF-1 to the E box, and both NF-Y and an NF-1-like factor to the CAAT box could be demonstrated. Synergism between Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y in CBS transactivation was also observed (7Ge, Y., Konrad, M. A., Matherly, L. H., and Taub, J. W. (2001) Biochem. J. 97–105.Google Scholar). The functional significance of the region upstream of the CBS −1b minimal promoter (positions −3792 to −3565) was suggested by 5′-deletion analysis (7Ge, Y., Konrad, M. A., Matherly, L. H., and Taub, J. W. (2001) Biochem. J. 97–105.Google Scholar).In this study, we used DNase I footprint analysis of the −4046/−3792 fragment, immediately upstream of the basal promoter region, to identify protected regions in HT1080 and HepG2 cells, designated FPA (positions −3992 to −3970), FPB (positions −3955 to −3935), FPC (positions −3874 to −3849), and FPD (positions −3813 to −3790). Four potential GC or GT box elements, two MZF-1 sites, and an IK2-binding site were identified by data base analysis. In gel shift and supershift assays with a HepG2 nuclear extract, binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the GC and GT box elements (designated GCg, GCf, GCe, and GTd) and binding of MZF-1-like proteins to MZF-1-binding sites in FPB and FPD (designated MZF-1a and MZF-1b, respectively) were demonstrated. Interestingly, in nuclear extracts prepared from HT1080 cells, Sp1 and/or Sp3 DNA-protein complexes were detected in only trace amounts despite comparable binding of CAAT-binding factors (NF-Y and NF-1) and USF-1 and nearly identical levels of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins on Western blots.The functional roles of all these upstream elements in CBS −1b promoter activity were further evaluated by mutating these sequences and transfecting the mutant constructs into HT1080 and HepG2 cells. These mutations all effected changes in promoter activities; however, this was somewhat variable and was strongly dependent on the expression model. Thus, mutations of GCg, GCe, GTd, and the two MZF-1-binding sites (MZF-1a and MZF-1b) individually resulted in losses (15–73%) of CBS −1b promoter activity in HT1080 and HepG2 cells. Mutation of GCf resulted in a striking loss of promoter activity (90%) in both lines (Fig. 4), suggesting a critical transcriptional role for this GC box element.In Drosophila SL2 cells, the effects of these mutations ranged from moderate (GTd mt, ∼15%) to potent (GCf, ∼80%) inhibition to a strong activation response (GCg, ∼200%). Sp1 and Sp3 have been previously reported to function as either transcriptional activators or repressors, depending on the cell and promoter context (21Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R.

Interactions between NF-Y binding to the CAAT box and Sp1/Sp3 binding to the GC boxes were indicated since in cotransfections of Sp1 and NF-Y with the full-length construct, a potent synergistic transactivation of the CBS −1b promoter was detected (7-fold), exceeding that obtained with the basal CBS −1b promoter (2.3-fold) (7Ge, Y., Konrad, M. A., Matherly, L. H., and Taub, J. W. (2001) Biochem. J. 97–105.Google Scholar). There is ample precedent for interactions between Sp1 and NF-Y in the functional transactivation of a number of genes (30Yamada K. Tanaka T. Miyamoto K. Noguchi T. J. Biol.

Davis B. Rauscher F.J. Klemsz M. Tenen D. Hoffman S. Xu D. Morris J.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar). MZF-1 contains 13 zinc finger domains, divided into two groups (26Hromas R. Collins S.J. Hickstein D. Raskind W. Deaven L.L. O'Hara P. Hagen F.S. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14183-14187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal group has four zinc fingers, and the carboxyl-terminal group has nine zinc fingers. MZF-1 is a bifunctional transcription factor, capable of repressing transcription in non-hematopoietic cells and activating transcription in cells of hematopoietic origin (25Hromas R. Davis B. Rauscher F.J. Klemsz M. Tenen D. Hoffman S. Xu D. Morris J.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar). In our gel shift assays, we demonstrated binding of MZF-1-like proteins to the MZF-1a- and MZF-1b-binding elements in the CBS −1b promoter upstream region. Whereas mutagenesis of the MZF-1 sites resulted in ∼15–59% losses of promoter activity in both HepG2 and HT1080 cells, only HT1080 cells showed CBS −1b transactivation in cotransfections with MZF-1 cDNA and CBS −1b promoter-reporter gene constructs, suggesting a cell-specific response.Our finding that significantly decreased CBS transcripts and −1b promoter activity in HT1080 cells were accompanied by very low levels of transcription factor binding compared with HepG2 cells in gel shift assays was of particular interest since similar differences in CBS expression were previously seen in AML specimens, including those from children with DS (9Taub J.W. Huang X. Matherly L.H. Stout M.L. Buck S.A. Massey G.V. Becton D.L. Chang M.N. Weinstein H.J. Ravindranath Y. Blood. 1999; 94: 1393-1400PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of CBS were implicated as a critical determinant of sensitivities to Ara-C for both AML and CBS-transfected acute lymphocytic leukemia cells (9Taub J.W. Huang X. Matherly L.H. Stout M.L. Buck S.A. Massey G.V. Becton D.L. Chang M.N. Weinstein H.J. Ravindranath Y. Blood. 1999; 94: 1393-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 12Taub J.W. Huang X. Ge Y. Dutcher J.A. Stout M.L. Mohammad R.M. Ravindranath Y. Matherly L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6421-6426PubMed Google Scholar). Since there were no differences in Sp factor levels between HT1080 and HepG2 cells, we performed mixing experiments to explore the possibility that these results might reflect a requirement for an unknown “cofactor” present in the HepG2 cells, but missing in HT1080 cells or, alternatively, the presence of an inhibitor in HT1080 cells. However, there were no effects on the levels of Sp factor binding upon mixing HT1080 and HepG2 nuclear extracts.Sp1 is post-translationally modified by glycosylation and phosphorylation (27Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The significance of Sp1 phosphorylation was suggested by reports that dephosphorylated Sp1 added to in vitro transcription extracts becomes rapidly phosphorylated in a manner that correlates with function (27Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). However, in other studies, phosphorylated Sp1 bound DNA with reduced affinity (28Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A similar regulation would presumably occur for Sp3 (42Haidweger E. Novy M. Rotheneder H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our experiments with protein kinase A and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatments of nuclear extracts strongly suggest that the differential binding of Sp1/Sp3 to the CBS −1b promoter in HT1080 and HepG2 cells is at least partially due to the different phosphorylation status of these factors in the two cell lines. The lack of a complete response upon protein kinase A treatment in our experiments may reflect phosphorylation effects independent of protein kinase A, a role for Sp factor glycosylation (43Du X. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), or separate mechanisms altogether. Experiments are underway to explore these possibilities.Studies of CBS gene expression should eventually provide insights into the bases for variations in CBS levels between DS and non-DS myeloblasts and for the remarkable responsiveness of DS/AML patients treated with chemotherapy including Ara-C. Likewise, they could potentially clarify the link between chromosome 21 and the increased risk of leukemia in DS children or the relationships between CBS and certain phenotypic features of DS. Finally, our findings should promote a better understanding of the molecular bases for variations in CBS gene expression in assorted human diseases, including homocystinuria, hyperhomocystinemia, and atherosclerosis. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS1; EC 4.2.1.22), a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme involved in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyzes the condensation ofl-serine and l-homocysteine to form cystathionine, an intermediate step in the synthesis of cysteine. The human CBS gene product is a 63,000-Da polypeptide. The tetrameric protein is catalytically dependent on both heme and pyridoxal phosphate and is allosterically regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (1Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol.

The human CBS gene spans over 30 kilobases and consists of 23 exons ranging in size from 42 to 209 base pairs (5Kraus J.P. Oliveriusová J. Sokolová J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovská G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V. Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The CBS polypeptide is encoded by exons 1–14 and 16. The human CBS gene encodes multiple mRNAs differing in their 5′-untranslated regions, resulting from the use of five alternative noncoding exons (designated −1a to −1e) and a constant exon 0. Transcripts containing exons −1a and −1b appear to be the most abundant and are found in an assortment of adult and fetal tissues (6Bao L. Vlcek C. Paces V. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By contrast, use of exons −1c, −1d, and −1e appears to be rare. There are at least two GC-rich TATA-less promoters upstream of exons −1a and −1b, containing numerous putative transcription elements (Sp1 (specificityprotein 1), AP1, AP2, etc.) (5Kraus J.P. Oliveriusová J. Sokolová J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovská G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V.

In our recent study of the CBS −1b minimal promoter (mapping between positions −3792 and −3667), we demonstrated important transactivating roles for Sp1, Sp3, NF-Y, and USF-1 (7Ge, Y., Konrad, M. A., Matherly, L. H., and Taub, J. W. (2001) Biochem. J. 97–105.Google Scholar). The CBS gene has been localized to human chromosome 21 (e.g.21q22.3), and its overexpression has been suggested to be linked to certain of the phenotypic features of Down syndrome (DS). Elevated CBS expression in DS results in low plasma homocysteine compared with non-DS individuals and has been suggested to contribute to decreased atherosclerosis in DS patients (8Chadefaux B. Ceballos I. Hamet M. Coude M. Poissonnier M. Kamoun P. Allard D. Lancet. 1988; 2: 741Abstract PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Upon co-expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, human RS1 decreased the concentration of the Na+-d-glucose co-transporter hSGLT1 in the plasma membrane (Valentin, M., Kühlkamp, T., Wagner, K., Krohne, G., Arndt, P., Baumgarten, K., Weber, W.-M., Segal, A., Veyhl, M., and Koepsell, H. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1468, 367–380). Here, the porcine renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 was used to investigate whether porcine RS1 (pRS1) plays a role in transcriptional up-regulation of SGLT1 after confluence and in down-regulation of SGLT1 by high extracellular d-glucose concentrations. Western blots indicated a dramatic decrease of endogenous pRS1 protein at the plasma membrane after confluence but no significant effect ofd-glucose. In confluent LLC-PK1 cells overexpressing pRS1, SGLT1 mRNA, protein, and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside uptakes were drastically decreased; however, the reduction of methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside uptake after cultivation with 25 mmd-glucose remained. In confluent pRS1 antisense cells, the expression of SGLT1 mRNA and protein was strongly increased, whereas the reduction of SGLT1 expression during cultivation with high d-glucose was not influenced. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the transcription of SGLT1 was 10-fold increased in the pRS1 antisense cells. The data suggest that RS1 participates in transcriptional up-regulation of SGLT1 after confluence but not in down-regulation by d-glucose.

Western blots indicated a dramatic decrease of endogenous pRS1 protein at the plasma membrane after confluence but no significant effect ofd-glucose. In confluent LLC-PK1 cells overexpressing pRS1, SGLT1 mRNA, protein, and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside uptakes were drastically decreased; however, the reduction of methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside uptake after cultivation with 25 mmd-glucose remained. In confluent pRS1 antisense cells, the expression of SGLT1 mRNA and protein was strongly increased, whereas the reduction of SGLT1 expression during cultivation with high d-glucose was not influenced. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the transcription of SGLT1 was 10-fold increased in the pRS1 antisense cells. The data suggest that RS1 participates in transcriptional up-regulation of SGLT1 after confluence but not in down-regulation by d-glucose.

In the kidney and small intestine,d-glucose is translocated across epithelial cells by the consecutive operation of glucose transporters that belong to the following two gene families: secondary active Na+-d-glucose co-transporters of the SGLT family in the brush-border membrane, and Na+-independent glucose transporters of the GLUT family in the basolateral membrane (1Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19161-19164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of glucose transport affects transporters of both families, is cell type-specific, and is brought about by various mechanisms (1Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B. Physiol.

The regulation of glucose transport has pivotal physiological and biomedical importance. For example (i) one of the biological effects of insulin is the stimulation ofd-glucose uptake into fat cells by GLUT4 (4Pessin J.E. Bell G.I. Annu. Rev.

(ii) Thed-glucose absorption in small intestine is adapted to diet by glucose-dependent regulation of the high affinity Na+-d-glucose co-transporter SGLT1 (6Ferraris R.P. Diamond J. Am. J.

(iii) The capacity of the d-glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule is one of the factors that determinedd-glucose plasma levels in diabetic patients (8Oku A. Ueta K. Arakawa K. Ishihara T.

(iv) The glomerulosclerosis observed in diabetes may be explained by the up-regulation of GLUT1 in mesangium cells, which triggers the overproduction of matrix proteins (9Ayo S.H. Radnik R.

One of the factors that affect the expression of SGLT1 in small intestine and LLC-PK1 cells is extracellulard-glucose concentration (7Shirazi-Beechey S.P. Hirayama B.A. Wang Y. Scott D. Smith M.W. Wright E.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 437: 699-708Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Mol. Cell.

However, with increasing d-glucose the expression of SGLT1 in small intestine was increased, whereas it was decreased in LLC-PK1 cells, and the regulatory specificity for SGLT1 remained ambiguous. Another factor observed in cell culture is cell confluence. During confluence of LLC-PK1 cells, up-regulation of SGLT1 was observed, together with other differentiation-specific gene products of kidney proximal tubules such as tight junctions and brush-border enzymes (16Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hemmings B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1290-C1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The confluence-dependent regulation of SGLT1 in LLC-PK1 cells appears to be mediated by protein kinases. Before confluence, activity of protein kinase C is high, and the mRNA level of SGLT1 is very low. After confluence, protein kinase C is down-regulated, whereas protein kinase A is up-regulated, and the level of SGLT1 mRNA is largely increased (19Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11919-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Yet S.F. Kong C.T. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell.

One of the effects of protein kinase A is to enhance message stability, mediated by a specific RNA-binding protein (20Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23996-24003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33998-34008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Some years ago, we cloned RS1, a hydrophilic 67-kDa polypeptide from porcine kidney cortex that changed the expression of SGLT1 inXenopus oocytes (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary immunohistochemical experiments suggested that RS1 is localized at the extracellular side of the brush-border membrane and interacts specifically with SGLT1 (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Haase W. Heitmann K. Friese W. Ollig D. Koepsell H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we put forward the hypothesis that RS1 is a subunit of SGLT1. This hypothesis was recently abandoned because we found that RS1 is actually localized at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane and that overexpression of human RS1 inXenopus oocytes not only decreased the expression of human SGLT1 but also that of the human organic cation transporter hOCT2 (28Reinhardt J. Veyhl M. Wagner K. Gambaryan S. Dekel C. Akhoundova A. Korn T. Koepsell H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,29Valentin M. Kühlkamp T. Wagner K.

In the present study, LLC-PK1 cells were used to investigate the putative role of RS1 in the regulation of SGLT1 expression and activity by cell confluence and extracellular glucose concentration. Evidence is provided that RS1 is involved in the confluence-dependent regulation of SGLT1 by decreasing the expression of SGLT1 in nonconfluent LLC-PK1 cells via down-regulation of mRNA transcription. A role of RS1 in the glucose-dependent regulation of SGLT1 could not be detected.DISCUSSIONThe amount of the Na+-d-glucose co-transporter molecules in the plasma membrane may be changed within minutes via endo- and exocytosis (14Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transcriptional regulation of SGLT1 is known to occur more slowly. The expression of SGLT1 is altered via changes of intracellular mRNA concentrations that were reported to be mediated by factors either directly affecting the transcription (11Rhoads D.B. Rosenbaum D.H. Unsal H. Isselbacher K.J. Levitsky L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9510-9516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or the stability of the mRNA (21Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20536-20542Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Lee W.Y. Loflin P. Clancey C.J. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33998-34008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When LLC-PK1 cells grown in 5 mmd-glucose differentiate during confluence, the cytosolic concentration of SGLT1 mRNA increases. In contrast, SGLT1 mRNA decreases when the cells de-differentiate after being detached mechanically or by trypsin treatment (19Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11919-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Yet S.F. Kong C.T. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In confluent LLC-PK1 cells, the concentration of cytosolic SGLT1 mRNA is also dependent on the concentration ofd-glucose in the incubation medium (17Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6491-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the past, many studies have been performed in LLC-PK1 cells to resolve the mechanisms that underlie these mRNA changes. They identified a correlation between the increase of SGLT1 mRNA during confluence with an increase of the intracellular cAMP and showed that SGLT1 mRNA was increased by cAMP-elevating agents (22Yet S.F. Kong C.T. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was revealed that the cAMP-dependent increase of SGLT1 mRNA relied on a decelerated message degradation that was mediated by binding of a cytosolic protein to a defined 3′ region of mRNA (21Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20536-20542Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Lee W.Y. Loflin P. Clancey C.J. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33998-34008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that the decrease of SGLT1 mRNA during de-differentiation can be blocked or accelerated by inhibition or stimulation of protein kinase C, respectively (19Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11919-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Concerning the regulation of SGLT1 in LLC-PK1 cells, many questions have remained unsolved. For example, it is not known which signaling mechanisms underlie the up-regulation of SGLT1 when LLC-PK1cells are gaining confluence, which cellular events induce the decrease of SGLT1 message during de-differentiation of the LLC-PK1cells, and how protein kinase C affects the concentration of SGLT1 mRNA.In this paper, we present data that show that the previously cloned 67-kDa polypeptide RS1 (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is involved in transcriptional regulation of the Na+-d-glucose co-transporter SGLT1 in LLC-PK1 cells. We generated stably transfected LLC-PK1 cell lines that either overexpress RS1 or transcribe antisense mRNA of RS1 and thereby suppress the translation of endogenous RS1. Opposite effects were obtained by both maneuvers. In the cell lines overexpressing RS1, SGLT1 mRNA, SGLT1 protein, and the Na+-d-glucose co-transport activities were decreased, whereas in RS1 antisense cell lines message, protein, and Na+-d-glucose transport activities were dramatically increased. Because the stability of SGLT1 mRNA was not significantly changed in RS1 antisense cells and the transcription of SGLT1 was largely increased in a nuclear run-on assay, our data suggest that RS1 is involved in the repression of SGLT1 transcription. Some selectivity for SGLT1 of this RS1 effect is proposed because the transcription of GAPDH and GLUT1 was not changed in the RS1 antisense cell lines, and the observed increase in transcription of the organic cation transporter OCT2 was much smaller than that of SGLT1. Interestingly, in the RS1 antisense cell lines, the message of SGLT1 was only increased when the cells were grown until after confluence. This indicates that RS1-mediated effects upon SGLT1 expression only apply in polarized cells forming a closed monolayer. Depletion of RS1 in subconfluent cells is not sufficient to initiate the up-regulation of SGLT1 but RS1 may act in concert with other factors that are involved in the confluence-dependent up-regulation of SGLT1. Because the concentration of RS1 at the plasma membrane was drastically reduced after confluence, RS1 may play an important role during this regulation.Our data suggest that RS1 does not participate in the glucose-dependent down-regulation of SGLT1 in LLC-PK1 cells. After cultivation of LLC-PK1cells with 25 mmd-glucose versus 5 mmd-glucose, glucose transport by SGLT1 was reduced to a similar extent in controls and pRS1-overexpressing cells. Also, after cultivation with 25 mmd-glucoseversus 5 mmd-glucose, SGLT1 mRNA was reduced to a similar extent in controls and RS1 antisense LLC-PK1 cells. In controls and RS1 antisense cells, the decrease of SGLT1 mRNA was correlated with a decrease of SGLT1 protein in a plasma membrane-enriched membrane fraction. The finding that the glucose-induced decrease of SGLT1 protein in the RS1 antisense cells was not combined with a significant decrease of the maximald-glucose transport rate, as observed in control cells, is probably due to a limited capacity of the plasma membrane for functional active transporter molecules.To avoid over-interpretation of the data, it must be kept in mind that stable overexpression or reduction of RS1 by antisense strategies may lead to complex changes in the cells. For example, concentration and activity of intracellular regulatory proteins and second messengers may change. Even the increase in the transcription of SGLT1 in isolated nuclei can rather be an effect that is mediated by the up-regulation or activation of cytosolic proteins that are translocated into the nucleus and activate transcription. However, since opposite effects were obtained after overexpressing RS1 and reducing endogenous RS1 in our stably transfected cell lines, and since we have recently been able to demonstrate that RS1 actually migrates into the nucleus, 2T. Kühlkamp, K. Baumgarten, M. Akimjanova, V. Gorboulev, and H. Koepsell, manuscript in preparation. we hypothesize that RS1 is a plasma membrane-associated protein that migrates into the nucleus to act as an inhibitory transcription factor for SGLT1.To discuss further the function of RS1, previous data must be recalled and re-evaluated. We identified porcine RS1 (pRS1) after screening an expression library with a monoclonal antibody raised against renal brush-border membrane proteins (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we cloned proteins with amino acid identities of 74 and 65% from human (hRS1) and rabbit (rbRS1), respectively (28Reinhardt J.

RS1 is a rather hydrophilic protein with two conserved consensus sequences for protein kinase C, three conserved consensus sequences for casein kinase II, and a conserved C terminus of 42 amino acids that contains a consensus sequence for a ubiquitin-associated domain (47Dieckmann T.

Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that hRS1 is an intronless single copy gene that localizes to chromosome 1.p36.1 (45Lambotte S. Veyhl M. Köhler M. Morrison-Shetlar A.I. Kinne R.K.H. Schmid M. Koepsell H. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Performing labeling experiments with membrane-impermeant reagents on oocytes ofXenopus laevis expressing RS1, we recently localized RS1 to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane (29Valentin M. Kühlkamp T. Wagner K. Krohne G. Arndt P. Baumgarten K. Weber W.-M. Segal A. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Functional activity of RS1 was originally concluded from effects that were observed when RS1 was expressed after cRNA injection into Xenopus oocytes (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R.

DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When RS1 was expressed alone, the membrane surface area was reduced (29Valentin M. Kühlkamp T. Wagner K. Krohne G. Arndt P. Baumgarten K. Weber W.-M. Segal A. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and after co-expression of hRS1 with human SGLT1, theVmax of expressed glucose co-transport and the amount of expressed SGLT1 protein in the plasma membrane were decreased (28Reinhardt J. Veyhl M. Wagner K. Gambaryan S. Dekel C. Akhoundova A. Korn T. Koepsell H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 45Lambotte S. Veyhl M. Köhler M. Morrison-Shetlar A.I. Kinne R.K.H. Schmid M. Koepsell H. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The effect of RS1 on the expression of SGLT1 in X.oocytes is not specific for this plasma membrane transporter as originally assumed (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because the transport activity expressed by the human cation transporter OCT2 was also reduced upon co-expression with RS1 (28Reinhardt J. Veyhl M. Wagner K. Gambaryan S. Dekel C. Akhoundova A. Korn T. Koepsell H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, it apparently does not concern all plasma membrane proteins because the expression of some other plasma membrane transporters was not changed (26Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of RS1 observed inXenopus oocytes probably represent functional activity of RS1 protein at the plasma membrane that is independent of transcription. First, in the employed oocyte expression system, RS1 and SGLT1 were expressed by the injection of their cRNAs. Second, identical results were obtained when the experiments were performed in the absence or presence of the transcription blocker actinomycin D. 3M. Veyhl and H. Koepsell, unpublished data. Possible functions of RS1 at the plasma membrane are an involvement in endo- or exocytosis or an involvement in the degradation of a subset of plasma membrane transporters.Further experiments are required to determine how RS1 is activated at the plasma membrane and by what mechanism RS1 exhibits the described effects on the transcription of SGLT1. The disappearance of RS1 during confluence of LLC-PK1 cells suggests an activation of RS1 that may occur at the plasma membrane. A similar type of dual function has been reported for β-catenin. On the one hand, β-catenin links cadherin in adhesion receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, and on the other hand it stimulates gene expression by binding to transcription factors (49Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The proposed function of RS1 has also similarities to the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway where the metabolism of cholesterol is regulated by a sterol-dependent release of transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (50Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). It will be a challenge to characterize further the regulatory pathway of RS1 and to identify physiological regulations that involve RS1. Because d-glucose has a key role in cellular metabolism, organisms dispose of highly efficient mechanisms to control transepithelial absorption of d-glucose in the small intestine and kidney and the d-glucose uptake into glucose-metabolizing cells. In the kidney and small intestine,d-glucose is translocated across epithelial cells by the consecutive operation of glucose transporters that belong to the following two gene families: secondary active Na+-d-glucose co-transporters of the SGLT family in the brush-border membrane, and Na+-independent glucose transporters of the GLUT family in the basolateral membrane (1Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 993-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,2Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19161-19164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of glucose transport affects transporters of both families, is cell type-specific, and is brought about by various mechanisms (1Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 993-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Klip A. Tsakiridis T. Marette A. Ortiz P.A. FASEB. 1994; 8: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The regulation of glucose transport has pivotal physiological and biomedical importance. For example (i) one of the biological effects of insulin is the stimulation ofd-glucose uptake into fat cells by GLUT4 (4Pessin J.E. Bell G.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 5James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). (ii) Thed-glucose absorption in small intestine is adapted to diet by glucose-dependent regulation of the high affinity Na+-d-glucose co-transporter SGLT1 (6Ferraris R.P. Diamond J. Am. J.

(iii) The capacity of the d-glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule is one of the factors that determinedd-glucose plasma levels in diabetic patients (8Oku A. Ueta K. Arakawa K. Ishihara T.

(iv) The glomerulosclerosis observed in diabetes may be explained by the up-regulation of GLUT1 in mesangium cells, which triggers the overproduction of matrix proteins (9Ayo S.H. Radnik R.

https://openalex.org/W2137195504,"Acetate kinase catalyzes the magnesium-dependent transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to acetate. The recently determined crystal structure of theMethanosarcina thermophila enzyme identifies it as a member of the sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily based on the fold and the presence of five putative nucleotide and metal binding motifs that characterize the superfamily. Residues from four of these motifs inM. thermophila acetate kinase were selected for site-directed replacement and analysis of the variants. Replacement of Asp148 and Asn7 resulted in variants with catalytic efficiencies less than 1% of that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that these residues are essential for activity. Glu384 was also found to be essential for catalysis. A 30-fold increase in the magnesium concentration required for half-maximal activity of the E384A variant relative to that of the wild type implicated Glu384 in magnesium binding. The kinetic analysis of variants and structural data is consistent with nonessential roles for active site residues Ser10, Ser12, and Lys14 in catalysis. The results are discussed with respect to the acetate kinase catalytic mechanism and the relationship to other sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily members.

The results are discussed with respect to the acetate kinase catalytic mechanism and the relationship to other sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily members. Acetate kinase, which catalyzes the magnesium-dependent transfer of the ATP γ-phosphate to acetate (Eq. 2), is a central enzyme in the energy-yielding metabolism of anaerobes.CH3COCoA+Pi⇌CH3COPO42−+CoAEq. 1 CH3COPO42−+ADP⇌CH3COO−+ATPEq. 2 In most fermentative procaryotes, the catabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA is converted to acetate by phosphotransacetylase (Eq. 1) and acetate kinase (Eq. 2), yielding ATP. In Archaea of the genusMethanosarcina, acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase catalyze the ATP-dependent activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA in the first step of the conversion of acetate to methane and CO2. The discovery of acetate kinase in 1944 by Lipmann (1Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 155: 55-70Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and the subsequent isolation in 1954 by Ochoa and co-workers (2Rose I.A. Grunberg-Manago M. Korey S.R. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 737-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) initiated investigations of the Escherichia coli enzyme. Kinetic and biochemical studies between 1954 and 1980 have led to two distinct proposals for the catalytic mechanism, one of which involves the direct in-line transfer of the ATP γ-phosphate to acetate. This mechanism is consistent with the finding that the acetate kinase reaction proceeds with the net inversion of configuration, indicating an odd number of phosphoryl transfers (3Blättler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The second proposal is a covalent triple displacement mechanism (4Spector L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which reconciles the stereochemical evidence with the isolation of an unspecified phosphorylated glutamate residue that forms upon the incubation of acetate kinase with acetyl phosphate (5Todhunter J.A. Purich D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the triple displacement mechanism, the ATP γ-phosphate is transferred to two consecutive enzyme sites before transfer to acetate. The triple displacement mechanism was challenged when it was shown that phosphorylated acetate kinase from E. coli is a phosphoryl donor to enzyme I of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (6Fox D.K. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13498-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested an alternate function for phosphorylated acetate kinase in the transport of sugars. The acetate kinase from Methanosarcina thermophila has been cloned and hyper-expressed in E. coli, enabling for the first time site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis (7Ingram-Smith C. Barber R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33765-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to probe the catalytic mechanism. Although the acetate kinase was crystallized in the presence of ATP, only the α- and β-phosphates, in addition to the adenosine moiety, could be resolved in the proposed active site cleft between the two domains of the monomer (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The β-phosphate of ADP appears to be displaced, possibly as a result of charge repulsion from the sulfate molecule that is present in the active site (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The sulfate lies in the proposed location of the ATP γ-phosphate (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The structure identifies M. thermophilaacetate kinase as a member of the sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin structural superfamily (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Buss K.A. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2659-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Acetate kinase shares no significant overall sequence similarity with sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily members; however, structural properties indicate that acetate kinase and other superfamily members share a core fold as well as five motifs (termed phosphate-1, phosphate-2, connect-1, connect-2, and adenosine) composed of both secondary structural elements and conserved amino acid residues (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. Proc.

Struct. 1996; 25: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In several superfamily members, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to implicate these motifs in either nucleotide binding, metal binding, or catalysis (15Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J.

Biophys. 1998; 349: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In acetate kinase, the roles of residues in these analogous motifs have yet to be investigated. The adenosine moiety of ADP in the crystal structure of the M. thermophila enzyme is bound in part to the conserved adenosine motif of the sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily. Thus, the structural data are consistent with data from other superfamily members in supporting a role for this motif in adenosine binding (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Identifying residues involved in binding the polyphosphate and the metal ion and facilitating phosphoryl transfer is less straightforward because of the apparent displacement of the ADP β-phosphate and the lack of electron density that can be attributed to the ATP γ-phosphate or metal ions in the crystal structure (10Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we report a site-directed mutational analysis of theM. thermophila acetate kinase to address the roles of active site residues in the phosphate-1, phosphate-2, connect-1, and connect-2 motifs that are highly conserved among acetate kinases. Our data have led us to hypothesize an alternate role for Glu384, previously postulated to be a phosphorylation site during catalysis (8Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified an active site aspartate (Asp148) and an active site asparagine residue (Asn7) that are essential for catalysis. Finally, we have identified three active site residues (Ser10, Ser12, and Lys14) that we propose to be involved in orienting the polyphosphate in a catalytically competent manner. Our results are discussed with respect to the acetate kinase catalytic mechanism and to data from other superfamily members. Data bases were searched at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST network server (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar). ClustalX (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35619) Google Scholar) was used for multiple protein sequence alignment. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), which employs the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis method (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). A derivative of the T7-based expression vector pET15b (Novagen) containing the M. thermophila ack gene (9Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was the target plasmid used for mutagenesis. In the resulting plasmids, a 60-nucleotide leader sequence with six tandem histidine codons was fused in-frame to the 5′-end of the wild-type and mutant ackgenes. The mutations were verified by dye termination cycle sequencing using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the Nucleic Acid Facility at the Pennsylvania State University. The wild-type and variant acetate kinases were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) as described previously (9Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid silica spin kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The enzymes were eluted in buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) using 12% gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The hydroxamate assay, an adaptation of the method of Lipmann and Tuttle (24Lipmann F. Tuttle L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 159: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Rose et al.(2Rose I.A. Grunberg-Manago M. Korey S.R. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 737-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indirectly detects the formation of acetyl phosphate from acetate and ATP. This previously described assay (25Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified such that the final concentrations of the assay components were as follows (unless otherwise noted): 145 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 705 mm hydroxylamine hydrochloride. When indicated, 10 mm MnCl2 was used in place of the MgCl2. In the determination of theKm for acetate, the concentration of ATP was 10 mm unless the Km for ATP was determined to be higher than that for the wild-type enzyme, in which case the concentration was increased to 20 mm. Likewise, when determining the Km for ATP, the acetate concentration was 500 mm unless the Km for acetate was determined to be higher than that for the wild-type enzyme, in which case the concentration of acetate was increased to 1.5 or 2 m. In the determination of the magnesium concentration required for half-maximal activity, the potassium acetate concentration was 1 m. Activity in the direction of ATP formation was assayed by the previously described enzyme-linked assay (25Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (500 μl) contained 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm NADP, 20 mm acetyl phosphate, 5 mm ADP, 10 units of hexokinase (yeast), and 10 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (yeast). In the determination of the Km for acetyl phosphate, the ADP concentration used was 5 mm, whereas in the determination of the Km for ADP, the acetyl phosphate concentration used was 20 mm. Kinetic constants were determined using non-linear regression to fit the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Spectra were acquired at 25 °C with an Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer, model 62DS. Samples (1 to 10 μm) of acetate kinase in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.2) were placed in a cuvette with a 1-mm path length, and data points were obtained from 200 to 300 nm in 1.0-nm increments (5-s averaging time). The resulting spectra were normalized for direct comparison. The native molecular mass was determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) calibrated with cytochrome c(12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa). Protein samples (1.0 ml) were loaded onto the column that had been pre-equilibrated with 145 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, and the column was developed with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Acetate kinase and the sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily have in common five motifs that, in superfamily members other than acetate kinase, have been shown to be primarily involved in metal binding or catalysis. Four of these motifs are visualized in the ribbon diagram of the acetate kinase from M. thermophila, shown in Fig. 1. These four motifs contain 11 residues that are both highly conserved among acetate kinases from phylogenetically diverse species (Fig.2) and present in the active site. Three of these residues (His208, Glu384, and Glu385) were previously investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and analyses of variants (7Ingram-Smith C. Barber R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33765-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active site locations of the remaining eight residues (in addition to Glu384) are shown in Fig. 3. These eight residues were individually replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. After a single step nickel-affinity purification, all of the variants were found to be homogeneous and have the same monomeric molecular mass as the wild type as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). In addition, gel filtration chromatography indicated that all of the variants were homodimers under native conditions (data not shown), as is the case with the wild-type enzyme (25Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate no gross structural differences between the wild-type and variant acetate kinases.Figure 2Alignments of four of the putative nucleotide and metal binding motifs in acetate kinase sequences. The phosphate-1 fingerprint sequence, proposed to bind the adenine nucleotide β-phosphate in members of the sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily, is also displayed (where X is any amino acid).

ADP (orange) and sulfate (green) are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The catalytic efficiencies of variants D148A, D148N, and D148E were less than 0.1% of that for the wild-type enzyme, which indicated that Asp148 is essential for catalysis (Table I). The circular dichroism spectra of the D148A variant, relative to that of wild type, varied by only 6.5% at 220 nm, confirming that replacement of Asp148 with alanine resulted in no significant global conformational changes (data not shown). These results indicate that the inactivity of the D148A variant is the result of the loss of an essential functional group and not a gross structural change. The Km values for ATP of the Asp148 variants did not differ from wild type, and the Km value for acetate of the D148A variant was only 3-fold higher than that of wild type (Table I).Table IKinetic constants for wild-type and variants of acetate kinase from M. thermophilaATPAcetateKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1mms−1WT2.13 ± 0.041278 ± 1360048 ± 51056 ± 2122N7A7.0 ± 0.61-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.37 ± 31-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.5ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.NDN7D5 ± 12.7 ± 0.20.5693 ± 324.4 ± 0.10.006S10A3.2 ± 0.123 ± 17814 ± 5821 ± 10.03S10T4.3 ± 0.3107 ± 325266 ± 1867 ± 20.25S11A4.5 ± 0.2422 ± 494200 ± 15330 ± 131.7S11T6.8 ± 0.51-cThese are apparent values owing to the fact that the maximum acetate concentration (2 m) used in the determination of the Km values of ATP and acetate may not have been saturating.191 ± 21-cThese are apparent values owing to the fact that the maximum acetate concentration (2 m) used in the determination of the Km values of ATP and acetate may not have been saturating.281573 ± 1061-cThese are apparent values owing to the fact that the maximum acetate concentration (2 m) used in the determination of the Km values of ATP and acetate may not have been saturating.179 ± 71-cThese are apparent values owing to the fact that the maximum acetate concentration (2 m) used in the determination of the Km values of ATP and acetate may not have been saturating.0.1S12A7.3 ± 0.31-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.92 ± 21-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.13ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.S12T3.7 ± 0.3414 ± 12112333 ± 9458 ± 91.4K14A5.8 ± 0.31-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.143 ± 41-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.25ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.K14R3.62 ± 0.09425 ± 9117239 ± 34482 ± 292D148A3.1 ± 0.20.59 ± 0.030.2170 ± 220.57 ± 0.020.003D148N5.2 ± 0.70.39 ± 0.020.1390 ± 750.34 ± 0.020.0009D148E5.0 ± 0.41-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.1.46 ± 0.091-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.0.3ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.N211A3.0 ± 0.11125 ± 146375111 ± 21047 ± 1369E384A7.7 ± 0.41-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.11.4 ± 0.11-aWhen theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.1.5ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.ND1-bND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.1-a When theKm value for acetate could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics (ND), the Km andkcat values for ATP were apparent values.1-b ND, these values could not be determined owing to non-saturation kinetics.1-c These are apparent values owing to the fact that the maximum acetate concentration (2 m) used in the determination of the Km values of ATP and acetate may not have been saturating. Open table in a new tab A preliminary report on Glu384 from the M. thermophila acetate kinase had indicated that this residue was essential for catalysis (8Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The authors concluded that the extremely low activities of the Glu384 variants precluded the determination of kinetic constants (8Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were able to purify E384A in sufficient quantity to determine the kinetic constants, enabling a further investigation into the role of Glu384 in catalysis. E384A had a catalytic efficiency that was less than 1% of that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I), consistent with the previous proposal that Glu384 is essential for catalysis. TheKm value for ATP of E384A was increased less than 3-fold relative to that of wild type (Table I). TheKm value for acetate could not be determined for E384A because of non-saturation kinetics with respect to acetate (Table I). The Km values for ADP and acetyl phosphate did not increase relative to wild type for the D148A and E384A variants, whereas the catalytic efficiencies were less than 1% of the wild type (data not shown). The catalytic efficiencies of the Asn7variants were 1% or less than that of wild type, suggesting an essential role for Asn7 in catalysis (Table I). Variants of Ser10, Ser12, and Lys14 also displayed reduced catalytic efficiencies, which were greater than 1% of the wild type, indicating important but not essential roles for these residues in catalysis. Variants of Asn7, Ser10, Ser12, and Lys14 hadKm values for ATP similar to that of wild type (Table I). Non-saturation kinetics precluded determination of theKm value for acetate of N7A. Replacement of Asn7 with aspartate resulted in a variant with a determinable Km value for acetate that was 14-fold greater than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I). Variants S10A, S12A, and K14A also displayed either high Km values for acetate as compared with that of wild-type or non-saturation kinetics with respect to acetate (Table I). Conservative replacement of Ser10 or Ser12 with threonine resulted in variants with higher catalytic efficiencies than those of S10A or S12A, indicating that the functional groups of Ser10 and Ser12 are important for catalysis (Table I). In addition, variants S10T and S12T had Km values for acetate that were elevated as compared with that of wild type (Table I). As compared with the K14A variant, K14R had a greater catalytic efficiency and a return to saturation kinetics with respect to acetate. These results are consistent with a role for the positive charge of Lys14 in catalysis (Table I). Variant S11A had aKm value for ATP and catalytic efficiencies that were not far removed from those of wild type. The Km value for acetate of variant S11A increased only 3-fold as compared with that of wild type. Replacement of Ser11 with a bulky threonine residue resulted in a lower catalytic efficiency and an elevated Km value for acetate (Table I) as compared with those of S11A, suggesting a size limitation for position 11. The functional group of residue Asn211 also appears to be unimportant for catalysis, as evidenced by the wild-type catalytic efficiencies of variant N211A (Table I). The Km values for ADP and acetyl phosphate did not increase relative to wild type for N7A, S10A, S11A, S12A, N211A, or K14A. However, the catalytic efficiencies for each variant were less than 2% of the wild type, except for S11A and N211A, which had values that were at least 21% of the wild type (data not shown). Several of the conserved motifs in other sugar kinase/Hsc70/actin superfamily members have been implicated in metal binding. Consequently, the magnesium concentration required for half-maximal activity was determined for the alanine variants (TableII) to implicate residues involved in metal coordination. All of the alanine variants except N211A and S11A showed an increase in the magnesium concentration required for half-maximal activity relative to that of wild type, particularly N7A, S12A, K14A, and E384A, suggesting that these residues contribute to the coordination of magnesium (Table II). Most significantly, Glu384 appears to be important for metal coordination, as evidenced by the 30-fold increase in the magnesium concentration required for half-maximal activity of the E384A variant relative to that of wild type.Table IIThe magnesium concentration required for half-maximal velocity of wild-type and variant acetate kinases from M. thermophilaMgCl2mmWT0.50 ± 0.01N7A4.5 ± 0.5S10A2.0 ± 0.1S11A0.68 ± 0.04S12A4.01 ± 0.08K14A3.0 ± 0.1D148A2.3 ± 0.3N211A0.90 ± 0.04E384A15.6 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Also consistent with roles for Glu384 and Asn7in magnesium coordination was the change in the preferred cation of the E384A and N7A variants relative to that of wild type (TableIII). Alteration of the divalent cation preference of an enzyme by replacement of a metal binding residue has been used to implicate residues in metal binding (26Cane D.E. Xue Q. Fitzsimons B.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12369-12376Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9591-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The specific activity of variant E384A was increased by 120% in the presence of manganese versus magnesium, whereas the specific activity of wild type was not significantly altered (Table III). Variants N7A, S12A, and D148A also displayed increases in specific activity with manganese versus magnesium (56, 83, and 58%, respectively) (Table III). Wild-type acetate kinase utilizes manganese or calcium in place of magnesium but is inactive with copper or zinc (25"

Here we demonstrated that IDGF has adenosine deaminase activity. The substrate specificity of IDGF was similar to that of the mammalian cytoplasmic adenosine deaminase. The adenosine deaminase activity of IDGF was shown to be indispensable for its growth factor activity toward NIH-Sape-4 cells. We found that there are specific binding sites for IDGF on the surface of NIH-Sape-4 cells and that it binds to these sites with a Kd value of 2.4 × 10−10m. We propose that the cell surface binding sites for IDGF are specific receptors modified with an adenosine moiety. When IDGF binds to these receptors, it may deaminate the adenosine moiety, and this process may be prerequisite for the signal transduction via this receptor.

Growth factors are known to bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, causing conformational changes of the receptors enabling them to transmit specific signals for cell growth (4Sibley D.R. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 913-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 5Massague J. Annu. Rev.

The conformational changes of the receptors induced by ligand binding are considered to be the first critical step for the subsequent sequential reactions that take place in the cells. In invertebrates, especially in insects, several growth factors with vertebrate homologues have been assigned at the gene or cDNA level (7Muskavitch M.A. Hoffmann F.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1990; 24: 289-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Shilo B.Z. Raz E. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 388-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Raffery L.A. Sutherland D.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), but few vertebrate growth factors homologous to invertebrate ones have been substantially identified. Insect-derived growth factor (IDGF)1 is a novel soluble growth factor that was purified from conditioned medium of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly), and then characterized (10Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It consists of 553 amino acid residues and stimulates the growth of NIH-Sape-4 cells at concentrations of 0.7–5 ng/ml, its specific activity being comparable with that of mammalian growth factors. IDGF exhibits no significant sequence similarity with any other growth factors so far characterized but shows about 25% sequence identity with the atrial gland granule-specific antigen of Aplysia californica, which is a secretory protein of unknown function (11Sossin W.S. Kreiner T. Barinaga M. Schilling J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although IDGF is assumed to play a role in the proliferation of Sarcophaga embryonic cells, its mode of action remains to be elucidated. Meanwhile, a number of genes structurally related to that of IDGF have been registered in data bases, suggesting that IDGF is a member of a protein family widely distributed in the animal kingdom. Recently, three products of IDGF family protein genes were characterized. One is a novel Drosophila gene, MSI(male-specific IDGF), of which the product is expressed exclusively in the membranes of mature spermatocytes in the adult testis, suggesting that MSI plays a role in spermatogenesis. When MSI was exogenously expressed in Schneider's line 2 cells, it was shown to be localized on the cell surface and to exhibit growth factor activity via cell to cell interaction, indicating that MSI is a transmembrane extracellular signaling molecule (12Matsushita T. Fujii-Taira I. Tanaka Y. Homma K.J. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36934-36941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other insect IDGF family genes (i.e. TSGF-1 and TSGF-2 (Glossina morsitanssalivary gland growth factor genes)) have also been reported, their transcripts being preferentially localized in the salivary glands (13Li S. Aksoy S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A human IDGF family gene, cat eye syndrome critical region gene 1 (CECR1), is expressed in many adult tissues and in the embryonic outflow tract and atrium of the developing heart, the VII/VIII cranial nerve ganglion, and the notochord (14Riazi M.A. Brinkman-Mills P. Nguyen T. Pan H. Phan S. Ying F. Roe B.A. Tochigi J. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Buchwald M. McDermid H.E. Genomics. 2000; 64: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). From the chromosomal location and embryonic expression of CECR1, this gene was suggested to be responsible for cat eye syndrome, which involves developmental disorders of multiple organs accompanying duplication of a 2-megabase pair region of 22q11.2 (15Mears A.J. el-Shanti H. Murray J.C. McDermid H.E. Patil S.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 667-673PubMed Google Scholar, 16McDermid H.E. MaTaggart K.E. Riazi M.A. Hudson T.J. Budarf M.L. Emanuel R.S. Bell C.J. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has been pointed out that the adenosine deaminase (ADA) domain is structurally conserved in the carboxyl-terminal region of CECR1 (14Riazi M.A. Brinkman-Mills P. Nguyen T. Pan H. Phan S. Ying F. Roe B.A. Tochigi J. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Buchwald M. McDermid H.E. Genomics. 2000; 64: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that IDGF exhibits ADA activity and that this activity is indispensable for its growth factor activity toward NIH-Sape-4 cells. NIH-Sape-4 cells were cultured in M-M medium (17Mitsuhashi J. Maramorosch K. Contrib. Boyce Thompson Inst. 1964; 22: 435-460Google Scholar) at 25 °C, as described previously (18Komano H. Kasama E. Nagasawa Y. Nakanishi Y. Matsuyama K. Ando K. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Flesh flies,S. peregrina, were reared by the method of Ohtaki (19Ohtaki T. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1966; 19: 97-104Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The flesh fly is an ovoviviparous insect, so unfertilized eggs and embryos were collected from adult uteri as described previously (20Homma K.-i. Kurata S. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15258-15264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos from 6-day-old flies are at the cellular blastodermal stage, and 11-day-old flies oviposit the first instar larvae. Adults are imaged 10 days after pupation. This was carried out as described previously by assessing the stimulation of cell proliferation (10Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH-Sape-4 cells were suspended at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml in M-M medium containing streptomycin (0.5 mg/ml) and penicillin G (120 units/ml), and then 100 μl of the cell suspension was poured into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The cell numbers did not increase appreciably, even when cultured for 7 days at 25 °C under these conditions, because the initial cell density was low. However, a significant increase in cell proliferation was detected when 100 pg of purified IDGF was added to the wells. Cell proliferation was determined by measurement of the enhancement of cellular metabolism by means of the Alamar Blue assay (21Ahmed S.A. Gogal Jr., R.M. Walsh J.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 22Page B. Page M. Noel C. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 473-476PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 2 days at 25 °C in the presence or absence of the test samples. Then 15 μl of Alamar Blue (Alamar Biosciences, Inc.) was added, and then changes in the color of the culture medium were monitored by measuring A570 and A610. In this assay, the reducing activity generated by proliferating cells changed the color of the Alamar Blue. One unit of growth factor was defined as the amount giving half-maximal stimulation of cell proliferation. The coding region of IDGF cDNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers under the following conditions: 30 cycles each comprising 94 °C for 0.5 min, 45 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The primers used were 5′-TTTCATATGGCAAATCACATGGTACAACAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCAAGCTTCGCGGCGAACAGGAGGTGTGC-3′ (antisense). For ligation to the expression vector, the sense primer contained the first Met codon and an NdeI site, and the antisense primer contained the termination codon and a HindIII site. The resulting PCR product (1.6 kilobase pairs) extracted from the agarose gel was ligated to expression vector pET 17b and then amplified in Escherichia coli JM109. The resulting plasmid was transfected into E. coli BL21, and then the recombinant IDGF was expressed by culturing the bacteria in LB medium containing 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation, disrupted in buffer I (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8)) by sonication, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and then saturated (NH4)2SO4 was added to the resulting supernatant to a final concentration of 30% (v/v). Purification of the recombinant IDGF was performed essentially as described previously (10Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The protein con- centration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The point mutations of D462E, D462N, H405E, and H405R were introduced by PCR using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) (24Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The two terminal primers were F (GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CAA ATC ACA TGG TAC AAC AT) for the 5′ end and R (CCC AAG CTT TCA AAT GAT TTT ATT CGT ATT) for the 3′-end. The point mutations of D462E, D462N, H405E, and H405R were introduced with primers D462E.D1 (GAA AGA AGG ATC C TCG GAG GAT ATA ACC ACA GGA TAA) and D462E.D2 (TAT ATC CTC CGA G GAT CCT TCT TTC TGG AAA GCT ACA), D462N.D1 (AAG AAG GAT CAT T GGA GGA TAT AAC CAC AGG ATA ATT) and D462N.D2 (GTT ATA TCC TCC A ATG ATC CTT CTT TCT GGA AAG CTA), H405E.D1 (CAA AGC AAA ACC CTC GCC TAT GCG CTT AGT GCC CAA TAA) and H405E.D2 (AAG CGC ATA GGC GAG GGT TTT GCT TTG GTC AAA CAT CCA), and H405R.D1 (AAA GCA AAA CCA C GGC CTA TGC GCT TAG TGC CCA ATA) and H405R.D2 (AGC GCA TAG GCT G CGG TTT TGC TTT GGT CAA ACA TCC), which were combined with F and R, respectively, to generate 5′ and 3′ fragments. These fragments were fused by annealing their overlapping ends and amplified with primers F and R to give the final PCR products. The PCR products digested with NdeI and HindIII were cloned into vector pET 17b (Novagen) using a DNA Ligation Kit version 2 (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan), and the correctness of the sequences was confirmed with a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (ABI). The ADA activity of IDGF was assayed by measuring the rate of the ADA-dependent increase in inosine absorption at 235 nm with 25–200 μmol of adenosine as the substrate (25Sideraki V. Mohamedali K.A. Wilson D.K. Chang Z. Kellems R.E. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7862-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One unit of ADA activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of inosine/min. The assay was carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, using a cuvette of 1-cm path length at 25 °C. Activity was measured with four different concentrations of adenosine or an alternative substrate, and the assay was repeated at least twice. The concentrations of adenosine and alternative substrates were 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm. The concentration of IDGF in the assay mixture ranged from 0.16 to 1 μm. Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined by means of Lineweaver-Burk plots.kcat was calculated with the equation,Vmax = kcat[E0]. IDGF was radioiodinated by the method of Hunter and Greenwood (26Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5835) Google Scholar). The specific activity of labeled IDGF was usually 107 cpm/μg of protein. The radioreceptor assay was based on the method of Smith and Cantrell (27Smith K.A. Cantrell D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). NIH-Sape-4 cells (5 × 105/0.2 ml) were placed in siliconized tubes with serially diluted 125I-labeled IDGF (1–500 pm) in M-M medium. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with occasional shaking to keep the cells in suspension. Then 1 ml of ice-cold M-M medium was added, and the cells were spun down (9000 × g for 15 s). The supernatant was removed, and its radioactivity was measured to determine the concentration of free 125I-labeled IDGF. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of ice-cold M-M medium and then washed three times by repeated centrifugation. The resulting pellet was then suspended in 0.1 ml of ice-cold M-M medium, and its radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 nm unlabeled IDGF. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The dose-response curve of the binding of IDGF to a fixed number of NIH-Sape-4 cells reached a plateau with an increase in the concentration of125I-labeled IDGF. Western blotting was performed essentially as described by Burnette (28Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5842) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter, which was then treated with a 0.5 μg/ml anti-IDGF antibody solution followed by peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit donkey IgG diluted 1:5000. The filter was then treated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. Immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosyl proteins was performed as described by Luttrell et al. (29Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M. Rodriguez M. Berman J.

NIH-Sape-4 cells (4 × 106/0.4 ml) were incubated for appropriate times in the presence of IDGF (50 ng/ml). Then 0.4 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (40 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm Nonidet P-40, 2 mmNa3VO4, 4 mmNa4P2O7, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin) was added, sonicated briefly, and kept at 4 °C for 30 min with agitation. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Then 10 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 (0.1 mg/ml) (Chemicon) was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with agitation. Then 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein G-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and incubation was continued for 90 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with extraction buffer, dissolved in 1% SDS containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blotting with 1 μg/ml of anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody 06-427 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted from flesh flies at various developmental stages by the guanidine-thiocyanate method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62891) Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then blotted onto a Gene Screen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10× SSPE (1× SSPE: 180 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Hybridization was performed in a 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSPE, 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% (w/v) each of Ficoll-400, bovine serum albumin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.2 mg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA solution for 16 h at 42 °C. The filters were autoradiographed at −80 °C. The DNA used as a probe was a full length of IDGF cDNA. This probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a BcaBEST random primer labeling kit (TaKaRa). The filter was subsequently hybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe to determine the amount of RNA loaded. The antibody against IDGF was raised as described previously (10Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205447) Google Scholar). DNA manipulations including sequencing, PCR, plasmid isolation, and E. colitransformation were carried out according to standard methods (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Accumulating sequence information has revealed that many proteins in the IDGF family contain putative hydrophobic sequences in their N termini and retain the ADA domain, suggesting that they are secretory or transmembrane ADAs. To determine the relationship between the growth factor activity of IDGF and its putative ADA activity, we first examined whether or not IDGF has ADA activity. For this, we produced a recombinant IDGF using an E. coli expression system. The recombinant IDGF was expressed in E. coli only in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside, and it was purified from an E. coli lysate to homogeneity (Fig.1 A). As summarized in TableI, about 1 mg of pure recombinant IDGF was obtained from 250 ml of E. coli culture.Table ISummary of the purification of the recombinant IDGFPurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldSupernatant of E. coli lysate3512,0003401001.0Butyl-Toyopearl3.995002400797.1Mono Q1.1600055005016 Open table in a new tab The growth factor activity of the recombinant IDGF was compared with that of authentic IDGF. As shown in Fig.2, the two proteins showed very similar dose-response relationships, and the specific activity of recombinant IDGF was almost identical to that of the authentic one. As a sufficient quantity of the recombinant IDGF was obtained, we measured its ADA activity. As shown in TableII, the ADA activity of IDGF was clearly detected when adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, and 3′-deoxyadenosine were used as substrate. The Km,Vmax, and kcat values obtained with adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, and 3′-deoxyadenosine were comparable with those of mammalian cytoplasmic ADA (33Wiginton D.A. Coleman M.S. Hutton J.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results indicate that IDGF is in fact an ADA and that IDGF family proteins can be classified into a new ADA group, namely secretory or transmembrane ADAs, since their overall sequences are unique except for in the ADA domain.Table IIKinetic parameters and substrate specificity of the ADA activity of IDGFSubstrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/KmRelative Vmaxμmunits/mgs−1s−1μm−1%Adenosine502.81703.41002′-Deoxyadenosine262.51505.8893′-Deoxyadenosine633.52103.4130 Open table in a new tab To determine the relationship between the growth factor activity and ADA activity of IDGF, we examined the effect of 2′-deoxycoformycin (DCF) on the growth factor activity of IDGF. This compound is known to be a potent inhibitor of mammalian ADAs and to inactivate them irreversibly (34Kodama K. Kusakabe H. Machida H. Midorikawa Y. Shibuya S. Kuninaka A. Yoshino H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1979; 43: 2375-2377Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For measurement of the growth factor activity, we first treated the IDGF with DCF, and then the growth factor activity was determined. The ADA activity of IDGF was assayed in the presence of DCF. As shown in Fig. 3, both the ADA and growth factor activities decreased in the same way with an increase in the concentration of DCF, and no appreciable activities were detected in the presence of 10−7m DCF. These results strongly suggested that the ADA activity of IDGF is essential for its growth factor activity. To further confirm these results, we prepared the recombinant IDGF with mutations in its ADA domain. For this, we designed four mutants as to Asp462 and His405, which correspond to Asp295 and His238 of mouse cytoplasmic ADA, respectively. In mouse ADA, Asp295 is known to play a critical role in the deamination of adenosine through interaction with the catalytic water (25Sideraki V. Mohamedali K.A. Wilson D.K. Chang Z. Kellems R.E. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7862-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and His238 is also known to play a crucial role in the catalytic reaction (35Sideraki V. Wilson D.K. Kurz L.C. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15019-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These two residues are conserved in many IDGF family proteins. The mutants we constructed were designated as D462E, D462N, H405E, and H405R. The sequence of the synthesized cDNA for each mutant was confirmed. Expression of each mutant was performed as for the recombinant IDGF, and each mutant was purified to homogeneity, as judged on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Fig. 1,B and C). No appreciable ADA activity was detected with any of these mutants, indicating that both Asp462 and His405 are essential residues for the ADA activity of IDGF. The kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, and kcat) of D462E, D462N, H405E, and H405R could not be determined. Next, the growth factor activity of the mutant proteins was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, these mutants rather inhibited the growth of NIH-Sape-4 cells, and no significant dose-dependent growth stimulation was detected like that in the case of the wild-type IDGF. From these results, we concluded that the ADA activity of IDGF is linked to its growth factor activity. We examined whether mammalian ADA has growth factor activity on NIH-Sape-4 cells, and found that commercially available calf spleen ADA stimulated their growth in a dose-dependent manner. However, its growth factor activity could not be compared directly with that of IDGF because of its low purity. Since the ADA activity of IDGF was shown to be indispensable for its growth factor activity, there remained the possibility that IDGF converts adenosine analogues in the medium into inosine analogues, which stimulate the growth of NIH-Sape-4 cells in some way. Therefore, we added various adenosine analogues and inosine analogues (adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, 3′-deoxyadenosine, 5′-AMP, inosine, 2′-deoxyinosine, 3′-deoxyinosine, 5′-IMP, and arabinofuranosyladenine) to the culture medium of NIH-Sape-4 cells at a concentration of 1 mm and then examined their growth stimulation effects. However, they caused essentially no growth stimulation of NIH-Sape-4 cells. Therefore, it is assumed that the growth stimulation of NIH-Sape-4 cells by IDGF is not simply due to the production of inosine analogues in the medium. We examined the effect of anti-IDGF antibody for the proliferation of NIH-Sape-4 cells, but essentially no appreciable inhibitory effect was detected. Possibly, this antibody detects epitopes on IDGF that are not involved in the growth factor activity. To gain more insight into the mechanism underlying the growth stimulation by IDGF, we examined the binding of IDGF to NIH-Sape-4 cells. For this, we prepared radioiodinated IDGF and measured its specific binding to NIH-Sape-4 cells. Scatchard analysis revealed that NIH-Sape-4 cells have one type of binding site for IDGF. Five independent experiments showed that IDGF binds to NIH-Sape-4 cells with a Kd value of about 2 × 10−10m, and the number of binding sites was calculated to be in the range of 1500–10,000/cell. These results suggest that IDGF exerts its growth factor activity by binding to a specific molecule that is present on the cell surface and then transmits a signal for growth into the cells. This molecule may be a substrate for ADA, and deamination of this substrate by IDGF is a prerequisite for transmission of the growth signal into the cells. So far, we have not succeeded in identifying the IDGF receptor. However, Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with a molecular mass of 180 kDa was transiently enhanced at 2 min post-stimulation with IDGF (Fig.5). In this experiment, we used 50 ng/ml of IDGF, and the result was reproducible. Similar results were obtained with IDGF concentrations of 1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml. The molecular nature of this protein is totally unknown, but these results suggest the involvement of a signal transduction via IDGF receptor in the growth stimulation of NIH-Sape-4 cells by IDGF. Finally, we performed Northern blotting to determine the timing of expression of the IDGF gene in the life cycle of Sarcophaga. As shown in Fig.6, unfertilized eggs contained a significant amount of maternal mRNA for IDGF, which decreased with development of the embryos, suggesting that the maternal mRNA was translated into IDGF and that the resulting IDGF enhanced the proliferation of embryonic cells during embryogenesis. Another stage at which expression of the IDGF gene was obvious was in first instar larvae. The size of the mRNA produced at this stage was a little smaller, but it contained the complete open reading frame for IDGF, suggesting that IDGF is also needed for larval maturation. The ADA family has previously been classified into two groups. The first group includes cellular enzymes that are involved in purine metabolism and are indispensable for the upkeep of a competent immune system, since genetic defects of them are associated with severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (36Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The second group comprises the double-stranded RNA-specific ADA that contains unique RNA-binding domains. This ADA is assumed to participate in RNA editing of specific mRNA (37Rueter S.M. Emeson R.B. Modification and Editing of RNA. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 1725-1768Google Scholar). Since IDGF was found to have ADA activity and since no significant sequence similarity was found between IDGF and known ADAs except for in their ADA domains, the IDGF family proteins may be classified into a third group that comprises secretory or transmembrane ADAs. We demonstrated that the ADA activity of IDGF is essential for its growth factor activity and suggested the presence of IDGF binding sites on the surface of NIH-Sape-4 cells. This binding site for IDGF is likely to be specific, and once IDGF binds to this receptor, a signal may be transmitted into the cells, resulting in stimulation of their proliferation. ADA activity seems to be implicated in this process. One possibility is that the receptor may be modified with an adenosine moiety, and conversion of this adenosine to inosine by ADA is indispensable for the receptor to transmit the growth signal into the cells. It has been shown that a specific ADA binding site is present in CD26 (38Kameoka J. Tanaka T. Nojima Y. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 39Dong R.P. Tachibana K. Hegen M. Munakata Y. Cho D. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6070-6076PubMed Google Scholar), which is a transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase located on the surface of mammalian lymphocytes (40Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the physiological meaning of this ADA binding site. Judging from the present results together, there is a possibility that CD26 is a transmembrane signaling molecule like the putative IDGF receptor. Thus, it may be worthwhile examining whether or not CD26 is modified with an adenosine moiety. The relationship between CD26 and the phosphorylated protein with the molecular mass of 180 kDa in the IDGF signaling pathway is another important issue. As was evident from Northern blotting, unfertilized eggs contain a significant amount of IDGF mRNA. This suggests that IDGF is needed immediately when embryonic cells are formed after fertilization. It is not clear whether the mRNA detected in embryos at an early developmental stage is a carryover of maternal mRNA or mRNA synthesized in situ. However, the latter possibility is more likely, since NIH-Sape-4 cells originating from Sarcophagaembryos constitutively synthesize IDGF. A significant amount of mRNA was detected in the first instar larvae, suggesting that IDGF is needed for the proliferation of certain larval cells. Clearly, this mRNA is synthesized in situ, because its molecular size is a little smaller than that of the maternal or embryonic mRNA. We confirmed that the smaller mRNA contains the same open reading frame as the maternal or embryonic mRNA. The smaller mRNA is thus likely to be produced through alternative splicing of the precursor RNA, but we have not yet determined the complete sequence of the smaller mRNA. It is noteworthy that the IDGF family proteins are widely distributed in the animal kingdom. The gene for CECR1 (14Riazi M.A. Brinkman-Mills P. Nguyen T. Pan H. Phan S. Ying F. Roe B.A. Tochigi J.

White B.N. Science. 1986; 232: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ADA activity as well as the growth factor activity of CECR1 from patients may provide clues as to this disease. It is known that mammalian serum contains a certain level of adenosine, which functions as a synaptic, angiogenic, and vasculogenic modulator (43Jacobson K.A. van Galen P.J. Williams M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). It is also possible that a humoral protein such as CECR1 participates in the maintenance of the adenosine level in the serum. An ADA inhibitor, DCF, has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent for leukemias such as adult T-cell leukemia (44Yamaguchi K. Yul L.S. Oda T. Maeda Y. Ishii M. Fujita K. Kagiyama S. Nagai K. Suzuki H. Takatsuki K. Leuk. Res. 1986; 10: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and hairy cell leukemia (45Kraut E.H. Bouroncle B.A. Grever M.R. Blood. 1986; 68: 1119-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is known that the permeability of cell membranes to DCF is very low and that it does not penetrate into leukemia cells. Moreover, the toxicity of DCF against leukemia cells was found to be very low when examined in vitro. 2H. Kusakabe, personal communication. These facts suggest the possibility that the real target of DCF in leukemia patients is an extracellular ADA like IDGF, not a cytoplasmic ADA. To prove this, more detailed examinations are needed.

BRFU is a factor exclusively required for transcription of the pol III-type snRNA genes. We report that recruitment of BRFU to the TATA-box of these promoters is TATA-binding protein (TBP)-dependent.

The pol III-specific core promoters contain an additional TATA-box at −25, which in this context is responsible for the selective recruitment of pol III (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Insertion of a TATA element into the pol II-transcribed U2 promoter converts it into a predominantly pol III promoter (8Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas mutation of the 7SK TATA-box reduces pol III transcription and allows snRNA-type transcription by pol II to occur (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TBP is required for transcription of both types of snRNA gene and is likely to be recruited to the TATA-less pol II-specific promoters by interaction with PTF binding to the PSE (3Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PTF also potentiates direct binding of TBP to the TATA-box of the pol III-specific promoters (9Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because loss of pol III transcription correlates with the loss of TBP binding to the mutated TATA-box (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Lobo S.M. Lister J. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the differential interaction of TBP with template DNA and the other proteins of the PIC is likely to play a key role in the ultimate recruitment of different polymerases.For transcription of tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes, which have gene-internal pol III promoters, TBP is associated with TFIIIB90 (11Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (also called hBRF (12Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7031-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) and hB“ (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (also called TFIIIB150 (14Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) within the TFIIIB-β complex (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At these TATA-less promoters, the internal promoter recruits TFIIIC that results in the subsequent recruitment of TFIIIB-β, which may then directly recruit pol III. TBP is a more loosely associated subunit of the less well characterized snRNA-specific TFIIIB form, designated hTFIIIB-α (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is required for transcription of the U6/7SK genes by pol III. Recently, a basal transcription factor known as BRFU (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), or TFIIIB50 (14Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), has been shown to be required for transcription of these snRNA genes but not an adenovirus 2 VA1 gene with an internal pol III promoter. Interestingly, BRFU/TFIIIB50 has sequence homology to both TFIIIB90/BRF and the pol II initiation factor TFIIB. A complex of TFIIIB50 and four tightly associated factors constitutes, together with TBP and TFIIIB150, the complete TFIIIB-α activity that transcribes pol III snRNA genes (14Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, Hernandez and colleagues (16Chong S.S. Hu P. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20727-20734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) could obtain U6 transcription by combining a partially purified pol III fraction with recombinant PTF, TBP, hB”, and BRFU alone (16Chong S.S. Hu P. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20727-20734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, another factor encoded by an alternatively spliced variant of hBRF (BRF2) may also be required for U6 transcription (17McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus the exact “TFIIIB complex” requirement for pol III-transcribed snRNA genes remains to be determined.The ∼50-kDa human BRFU represents another member of the TFIIB-related protein family and has conserved zinc and core domains, and a divergent C-terminal domain (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), (18Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26733-26736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Within the Zn2+-binding region, BRFU is 37.5 and 31.2% identical to human TFIIB and BRF, respectively, suggesting that this region of BRFU also adopts a zinc ribbon structure. The identity with the TFIIB core region is 19% (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and as in TFIIB, the BRFU core domain consists of two direct repeats.Here we show that BRFU interacts with TBP to form a complex on TATA-containing templates and have mapped amino acid residues within TBP and domains of BRFU that mediate this interaction. Strikingly, we found that BRFU, unlike TFIIB, appears to have no specificity for sequences outside the binding site for TBP. Together, the data presented here provide an insight into an important step in nucleation of a pol III- specific snRNA transcription initiation complex.DISCUSSIONThe exact mechanism of differential PIC assembly on pol II and pol III snRNA promoters is still awaiting elucidation. TBP is required for transcription of both types of snRNA genes but not as part of the TBP-containing complexes TFIID (32Bernues J. Simmen K.A. Lewis J.D. Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3573-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or TFIIIB-β (3Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that function in transcription of mRNA genes (by pol II) and tRNA/5 S RNA genes (by pol III), respectively. Because the same PTF is required for transcription of snRNA genes by both pol II and III, it seems likely that different modes of TBP recruitment by both PTF and promoter sequences set the stage for subsequent recruitment of polymerase-specific factors. Here we show that TBP bound to the TATA-box of pol III snRNA templates can recruit the pol III-specific snRNA-gene factor BRFU but not the pol II-specific TFIIB and that the intact TATA element is essential for BRFU·TBP·DNA complex formation. The stability of the BRFU·TBP·DNA complex resembles to some extent the yeast TFIIIB complex, which consists of strongly associated TBP and BRF and loosely associated B“ (33Kassavetis G.A.

Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The non-conserved N-terminal domain of TBP was reported to be responsible for its cooperative binding with PTF to their respective binding sites on U6 promoter (9Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that the C-terminal core domain of TBP (cTBP) is sufficient to mediate interaction with BRFU both in solution and on DNA.We could not detect direct interaction between BRFU and DNA, but DNase I analysis suggests that BRFU contacts sequences upstream and downstream of the TATA-box when TBP is bound. These sequences might play a role in the clamping of TBP to DNA by BRFU. We speculate there is a TBP-induced DNA bend in BRFU·TBP·DNA complex that places the upstream and downstream DNA segments in proper spatial register for simultaneous BRFU·DNA interactions with both DNA segments. It is therefore possible that, like TFIIB (27Tsai F.T. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), binding of BRFU is synergetic with TBP requiring the distortion of the TATA-box (Fig. 2 B). Biochemical studies have shown that cTBP recognizes the TATA-box of protein-encoding genes in both orientations (reviewed in Ref. 35Reinberg D. Orphanides G. Ebright R. Akoulitchev S. Carcamo J. Cho H. Cortes P. Drapkin R. Flores O. Ha I. Inostroza J.A. Kim S. Kim T.K. Kumar P. Lagrange T. LeRoy G. Lu H. Ma D.M. Maldonado E. Merino A. Mermelstein F. Olave I. Sheldon M. Shiekhattar R. Zawel L. et al.Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and TFIIB, as an essential factor in the assembly of a functional PIC, forms a stereo-specific complex with TBP (36Tansey W.P. Herr W. Science. 1997; 275: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It, therefore, follows that a specific TFIIB·BRE interaction (31Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) would contribute strongly to unique directionality in the assembly of the PIC and, hence, to the polarity of transcription. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TFIIIB is recruited to the U6 promoter through the interaction of its TBP subunit with a TATA-box, and the direction of this complex assembly is dictated by a TFIIIC-dependent mechanism (37Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the sequences flanking the TATA-box in human pol III-specific snRNA templates play a role in setting the orientation of the TBP·BRFU complex.Although the BRFU core possesses a structure similar to the core of TFIIB, we can expect differences in composition of TFIIB·TBP·DNA and BRFU·TBP·DNA complexes. The TFIIB C-terminal domain, containing intact direct repeats and associated basic regions, is necessary for interaction with TBP·DNA complexes (30Hisatake K. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nature. 1993; 363: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that direct repeat 2 of the BRFU core, but not repeat 1, is required for formation of a TBP·BRFU·DNA complex. In hBRF, both repeats and more avidly the C-terminal half of the protein interact with TBP (11Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active BRF2 variant is also able to form a complex with TBP (17McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this regard it should be noted that the 23-kDa BRF2 does not contain all of the structural regions that are typical for TFIIB-related proteins (zinc-ribbon, repeat 1, and repeat 2) and includes only part of the second direct repeat. In TFIIB, the zinc-ribbon domain is required for direct recruitment of a TFIIF·pol II complex (38Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Fang S.M. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11703-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BRF, like TFIIB, also directly contacts polymerase, in this case pol III (11Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the Zn-ribbon in BRF plays a role in open complex formation in yeast (41Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar) but is not required for pol III recruitment (41Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 43Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further experiments are therefore required to reveal the precise function of the Zn-ribbon in BRFU.Earlier studies of TBP mutants have already revealed a great deal about how the protein functions in pol II and pol III transcription. Residues Glu-284, Glu-286, and Leu-287 at the tip of the second stirrup of the saddle-shaped molecule (44Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 638-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are critical both for TFIIB binding and in vitro and in vivo transcription (19Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,45Kim T.K. Hashimoto S. Kelleher 3rd, R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In yeast, different residues Arg-231, Arg-235, and Phe-250 contribute to the TBP surface that interacts with BRF (29Shen Y. Kassavetis G.A. Bryant G.O. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our assays, single-amino acid substitutions R235E and F250E in TBP prevent BRFU from entering a TBP·DNA complex. Mutation E284R did not affect the stability of the BRFU·TBP·DNA complex but caused significant changes in the complex conformation. Thus, these data are consistent with the BRFU sequence similarities to both BRF and TFIIB.Clearly, the sequences flanking the TATA-box in the U2 TATA construct do not allow TBP·TFIIB·DNA complex formation and thus might exclude TFIIF-pol II recruitment, and in consequence, pol II-specific transcription. However, because BRFU forms a complex with TBP·AdMLP as well as TFIIB does and pol III-type transcription can initiate from an snRNA gene promoter containing an mRNA gene TATA-box and flanking sequences, additional mechanism(s) must direct BRFU to specifically assemble on pol III snRNA templates in the cell. Otherwise, BRFU would compete with TFIIB in PIC formation on the promoters of protein-encoding genes (Fig.7). Thus, sequences further outside the core promoter of the AdMLP may ensure that only pol II-specific PICs can form on this template in vivo. For instance, factors binding to promoter and initiator sequences may interact specifically with pol II-specific basic factors and effectively exclude pol III-specific factors. However, at least one mRNA promoter, within the c-myc gene, can direct TATA-dependent transcription by pol III both in vitro and in vivo in some circumstances (46Sussman D.J. Chung J. Leder P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5045-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that the balance can be tipped to favor pol III.The availability of individual factors, TBP, PTF, B“, and pol III snRNA-specific BRFU offers a unique system to understand the structure and function of a basal transcription multisubunit complex specific for snRNA genes transcribed by pol III polymerase. It is possible that, in addition to TBP, BRFU or its associated factors directly contact transcription factors PTF and B” and, together with any recognition elements in the core of pol III snRNA promoters, provides a basis for selective recruitment of pol III. The core promoter regions of human snRNA1 genes are sufficient to direct low levels of transcription in vitro and contain a binding site, called the proximal sequence element (PSE), for the multisubunit factor PBP/PTF/SNAPc (1Waldschmidt R. Wanandi I. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2595-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

The PSE, usually located around −55, is interchangeable between snRNA gene promoters recognized by RNA polymerase II (e.g. U1 and U2) and RNA polymerase III (e.g. U6 and 7SK) (4Lobo, S. M., and Hernandez, N. T. (1994) inTranscription: Mechanisms and Regulation (Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W., eds), pp. 127–159, Chapter 8, Raven Press, Ltd., New York.Google Scholar, 5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and purified or recombinant PTF functions as a basal transcription factor for both types of snRNA gene (6Yoon J.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Henry R.W. Mittal V. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pol III-specific core promoters contain an additional TATA-box at −25, which in this context is responsible for the selective recruitment of pol III (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Insertion of a TATA element into the pol II-transcribed U2 promoter converts it into a predominantly pol III promoter (8Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas mutation of the 7SK TATA-box reduces pol III transcription and allows snRNA-type transcription by pol II to occur (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TBP is required for transcription of both types of snRNA gene and is likely to be recruited to the TATA-less pol II-specific promoters by interaction with PTF binding to the PSE (3Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PTF also potentiates direct binding of TBP to the TATA-box of the pol III-specific promoters (9Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because loss of pol III transcription correlates with the loss of TBP binding to the mutated TATA-box (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Lobo S.M. Lister J. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the differential interaction of TBP with template DNA and the other proteins of the PIC is likely to play a key role in the ultimate recruitment of different polymerases. For transcription of tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes, which have gene-internal pol III promoters, TBP is associated with TFIIIB90 (11Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (also called hBRF (12Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7031-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) and hB“ (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (also called TFIIIB150 (14Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) within the TFIIIB-β complex (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At these TATA-less promoters, the internal promoter recruits TFIIIC that results in the subsequent recruitment of TFIIIB-β, which may then directly recruit pol III. TBP is a more loosely associated subunit of the less well characterized snRNA-specific TFIIIB form, designated hTFIIIB-α (15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is required for transcription of the U6/7SK genes by pol III. Recently, a basal transcription factor known as BRFU (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), or TFIIIB50 (14Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), has been shown to be required for transcription of these snRNA genes but not an adenovirus 2 VA1 gene with an internal pol III promoter. Interestingly, BRFU/TFIIIB50 has sequence homology to both TFIIIB90/BRF and the pol II initiation factor TFIIB. A complex of TFIIIB50 and four tightly associated factors constitutes, together with TBP and TFIIIB150, the complete TFIIIB-α activity that transcribes pol III snRNA genes (14Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, Hernandez and colleagues (16Chong S.S. Hu P. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20727-20734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) could obtain U6 transcription by combining a partially purified pol III fraction with recombinant PTF, TBP, hB”, and BRFU alone (16Chong S.S. Hu P. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20727-20734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, another factor encoded by an alternatively spliced variant of hBRF (BRF2) may also be required for U6 transcription (17McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus the exact “TFIIIB complex” requirement for pol III-transcribed snRNA genes remains to be determined. The ∼50-kDa human BRFU represents another member of the TFIIB-related protein family and has conserved zinc and core domains, and a divergent C-terminal domain (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), (18Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26733-26736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Within the Zn2+-binding region, BRFU is 37.5 and 31.2% identical to human TFIIB and BRF, respectively, suggesting that this region of BRFU also adopts a zinc ribbon structure. The identity with the TFIIB core region is 19% (13Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and as in TFIIB, the BRFU core domain consists of two direct repeats. Here we show that BRFU interacts with TBP to form a complex on TATA-containing templates and have mapped amino acid residues within TBP and domains of BRFU that mediate this interaction. Strikingly, we found that BRFU, unlike TFIIB, appears to have no specificity for sequences outside the binding site for TBP.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar) but is not required for pol III recruitment (41Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C.

Further experiments are therefore required to reveal the precise function of the Zn-ribbon in BRFU.Earlier studies of TBP mutants have already revealed a great deal about how the protein functions in pol II and pol III transcription. Residues Glu-284, Glu-286, and Leu-287 at the tip of the second stirrup of the saddle-shaped molecule (44Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 638-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are critical both for TFIIB binding and in vitro and in vivo transcription (19Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In yeast, different residues Arg-231, Arg-235, and Phe-250 contribute to the TBP surface that interacts with BRF (29Shen Y. Kassavetis G.A. Bryant G.O. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our assays, single-amino acid substitutions R235E and F250E in TBP prevent BRFU from entering a TBP·DNA complex. Mutation E284R did not affect the stability of the BRFU·TBP·DNA complex but caused significant changes in the complex conformation. Thus, these data are consistent with the BRFU sequence similarities to both BRF and TFIIB.Clearly, the sequences flanking the TATA-box in the U2 TATA construct do not allow TBP·TFIIB·DNA complex formation and thus might exclude TFIIF-pol II recruitment, and in consequence, pol II-specific transcription. However, because BRFU forms a complex with TBP·AdMLP as well as TFIIB does and pol III-type transcription can initiate from an snRNA gene promoter containing an mRNA gene TATA-box and flanking sequences, additional mechanism(s) must direct BRFU to specifically assemble on pol III snRNA templates in the cell. Otherwise, BRFU would compete with TFIIB in PIC formation on the promoters of protein-encoding genes (Fig.7). Thus, sequences further outside the core promoter of the AdMLP may ensure that only pol II-specific PICs can form on this template in vivo. For instance, factors binding to promoter and initiator sequences may interact specifically with pol II-specific basic factors and effectively exclude pol III-specific factors. However, at least one mRNA promoter, within the c-myc gene, can direct TATA-dependent transcription by pol III both in vitro and in vivo in some circumstances (46Sussman D.J. Chung J. Leder P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5045-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that the balance can be tipped to favor pol III.The availability of individual factors, TBP, PTF, B“, and pol III snRNA-specific BRFU offers a unique system to understand the structure and function of a basal transcription multisubunit complex specific for snRNA genes transcribed by pol III polymerase. It is possible that, in addition to TBP, BRFU or its associated factors directly contact transcription factors PTF and B” and, together with any recognition elements in the core of pol III snRNA promoters, provides a basis for selective recruitment of pol III. The exact mechanism of differential PIC assembly on pol II and pol III snRNA promoters is still awaiting elucidation. TBP is required for transcription of both types of snRNA genes but not as part of the TBP-containing complexes TFIID (32Bernues J. Simmen K.A. Lewis J.D. Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3573-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or TFIIIB-β (3Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Yoon J.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that function in transcription of mRNA genes (by pol II) and tRNA/5 S RNA genes (by pol III), respectively. Because the same PTF is required for transcription of snRNA genes by both pol II and III, it seems likely that different modes of TBP recruitment by both PTF and promoter sequences set the stage for subsequent recruitment of polymerase-specific factors. Here we show that TBP bound to the TATA-box of pol III snRNA templates can recruit the pol III-specific snRNA-gene factor BRFU but not the pol II-specific TFIIB and that the intact TATA element is essential for BRFU·TBP·DNA complex formation. The stability of the BRFU·TBP·DNA complex resembles to some extent the yeast TFIIIB complex, which consists of strongly associated TBP and BRF and loosely associated B“ (33Kassavetis G.A. Bartholomew B. Blanco J.A. Johnson T.E. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7308-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Huet J. Conesa C. Manaud N. Chaussivert N. Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The non-conserved N-terminal domain of TBP was reported to be responsible for its cooperative binding with PTF to their respective binding sites on U6 promoter (9Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that the C-terminal core domain of TBP (cTBP) is sufficient to mediate interaction with BRFU both in solution and on DNA. We could not detect direct interaction between BRFU and DNA, but DNase I analysis suggests that BRFU contacts sequences upstream and downstream of the TATA-box when TBP is bound. These sequences might play a role in the clamping of TBP to DNA by BRFU. We speculate there is a TBP-induced DNA bend in BRFU·TBP·DNA complex that places the upstream and downstream DNA segments in proper spatial register for simultaneous BRFU·DNA interactions with both DNA segments. It is therefore possible that, like TFIIB (27Tsai F.T. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), binding of BRFU is synergetic with TBP requiring the distortion of the TATA-box (Fig. 2 B). Biochemical studies have shown that cTBP recognizes the TATA-box of protein-encoding genes in both orientations (reviewed in Ref. 35Reinberg D. Orphanides G. Ebright R. Akoulitchev S. Carcamo J. Cho H. Cortes P. Drapkin R. Flores O. Ha I. Inostroza J.A. Kim S. Kim T.K. Kumar P. Lagrange T. LeRoy G. Lu H. Ma D.M. Maldonado E. Merino A. Mermelstein F. Olave I. Sheldon M. Shiekhattar R. Zawel L. et al.Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and TFIIB, as an essential factor in the assembly of a functional PIC, forms a stereo-specific complex with TBP (36Tansey W.P. Herr W. Science. 1997; 275: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It, therefore, follows that a specific TFIIB·BRE interaction (31Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) would contribute strongly to unique directionality in the assembly of the PIC and, hence, to the polarity of transcription. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TFIIIB is recruited to the U6 promoter through the interaction of its TBP subunit with a TATA-box, and the direction of this complex assembly is dictated by a TFIIIC-dependent mechanism (37Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the sequences flanking the TATA-box in human pol III-specific snRNA templates play a role in setting the orientation of the TBP·BRFU complex. Although the BRFU core possesses a structure similar to the core of TFIIB, we can expect differences in composition of TFIIB·TBP·DNA and BRFU·TBP·DNA complexes. The TFIIB C-terminal domain, containing intact direct repeats and associated basic regions, is necessary for interaction with TBP·DNA complexes (30Hisatake K. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nature. 1993; 363: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that direct repeat 2 of the BRFU core, but not repeat 1, is required for formation of a TBP·BRFU·DNA complex. In hBRF, both repeats and more avidly the C-terminal half of the protein interact with TBP (11Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active BRF2 variant is also able to form a complex with TBP (17McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this regard it should be noted that the 23-kDa BRF2 does not contain all of the structural regions that are typical for TFIIB-related proteins (zinc-ribbon, repeat 1, and repeat 2) and includes only part of the second direct repeat. In TFIIB, the zinc-ribbon domain is required for direct recruitment of a TFIIF·pol II complex (38Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Fang S.M. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11703-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BRF, like TFIIB, also directly contacts polymerase, in this case pol III (11Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc.

However, the Zn-ribbon in BRF plays a role in open complex formation in yeast (41Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar) but is not required for pol III recruitment (41Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C.

Under strong denaturing conditions (e.g. 6 m guanidinium chloride) and in the presence of a thiol initiator, α-lactalbumin (αLA) denatures by shuffling its four native disulfide bonds and converts to an assembly of 45 species of scrambled isomers. Among them, two predominant isomers, designated as X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d, account for about 50% of the total denatured structure of αLA. X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d, which adopt the disulfide patterns of (1–2,3–4,5–6,7–8) and (1–2,3–6,4–5,7–8), respectively, represent the most unfolded structures among the 104 possible scrambled isomers (Chang, J.-Y., and Li, L.

Overall, the folding mechanism of αLA is essentially congruent with the model of “folding funnel” furnished with a rather intricate energy landscape. guanidinium chloride α-lactalbumin high pressure liquid chromatography Most nascent polypeptides need to navigate their way to form the native, biologically active structures. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism and pathway of this folding process is of fundamental importance in biological science (1–14). Experimentally, it also represents one of the most daunting challenges to protein chemists and structural biologists. At present, the pathway of protein folding can be elucidated by two general methods. The most widely adopted conventional approach is to unfold proteins in the presence of strong denaturant (e.g. 8 m urea or 6 mGdmCl)1 or by extreme pH and temperature. Following the removal of denaturant (e.g. by gel filtration, dilution, or dialysis), pH jump, or temperature jump, denatured proteins usually refold spontaneously to form the native structure. The pathway of protein refolding is then monitored by the mechanism of restoration of some physicochemical signals that distinguish the native and unfolded states. The most commonly used signals are spectra of fluorescence, circular dichroism (15Labhardt A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), infrared (16Surewicz W.E. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D.

This method is most versatile and can be practically applied to study folding behaviors of any protein. However, it does not permit, in most cases, isolation of folding intermediates. To date, the vast majority of our knowledge about protein folding has been acquired by the application of this approach. Another established method is oxidative folding of disulfide-containing proteins (22Creighton T.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1978; 33: 231-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 23Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 24Wedemeyer W.J.

Biol. 2000; 4: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Proteins are first reduced and denatured in the presence of reducing agent (e.g. dithiothreitol) and denaturant (e.g. 6 m GdmCl). After exclusion of the reductant and denaturant, the reduced and denatured protein is allowed to refold in the presence of redox buffer (27Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The pathway of refolding is then tracked by the mechanism of formation of the native disulfide bonds. For example, a protein that contains three disulfide bonds can potentially assume 75 different disulfide isomers (15 one-disulfide, 45 two-disulfide, and 15 three-disulfide). The disulfide folding pathway is characterized by the heterogeneity and structures of disulfide isomers that accumulate along the process of oxidative folding that leads to the formation of the species containing the three native disulfide bonds. This technique, pioneered by Creighton (22Creighton T.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1978; 33: 231-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar,23Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol.

We describe here a third approach for analyzing the pathway of protein folding using the technique of disulfide scrambling, a process of shuffling and reshuffling of disulfide bonds accompanied by the reversible conformational change between the native and denatured proteins (40Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the presence of denaturant and a thiol initiator, a native protein denatures by shuffling its native disulfide bonds and converts to a mixture of heterogeneous scrambled isomers. Upon removal of the denaturant (but retaining the thiol initiator), all scrambled isomers refold spontaneously by reshuffling their non-native disulfide bonds to form the native structure. The technique of disulfide scrambling was applied to analyze the structures of denatured α-lactalbumin (αLA) (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). αLA contains four disulfide bonds and may adopt 104 possible denatured scrambled isomers. Each scrambled isomer assumes a specific disulfide pairings and adopts a varied extent of unfolding. At mild concentration of GdmCl (e.g. 1.5 m), denatured αLA was shown to consist of 45 fractions of scrambled species (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). None of them comprises more than 10% of the total structure of denatured αLA. However, under strong denaturing conditions, two predominant scrambled isomers, namely X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d, together account for about 50% of the total structure of denatured αLA (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These two well populated isomers contain exclusively non-native disulfide bonds and adopt the disulfide patterns of (1–2,3–4,5–6,7–8) and (1–2,3–6,4–5,7–8), respectively (see Fig. 1). They have the smallest sizes of disulfide loops of all possible scrambled isomers. Their disulfide structures, together with the fact that they are predominant only under strong denaturing conditions, indicate that X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d possess the highest free energy and represent the most unfolded structures among the 104 possible denatured isomers. In this report, X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d were purified and allowed to refold through disulfide scrambling in the presence of thiol initiators. Folding intermediates were trapped by acid quenching and analyzed by HPLC. The studies have enabled us to identify and isolate productive folding intermediates, kinetic traps, and a large number of transient intermediates along the folding pathway of αLA. Calcium-depleted bovine αLA (l-6010) was used throughout this study and was obtained from Sigma. The protein was further purified by HPLC and was shown to be more than 97% pure. Thermolysin (P-1512), dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, cysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, GdmCl, guanidinium thiocyanate, and urea were also purchased from Sigma with purity of greater than 99%. Protein disulfide isomerase (number 7318) was purchased from Takara, Kyoto, Japan. Scrambled species of αLA are designated by the following formula: X-αLA-(species assigned on HPLC), where X stands for scrambled. For instance, X-αLA-a represents species a of scrambled αLA. The native αLA (4 mg/ml) was dissolved in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 mm) and GdmCl (6 m). Denaturation was carried out at 23 °C for 24 h. Denatured αLA was then mixed with an equal volume of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and subjected directly to separation by HPLC. Under these conditions (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), denatured αLA consists of about 45 fractions of scrambled isomers, with two predominant species, namely X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d, each accounting for about 24 and 17% of the total denatured structure. X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d were purified by HPLC, freeze-dried, and used as starting materials of folding experiments. They were stored at −20 °C. Folding of X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d was performed in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) using 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm) (control folding), cysteine (0.1 mm), or reduced glutathione (0.1 mm) as thiol initiators. Folding experiments of X-αLA-a were also carried out in the presence of NaCl (1 m), CaCl2 (5 mm), and protein disulfide isomerase (5 and 50 μm) using 2-mercaptoethanol as the thiol initiator. Stop/go folding experiments of purified intermediates (X-αLA-b, X-αLA-c, X-αLA-h, and X-αLA-k) were similarly conducted in the Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. All experiments were carried out at 23 °C with the protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. To monitor the kinetics of folding, the recovery of native structure, and the heterogeneity of folding intermediates, aliquots of the folding sample were removed at time intervals, quenched with an equal volume of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by HPLC. The samples were stored at −20 °C. Analysis and isolation of folding intermediates of αLA were achieved by the reversed phase HPLC using the following conditions: Solvent A for HPLC was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and Solvent B was acetonitrile/water (9:1, by volume) containing 0.086% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was 22 to 37% Solvent B in 15 min, and 37 to 56% Solvent B from 15 to 45 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The HPLC column was Zorbax 300SB C-18 for peptides and proteins, 4.6 mm, 5 μm. Column temperature was 23 °C. Fractions of scrambled αLA (∼10 μg) were isolated and treated with 1 μg of thermolysin in 30 μl of N-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.4). Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were then isolated by HPLC and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the disulfide-containing peptides. Amino acid sequence of disulfide-containing peptides were analyzed by automatic Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise sequencer (model 494) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. The molecular masses of disulfide-containing peptides were determined by a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Voyager-DE STR). A control folding experiment of X-αLA-a was first performed at 23 °C using 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm) as a thiol initiator. The folding intermediates and the yield of native αLA, trapped by acid quenching and analyzed by HPLC, are presented in Fig. 2A. About 55% of the native αLA was recovered after 24 h of folding (see Fig. 3). Conversion of X-αLA-a to the native αLA proceeds through a mixture of heterogeneous intermediates. Approximately 35 fractions of scrambled αLA were identified along the folding pathway. Among them, four major species have been structurally characterized (Fig.1) (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). X-αLA-b contains two native disulfide bonds at the β-sheet domain, whereas X-αLA-c forms two native disulfides within the α-helical domain. Both X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k undergo partial folding at the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of αLA. The relative concentration of these four major intermediates accumulated along the folding pathway is shown in Fig.4A. Cysteine and reduced glutathione are useful thiol initiators, as well, but they are less effective than 2-mercaptoethanol. At the same concentration (0.1 mm), 2-mercaptoethanol is about 60 and 120% more efficient than cysteine and reduced glutathione in promoting the conversion of X-αLA-a to native αLA (see Fig. 3). Regardless of the nature of thiol initiator, the patterns of folding intermediates remain indistinguishable.Figure 3Renaturation curves of X-αLA-a under different folding conditions.

However, it is the presence of protein disulfide isomerase that exhibits the most remarkable effect on accelerating the folding of X-αLA-a. As compared with the control folding experiment performed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm) alone, addition of 5 and 50 μm protein disulfide isomerase increases the rate of folding of X-αLA-a by 6- and 60-fold, respectively (see Fig.3). The concentrations of folding intermediates rise by an average of 75% (compare Fig. 4, A and B), but their heterogeneity and patterns remain essentially unchanged (compare Fig.2, A and B). The rise of concentration of folding intermediates in the presence of protein disulfide isomerase reflects the significant increase of rate constant for the conversion of X-αLA-a to the various intermediates. αLA is a calcium-binding protein. Not surprisingly, the presence of CaCl2 also displays significant influence on both folding kinetic and folding intermediates of X-αLA-a. Inclusion of CaCl2 (5 mm) accelerates the folding of X-αLA-a by about 2.5-fold (Fig. 3) and promotes formation of the folding intermediate (X-αLA-b) that adopts a structured calcium binding (β-sheet) domain (Fig. 2C). Under such conditions, X-αLA-b represents the only predominant intermediate along the folding pathway of X-αLA-a (Fig.4C). Of the four major folding intermediates of X-αLA-a, two comprise native-like structural domains. X-αLA-b forms two native disulfide bonds (Cys61–Cys77, Cys73–Cys91) at the β-sheet region, whereas X-αLA-c contains the other two native disulfide bonds (Cys6–Cys120, Cys28–Cys111) within the α-helical domain (Fig. 1). X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c were purified by HPLC, freeze-dried, and allowed to continue the folding in the Tris-HCl buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm). Folding intermediates were trapped by acidification and analyzed by HPLC. Chromatograms are presented in Fig. 5. Both X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c fold to form the native αLA without accumulation of any significant intermediate along the pathway (Fig.5). These data suggest that existing native disulfide bonds of X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c remain stable and do not participate in further disulfide shuffling during the folding. Conversion of both X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c to the native αLA thus entail only disulfide scrambling of their remaining two non-native disulfide bonds. In the case of X-αLA-b (Fig. 1), for instance, it requires reshuffling of Cys6–Cys28 and Cys111–Cys120 to form Cys6–Cys120 and Cys28–Cys111 to reach the native structure. In this setting, only one possible isomer (Cys6–Cys111, Cys61–Cys77, Cys73–Cys91, and Cys28–Cys120) may serve as the folding intermediate of X-αLA-b. Absence of this yet to be identified isomer indicates that it is unlikely to adopt a stable structure. A similar scenario is applied to the folding of X-αLA-c. The rates of renaturation of X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c are considerably greater than that of X-αLA-a (Fig. 6). Between these two intermediates, X-αLA-b is about 65% more competent than X-αLA-c in converting to the native αLA, implying that folding (formation) of the α-helical domain is more efficient than that of the β-sheet domain. Purified X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k were also permitted to carry on the folding under similar conditions (0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Their folding kinetics and the heterogeneity of folding intermediates were concluded from chromatograms presented in Fig. 7. Efficiencies of folding of X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k are slightly lower than that of X-αLA-a and significantly lower than those of X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c (Fig. 6). The rate of renaturation of X-αLA-k is about 5-fold slower than that of X-αLA-b. In addition, folding of both X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k undergo a mixture of heterogeneous intermediates that include X-αLA-a, X-αLA-b, and X-αLA-c (Fig.7). The low concentration of intermediates observed in the case of X-αLA-k folding (Fig. 7, right panel) is consistent with its slow renaturation to form the native structure. In this case, disulfide reshuffling (reorganization) of X-αLA-k and its conversion to other scrambled species represent a major rate-limiting step. These data imply that X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k are stable kinetic traps along the folding pathway of X-αLA-a. Their stability accounts for their accumulation and slow conversion during the folding. Because X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k both contain entirely non-native disulfide bonds, their conformational stability must be attributed to the non-native interactions formed at the N-terminal (X-αLA-k) and C-terminal (X-αLA-h) regions (Fig. 1). To continue the folding, such stable structural elements need first to be disrupted through disulfide shuffling. For example, one major route for X-αLA-k to carry on folding is to scramble Cys6–Cys61 and Cys28–Cys73 at the N-terminal region (Fig. 1) and return back to X-αLA-a (see Fig. 7 and Fig.8). X-αLA-a and X-αLA-d are two predominant isomers that constitute the structure of denatured αLA generated under strong denaturing conditions (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to the unfolding curves of αLA (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the yield of X-αLA-d as a fraction of the total denatured αLA increases from 20 to 23% as the concentration of guanidinium thiocyanate rises from 5 to 6m. At the same time, the recovery of X-αLA-a decreases from 28 to 26%. A similar phenomenon was observed with the GdmCl unfolding curves of αLA. These data indicate that X-αLA-d possesses a higher free energy and possibly adopts a more unfolded structure than X-αLA-a. To corroborate this finding, folding of X-αLA-d was also examined here. Purified X-αLA-d was allowed to refold in the Tris-HCl buffer using 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm) as the thiol initiator, an experimental condition identical to that used in the control folding of X-αLA-a (Fig. 2A). Folding intermediates were similarly analyzed by HPLC. The results show that the patterns of folding intermediates of X-αLA-d (Fig. 7, left panel) are largely comparable with those initiated with X-αLA-a (Fig. 2A). These results, however, reveal two distinct properties of X-αLA-d. 1) Folding of X-αLA-d was found to proceed through X-αLA-a as a major intermediate (Fig. 4D). By contrast, only a minute amount of X-αLA-d appeared along the folding pathway of X-αLA-a (Fig. 2, A and B). This clearly demonstrates that conversion of X-αLA-d to X-αLA-a during the folding is essentially an irreversible one-way street, which in turn substantiates our previous finding (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that X-αLA-d is thermodynamically less stable than X-αLA-a. 2) Under identical folding conditions, renaturation of X-αLA-d is actually about 20% more efficient than that of X-αLA-a (Fig. 6). This is most likely because of the fact that, aside from converting to X-αLA-a, a substantial amount of X-αLA-d may also refold directly via X-αLA-b, which is an on-pathway productive intermediate that rapidly forms the native αLA (Fig. 5). It is now commonly understood that for most proteins there is no single specific folding pathway. Instead, unfolded proteins must navigate their way through a maze of routes and an energy landscape (folding funnel) to reach the native structure (10Dinner A.R. Sali A. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M.

Chem. 1997; 48: 545-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Complexity and smoothness of such a folding funnel are determined by the nature, size, and domain structures of proteins. This new model of protein folding has presented experimentalists a formidable challenge to monitor and describe simultaneously an exceedingly large number of transient intermediates with vastly diverse stability and local energy minima (7Radford S.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 611-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Without separation and identification of these transient intermediates, the folding pathway at present can only be deduced and described from analysis of the average physicochemical properties of these collective transient isomers. The technique of disulfide scrambling permits folding experiments to be initiated with a structurally defined isomer and also allows such heterogeneous folding intermediates to be trapped by covalent bonds (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of trapped folding intermediates can be performed with HPLC. We demonstrate here the application of this method to the folding of αLA. The results show that the folding mechanism of αLA is essentially congruent with the model of a folding funnel (43Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 44Schultz C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 45Dobson C.M. Sali A. Karplus M. Angew.

Chem. 1997; 48: 545-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). The energy landscape that constitutes the folding funnel of αLA is best illustrated by the intermediates presented in Fig. 2B. Along the folding pathway of αLA, there exists a large number of structural isoforms. A few of them represent productive intermediates (e.g.X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c), some are transient intermediates (local energy minima), whereas others account for major kinetic traps (e.g. X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k). All together, at least 35 fractions of major and minor folding intermediates of αLA are identified. In this study, only four predominant intermediates were characterized. A thorough structural analysis and stop/go folding experiments of these minor intermediates should reveal a more detailed energy landscape of the folding of αLA. Despite the complexity of minor transient intermediates, analysis of the predominant on-pathway and off-pathway intermediates allows us to construct the major folding pathways of αLA (Fig. 8). In this scheme, folding of the unfolded protein (X-αLA-a) undergoes two major routes, and each consists of two distinct pathways. One is to form on-pathway intermediates with native disulfide bonds (X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c). Such intermediates most likely comprise native-like structures and may directly proceed to form the native αLA. X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c do not exist in a state of equilibrium (Fig. 5). The extent of their accumulation along the folding pathway is kinetically partitioned by the rates of their formation and their subsequent conversion to the native αLA. Stop/go folding experiments with purified X-αLA-b and X-αLA-c have demonstrated that folding (formation) of the α-helical domain (conversion of X-αLA-b to the native αLA) is about 65% more efficient than that of the β-sheet domain. The other route is to form off-pathway intermediates with non-native disulfide bonds (X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k). Such intermediates act as kinetic traps that are stabilized by non-native interactions. For X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k to carry on the folding, they will have to overcome an energy barrier and unravel the structure that already formed. In some occasions, they may need to return to a state of higher free energy to continue the folding. This is evident in the case of X-αLA-k. One major channel for X-αLA-k to continue the folding is to convert back to X-αLA-a (Fig. 7). This conclusion is based on the observation that X-αLA-a represents the major intermediate along the stop/go folding pathway of X-αLA-k. The overall low concentration of intermediates observed in the case of X-αLA-k folding (Fig. 7, right panel) signals the stability of X-αLA-k and indicates that disulfide reshuffling (reorganization) of X-αLA-k and its conversion to other scrambled species represent a major rate-limiting step. Folding can also be initiated with X-αLA-d, an isomer that possesses a higher free energy than X-αLA-a (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this case, folding pathways are kinetically segregated by converting to either X-αLA-a or X-αLA-b, which then keep folding as illustrated (Fig. 8). It is relevant to mention that this outlined folding pathway of αLA, and hence the configuration of the energy landscape of αLA folding, appears to be independent of the rate of protein renaturation, at least under the folding conditions described here. For instance, in the presence of protein disulfide isomerase (50 μm), the rate of folding of αLA increases by more than 60-fold (Fig. 4), yet the patterns of folding intermediates remain practically unaffected (compare Fig. 2, A and B). However, in the presence of ligand (Ca2+) that binds to a specific structural domain of αLA, the folding pathways can be drastically altered. In this setting, folding of X-αLA-a bypasses the majority of transient intermediates and kinetic traps and undergoes a single predominant intermediate that forms a structured β-sheet (calcium binding) domain (Fig. 2C). The energy landscape is greatly simplified and becomes much smoother. αLA is among the most intensively investigated models for understanding the mechanism of protein folding (19Forge V. Wijesinha R.T. Balbach J. Brew K. Robinson C.V. Redfield C. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 49Sugai S. Ikeguchi M. Adv. Biophys. 1994; 30: 37-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To date, the majority of existing data concerning the folding mechanism of αLA has been obtained from monitoring the refolding process of denatured αLA without disrupting its native disulfide bonds and without fractionation of folding intermediates (49Sugai S.

However, these documented findings are largely consistent with the folding pathway of αLA elucidated here using the technique of disulfide scrambling. These consistencies are elaborated as follows. 1) The molten globule state of αLA has been widely observed by various spectroscopic and physicochemical techniques as a major kinetic folding intermediate of αLA (19Forge V.

Fold. Des. 1996; 1: 275-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Structural analysis by NMR revealed that the molten globule state of αLA comprises a structured α-helical domain and a disordered β-sheet domain (51Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 53Peng Z.Y. Wu L.C. Kim P.S. Bichemistry. 1995; 34: 3248-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 54Wu L.C. Peng Z.Y. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A similar intermediate was found along the folding pathway of αLA elucidated here (Fig. 8). The most predominant on-pathway folding intermediate, X-αLA-c, bears the essential structural properties of the molten globule state of αLA (42Chang J.-Y. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9705-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 66Chang J.-Y. Bulychev A. Li L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 298-300Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). X-αLA-c contains two native disulfide bonds (Cys6–Cys120, Cys28–Cys111) within the α-helical domain and two scrambled disulfide bonds (Cys61–Cys73, Cys77–Cys91) at the β-sheet region (Fig. 1). X-αLA-c also retains a substantial amount of α-helical structure as exhibited by its far UV CD spectrum (66Chang J.-Y. Bulychev A. Li L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 298-300Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 2) Transient non-native secondary structures (β-sheet) were detected during the refolding of αLA by infrared spectroscopy (17Troullier A. Reinstadler D. Dupont Y. Naumann D. Forge V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here, the two major kinetic traps (X-αLA-h and X-αLA-k) and 30 minor transient intermediates are all potential candidates containing such non-native secondary structures. 3) The presence of calcium is known to accelerate the folding rate of αLA (17Troullier A. Reinstadler D. Dupont Y. Naumann D. Forge V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 67Rao K.R. Brew K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Berliner L.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This effect has been suggested to be the consequence of calcium binding to the early intermediates (19Forge V. Wijesinha R.T. Balbach J. Brew K. Robinson C.V. Redfield C. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 70Kuwajima K. Mitani M. Sugai S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 547-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Here, we clearly demonstrate that the presence of CaCl2enhances the folding of calcium binding site of αLA and favors the formation of an on-pathway folding intermediate (X-αLA-b) that adopts a structured, native-like β-sheet domain.

Because EGF activates the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt, we explored the role of Akt in gastric acid secretion. Akt phosphorylation and activation were measured by kinase assays and by Western blots with an anti-phospho-Akt antibody, using lysates of purified (>95%) canine gastric parietal cells in primary culture. EGF induced Akt phosphorylation and activation, whereas carbachol had no effect. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, completely blocked EGF induction of Akt phosphorylation, whereas the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 and the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X had no effect. We examined the role of Akt in H+/K+-ATPase gene expression by Northern blotting using a canine H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA probe. The parietal cells were transduced with a multiplicity of infection of 100 of the adenoviral vector Ad.Myr-Akt, which overexpresses a constitutively active Akt gene, or with the control vector Ad.CMV-β-gal, which expresses β-galactosidase. Ad.Myr-Akt induced H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression 3-fold, whereas it failed to stimulate the gene cyclooxygenase-2, which was potently induced by carbachol in the same parietal cells. Ad.Myr-Akt induced aminopyrine uptake 4-fold, and it potentiated the stimulatory action of carbachol 3-fold. In contrast, Ad.Myr-Akt failed to induce changes in either parietal cell actin content, measured by Western blots with an anti-actin antibody or in the organization of the actin cellular cytoskeleton, visualized by fluorescein phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy. Transduction of the parietal cells with a multiplicity of infection of 100 of the adenoviral vector Ad.dom.neg.Akt, which overexpresses an inhibitor of Akt, blocked the stimulatory effect of EGF on both aminopyrine uptake and H+/K+-ATPase production, measured by Western blots with an anti-H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit antibody. Thus, EGF induces a cascade of events in the parietal cells that results in the activation of Akt. The functional role of Akt appears to be stimulation of gastric acid secretion through induction of H+/K+-ATPase expression.

Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 129-167Google Scholar). In the stomach, EGF affects acid secretion in a divergent fashion. Under acute conditions, EGF has a long recognized inhibitory effect on acid secretion, whereas prolonged administration of EGF increases both basal and maximal acid secretion in vivo (2Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 278-319Google Scholar, 3Wang L. Wilson E.J. Osburn J. DelValle J.

Similar results have been observedin vitro, using preparations of highly purified gastric parietal cells in primary culture, which have been shown to express specific receptors for EGF/transforming growth factor-α (2Del Valle J.

Invest. 1989; 84: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this system, prolonged exposure of the parietal cells to EGF (>16 h) has been shown to enhance the stimulatory effects of carbachol, gastrin, and histamine on gastric acid secretion (2Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 278-319Google Scholar, 4Chew C.S. Nakamura K. Petropoulos A.C. Am. J.

The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are currently only partially understood. One hypothesis, based on in vivo observations, is that EGF stimulates the proliferation of progenitor neck cells present in the gastric glands, leading to an overall increase in the number of acid-producing parietal cells present in the gastric mucosa (5Dembinski A.B. Johnson L.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recent studies performed both in isolated, cultured, parietal cells and in AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells have indicated that EGF is able to induce both the expression and the transcription of the H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit gene (6Kaise M. Muraoka A. Yamada J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18637-18642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Gooz M. Hammond C.E. Larsen K. Mukhin Y.V. Smolka A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G981-G991PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that EGF might have a direct stimulatory effect on the expression of the gene responsible for gastric acid production. Little is known about the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms that mediate the stimulatory effects of EGF on gastric acid production and on H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression. Some studies, performed in isolated gastric parietal cells in primary culture, have suggested that the stimulatory actions of EGF on gastric acid secretion could be mediated by activation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway because they can be fully reversed either by genistein, a proteintyrosine kinase inhibitor, or by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (2Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 278-319Google Scholar, 9Takeuchi Y. Yamada J. Yamada T. Todisco A. Am. J.

However, another signal transduction pathway that has been recently shown to play an important role in the mediation of some of the physiological actions of EGF is that involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B/Akt (11Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 12Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

Although Akt 1 and Akt 2 are ubiquitously expressed, Akt 3 appears to be expressed predominantly in the brain, heart, and kidney (12Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt is known to induce cellular growth and survival and to promote the expression and the maintenance of highly differentiated cellular phenotypes (11Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl.

In addition, Akt has also been shown to regulate the translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane (12Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Akt is homologous to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and PKC families of protein kinases (12Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). In vivo, the activity of Akt is regulated by growth factors and serum through the induction of PI3K (12Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The major phosphorylation sites required for activation of Akt 1 have been identified as threonine 308 and serine 473, which are the targets of the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases I and II, respectively (12Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 17Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Similarly, Akt 2 and Akt 3 are also phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues (Thr-309 and Ser-474 in Akt 2 and Thr-305 and Ser-472 in Akt 3) by phosphoinositide-dependent kinases I and II (12Chan T.O.

Because little is known about the regulation and function of the protein kinase Akt in the stomach, we undertook these studies to examine the role of Akt in EGF-stimulated gastric acid production using highly purified gastric parietal cells in primary culture. The replication-defective adenoviral vectors expressing wild type, HA-tagged Akt 1 (Ad.wt.Akt), dominant negative HA-tagged, Akt 1 (with serine 473 and threonine 308 mutated to alanine) (Ad.dom.neg.Akt), or HA-tagged, myristoylated, constitutively active Akt 1 (Ad.Myr-Akt), under the control of the CMV promoter, were gifts of K. Walsh (Tufts University, Boston, MA) (19Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The adenoviral vector expressing the β-galactosidase enzyme under the control of the CMV promoter (Ad.CMV-β-gal) was described previously (20Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of primary parietal cells we utilized a modification of the method of Soll (21Soll A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and others (22Ljungstrom M. Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C67-C78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Campbell V.W. Yamada T.

The mucosal layer of freshly obtained canine gastric fundus was bluntly separated from the submucosa and rinsed in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were dispersed by sequential exposure to 0.35 mg/ml collagenase and 1 mm EDTA, and parietal cells were enriched by centrifugal elutriation using a Beckman JE-6B elutriation rotor. Our best preparations contained up to 70% parietal cells as determined by hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Shiff reagent staining. The parietal cells are further purified by centrifugation through density gradients generated by 50% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The cell fraction at ρ = 1.05 consists of virtually all parietal cells as determined by staining with a specific mouse monoclonal antibody against the hog H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit (a gift of A. Smolka, Charleston, SC) (26Takeuchi Y. Pausawasdi N. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1484-G1492PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated parietal cells (2 × 106 cells/well) are cultured according to the methods of Ljungstrom and Chew (22Ljungstrom M. Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C67-C78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (25Muraoka A. Kaise M. Guo Y. Yamada J. Song I. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G1104-G1113PubMed Google Scholar, 26Takeuchi Y. Pausawasdi N. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1484-G1492PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells are cultured in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) on 6-well culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) coated with 150 μl of H2O-diluted (1:5) growth factor reduced Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). For our studies, the parietal cells were incubated with either EGF (Becton Dickinson) (10−8–10−6m) or carbachol (Sigma) (10−4m), for various time periods. In some experiments PD98059 (5 × 10−5m) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), GF109203X (3.5 × 10−6m) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and LY294002 (10−5m) (Calbiochem) were added 30 min prior to the addition of the stimulants. PD98059, GF109203X, and LY294002 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. All other test substances were dissolved in water. The parietal cells were transduced, when indicated, with a multiplicity of infection of 100 of the adenoviral vectors expressing wild type Akt, dominant negative Akt, constitutively active Akt, or β-galactosidase for different time periods. The parietal cells were lysed with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot hybridization assays were performed as described previously (27Nagahara A. Wang L. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G740-G748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of each RNA sample, with ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) in a final volume of 20 μl, were electrophoresed on a 1.25% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and the RNA was transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose filters. The ethidium-stained ribosomal RNA bands in the gel were photographed before and after transfer to ensure that equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded onto each lane and that no residual RNA was left on the gel. The canine H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit and the human cyclooxygenase-2 cDNA probes were gifts of I. Song and L. Crofford, respectively (University of Michigan). The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNAs were labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random priming procedure, and the nitrocellulose filters were hybridized to the32P-labeled cDNA probes as described previously (27Nagahara A. Wang L. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G740-G748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and kinase assays were performed according to techniques described previously (26Takeuchi Y. Pausawasdi N. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1484-G1492PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nagahara A. Wang L. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G740-G748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The parietal cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7·10 H2O, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoridehydrochlorine (ICN-Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each treatment group (300 μg) were incubated with a monoclonal anti-Akt kinase antibody immobilized on agarose beads and recognizing all Akt isoforms (New England Biolabs). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the solutions were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. Immunoprecipitated Akt kinase was used to phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase 3α. GSK3α phosphorylation was measured by Western blots with a specific anti-phospho-GSK3α/β antibody. The reactions were carried out according to the instructions of the Akt kinase assay kit from New England Biolabs. For most blots, the parietal cells were lysed as described previously under “Materials and Methods.” For the H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit Western blots, the parietal cells were lysed according to a different protocol (29Smolka A.J. Larsen K.A. Schweinfest C.V. Hammond C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed once in PBS and spun at 1500 RPM for 10 min at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mmPipes (Sigma) with Tris, pH 6.8, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The solutions were sonicated on ice (twice for 5 min each) (Braun). After sonication, the samples were homogenized in 1-ml Dounce micro-homogenizers (∼15 strokes). The cell homogenates were spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). 80 μg (5–10 μg for the H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit Western blots) of parietal cell lysates were mixed with 5× electrophoresis buffer (for 5 ml: 2.5 ml of glycerol, 1.25 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 g of SDS, 1.043 ml of 1.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, and 1.25 mg of bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min (except for the H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit Western blots, in which the samples were not boiled), and loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels that were run at 200 volts for 1 h. The gels were transferred on an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in 25 mm Tris, 150 mmglycine, and 20% methanol. After transfer the membranes were blocked in 10 ml of TBST (20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween) and 5% dry milk for 1 h and then incubated for 16–18 h at 4 °C in 10 ml of TBST and 5% dry milk containing either a specific anti-phospho-Akt antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated serine 473 of Akt, or an anti-phospho-AFX antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated serine 193 of the transcription factor AFX (1:1000). Control blots were performed using antibodies recognizing all isoforms of Akt kinase independent of their phosphorylation states (1:1000) (New England Biolabs). For the H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit Western blots the membranes were incubated for 16–18 h at 4 °C in TBST and 5% dry milk containing a specific mouse monoclonal antibody against the hog H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit (26Takeuchi Y. Pausawasdi N. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1484-G1492PubMed Google Scholar) antibody (1:5000). In some experiments the membranes were incubated for 16–18 h at 4 °C in 10 ml of TBST and 5% dry milk, containing 20 μg of a monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For the GSK3 phospho-blots, the membranes were incubated for 16–18 h at 4 °C in 10 ml of TBST and 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) containing a monoclonal anti-phospho-GSK3α/β antibody (1:1000) that recognizes phosphorylated serine 21 of GSK3α and phosphorylated serine 9 of GSK3β, (New England Biolabs). At the end of the incubation periods the membranes were washed in TBST for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h in TBST and 5% dry milk containing either protein A directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:2500) for the Akt and the AFX blots or an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) for the GSK3, actin, and H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit blots. The membranes were washed in TBST for 30 min at room temperature and then exposed to the Amersham ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the recombinant adenoviruses were amplified as described previously using 293 cells (20Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). The viruses were subsequently concentrated and purified on a cesium chloride gradient (20Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the recombinant adenoviruses was assessed on the basis of the absorbency at 260 nm and on a limiting dilution plaque assay (20Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). The parietal cells were transduced with the adenoviral vectors expressing HA-tagged dominant negative Akt, HA-tagged Myr-Akt, or HA-tagged wt-Akt or with the adenoviral vectors expressing the β-galactosidase enzyme and cultured on slides for 16–18 h. At the end of the incubation period the cells were fixed in 4% formalin-PBS. The slides were blocked for 30 min with 20% donkey serum and incubated for 2 h with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:500) (Babco Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA). The cells were then rinsed with PBS, and a 1:150 dilution of a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added for 1 h. After a wash with PBS, the cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In some experiments the parietal cells were incubated with the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody without the primary antibodies. The percentage of parietal cells expressing the HA-tagged virally expressed Akt proteins was calculated by examining both the differential interference contrast and the immunofluorescence images of transduced parietal cells in three fields of each slide. After either stimulation with carbachol or transduction with the adenoviral vectors, the parietal cells were fixed by treatment with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After a PBS wash, the cells were permeabilized by incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and blocked with three sequential 5-min incubations in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100. Actin was detected by incubation of the cells for 20 min in fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 1% bovine serum albumin with PBS at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, the parietal cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In control experiments the cells were incubated with PBS without fluorescein phalloidin. For identification of parietal cells transduced with the adenoviral vector expressing β-galactosidase, the cells were cultured on slides for 16–18 h and stained with X-gal after 24 h of infection. The cells were washed with PBS and then fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After two washes with 1 mmMgCl2 in PBS, the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a solution consisting of 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, and 2 mmMgCl2 in PBS with 0.1% X-gal. At the end of the incubation, the cells were rinsed with PBS and observed with a light transmission microscope. Gastric acid secretion was measured according to methods described previously (2Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. J. B.

Briefly, the accumulation of the weak base [14C]aminopyrine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as an indicator of acid production by parietal cells. Both infected and noninfected cultured parietal cells were washed once with Earle's balanced salt solution, incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]aminopyrine for 60 min, and then stimulated, when indicated, with carbachol (10−4m) for the last 30 min of aminopyrine incubation. In some experiments, the cells were cultured for 16–18 h in the presence of EGF (10−8m) either alone or in combination with LY294002 (10−5m), prior to the addition of carbachol. The parietal cells were lysed with 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity of lysate was qu"

Sos proteins are ubiquitously expressed and are activated in response to cell-surface tyrosine kinase stimulation. In contrast, Ras-GRF proteins are expressed primarily in central nervous system neurons and are activated by calcium/calmodulin binding and by phosphorylation. Although both Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 activate the Ras proteins Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and Ki-Ras, only Ras-GRF1 also activates the functionally distinct R-Ras GTPase. In this study, we determined which amino acid sequences in these exchange factors and their target GTPases are responsible for this signaling specificity difference. Analysis of chimeras and individual amino acid exchanges between Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 revealed that the critical amino acids reside within an 11-amino acid segment of their catalytic domains between the second and third structurally conserved regions (amino acids (aa) 828–838 in Sos1 and 1057–1067 in Ras-GRF1) of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. In Sos1, this segment is in helix B, which is known to interact with the switch 2 region of Ha-Ras. Interestingly, a similar analysis of Ha-Ras and R-Ras chimeras did not identify the switch 2 region of Ha-Ras as encoding specificity. Instead, we found a more distal protein segment, helix 3 (aa 91–103 in Ha-Ras and 117–129 in R-Ras), which interacts instead primarily with helix K (aa 1002–1016) of Sos1. These findings suggest that specificity derives from the fact that R-Ras-specific amino acids in the region analogous to Ha-Ras helix 3 prevent a functional interaction with Sos1 indirectly, possibly by preventing an appropriate association of its switch 2 region with helix B of Sos1. Although previous studies have shown that helix B of Sos1 and helix 3 of Ha-Ras are involved in promoting nucleotide exchange on Ras proteins, this study highlights the importance of these regions in establishing signaling specificity.

They become active in cells upon interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs).1 These GEFs promote the release of GDP from inactive GTPases, allowing their replacement with activating GTP. In the active state, the GTPases bind to and alter specific sets of “effector” molecules until the GTPases hydrolyze GTP back to GDP. This deactivating process is enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The Ras superfamily consists of the Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran families. The Ras family includes the Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, and N-Ras) and the TC21, R-Ras, M-Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb, Rin, Rad, Kir/Gem, Rit, and K-B-Ras proteins. These proteins are grouped because of their similar amino acid sequence, although their functions can differ quite significantly. This is because they can be activated by different upstream signals and affect different sets of downstream target proteins. Ras proteins have been the most extensively studied members of this subfamily. By activating at least three downstream signaling pathways mediated by Raf kinases, Ral-GEFs, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, Ras proteins have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including enhancement of cell proliferation, differentiation, and multiple functions associated with fully differentiated cells (2Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 615-661PubMed Google Scholar). R-Ras is quite similar to Ras proteins (55% amino acid sequence identity) and can be activated by some GEFs that activate Ras, such as Ras-GRF1, and inactivated by Ras GTPase-activating proteins such as p120Ras-GAP (3Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20020-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). R-Ras even contains the same minimal effector domain that is responsible for binding downstream effector proteins; yet for reasons that are not understood, R-Ras displays biological properties that are distinct from those of Ras proteins. For example, unlike Ras, which activates all three downstream target proteins it binds to in cells, R-Ras activates only phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R-Ras is also a much weaker protein than Ras (5Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 6Self A.J. Caron E. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, R-Ras promotes inside-out integrin activation, whereas Ras proteins do not (7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E.

The catalytic domains of GEFs for Ras subfamily GTPases such as Ras, R-Ras, and Ral are all similar in amino acid sequence to the first Ras-GEF identified, yeast Cdc25. Thus, they are referred to as Cdc25 homology domains (11Feig L.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Most studies on Cdc25-like GEFs have investigated the Ras-activating Sos and Ras-GRF families. Sos1 and Sos2 are highly similar GEFs that contain Grb2-binding domains, allowing them to be activated by cell-surface tyrosine kinases (2Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 615-661PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1 (also referred to as Cdc25Mm) (13Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Zippel R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) are also highly similar GEFs that contain calmodulin-binding domains, allowing them to be activated by elevated calcium in cells (16Farnsworth C.L.

Genet. 1993; 14: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1 can also be activated by phosphorylation (18Kiyono M. Kato J. Kataoka T. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol.

Both families of GEFs also contain DH domains that allow them to activate Rac GTPases (21Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 22Fan W.-T. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr.

A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies on Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 have revealed important insights into the mechanism of GEF action. Kinetic studies on Ras-GRF1 have shown that GEF-stimulated nucleotide exchange involves the transient creation of a ternary Ras·nucleotide·GEF complex, followed by the formation of a stable binary Ras·GEF complex. Nucleotide (usually GTP because of its excess over GDP in cells) then binds to this binary complex, promoting the release of the GEF (24Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Structure/function studies based on mutagenesis have identified three regions of Ras that interact with GEFs: the switch 1 region (aa 25–40), the switch 2 region (aa 57–65), and α-helix 3 (aa 92–104) plus loop 7 (aa 105–109) (25–36). Recent crystallographic studies on a complex between Sos1 and Ha-Ras have revealed the overall structural design of Sos1, contact points with Ha-Ras, and important insights into the potential mechanism of GEF action (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The Sos1 structure is predominantly α-helical, with helices H and I interacting with switch 1 of Ha-Ras to open the nucleotide-binding site, allowing for exchange. Helices B, D, and G interact predominantly with switch 2 of Ha-Ras, and helix K with helix 3 of Ras apparently to stabilize GEF/Ras binding (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 38Hall B.E. Yang S.S. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Kuriyan J. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol.

Although each Cdc25-like GEF was originally thought to activate members of only one Ras subfamily, it is now appreciated that some GEFs can activate more than one. For example, although Sos1 stimulates classical Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and Ki-Ras) and the closely related M-Ras (3Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S.

C3G can also stimulate functionally distinct GTPases such as Rap, R-Ras, and TC21 (3Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol.

In this study, we focused our attention on the two Ras-activating GEFs Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 and the GTPases Ha-Ras and R-Ras. We investigated which amino acids are responsible for differences in signaling specificity and found them to reside in helix B of Sos1 (and the comparable region of Ras-GRF1) and helix 3 of Ras (and the comparable region of R-Ras). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% iron-enriched calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (40Gotoh T. Niino Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). pCAGGS-Sos and pCAGGS-GRF1 were described previously (40Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O.

The catalytic domains of Sos1 (aa 564–1049) and Ras-GRF1 (aa 798–1244) were subcloned into pEBG by polymerase chain reaction using SpeI and ClaI as cloning sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Plasmids pEBG-Ha-Ras and pEBG-R-Ras were described previously (40Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All chimeras and point mutations were generated by overlap polymerase chain reaction (41Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). For Ras constructs, BamHI and NotI were used as cloning sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. All constructs were sequenced to verify correct nucleotide alterations. Sos1, Ras-GRF1, and mutants of both were assayed for guanine nucleotide exchange activity by their ability to activate Ha-Ras, R-Ras, or mutants of both in cells by methods used previously (16Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 40Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M.

Briefly, epitope-tagged GEFs and GST fusions of GTPases were cotransfected into 293 cells; and 48 h later, the cells were metabolically labeled with 32PO4 (0.25 mCi/ml) for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100; GTPases were isolated from cell extracts with glutathione-agarose; and then the nucleotide bound to GTPases was quantified by thin-layer chromatography, followed by PhosphorImager analysis. The expression levels of various GEFs and GTPases were quantified by running cell extracts on 10% SDS gels, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to GST. To analyze the basis for signaling specificity differences between Sos1 and Ras-GRF1, we used a previously described in vivo assay for Ras-GEF activity that involves measurement of the ability of a transfected GEF to promote the active GTP-bound state of a cotransfected GTPase. In particular, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with a GST fusion construct of a GTPase either alone or together with a GEF. Cells were then metabolically labeled with32PO4; and 4 h later, the GST-GTPase construct was isolated from cell extracts using glutathione-agarose beads. The proportion of 32P-labeled GTP to GDP + GTP bound to the GTPase was determined after separating bound nucleotides by thin-layer chromatography. As expected, Ras-GRF1 expression increased the proportion of GTP bound to both Ha-Ras and R-Ras, whereas Sos1 expression increased the proportion of GTP bound to Ha-Ras, but not R-Ras (Fig. 1 A). We have recently shown that Ras-GRF2 is similar to Sos1 in that it can activate Ha-Ras (but not R-Ras) in cells (42Gotoh T. Tian X. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38029-38035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that this was due to the geranylgeranyl post-translational modification present in R-Ras since its replacement with farnasyl or the prevention of all post-translational modification restored Ras-GRF2 activity against R-Ras. Thus, to determine whether lipid modification of GTPases influences Sos1 function, we used Ha-Ras and R-Ras mutated in their C termini (CAAX to SAAX, where Ais aliphatic amino acid) to prevent their post-translational prenylation. In contrast to Ras-GRF2, Sos1 still failed to activate R-Ras under these conditions (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies assaying GEF activity in vitro showed that the signaling specificity difference between Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 is encoded in the catalytic domains of the two proteins, which span ∼500 amino acids near their C termini (40Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We confirmed these findings using the in vivo assay described above. Transfection of these fragments of Sos1 (aa 564–1049) and Ras-GRF1 (aa 798–1244) into 293 cells showed that the catalytic domain of Ras-GRF1 activated Ha-Ras and R-Ras, whereas the catalytic domain of Sos1 activated only Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 C). We then localized the specificity region more precisely by assaying a set of chimeras between portions of the catalytic domains of Sos1 and Ras-GRF1. Recent structural analysis has revealed that the catalytic domain of Sos1 consists of two distinct α-helical domains (see Fig. 2 A) (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (aa 568–741) containing α-helices 1–6 does not interact directly with Ras, but appears to contribute to the structural integrity of the catalytic segment of Sos1. The C-terminal domain (aa 752–1044) is made up of helices A–K and contains all of the regions that interact with Ras. Although the structure of Ras-GRF1 has not been solved, it is assumed to have a similar overall structure (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we generated a series of chimeras that encoded various amounts of the N-terminal segment of the catalytic domain of Sos1 and various amounts of the C-terminal segment of the catalytic domain of Ras-GRF1 (Fig. 2 A). These genes were then transfected into 293 cells along with either Ha-Ras or R-Ras to test their GEF specificity as described for Fig. 1. Chimera S-A-G, which encoded all of the N-terminal domain containing helices 1–6 from Sos1 plus half of helix A (aa 546–790 in Sos1) and the C-terminal domain of Ras-GRF1 containing the second half of helix A plus helices B–K (aa 1021–1244 in Ras-GRF1) promoted nucleotide exchange in both Ha-Ras and R-Ras (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the ability to activate R-Ras derives from the C-terminal segment of Ras-GRF1. Chimera S-D-G, which encoded the N-terminal domain plus helices A–C from Sos1 (aa 546–869) and the remaining helices of the C-terminal domain from Ras-GRF1 (aa 1099–1244), retained the ability to activate Ha-Ras, but lost the ability to activate R-Ras (Fig. 2 B). A similar result was obtained with chimera S-H-G, which contained the N-terminal domain plus helices A–G from Sos1 (aa 546–923) and the remaining helices from Ras-GRF1 (aa 1155–1244). These results, together with those obtained with chimera S-A-G, imply that signaling specificity resides within the segment encompassing helices A–C of the C-terminal domain. To further define the key segment, additional chimeras were generated and assayed (Fig. 3, A andB). Chimera S-AB-G, which contained helices 1–6 plus helix A from Sos1 (aa 546–818) and helices B–K from Ras-GRF1(aa 1048–1244) activated both Ha-Ras and R-Ras (Fig. 3, A andB). Thus, helix A is not involved in specificity. If we included helix B (chimera S-835-G) or helix B plus additional segments from Sos1 (chimeras S842-G, S-852-G, and S-861-G), not only was R-Ras activity lost, but Ha-Ras activity was lost as well (Fig. 3 B). This was despite the fact that the mutants were expressed in cells at levels comparable to those of the functional proteins (Fig. 3 C). When we attempted to retain just helix B of Ras-GRF1 in the context of the rest of Sos1, the chimeric protein was not expressed (data not shown). Although this last set of chimeras lost more than just activity against R-Ras, they suggested that helix B was critical for R-Ras signaling activity. These results and those from the chimeras described for Fig. 2 suggest that the specificity region is localized within a 52-amino acid segment between amino acids 818 and 869 in Sos1 (aa 1047 and 1098 in Ras-GRF1) containing helices B and C. This hypothesis was confirmed by chimera S-AB-D-S, which was all Sos1 except for these 52 amino acids of Ras-GRF1 inserted in place of analogous Sos1 amino acids. It behaved like Ras-GRF1 and activated both Ha-Ras and R-Ras (Fig. 3, A and B). These 52 amino acids in Sos1 and comparable ones in Ras-GRF1 are shown in Fig. 4. In an attempt to determine which amino acids within this region are most important for exchange activity against R-Ras, Sos1 amino acids were used to replace Ras-GRF1 residues at sites where divergence was most significant. The Ras-GRF1 mutants were then screened for loss of R-Ras reactivity, but retention of Ha-Ras reactivity. Eight different substitutions were made with amino acids from Sos1 distal to helix B where direct contacts between Sos1 and Ha-Ras are not made (Sos1 numbering R841E/N842T, E844N, S846E/A847E, A849V, W855I, A857E, D860Q, and C864E). None of these mutations significantly influenced the ability of Ras-GRF1 to activate R-Ras or Ha-Ras (data not shown), and neither did mutations in the N terminus of helix B. These mutations included Y820N, in which the asparagine in Sos1 is not directly involved with Ras binding. They also included the double mutant T824M/T825I, in which both methionine and isoleucine in Sos1 directly contact Ha-Ras amino acids. The properties of this last mutant suggest that unlike the comparable Sos1 amino acids Met824 and Ile825, Thr1053 and Thr1054 of Ras-GRF1 do not play a critical role in Ha-Ras binding because they are quite distinct from the Sos1 amino acids and yet changing them to Sos1 amino acids did not disrupt GEF activity. In contrast, many changes made in the C-terminal end of helix B (F828T/N829T, N833L/L834W/I835F, and A836E/S837K/E838C) had drastic effects on Ras-GRF1 activity such that the mutants no longer activated either R-Ras or Ha-Ras (data not shown), All three of these mutations included amino acids that participate in the binding between Sos1 and Ha-Ras (Fig. 4) (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Thus, key amino acids involved in R-Ras activation by Ras-GRF1 reside at the end of helix B; however, these sequences also appear to be involved in Ha-Ras activation. The fact that these Sos1 sequences could not substitute for Ras-GRF1 sequences adds additional evidence supporting the notion that these GEFs interact differently with target GTPases. Overall, the data indicate that the key residues endowing Ras-GRF1 with the ability to activate R-Ras and to prevent Sos1 from activating R-Ras reside in amino acids 1057–1067 of Ras-GRF1 and amino acids 828–838 of Sos1. Characterization of chimeras between Ha-Ras and R-Ras was used to identify key residues of the GTPases that generate differential responses to Ras-GRF1 and Sos1. Sos1 interacts with multiple surfaces of Ras, including the phosphate-binding P-loop (aa 10–17), switch 1 (aa 25–40), switch 2 (aa 57–75), and helix 3/loop 7 (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The initial chimera generated encoded the first 82 amino acids of R-Ras and the final 133 amino acids of Ha-Ras. This mutant (R-57-Ha-Ras), which contained a 26-amino acid N-terminal extension unique to R-Ras and the P-loop and switch 1 of R-Ras (aa 83 and aa 57 in Ha-Ras, respectively) joined to the switch 2 region and beyond of Ha-Ras, retained responsiveness to both Ras-GRF1 and Sos1. Thus, amino acid residues responsible for specific responses to GEFs reside in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein. In the next chimera (R-91-Ha-Ras), the contribution of R-Ras was extended to include the switch 2 region and additional amino acids up to R-Ras residue 116 followed by Ha-Ras sequence 91 and beyond. This chimera also responded to both Ras-GRF1 and Sos1, indicating that the key residues are more C-terminal than amino acid 116 of R-Ras (aa 91 of Ha-Ras). When the R-Ras contribution was extended to amino acid 129 such that Ha-Ras contributions started at Ha-Ras amino acid 104 in the next chimera (R-104-Ha-Ras), responsiveness to Ras-GRF1 was retained, but responsiveness to Sos1 was lost. Similar results were obtained with a chimera that included R-Ras residues 1–154 followed by Ha-Ras amino acids after aa 129 (R-129-Ha-Ras). These results suggest that the key residues are those residing between amino acids 117 and 129 of R-Ras (aa 91 and 103 of Ras). This idea was confirmed by the finding that substituting just amino acids 91–103 of Ha-Ras for the comparable amino acids 117–129 of R-Ras (R-91-H104-R-Ras) was sufficient to make R-Ras responsive to Sos1 (Fig. 5). Next, we attempted to exchange those residues that differ most in this 13-amino acid segment (Fig. 6 A). When His94 of Ha-Ras replaced Gly124 of R-Ras, partial responsiveness of R-Ras to Sos1 was obtained (Fig. 6 B). In addition, when Gly120 of R-Ras replaced His94 of Ha-Ras, responsiveness of Ha-Ras to Sos1 was partially inhibited. These findings confirm the importance of these amino acids for signaling specificity. When a similar approach was used to exchange other amino acids in this region, i.e.Lys125-Leu126 of R-Ras for Gln95-Tyr96 of Ha-Ras or Phe127-Thr128 of R-Ras for Arg97-Glu98 of Ha-Ras, basic interactions of the GTPases with nucleotides were severely altered, making GEF assays difficult to interpret. This study identified amino acids in both GEFs and GTPases that are responsible for the fact that Ras-GRF1 can activate Ha-Ras and the functionally distinct R-Ras, whereas Ras-GRF2 can activate only the former. We have been aided in designing experiments and interpreting results by the recent elegant studies revealing the crystal structure of Sos1 bound to Ha-Ras (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the structures of Ras-GRF1 and R-Ras have not been solved; however, it is likely that they have similar folds, and we have assumed as much for the purpose of discussion. Chimeras between Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 identified a 52-amino acid segment forming helices B and C in the catalytic domains of the GEFs as the key determinant of specificity. Merely replacing these amino acids in Sos1 with analogous Ras-GRF1 amino acids endowed Sos1 with the ability to activate R-Ras. Unfortunately, we could not do the converse experiment and show loss of R-Ras activity upon replacement of comparable Ras-GRF1 amino acids with Sos1 residues since the chimera produced lost all GEF activity. When we attempted to make chimeras with smaller regions of Sos1 replaced by analogous regions of Ras-GRF1, we again produced proteins that lost all GEF activity. However, we could exchange a variety of single and double amino acids from all regions of helix C of Sos1 into Ras-GRF1 without affecting activity against Ha-Ras or R-Ras, suggesting that helix B (not helix C) is most important. That helix B plays a role in GEF signaling specificity is consistent with previous observations. First, structural studies have shown that amino acids within helix B of Sos1 participate in the interaction with Ha-Ras (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been observed previously that the Cdc25 family of GEF domains, which are responsible for activating Ras subfamily GTPases such as Ras, Rap, and Ral, contains four highly conserved regions (structurally conserved regions) (43Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). As would be expected for amino acids that generate specificity among these Cdc25 family members, helix B is not part of the structurally conserved regions and is not highly conserved among GEFs with different target GTPase specificity (see Fig. 4). Within helix B, we exchanged N-terminal amino acids that differ between Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 with little effect. These included Sos1 residues that do not make direct contact with Ha-Ras, such as Leu821 and Leu822, but also those that do, such as Met824and Ile825. Results with the latter two mutants suggest that Sos1 and Ras-GRF1 function differently because the comparable Ras-GRF1 amino acids (Thr1051 and Thr1052) are significantly distinct from their Sos1 counterparts. Moreover, replacing them with Sos1 amino acids did not alter Ras-GRF1 activity. In contrast, replacing Ras-GRF1 amino acids with Sos1 amino acids from the C-terminal end of helix B blocked Ras-GRF1 activity for R-Ras. However, these changes also blocked Ras-GRF1 activity for Ha-Ras. These substitutions involved Thr828, Thr829, Leu833, and Glu836, all of which are known to make direct contacts with Ha-Ras. These findings localized the specificity region to an 11-amino acid stretch in helix B from Thr828 to Cys838 of Sos1 and from Phe1055 to Glu1065 of Ras-GRF1. The fact that Ras-GRF1 lost both R-Ras and Ha-Ras activities when Ras-GRF1 amino acids were replaced with Sos1 amino acids shows that it is difficult to dissociate basic GEF activity from target specificity. This observation adds to the argument that Ras-GRF1 and Sos1 use somewhat different mechanisms to promote guanine nucleotide exchange on Ha-Ras. A similar conclusion was reached recently in mutagenic studies of GTPases that investigated the basis for signaling specificity differences between Ras-GRF1 (Cdc25Mm) and Rap-GEF C3G (44van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Ras-GRP (45Nielsen K.H. Gredsted L. Broach J.R. Willumsen B.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Helix B of Sos1 does not directly promote nucleotide release from Ha-Ras. Instead, it stabilizes Sos1/Ha-Ras interactions primarily by forming part of the interface with the switch 2 region of Ha-Ras (Fig. 7) (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 38Hall B.E. Yang S.S. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Kuriyan J. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27629-27637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that the reason Sos1 can activate Ha-Ras (but not R-Ras) is that helix B of Sos1 can participate in binding to the switch 2 region of Ha-Ras, but not to the comparable amino acids in R-Ras. Since we found that replacement of helices B and C of Sos1 with helices B and C of Ras-GRF1 generated Sos1 activity against R-Ras, helix B of Ras-GRF1 can likely form a productive interaction with the switch 2 region regardless of whether it is part of Ha-Ras or R-Ras. It is not obvious, however, how Sos1 can distinguish between the switch 2 regions of Ha-Ras and R-Ras because they are quite similar. In fact, previous work has shown that exchanging the one pair of differing amino acids in Ha-Ras and TC21 (which also does not respond to Sos1) has no effect on signaling specificity (3Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20020-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the present study, chimeras of Ha-Ras and R-Ras that exchanged switch 2 regions had no effect on responsiveness to GEFs. Instead, these chimeras identified a 13-amino acid region (aa 91–103 in Ha-Ras) distal to switch 2, which constitutes helix 3 of Ha-Ras, as the key element for specificity. Merely replacing analogous amino acids in R-Ras with these 13 Ha-Ras amino acids allowed Sos1 to activate R-Ras. In addition, swapping a histidine from Ha-Ras for a glycine normally found in R-Ras at a site inside this region generated some responsiveness of R-Ras to Sos1, and swapping a glycine from R-Ras for a histidine normally found in Ha-Ras suppressed responsiveness of Ha-Ras to Sos1. These results are consistent with the fact that helix 3 has already been shown by mutagenesis studies to be involved in GEF binding (25Willumsen B.M. Papageorge A.G. Kung H. Bekesi E. Robins T. Johnsen M. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Segal M. Willumsen B.M. Levitzky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5564-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Leonardsen L. DeClue J.E. Lybaek H. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2177-2187PubMed Google Scholar). However, helix 3 of Ha-Ras does not bind to helix B of Sos1. Instead, it associates with helix K (aa 1002–1016) and a region just distal to helix D (aa 880–881) (Fig. 7) (37Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In addition, changing helix K or sequences distal to helix D of Sos1 to comparable amino acids found in Ras-GRF1 had no effect on signaling specificity. The fact that signaling specificity can be changed by altering regions in GTPases (helix 3) and GEFs (helix B) that do not directly interact with each other suggests that they influence each other indirectly. Given that neither the structures of Ras-GRF1 and R-Ras nor a complex of these proteins is available to compare with those of Ha-Ras and Sos1, it is clearly difficult to make firm conclusions about the mechanisms underlying these observations. Nevertheless, it is possible to speculate based on existing information. For example, the crystal structure of Ras and the Sos1·Ha-Ras complex reveals that helix 3 of Ha-Ras is in close proximity to switch 2 of Ha-Ras; and in particular, Val103 of helix 3 interacts with Asp69 of switch 2 (see Fig. 7). Since switch 2 of Ha-Ras binds to helix B of Sos1, switch 2 could be the intermediate that connects helix 3 of Ha-Ras with helix B of Sos1. A more indirect model involves helix K of Sos1 since it binds to helix 3 of Ras and is also in close proximity to helix B of Sos1 (Fig. 7). Obviously, a definitive explanation must await structural analysis of Ras-GRF1 complexes with Ha-Ras and R-Ras. The discovery that helix B of Sos1 determines specificity among Ras-GEFs for activating Ha-Ras and R-Ras is striking in light of results from our recent experiments investigating the basis for signaling specificity differences between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2. We recently showed that although Ras-GRF1 can activate Ha-Ras and R-Ras in cells, Ras-GRF2 (like Sos1) can activate only Ha-Ras (42Gotoh T. Tian X. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38029-38035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unlike Sos1, however, Ras-GRF2 has the catalytic potential to activate R-Ras, but it is suppressed by the geranylgeranyl modification found in R-Ras. Interestingly, we found that the segment in Ras-GRF2 that prevents it from activating processed R-Ras is just distal to the region in helix B found here that prevents Sos1 from activating either processed or unprocessed R-Ras. Apparently, this region in both Sos1 and Ras-GRF exchange factors is particularly important for generating signaling specificity between Ha-Ras and R-Ras GTPases. Other Ras-GEFs such as CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG-GEFIII (Ras-GRP) also activate R-Ras in addition to the Ras proteins. Furthermore, TC21 is a Ras relative that responds to GEFs in a manner similar to that of R-Ras such that it is responsive to Ras-GRF1, but not to Sos1 (3Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20020-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether the functions ascribed here for helix 3 of the GTPases and helix B of the GEFs apply to these related signaling molecules. A recent study using mutant analysis of the GTPases investigated why Ha-Ras responds to Ras-GRF1 (also called Cdc25Mm), whereas Rap1A responds to C3G (44van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By exchanging specific amino acids that differ between Ha-Ras and Rap1A, this study provided some evidence for a role for switch 2 in specificity. These findings differ from those described here, where swapping switch 2 of Ha-Ras into R-Ras was not necessary to generate Sos1 responsiveness. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions in helix 3 of Ha-Ras and Rap1A did not affect signaling specificity. In contrast, Rap2A, which normally does not respond to C3G, could be induced to do so by replacing amino acids just distal to helix 3 with Rap1A sequences (44van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overall, the present study and those reported previously indicate that although the interactions between the Ras family of GTPases and their cognate GEFs share many basic features, distinct interactions exist to generate signaling specificity. For Ras-GRF1 and Sos1, the unique features involve helix B, whereas for Ha-Ras and R-Ras, they involve helix 3. R-Ras and Ras proteins have different activities in cells. For example, of the three downstream target proteins known to be activated by Ha-Ras, only phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is activated by R-Ras (4Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, R-Ras displays weaker oncogenic activity than Ras (5Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 6Self A.J. Caron E. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, it can promote inside-out integrin activation, whereas Ras cannot (7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E.

Understanding the mechanisms used by Ras-GRF1 to activate Ras and R-Ras proteins will be important to explain fully Ras-GRF1 function in neurons, where Ras and R-Ras proteins likely play unique but complementary functions.

These three-dimensional structures not only established the location of the redox centers, transmembrane helices, and inhibitor binding sites, but also showed an unexpected dimeric structural arrangement of this complex in the crystal (2Xia D., Yu, C.A.

The two ISPs from the two monomers are intertwined; the head domain of ISP in one monomer is close to the cytochromeb and cytochrome c 1 in the other monomer. The molecule of ISP can be divided into three domains: head, tail, and neck, with the 2Fe-2S cluster located at the tip of the head (6Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assmann C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In tetragonal I4122 crystals of native oxidized bovine cytochrome bc 1complex, the 2Fe-2S cluster in one monomer is 27 Å from hemeb L of the other monomer and 40 Å from the heme bL of the same monomer (2Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This structural arrangement suggests that mitochondrial bc 1 complex functions as a dimer, because the distance between the 2Fe-2S of ISP of one monomer and the low potential cytochrome b(b L) of the other monomer is less than that between these groups in the same monomer. The shorter distance accommodates fast electron transfer from QH2 to ISP andb L. However, a complex that exists as a dimer in the crystal might exist and function as a monomer in solution. Evidence for the cytochrome bc 1 complex functioning as a dimer or a monomer has been reported (8Von Jagow G. Schagger H. Riccio P. Klingenberg M. Kolb H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 462: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Nalecz M.J. Azzi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Musatov A. Robinson N.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to establish whether or not the structure of the dimeric cytochrome bc 1 complex observed in the crystal also exists in solution. One way to address this question is to generate a mutantbc 1 complex that forms two intersubunit disulfide bonds, one at the interface between the head domain of ISP and cytochrome b and the other at the proximity of the tail domain of ISP and cytochrome b. If the complex exists as a dimer with intertwining ISPs of the two monomers in solution, formation of these two intersubunit disulfide bonds should yield an adduct protein with an apparent molecular mass of 128 kDa containing two cytochrome b and two ISP proteins. If the complex exists as a dimer, but without intertwining of the two ISPs in the two monomers, or it exists as a monomer, formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds would yield an adduct protein with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa containing only one cytochrome b and one ISP. Because genetic manipulation of bovine heart mitochondria is not practical, Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a better system for studying structure-based functions of the bc 1complex by molecular genetics. The four-subunit R. sphaeroides bc 1 complex is functionally analogous to the mitochondrial complex; the largest three subunits (cytochromeb, cytochrome c 1, and ISP) are homologous to their mitochondrial counterparts, and this system is readily manipulated genetically. In addition, R. sphaeroidesexpressing (His)6-tagged cytochromebc 1 complex has been prepared previously (12Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This greatly facilitates the isolation of thebc 1 complex from wild type or mutant cells. Recently, our laboratory has used this bacterial system to provide evidence for movement of the head domain of ISP duringbc 1 catalysis (12Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Such movement was suggested by the three-dimensional structure of the mitochondrialbc 1 complex (2Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J.

Herein we report procedures for generating four double-cysteine-pairR. sphaeroides mutants with one pair at the interface between the head domain of ISP and cytochrome b and the other at the proximity between the tail domain of ISP and cytochromeb. Mutants with single cysteine and single-cysteine-pair substitutions at indicated positions were also generated and characterized to confirm that the generated double-cysteine-pair mutants are not at critical positions in the bc 1complex and, hence, are suitable for this study. The photosynthetic growth behavior, cytochrome bc 1 complex activity, SDS-PAGE patterns, and EPR characteristics of the 2Fe-2S cluster in purified complexes from wild type and mutant strains were examined and compared, as were the thermotropic properties. Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.N-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside andN-octyl-β-d-glucoside were from Anatrace. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gel and a Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit were from Qiagen. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinol (Q2H2) was prepared in our laboratory as previously reported (16Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4096-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites system from Promega. For generation of single-cysteine-pair substitutions, the single-stranded pSELNB3503 (17Mather M.W., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used as the template for mutagenesis, and oligonucleotides used were as follows: K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb), GTCAAGTTCCTCGGCTGCCCGATCTTCATCCGCCGCCGCACCGAGGCCGACATCG/GCTGCTCGGCGGCCCGTGCGTGGACAATGCCA; P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), GGGGCCGCCGTCTGGTGCCTGATCAACCAAATG/AACGTGAACTGCGGCTTCATGCT; P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb), GGGGCCGCCGTCTGGTGCCTGATCAACCAAATG/AACGGCGGCTTCTGCCTGCGCTACCTGCATGC; L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb), GCCGTCTGGCCGTGCATCAACCAAATG/GTCACCGGCATCTGCCTTGCGATGCAT; and N36C(ISP)/G89C, TGGCCGCTGATCTGCCAAATGAATCCGTC/AACGTGAACTGCGGCTTCATGCT.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used to mobilize the pRKDfbcFmBmCHQ plasmid in Escherichia coli S17-1 cells into R. sphaeroides BC17 cells. The presence of engineered mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing before and after photosynthetic or semi-aerobic growth of the cells as previously reported (17Mather M.W., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis were performed by the Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility at Oklahoma State University. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Photosynthetic growth conditions for R. sphaeroides were essentially as described previously (14Xiao K., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38597-38604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The concentrations of antibiotics used were: ampicillin, 125 μg/ml; kanamycin sulfate, 30 μg/ml; tetracycline (10 μg/ml for E. coli and 1 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides); trimethoprim (100 μg/ml for E. coli and 30 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides). Chromatophores were prepared as described previously (12Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The (His)6-tagged cytochrome bc 1 complexes were purified from chromatophores as previously reported (12Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To assay ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity, chromatophores, or purified cytochrome bc 1 complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01%N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside to a final concentration of cytochrome b of 5 μm. 5 μl of the diluted samples was added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 300 μm EDTA, 100 μm cytochromec, and 25 μm Q2H2. Activities were determined by measuring the reduction of cytochromec (the increase of the absorbance at wavelength 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 for calculation. The nonenzymatic oxidation of Q2H2, determined under the same conditions, in the absence of enzyme, was subtracted during specific activity calculations. Calorimetric measurements were performed with a CSC 6100 NanoII DSC. All reference and sample solutions were degassed prior to use. A 0.33-mlbc 1 solution, 2 mg/ml, in 50 mmK+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl and 0.5% octylglucoside, was placed in the sample capillary cell, and the same amount of buffer was placed in the reference capillary cell. The scanning rate was 1 °C/min for both heating and cooling. All thermodynamic analyses were carried out according to the program known as CpCalc from the Nano DSC program group. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b (19Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and cytochromec 1 (20Yu L. Dong J.H. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) contents were determined according to published methods. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean dual slab vertical cell. Samples were digested with 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, and 3% glycerol in the presence and absence of 0.4% β-ME for 2 h at 37 °C before being subjected to electrophoresis. EPR spectra were recorded in a Bruker ER 200D apparatus equipped with a liquid Nitrogen Dewar flask, at 77 K. The instrument settings are detailed in the figure legends. FourR. sphaeroides mutants carrying double-cysteine-pair substitutions, one pair in the interface between the head domain of ISP and cytochrome b and the other pair in the close proximity between the tail domain of ISP and cytochrome b, were generated for this study. They are: K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb), K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb), and K70C(ISP)/A185C (cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb). All of these double-cysteine-pair mutants contain the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb) substitution, which was selected for cross-linking the head domain of ISP and cytochrome b. This selection is based on our previous finding (14Xiao K., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38597-38604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that the cysteine-pair, of Lys-70 of ISP and Ala-185 of cytochrome b, forms a spontaneous intersubunit disulfide bond between the head domain of ISP and cytochromeb in the bc 1 complex. Other cysteine-pair substitutions: P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb), L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb), and N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), were selected for possible cross-linking of the tail domain of ISP with cytochrome b, based on the three-dimensional structural model of the four-subunit cytochrome bc 1 complex of R. sphaeroides (Fig. 1) constructed with coordinates from the bovine cytochromebc 1 complex (22Tso S.-C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15287-15294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The distances between these four cysteine pairs are 3.4, 6.2, 6.5, and 4.9 Å, respectively, in the bacterial complex. They are 4.5, 6.3, 6.5, and 6.8 Å, when calculations are based on corresponding residues in the bovine enzyme (Table I). Mutants with a single-cysteine substitution, at positions Pro-33 (ISP), Leu-34 (ISP), Asn-36 (ISP), Lys-70 (ISP), Val-64 (cytb), Gly-89 (cytb), Met-92 (cytb), and Ala-185 (cytb), and with single-cysteine-pair substitution, at positions Lys-70 (ISP)/Ala-185 (cytb), Pro-33 (ISP)/Gly-89 (cytb), Pro-33 (ISP)/Met-92 (cytb), Leu-34 (ISP)/Val-64 (cytb), and Asn-36 (ISP)/Gly-89 (cytb), were also generated and used as controls (see Table I).Table ICharacterization of ISP and cytochrome b interface cysteine mutantsMutantsSingle mutationDouble mutant residues distance1-aThe distances were measured from Cβ to Cβ (except for glycine, which is to Cα).Ps1-bPs, photosynthetic growth. ++, cell growth rate is essentially the same as that of the wild type cells; +, cells grow photosynthetically but at a rate slower than that of the wild type; −, no photosynthetic growth in 4 days.Enzymatic activity1-cEnzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochromeb at room temperature.Corresponding residues in bovineLocationIn bovine structureIn bacterial modelingChromatophorePurified complex1-dThe cytochromebc 1 complex was in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm histidine, and 0.5% octylglucoside.ÅWild type++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)K70C(ISP)Lys-95Head++1.3 (57%)1.4 (56%)A185C(cyth)Ser-169cd2++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)6.56.1++1.3 (57%)0.3 (12%)1-eThe cytochromebc 1 complex activity was measured immediately after preparation.P33C(ISP)Gln-57Tail++1.3 (57%)1.4 (56%)G89C(cytb)Tyr-75ab loop++2.4 (100%)2.4 (96%)P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)4.53.4++1.3 (57%)1.4 (56%)K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)· P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)6.5·4.56.1·3.4+0.4 (17%)0.1 (4%)1-eThe cytochromebc 1 complex activity was measured immediately after preparation.M92C(cytb)Ile-78Helex B++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb)6.36.2++1.9 (83%)2.0 (80%)K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)· P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb)6.5·6.36.1·6.2−L34C(ISP)Phe-58Tail++1.6 (70%)1.7 (68%)V64C(cytb)Phe-50Helix A++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb)6.56.5++1.4 (61%)1.6 (64%)K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)· L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb)6.5·6.56.1·6.5−N36C(ISP)Ser-60Tail++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)6.84.9++2.2 (96%)2.5 (100%)K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)· N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)6.5·6.86.1·4.9++0.5 (22%)0.1 (4%)1-eThe cytochromebc 1 complex activity was measured immediately after preparation.1-a The distances were measured from Cβ to Cβ (except for glycine, which is to Cα).1-b Ps, photosynthetic growth. ++, cell growth rate is essentially the same as that of the wild type cells; +, cells grow photosynthetically but at a rate slower than that of the wild type; −, no photosynthetic growth in 4 days.1-c Enzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochromeb at room temperature.1-d The cytochromebc 1 complex was in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm histidine, and 0.5% octylglucoside.1-e The cytochromebc 1 complex activity was measured immediately after preparation. Open table in a new tab For double-cysteine-pair mutants to be useful in this study, the resulting mutant bc 1 complexes must be active. Because the bc 1 complex is absolutely required for the photosynthetic growth of R. sphaeroides, whether or not the engineered cysteine positions result in inactivebc 1 complexes can be determined by assaying photosynthetic growth. Mutants with cysteine substitutions at critical positions in the complex will not grow photosynthetically; mutants with substitutions at noncritical positions will grow. When mid-log phase, aerobically dark grown wild type and mutant cells were inoculated into enriched Sistrom's medium and subjected to anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions, all the single cysteine substitution mutants, all the single-cysteine-pair mutants, and the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) double-cysteine-pair mutant grew at rates comparable with that of wild type cells. The K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant grew at a retarded rate (30%), and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb) did not grow photosynthetically (Table I). The finding that the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/M92C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·L34C(ISP)/V64C(cytb) double-cysteine-pair mutants cannot grow photosynthetically is rather surprising, because mutants with single-cysteine substitutions or single-cysteine-pair substitutions at the respective positions of ISP and cytochromeb have the same photosynthetic growth rate as that of wild type cells. The inability of these two double-cysteine-pair mutants to support photosynthetic growth is not due to the formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds from engineered cysteines, because no disulfide bond formation is expected in the absence of oxygen. Perhaps introduction of an additional cysteine pair in these two double-cysteine-pair mutants changes the conformation of thebc 1 complex, causing inactivation. In any case, the failure of these two double-cysteine-pair mutants to support photosynthetic growth makes them unsuitable for this study. On the other hand, the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) support photosynthetic growth, indicating that the engineered cysteine pairs are not impairing the complex. Therefore, formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds between ISP and cytochrome b was examined in these two double-cysteine-pair mutants. Chromatophores freshly prepared from these two double-cysteine-pair mutants, and their respective single-cysteine pair mutants, K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb), P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), and N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), have, respectively, 17, 22, 57, 57, and 96% of the bc 1 activity found in wild type chromatophores (see Table I). When these chromatophore preparations were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies againstR. sphaeroides b and ISP, no protein band corresponding to the adduct of cytochrome b and ISP was observed, indicating that no disulfide bond is formed between the engineered cysteines during anaerobic photosynthetic growth. No disulfide bond formation is expected, because photosynthetic growth is under strict anaerobic conditions. Without oxygen no disulfide bond can be formed even if the two cysteines are in favorable positions. When the His6-tagged bc 1 complexes were purified from these five freshly prepared mutant chromatophores, the P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) single-cysteine-pair mutant complexes have the same activity as that found in their respective chromatophores, based on cytochrome b content (see Table I). Activities in these two single-cysteine-pair mutant complexes remained unchanged during storage at 0 °C. On the other hand, the single-cysteine-pair mutant complex of K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb) and double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes of K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) have about 20% of thebc 1 activity found in their respective chromatophores (Table I). Activities in these three mutant complexes decreased during storage at 0 °C. Almost no activity remained after 30 h. Under identical conditions, no activity loss was observed for the wild type complex. When these purified mutant complexes were treated with SDS at 37 °C for 2 h and subjected to electrophoresis in the absence of β-ME, an adduct protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa, the size of one cytochrome b and one ISP, was detected in the single-cysteine-pair mutant complexes. Meanwhile, an adduct protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 128 kDa, the size of two cytochrome b and two ISP, was detected in the double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes (see Fig.2). The 64-kDa protein band is an adduct of one cytochrome b and one ISP, and the 128-kDa protein band is an adduct of two cytochromeb and two ISP. These two adduct proteins result from the formation of one and two disulfide bonds between cytochromeb and ISP in the single- and double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes, respectively. Experimental results supporting this conclusion are as follows: first, the appearance of the 64- or 128-kDa protein band is accompanied by a decrease in the band intensities of cytochrome b and ISP (see Fig. 2); second, the 64- and 128-kDa protein bands react with antibodies against cytochromeb and ISP; third, when these mutant complexes were treated with SDS and β-ME and then subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of β-ME, the 64- and 128-kDa protein bands disappear, and the band intensities of cytochrome b and ISP increase; and fourth, protein isolated from the 64- and 128-kDa gel slice, after treatment with β-ME, can be resolved into cytochrome b and ISP. Formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds, one between the tail domain of ISP and one cytochrome b and the other between the head domain of the same ISP and other cytochromeb, in double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes of K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) yields an adduct protein with an apparent molecular mass of 128 kDa, containing two cytochrome b and two ISP. Therefore, the cytochromebc 1 complex must exist as a dimer with intertwining ISPs, in solution. This structural arrangement must be similar to that observed in the crystal state. The loss of activity in double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes of K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C (ISP)/G89C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) is apparently due to the formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds between ISP and cytochrome b (see Table I and Fig. 2). It is important to know which of these two, or both, bonds are responsible for activity loss. Because the purified K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb) mutant complex lost the bc 1 activity, whereas the purified P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) or N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complexes had the same activity as that in their respective chromatophores (see Fig. 2and Table I), we conclude that the disulfide bond between cysteines K70C(ISP)/A185C(ISP), but not the one between cysteines P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) or N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), is responsible for the activity loss in these two double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes. This deduction is consistent with the recent finding that mobility of the ISP head is essential for the bc 1 complex (12Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1457: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cysteines at Lys-70 of ISP and Ala-185 of cytochrome b are between the head domain of ISP, where 2Fe-2S cluster resides, and cytochrome b. Formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between these two cysteines would render the ISP head immobile, causing a loss of activity. The cysteines at Pro-33 or Asn-36 of ISP and Gly-89 of cytochrome b are between the tail domain of ISP and cytochrome b. Formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond here has no effect on activity, suggesting that movement of the head domain of ISP, which is required for bc 1 catalysis, does not involve the tail domain. To further substantiate this deduction, the effect of β-ME onbc 1 activity and disulfide bond formation was examined in these two double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes and their respective single-cysteine-pair complexes. When purified K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/ A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complexes, which had little bc 1 activity, were treated with β-ME, the activities were restored to the same level as those in their respective chromatophores prepared in the presence or absence of β-ME (Table II). No adduct protein with an apparent molecular mass of 128 kDa containing two cytochromeb and two ISP subunits was detected in these β-ME-treated complexes (see Fig. 2). These results confirm that the loss of activity in these two mutant complexes results from the formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds between ISP and cytochromeb.Table IIEffect of β-ME on the cytochrome bc 1 activity in chromatophores and purified complexes from wild type, single- and double-cysteine pair mutantsMutantsEnzymatic activity2-aEnzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochrome b at room temperature.ChromatophorePurifiedbc 1 complex−2-b− samples prepared in the absence of β-ME.+2-c+ samples prepared with buffers containing 100 mm β-ME.−2-d− samples stored at 0 °C for 30 h after preparation.+2-e+ stored samples treated with 100 mm β-ME.Wild type2.32.32.52.5K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)1.31.30.11.4P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)1.31.31.40.8N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)2.22.22.51.5K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)0.40.400.4K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb)0.50.500.62-a Enzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochrome b at room temperature.2-b − samples prepared in the absence of β-ME.2-c + samples prepared with buffers containing 100 mm β-ME.2-d − samples stored at 0 °C for 30 h after preparation.2-e + stored samples treated with 100 mm β-ME. Open table in a new tab Activity restoration by β-ME was also observed with the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb) single-cysteine-pair mutant complex (Table II). This reactivation was accompanied by the disappearance of the 64-kDa ISP-cyt b adduct protein (Fig. 2). Thus disulfide bond formation between the head domain of ISP and cytochrome barrests the mobility of the ISP head, causing thebc 1 activity loss. When the N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complexes, which had the same activity as that in their respective chromatophores and showed the 64-kDa ISP-cytb adduct protein, were treated with 100 mm β-ME, about 70% of thebc 1 activity was lost and the 64-kDa adduct protein disappeared. The loss of activity in these two β-ME-treated mutant complexes is rather surprising, because their respective mutant chromatophores, prepared in the absence and presence of β-ME, have the same bc 1 activity (Table II) and contain no intersubunit disulfide bond. Spectral analysis revealed that the β-ME-treated N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complexes had only 50% of the cytochrome b content found in their respective untreated complexes, indicating that β-ME causes the release of heme b from its apoprotein and, thus, the loss the activity. Under identical conditions no heme b release was observed in the wild type complex, double-cysteine-pair mutant complexes of K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C (cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), single-cysteine-pair mutant complex of K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb), and single-cysteine substitution mutant complexes of A185C(cytb), K70C(ISP), N36C(ISP), G89C(cytb), and P33C(ISP). Why cytochrome b in the N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and P33C(ISP)/G89C (cytb) mutant complexes is more labile toward β-ME treatment is unknown. Nevertheless, the effect of disulfide bond formation on bc 1activity in the N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complexes cannot be assessed by β-ME treatment. Although the loss ofbc 1 complex activity in K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) and K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) is attributed to the formation of the disulfide bond between cysteines K70C(ISP) and A185C(cytb), making the ISP head immobile, perhaps formation of two intersubunit disulfide bonds in these two complexes altered the microenvironment of ISP, thus leading to activity loss. To test this possibility, EPR characteristics of the 2Fe-2S in these two complexes, with and without β-ME treatment, were compared. It has been reported that the g x signal of the 2Fe-2S cluster of ISP in the cytochrome bc 1 complex depends on the environment (25McCurley J.P. Miki T., Yu, L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the quinone occupancy (25McCurley J.P. Miki T., Yu, L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the 2Fe-2S cluster in the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complex, with or without β-ME treatment, has the same EPR spectrum, with theg x signal at 1.77. An identical EPR spectrum was obtained for the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb)·P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complex (data not shown). These results indicate that the microenvironments of the ISP cluster in these two mutant complexes are not affected by the formation of two disulfide bonds. Therefore, the loss of bc 1 activity is not due to a change of microenvironment in ISP. The 2Fe-2S cluster in the N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) mutant complex has an EPR spectrum identical to that observed in the wild type complex with the g x at 1.80, suggesting that formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between the tail domain of ISP and cytochrome b has no effect on ISP. The 2Fe-2S in the K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb) mutant complex, with and without β-ME treatment, has the same EPR spectrum with a g xat 1.78 (see Fig. 3). This coupled with the fact that the 2Fe-2S cluster in the A185C(cytb) mutant complex has an EPR spectrum identical to that observed in the wild type complex with theg x at 1.80, whereas the 2Fe-2S in the K70C(ISP) mutant complex has a broadened g x signal that is shifted to 1.77, suggests that the shift of theg x signal of 2Fe-2S in the K70C(ISP)/ A185C(cytb)·N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) complex is due to replacing Lys-70 of ISP with cysteine. Differential scanning calorimetry has been widely used to study protein stability. The thermodenaturation temperature (T m) and the change of enthalpy (ΔH) are the two parameters used to assess this thermostability. Since the bc 1 complex purification involves detergents, and the amount and type of detergents used greatly affect the protein stability, for systematic comparison of protein stability, all bc 1 preparations used in these DSC studies were in 0.5% octylglucoside. When purified, wild type cytochrome bc 1 complex underwent thermodenaturation, it showed a T m at 37.8 °C and ΔH of 33.1 kcal/mol. Under identical conditions the mitochondrial bc 1 complex has aT m of 63.3 °C and ΔH of 749.3 kcal/mol (data not shown), indicating that the mitochondrialbc 1 complex is more stable than the bacterial complex. The presence of more supernumerary subunits in the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1 complex apparently contributes to the thermal stability of the complex. When single-cysteine-pair mutant complexes K70C(ISP)/A185C(cytb), P33C(ISP)/G89C(cytb), and N36C(ISP)/G89C(cytb) were subjected to thermodenaturation, all showed a T m of around 41 °C (an increase of about 3 °C) with an increased ΔH value. This indicates that formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond either between the head domain or tail domain of ISP and cytochrome b increases the structural stability of the complex. It should be noted that single-cysteine substitutions at positions Lys-70, Pro-33, or Asn-36 of ISP, or Ala-185 or Gly-89 of cytochrome b do not affect the stability of thebc 1 complex (data not shown). The increase inT m and ΔH in the double-cysteine mutant proteins must be a result of the formation of the disulfide bond. We thank Dr. Roger Koeppe for his critical review of this manuscript."
