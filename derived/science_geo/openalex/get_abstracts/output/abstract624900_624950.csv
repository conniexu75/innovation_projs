https://openalex.org/W2907084113,"Field studies have shown that plants growing next to herbivore-infested plants acquire higher resistance to herbivore damage. This increased resistance is partly due to regulation of plant gene expression by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by plants that sense environmental challenges such as herbivores. The molecular basis for VOC sensing in plants, however, is poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of TOPLESS-like proteins (TPLs) that have VOC-binding activity and are involved in VOC sensing in tobacco. While screening for volatiles that induce stress-responsive gene expression in tobacco BY-2 cells and tobacco plants, we found that some sesquiterpenes induce the expression of stress-responsive genes. These results provided evidence that plants sense these VOCs and motivated us to analyze the mechanisms underlying volatile sensing using tobacco as a model system. Using a pulldown assay with caryophyllene derivative–linked beads, we identified TPLs as transcriptional co-repressors that bind volatile caryophyllene analogs. Overexpression of TPLs in cultured BY-2 cells or tobacco leaves reduced caryophyllene-induced gene expression, indicating that TPLs are involved in the responses to caryophyllene analogs in tobacco. We propose that unlike animals, which use membrane receptors for sensing odorants, a transcriptional co-repressor plays a role in sensing and mediating VOC signals in plant cells.

https://openalex.org/W2908208634,"The field cancerization effect has been proposed to explain bladder cancer's multifocal and recurrent nature, yet the mechanisms of this effect remain unknown. In this work, using cell biology, flow cytometry, and qPCR analyses, along with a xenograft mouse tumor model, we show that chronic exposure to tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) results in the neoplastic transformation of nonmalignant human SV-HUC urothelial cells. Inhibition of EV uptake prevented this transformation. Transformed cells not only possessed several oncogenic properties, such as increased genome instability, loss of cell–cell contact inhibition, and invasiveness, but also displayed altered morphology and cell structures, such as an enlarged cytoplasm with disrupted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alignment and the accumulation of smaller mitochondria. Exposure of SV-HUC cells to TEVs provoked the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER). Prolonged induction of UPRER signaling activated the survival branch of the UPRER pathway, in which cells had elevated expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), NF-κB, and the inflammatory cytokine leptin, and incurred loss of the pro-apoptotic protein C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). More importantly, inhibition of ER stress by docosahexaenoic acid prevented TEV-induced transformation. We propose that TEVs promote malignant transformation of predisposed cells by inhibiting pro-apoptotic signals and activating tumor-promoting ER stress–induced unfolded protein response and inflammation. This study provides detailed insight into the mechanisms underlying the bladder cancer field effect and tumor recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2907810295,"G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are currently the target of more than 30% of the marketed medicines. However, there is an important medical need for ligands with improved pharmacological activities on validated drug targets. Moreover, most of these ligands remain poorly characterized, notably because of a lack of pharmacological tools. Thus, there is an important demand for innovative assays that can detect and drive the design of compounds with novel or improved pharmacological properties. In particular, a functional and screening-compatible GPCR–G protein interaction assay is still unavailable. Here, we report on a nanoluciferase-based complementation technique to detect ligands that promote a GPCR–G protein interaction. We demonstrate that our system can be used to profile compounds with regard to the G proteins they activate through a given GPCR. Furthermore, we established a proof of applicability of screening for distinct G proteins on dopamine receptor D2 whose differential coupling to Gαi/o family members has been extensively studied. In a D2–Gαi1 versus D2–Gαo screening, we retrieved five agonists that are currently being used in antiparkinsonian medications. We determined that in this assay, piribedil and pergolide are full agonists for the recruitment of Gαi1 but are partial agonists for Gαo, that the agonist activity of ropinirole is biased in favor of Gαi1 recruitment, and that the agonist activity of apomorphine is biased for Gαo. We propose that this newly developed assay could be used to develop molecules that selectively modulate a particular G protein pathway.

Given their successes in drug discovery, it is common sense to postulate that uncharacterized members hold great potential in terms of innovative therapeutic strategies (2Sriram K. Insel P.A.

In addition, there is still an unmet medical need in various diseases for drugs with improved properties such as increased potency, higher selectivity, or refined efficacy for existing validated drug targets. Thus, the drug discovery process would benefit from more sophisticated assays able to detect with maximal accuracy the ligands with a desired pharmacological profile.

GPCR signaling has been extensively studied and is notoriously complex. The current paradigm states that the binding of a ligand to its receptor stabilizes active conformations that in turn triggers through allosteric effects the formation of an active complex bound with intracellular partners (7Kenakin Biased signalling and allosteric machines: new vistas and challenges for drug discovery.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165 (22023017): 1659-166910.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01749.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the prime event following ligand binding is the interaction of the active receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins composed of α and βγ subunits (8Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Heterotrimeric G protein activation by G-protein-coupled receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18043707): 60-7110.1038/nrm2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). These elements dissociate upon activation, and each of them has the capacity to promote distinct signaling pathways (9Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Following G protein activation, the receptor undergoes desensitization and internalization through diverse processes involving phosphorylation by GPCR-specific kinases (GRK) and scaffolding by proteins such as arrestins (10Rajagopal S. Shenoy S.K. GPCR desensitization: acute and prolonged phases.Cell. Signal. 2018; 41 (28137506): 9-1610.1016/j.cellsig.2017.01.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In humans, the G protein family comprises 16 members that are classified according to the identity of their α subunits into four families (11Milligan G. Kostenis E. Heterotrimeric G-proteins: a short history.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147 (16402120): S46-S55Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The Gαs family (Gαslong, Gαsshort, and Gαolf) increases and the Gαi/o family (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, and Gαz) decreases adenylate cyclase activity. Hence, Gαs/olf and Gαi/o oppositely regulate levels of cAMP in the cell (9Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The Gαq/11 family (Gαq, Gα11, Gα15, and Gα16) notably triggers the activation of the phospholipase C-β and calcium mobilization through the release of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (9Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Gα12 and Gα13 (Gα12/13) activate the small GTPase regulators Rho-GEF (9Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Although individual receptors were initially seen as being selective for a given pathway and thus coupled to a single G protein, it has been observed that most receptors display at least some level of promiscuousness toward different G proteins or G protein families (9Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Another layer of complexity exists in GPCR signaling with the observation of functional selectivity, which can be defined as the ability of a ligand to stabilize a specific receptor conformation leading to a unique and ligand-determined profile of signaling pathway activations (7Kenakin Biased signalling and allosteric machines: new vistas and challenges for drug discovery.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165 (22023017): 1659-166910.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01749.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A large array of pharmacological assays has been developed for the identification of substances able to modulate G proteins through GPCRs. Most of them focus on the downstream events triggered by G protein activation such as the generation of cAMP (Gαs/olf and Gαi/o) (12Williams C. cAMP detection methods in HTS: selecting the best from the rest.Nat.

Shi Y. Zhou N. An overview of Ca2+ mobilization assays in GPCR drug discovery.Expert Opin.

More generic and holistic assays measuring the accumulation of the nonhydrolysable GTPγS (reflecting G protein activation) (16Milligan G. Principles: extending the utility of [35S]GTPγS binding assays.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24 (12559773): 87-9010.1016/S0165-6147(02)00027-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or cell morphology (17Schröder R. Janssen N. Schmidt J. Kebig A. Merten N. Hennen S. Müller A. Blättermann S. Mohr-Andrä M. Zahn S. Wenzel J. Smith N.J. Gomeza J. Drewke C. Milligan G. et al.Deconvolution of complex G protein–coupled receptor signaling in live cells using dynamic mass redistribution measurements.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 (20711173): 943-94910.1038/nbt.1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have also been extensively used. To extend the scope of an assay to more than one or two pathways, promiscuous G proteins linking most receptors to common second messengers are generally added to the system (18Kostenis E. Waelbroeck M. Milligan G. Techniques: promiscuous Gα proteins in basic research and drug discovery.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26 (16183138): 595-60210.1016/j.tips.2005.09.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Collectively, these assays are limited in the way that they cannot give direct information on the kind of G protein, or even on the identity of the GPCR, that has been activated by a given ligand. Thus, during screening campaigns, they are prone to deliver a high rate of false positives (13Gilissen J. Geubelle P. Dupuis N. Laschet C. Pirotte B. Hanson J. Forskolin-free cAMP assay for Gi-coupled receptors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2015; 98 (26386312): 381-39110.1016/j.bcp.2015.09.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recent techniques based on resonance energy transfer (BRET and FRET) have given unprecedented access to the study of individual interaction between G protein and their receptors in living cells (19Lohse M.J. Nuber S. Hoffmann C. Fluorescence/bioluminescence resonance energy transfer techniques to study G-protein-coupled receptor activation and signaling.Pharmacol. Rev. 2012; 64 (22407612): 299-33610.1124/pr.110.004309Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, these approaches suffer from important drawbacks such as limited sensitivity (BRET) or high background noise (FRET) that limit their use, for instance in high-throughput screenings (20Boute N. Jockers R. Issad T. The use of resonance energy transfer in high-throughput screening: BRET versus FRET.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23 (12377570): 351-35410.1016/S0165-6147(02)02062-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, they require the presence of bulky donor and/or acceptors, although reduced-size donors such as NanoLuc (BRET (21Machleidt T. Woodroofe C.C. Schwinn M.K. Méndez J. Robers M.B. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Daniels D.L. Kirkland T.A. Wood K.V. NanoBRET—a novel BRET platform for the analysis of protein–protein interactions.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10 (26006698): 1797-180410.1021/acschembio.5b00143Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar)) or FlasH (FRET (22Hoffmann C. Gaietta G. Bünemann M. Adams S.R. Oberdorff-Maass S. Behr B. Vilardaga J.-P. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Lohse M.J. A FlAsH-based FRET approach to determine G protein–coupled receptor activation in living cells.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2 (15782185): 171-17610.1038/nmeth742Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar)) are now routinely used. Here, we describe a simple and flexible NanoLuc-based complementation assay that overcomes these issues and gives access to the profiling of ligands for their ability to induce GPCR interaction with individual G protein. In addition, the procedure is compatible with the settings of high-throughput screening. We applied this methodology to several prototypical class A receptors and their cognate G proteins. The D2 receptor is a well-validated drug target in psychosis and Parkinson's disease and is coupled to the Gαi/o family. We used the D2 receptor as a proof-of-concept to perform a screening of a library containing known drugs and active compounds against the D2 receptor. To detect the real-time interaction between receptor and G proteins, we selected the NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT) that is based on NanoLuc, an engineered luciferase from the deep sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris (23Hall M.P. Unch J. Binkowski B.F. Valley M.P. Butler B.L. Wood M.G. Otto P. Zimmerman K. Vidugiris G. Machleidt T. Robers M.B. Benink H.A. Eggers C.T. Slater M.R. Meisenheimer P.L. et al.Engineered luciferase reporter from a deep sea shrimp utilizing a novel imidazopyrazinone substrate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7 (22894855): 1848-185710.1021/cb3002478Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the reported increased brightness of the enzyme would overcome sensitivity issues of other systems, such as firefly luciferase complementation, BRET or FRET. In addition, we expected the small size of the NanoBiT partners (a small subunit (SmBiT, 11 AA)) and a larger subunit ((LgBiT, 158 AA), Fig. 1A (24Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V. NanoLuc complementation reporter optimized for accurate measurement of protein interactions in cells.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 (26569370): 400-40810.1021/acschembio.5b00753Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar)) could minimize perturbations of GPCR pharmacology that have been outlined with large fluorescent proteins (19Lohse M.J. Nuber S. Hoffmann C. Fluorescence/bioluminescence resonance energy transfer techniques to study G-protein-coupled receptor activation and signaling.Pharmacol. Rev. 2012; 64 (22407612): 299-33610.1124/pr.110.004309Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). As proof of concept for such an approach, we first selected three receptors coupled to the Gαi/o family: the long isoform of the dopamine receptor subtype 2 (D2) (25Beaulieu J.-M. Espinoza S. Gainetdinov R.R. Dopamine receptors–IUPHAR review 13.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172 (25671228): 1-2310.1111/bph.12906Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar); the histamine receptor H3 (26Panula P. Chazot P.L. Cowart M. Gutzmer R. Leurs R. Liu W.L. Stark H. Thurmond R.L. Haas H.L. International union of basic and clinical pharmacology. XCVIII. Histamine receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67 (26084539): 601-65510.1124/pr.114.010249Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar); and the succinate receptor (SUCNR1) (27Gilissen J. Jouret F. Pirotte B. Hanson J. Insight into SUCNR1 (GPR91) structure and function.Pharmacol. Ther. 2016; 159 (26808164): 56-6510.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.01.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The SmBiT was attached to the C terminus of the receptors, and the LgBiT was introduced in the loop connecting helices A and B of the Gαi1 protein (Gαi1—LgB91) (Fig. 1A). The interaction between labeled receptor and Gαi1–LgB91 was estimated by measuring the emitted light upon agonist stimulation. All the tested receptors induced a rapid increase of luminescent signal upon stimulation (Fig. 2, A–C). However, the amplitude and stability of the obtained signal was relatively weak. We reasoned that the transient nature of the GPCR–G protein interaction could, to some extent, explain the low level of the observed signal. SmBiT has been optimized to have a low affinity for LgBiT (KD = 190 μm (24Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A.

Biol. 2016; 11 (26569370): 400-40810.1021/acschembio.5b00753Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar)) compared with the native sequence (natural peptide or NP, KD = 0.9 μm (24Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V.

Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V.

Biol. 2016; 11 (26569370): 400-40810.1021/acschembio.5b00753Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). A third peptide with high affinity (HiBiT, KD = 0.7 nm (24Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P.

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our assay, we hypothesized that the affinity of the small complementing peptide could be a critical parameter for the sensitivity of the detection system. Therefore, we tested the other two peptides, NP and HiBiT, fused at the same location as SmBiT on the tested receptors. For the three receptors, the amplitude and the stability of the signal were markedly increased when NP was used as the complementation peptide (Fig. 2, D–F). For both these peptides, the signal remained stable for at least 10 min (Fig. 2, D–I), which is consistent with the literature describing real-time GPCR–G protein interaction (28Galés C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A. Hébert T.E. Bouvier M. Real-time monitoring of receptor and G-protein interactions in living cells.Nat Methods. 2005; 2 (15782186): 177-18410.1038/nmeth743Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. Dynamics of receptor/G protein coupling in living cells.EMBO J. 2005; 24 (16292347): 4106-411410.1038/sj.emboj.7600870Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Next, we envisaged the possibility that the use of complementing partners with different affinities for each other could completely distort the GPCR–G protein interaction and increase the risk of detecting nonpharmacological interactions and the accumulation of irreversible receptor–G protein complexes. Thus, we tested the reversibility of the complementation between the three small peptides (SmBiT, NP, and HiBiT) and LgBiT in our system. Following stimulation with dopamine, a competitive D2 receptor antagonist (sulpiride) was injected. For the D2 receptor fused with the SmBiT, a rapid decrease of the NanoLuc signal that reached basal level was observed upon antagonist addition (Fig. 3A). When the experiment was repeated with the constructs containing NP, a similar pattern was observed, although the signal-to-noise ratio was increased (Fig. 3B). When the HiBiT was used as a partner, the rate of dissociation was markedly decreased, and the signal did not reach the basal level, suggesting an incomplete dissociation of the receptor–G protein complex (Fig. 3C). In light of such results, we decided to select the system using the NP for further investigations. We questioned the possibility of implementing the detection system to other G protein subtypes. Thus, we also expanded our detection system to other families of Gα proteins. We introduced the LgBiT in the loop connecting helices A and B of the other Gα proteins and tested the long isoform of Gαs with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (Fig. 4A), Gαq and Gα11 with the histamine receptor H1 (H1) (Fig. 4B), and Gα12 and Gα13 with the thromboxane A2 receptor (TPα) (Fig. 4C). Upon stimulation with their respective ligands, a significant interaction between the receptor and the Gα subunit was recorded in cells co-transfected with β2AR-NP/Gαs–LgB113, H1-NP/Gαq/11–LgB97, and TPα-NP/Gα12/13–LgB115/106 (Fig. 4, A–C). We then aimed at performing a complete profiling of G protein recruitment on a test receptor. We chose the well-characterized D2 dopaminergic receptor as a model because it has been previously reported to couple differently to a diversity of G proteins from the Gαi/o family (30Beaulieu J.M. Gainetdinov R.R. The physiology, signaling, and pharmacology of dopamine receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63 (21303898): 182-21710.1124/pr.110.002642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). We designed additional sensors for the other α subunits of the Gi/o family. We inserted the LgBiT at the same topological location in Gαi2 and Gαi3. For Gαo (the “a” isoform), the initial constructs gave a poor signal, and after different rounds of optimization, the LgBiT was placed just after helix C, and a deletion of the first 52 amino acids at the N-terminal side (Gαo–LgB143d) was performed. We stimulated with dopamine the HEK293 cells transiently transfected with D2–NP and each of these Gα subunits fused with LgBit. Exposure of D2–NP to its endogenous agonist, dopamine, induced a significant increase of luminescence signal when the receptor was co-expressed in HEK293 cells with either Gαi1–LgB91, Gαi2–LgB91, Gαi3–LgB91, or Gαo–LgB143d but no activity when the D2–NP was co-transfected with plasmids containing the validated constructs Gαs–LgB113, Gαq–LgB97, Gα11–LgB97, Gα12–LgB115, or Gα13–LgB106 (Fig. 4D). The interaction profile of the D2 with Gα subunits that was obtained with the present system was consistent with the ones already described in the literature (31Lane J.R. Powney B. Wise A. Rees S.

Signal. 2015; 8 (26628681 ra123): ra12310.1126/scisignal.aab4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We further examined whether the GPCR–G protein NanoLuc complementation assay could be used for a high-throughput screening campaign. To transpose this assay to a screening protocol, we first optimized the Gαi1 construct. The LgBiT was inserted at different locations of the Gα protein and tested in the presence of D2 receptor tagged with the NP (Fig. S1A). The LgBiT placed at the N terminus of Gαi1 (Gαi1–LgBN-term) showed the strongest signal among all the constructs tested. Similar investigations on Gαo confirmed that Gαo–LgB143d was the construct that gave the best signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. S1B). Next, we performed a flow cytometry experiment to determine the relative expression of the D2–NP receptor at the membrane compared with the intracellular expression of Gαi1–LgBN-term and Gαo–LgB143d in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. We observed a similar expression of receptor and Gα protein constructs for the two conditions of transfection (Fig. S2). To obtain the higher signal-to-noise ratio, we tested a different stoichiometry of D2–NP and Gαi1–LgBN-term/Gαo–LgB143d for the transfection. A ratio 1:1 of receptor and Gα subunit revealed a higher signal-to-noise ratio and was used for the subsequent experiments (Fig. S3A). Next, we reasoned that the Gβγ dimer could affect the amplitude of the signal obtained, as it has been shown for the RET-based systems (28Galés C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A. Hébert T.E. Bouvier M. Real-time monitoring of receptor and G-protein interactions in living cells.Nat Methods. 2005; 2 (15782186): 177-18410.1038/nmeth743Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, the co-expression of Gαo–LgB143d with its complementary Gβ1γ2 dimer did not modify the recruitment of Gαo–LgB143d to D2–NP. Interestingly, the co-expression of D2–NP and Gαi1–LgBN-term with Gβ1γ2 subunits decreased the signal of NanoLuc complementation upon dopamine stimulation, although it did not affect the pEC50 (Fig. S3B). Thus, the detection of the interaction between NP-tagged GPCR and the LgBiT-tagged Gα subunit does not require the co-expression with the Gβγ dimer. Concentration-response curves that were determined on the system revealed specific interaction between D2–NP/Gαi1–LgBN-term (EC50 = 2 nm) and D2–NP/Gαo–LgB143d (EC50 = 116 nm) in the presence of dopamine (Fig. 5, A and B). During the kinetic measurement of the D2–NP/Gαi1–LgBN-term or the D2–NP/Gαo–LgB143d interaction induced by dopamine stimulation, we observed an increase of signal that started to decrease immediately upon competitive antagonist (sulpiride and spiperone) addition (Fig. 5, C and D). The affinity of sulpiride for the D2–NP construct that was estimated with a Schild plot (Fig. S4) was not significantly different between the"

Low amplitude corneal deformation was produced during OCT imaging with a linear actuator-driven lens coupled to force transducers. A cross-correlation algorithm was applied to track frame-by-frame speckle displacement across horizontal meridian scans. Intra-measurement force and displacement data series were plotted against each other to produce local axial stiffness approximations, k, defined by the slope of a linear fit to the force/displacement data (ignoring non-axial contributions from corneal bending). Elastographic maps displaying local k values across the cornea were generated, and the ratio of mean axial stiffness approximations for adjacent anterior and posterior stromal regions, ka/kp, was calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to estimate repeatability.Seventeen eyes (ten subjects) were included in this prospective first-in-humans translational study. The ICC was 0.84. Graphs of force vs. displacement demonstrated that, for simultaneously acquired measurements involving the same applied force, anterior stromal displacements were lower (suggesting stiffer behavior) than posterior stromal displacements. Mean ka was 0.016±0.004 g/mm and mean kp was 0.014±0.004 g/mm, giving a mean ka/kp ratio of 1.123±0.062.OCE is a clinically feasible, non-invasive corneal biomechanical characterization method capable of resolving depth-dependent differences in corneal deformation behavior. The anterior stroma demonstrated responses consistent with stiffer properties in compression than the posterior stroma, but to a degree that varied across normal eyes. The clinical capability to measure these differences has implications for assessing the biomechanical impact of corneal refractive surgeries and for ectasia risk screening applications."
https://openalex.org/W2907407985,"Salicylic acid (SA) is responsible for certain plant defence responses and NON EXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1 (NPR1) is the master regulator of SA perception. In Arabidopsis thaliana there are five paralogs of NPR1. In this work we tested the role of these paralogs in SA perception by generating combinations of mutants and transgenics. NPR2 was the only paralog able to partially complement an npr1 mutant. The null npr2 reduces SA perception in combination with npr1 or other paralogs. NPR2 and NPR1 interacted in all the conditions tested, and NPR2 also interacted with other SA-related proteins as NPR1 does. The remaining paralogs behaved differently in SA perception, depending on the genetic background, and the expression of some of the genes induced by SA in an npr1 background was affected by the presence of the paralogs. NPR2 fits all the requirements of an SA receptor while the remaining paralogs also work as SA receptors with a strong hierarchy. According to the data presented here, the closer the gene is to NPR1, the more relevant its role in SA perception."
https://openalex.org/W2906954249,"Modulating the complement system is a promising strategy in drug discovery for disorders with uncontrolled complement activation. Although some of these disorders can be effectively treated with an antibody that inhibits complement C5, the high plasma concentration of C5 requires a huge dosage and frequent intravenous administration. Moreover, a conventional anti-C5 antibody can cause C5 to accumulate in plasma by reducing C5 clearance when C5 forms an immune complex (IC) with the antibody, which can be salvaged from endosomal vesicles by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling. In order to neutralize the increased C5, an even higher dosage of the antibody would be required. This antigen accumulation can be suppressed by giving the antibody a pH-dependent C5-binding property so that C5 is released from the antibody in the acidic endosome and then trafficked to the lysosome for degradation, while the C5-free antibody returns back to plasma. We recently demonstrated that a pH-dependent C5-binding antibody, SKY59, exhibited long-lasting neutralization of C5 in cynomolgus monkeys, showing potential for subcutaneous delivery or less frequent administration. Here we report the details of the antibody engineering involved in generating SKY59, from humanizing a rabbit antibody to improving the C5-binding property. Moreover, because the pH-dependent C5-binding antibodies that we first generated still accumulated C5, we hypothesized that the surface charges of the ICs partially contributed to a slow uptake rate of the C5–antibody ICs. This idea motivated us to engineer the surface charges of the antibody. Our surface-charge engineered antibody consequently exhibited a high capacity to sweep C5 and suppressed the C5 accumulation in vivo by accelerating the cycle of sweeping: uptake of ICs into cells, release of C5 from the antibody in endosomes, and salvage of the antigen-free antibody. Thus, our engineered anti-C5 antibody, SKY59, is expected to provide significant benefits for patients with complement-mediated disorders."

Understanding the prevalence of such infections and the underlying genetic mechanisms of resistance may help in the implementation of adequate measures to control and prevent acquisition of nosocomial infections, especially in an intensive care unit setting. This study describes the molecular characteristics and risk factors associated with OXA-23-producing A. baumannii infections. A case-control study was undertaken from September/2013 to April/2015. Acquisition of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii was found to be associated with the use of nasogastric tubes, haemodialysis, and the use of cephalosporins. These isolates were only susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, tigecycline, and colistin, and contained the ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream ofblaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51 genes. Twenty-six OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains belonged to the ST79 (CC79) clonal group,and patients infected or colonised by these isolates had a higher mortality rate (34.6%). In conclusion, this study showed a dissemination of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains that was associated with several healthcare-related risk factors and high mortality rates among intensive care unit patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908215280,"Background Most glycomics studies have focused on understanding disease mechanisms and proposing serum markers for various diseases, yet the influence of ethnic variation on the identified glyco-biomarker remains poorly addressed. This study aimed to investigate the inter-ethnic serum N-glycan variation among US origin control, Japanese, Indian, and Ethiopian healthy volunteers. Methods Human serum from 54 healthy subjects of various ethnicity and 11 Japanese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were included in the study. We employed a comprehensive glycoblotting-assisted MALDI-TOF/MS-based quantitative analysis of serum N-glycome and fluorescence HPLC-based quantification of sialic acid species. Data representing serum N-glycan or sialic acid levels were compared among the ethnic groups using SPSS software. Results Total of 51 N-glycans released from whole serum glycoproteins could be reproducibly quantified within which 33 glycoforms were detected in all ethnicities. The remaining N-glycans were detected weakly but exclusively either in the Ethiopians (13 glycans) or in all the other ethnic groups (5 glycans). Highest abundance (p < 0.001) of high mannose, core-fucosylated, hyperbranched/hypersialylated N-glycans was demonstrated in Ethiopians. In contrast, only one glycan (m/z 2118) significantly differed among all ethnicities being highest in Indians and lowest in Ethiopians. Glycan abundance trend in Ethiopians was generally close to that of Japanese HCC patients. Glycotyping analysis further revealed ethnic-based disparities mainly in the branched and sialylated structures. Surprisingly, some of the glycoforms greatly elevated in the Ethiopian subjects have been identified as serum biomarkers of various cancers. Sialic acid level was significantly increased primarily in Ethiopians, compared to the other ethnicities. Conclusion The study revealed ethnic-specific differences in healthy human serum N-glycome with highest abundance of most glycoforms in the Ethiopian ethnicity. The results strongly emphasized the need to consider ethnicity matching for accurate glyco-biomarker identification. Further large-scale study employing various ethnic compositions is needed to verify the current result."

TNT hydrolyzes NAD+ in the absence of any exogenous cofactor, thus classifying it as a β-NAD+ glycohydrolase. However, TNT lacks sequence similarity with other NAD+ hydrolyzing enzymes and lacks the essential motifs involved in NAD+ binding and hydrolysis by these enzymes. In this study, we used NMR to examine the enzymatic activity of TNT and found that TNT hydrolyzes NADP+ as fast as NAD+ but does not cleave the corresponding reduced dinucleotides. This activity of TNT was not inhibited by ADP-ribose or nicotinamide, indicating low affinity of TNT for these reaction products. A selection assay for nontoxic TNT variants in Escherichia coli identified four of six residues in the predicted NAD+-binding pocket and four glycine residues that form a cradle directly below the NAD+-binding site, a conserved feature in the TNT protein family. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues near the predicted NAD+-binding site revealed that Phe727, Arg757, and Arg780 are essential for NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT. These results identify the NAD+-binding site of TNT. Our findings also show that TNT is an NAD+ glycohydrolase with properties distinct from those of other bacterial glycohydrolases.

Although TNT promotes intracellular survival and replication of M. tuberculosis, a large family of secreted NAD+ glycohydrolases with similarities to TNT was shown to be involved in interbacterial competition in Firmicutes (20Whitney J.C.

An important distinction between NAD+ glycohydrolases and ADP-ribosyltransferases is that the latter enzymes hydrolyze NAD+ with very low turnover numbers of less than 0.17 s−1 in the absence of their target proteins. In contrast, glycohydrolases such as SPN and Tse6 rapidly cleave NAD+ with rates of 8390 and 1983 s−1, respectively (13Ghosh J. Anderson P.J. Chandrasekaran S. Caparon M.G.

Interestingly, SPN shares sequence similarities with both ADP-ribosyl cyclases, which produce cyclic ADP-ribose as a by-product, and ADP-ribosyltransferases including the ARTT motif with the catalytically essential glutamate residue Glu391 (13Ghosh J. Anderson P.J. Chandrasekaran S. Caparon M.G. Characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes β-NAD+ glycohydrolase: re-evaluation of enzymatic properties associated with pathogenesis.J. Biol.

The structure of TNT is distinct from those of SPN and ADP-ribosyltransferases because it lacks the ARTT and other motifs involved in NAD+ binding and hydrolysis by these enzymes (18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The goal of this study was to examine the enzymatic properties of TNT using random mutagenesis and genetic selection and structure-guided approaches. We characterized the substrate specificity and the kinetic activity of TNT. Further, we identified catalytic residues of TNT that are different from those required for the enzymatic activity of SPN and ADP-ribosyltransferases. The molecular model derived from these results provides a better understanding of substrate hydrolysis by TNT. This model may also help to examine the functions of the more than 300 homologs in the TNT protein family, previously known as the DUF4237 domain. tuberculosis necrotizing toxin β-ara-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide maltose-binding protein tobacco etch virus. Although ADP-ribosyltransferases cleave only NAD+, bacterial glycohydrolases cleave both NAD+ and NADP+. TNT was shown to hydrolyze NAD+ (18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26237511): 672-67810.1038/nsmb.3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the activity of TNT toward other dinucleotides was not investigated. This was partly due to the difficulties in purification of TNT, which must be co-expressed with its antitoxin IFT and separated by heat, resulting in a loss of over 70% target protein (18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26237511): 672-67810.1038/nsmb.3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To this end, we improved the purification protocol of TNT by replacing the heat-denaturation step (18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26237511): 672-67810.1038/nsmb.3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) by treatment with 8 m urea or 4 m guanidine hydrochloride to remove the inhibitor IFT from the His6–MBP–TNT fusion protein. TNT was then refolded on a column and purified by standard affinity chromatography techniques (Fig. 2A). The His6–MBP–TNT protein was then purified by amylose affinity chromatography and, after TEV protease cleavage and removal of the affinity tag, by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). Using this protocol, we obtained ∼0.25 mg of pure TNT protein per liter of Escherichia coli culture (Fig. 2A). Next, we investigated the substrate specificity of TNT using a fluorescence-based enzyme cycling assay as previously described (18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26237511): 672-67810.1038/nsmb.3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TNT hydrolyzed the dinucleotides NAD+ and NADP+ but not their reduced forms NADH and NADPH (Fig. 2B). Addition of the antitoxin IFT prevented hydrolysis of both NAD+ and NADP+ (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that both dinucleotides are cleaved at the same site because IFT blocks access to a cleft predicted as the NAD+-binding site by docking modeling (18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26237511): 672-67810.1038/nsmb.3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To further characterize the catalytic activity of TNT, we tested the ability of TNT to cleave the NAD+ analog β-ara-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (araF-NAD+), which acts as a slow binding inhibitor of eukaryotic NAD+ hydrolases (23Muller-Steffner H.M. Malver O. Hosie L. Oppenheimer N.J. Schuber F. Slow-binding inhibition of NAD+ glycohydrolase by arabino analogues of β-NAD.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1315761): 9606-9611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). araF-NAD+ was cleaved by TNT, albeit more slowly than NAD+ (Fig. 2D). Some NAD+-hydrolyzing enzymes produce cyclic ADP-ribose as a side product in addition to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose (13Ghosh J. Anderson P.J. Chandrasekaran S. Caparon M.G. Characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes β-NAD+ glycohydrolase: re-evaluation of enzymatic properties associated with pathogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20018886): 5683-569410.1074/jbc.M109.070300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A complete assignment of all 1H NMR peaks for NAD+, nicotinamide, ADP-ribose, and cyclic ADP-ribose did not reveal any signals specific for cyclic ADP-ribose after hydrolysis of NAD+ by TNT (Fig. S2). These results show that TNT does not produce any cyclic ADP-ribose detectable under those conditions. We used 1H NMR to directly measure the kinetics of TNT-mediated hydrolysis of NAD+ and NADP+. To this end, we followed the resonance decay of NAD+ protons and the resonance increase of nicotinamide and ADP-ribose protons (Fig. 3A). An advantage of NMR is that it directly and quantitatively records substrate hydrolysis and product accumulation in real-time over the entire course of the reaction (Fig. 3B) as shown previously (24Vandenberg J.I. Kuchel P.W. King G.F. Application of progress curve analysis to in situ enzyme kinetics using 1H NMR spectroscopy.Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155 (3013046): 38-4410.1016/0003-2697(86)90221-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Michaelis constant Km of ∼190 ± 50 μm and the turnover rate kcat of 16/s for NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT were determined using a direct numerical solution of the Michaelis–Menten equation. Both substrate-binding affinity and maximal NAD+ hydrolysis rates measured by NMR were slightly different compared with previous values (Ref. 18Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26237511): 672-67810.1038/nsmb.3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and Table 1). This difference could be due to the different protein purification methods, the different methods of NAD+ detection, and/or the different buffer conditions. Because the NMR method detects NAD+ hydrolysis directly and enables the measurement of kinetics continuously and more reproducibly, we used NMR in subsequent experiments to examine the catalytic properties of TNT. Using NMR, we showed that TNT hydrolyzed NAD+ and NADP+ with similar specificity constants in contrast to SPN, which had a 20-fold reduced rate for NADP+ cleavage (Table 1). Our results are consistent with a Km of 310 μm determined previously for NAD+ hydrolysis in M. tuberculosis extracts (25Gopinathan K.P. Sirsi M. Vaidyanathan C.S.

https://openalex.org/W2906941281,"We provide the first detailed identification of Barents Sea cold seep frenulate hosts and their symbionts. Mitochondrial COI sequence analysis, in combination with detailed morphological investigations through both light and electron microscopy was used for identifying frenulate hosts, and comparing them to Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis and Oligobrachia webbi, two morphologically similar species known from the Norwegian Sea. Specimens from sites previously assumed to host O. haakonmosbiensis were included in our molecular analysis, which allowed us to provide new insight on the debate regarding species identity of these Oligobrachia worms. Our results indicate that high Arctic seeps are inhabited by a species that though closely related to Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis, is nonetheless distinct. We refer to this group as the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade, based on the colloquial names of the sites they are currently known to inhabit. Since members of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade cannot be distinguished from O. haakonmosbiensis or O. webbi based on morphology, we suggest that a complex of cryptic Oligobrachia species inhabit seeps in the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic. The symbionts of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade were also found to be closely related to O. haakonmosbiensis symbionts, but genetically distinct. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and transmission electron micrographs revealed extremely dense populations of bacteria within the trophosome of members of the Oligobrachia sp. CPL-clade, which is unusual for frenulates. Bacterial genes for sulfur oxidation were detected and small rod shaped bacteria (round in cross section), typical of siboglinid-associated sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, were seen on electron micrographs of trophosome bacteriocytes, suggesting that sulfide constitutes the main energy source. We hypothesize that specific, local geochemical conditions, in particular, high sulfide fluxes and concentrations could account for the unusually high symbiont densities in members of the Oligrobrachia sp.

Loss of TG function is associated with numerous orphan diseases that affect a relatively small number of individuals: loss of FXIIIa (transamidase-activated form) crosslinking leads to defects in blood coagulation in FXIII deficiency; loss of TG1 and TG5 cross linking leads to defects in epidermal cornification in lamellar ichthyosis and acral peeling skin syndrome, respectively; loss of TG3 crosslinking in hair-cuticle formation leads to uncombable hair syndrome; the predicted loss of TG6 crosslinking leads to spinocerebellar ataxia-35; and loss of the structural erythrocyte membrane protein, protein 4.2, leads to hereditary spherocytosis type 5. The enzymatic activity of TG2 is involved in the exacerbation of celiac disease and in at least 1 case of hemoglobinopathy, characterized by shortened erythrocyte lifespan. TGs are also autoantigens in a number of immune diseases, resulting in the production of autoantibodies against FXIIIa in acquired FXIII deficiency, TG2 in celiac disease, TG3 in dermatitis herpetiformis, TG4 in autoimmume polyglandular syndrome type 1, and TG6 in gluten axonal neuropathy and gluten ataxia. Much still remains to be learned and confirmed with respect to disease mechanisms, particularly with respect to TG-related immune diseases, in which development of isozyme-specific inhibitors may be useful for treatment.—Lorand, L., Iismaa, S.

https://openalex.org/W2907671687,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). PrEP uptake and adherence remain low and product preferences are unknown, especially among young African American MSM who are most at-risk. We conducted 26 qualitative interviews from 2014-2016 among young adult HIV-negative African American MSM regarding PrEP product preferences in Missouri. While the pill and injectable were most liked of all modalities, about a quarter preferred rectal products or patches. Most participants preferred a long-acting injectable (LAI) to daily oral pills due to better medication adherence and a dislike for taking pills. Many participants preferred daily oral pills to on-demand oral PrEP due to the inability to predict sex and the perception that insufficient time or medication would not achieve HIV protection with on-demand. A fear of needles and the perception that there would not be therapeutic levels for a long duration were concerns with injectable PrEP. Study findings highlight the need for a range of prevention options for African American MSM and can inform PrEP product development as well as dissemination and implementation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2907295631,"The plant NAC transcription factors depict one of the largest plant transcription factor families. They regulate a wide range of different developmental processes and most probably played an important role in the evolutionary diversification of plants. This makes comparative studies of the NAC transcription factor family between individual species and genera highly relevant and such studies have in recent years been greatly facilitated by the increasing number of fully sequenced complex plant genomes. This study combines the characterization of the NAC transcription factors in the recently sequenced genome of the cereal crop barley with expression analysis and a comprehensive phylogenetic characterization of the NAC transcription factors in other monocotyledonous plant species. Our results provide evidence for the emergence of a NAC transcription factor subclade that is exclusively expressed in the grains of the Poaceae family of grasses. These notably comprise a number of cereal crops other than barley, such as wheat, rice, maize or millet, which are all cultivated for their starchy edible grains. Apparently, the grain specific subclade emerged from a well described subgroup of NAC transcription factors associated with the senescence process. A promoter exchange subsequently resulted in grain specific expression. We propose to designate this transcription factor subclade Grain-NACs and we discuss their involvement in programmed cell death as well as their potential role in the evolution of the Poaceae grain, which doubtlessly is of central importance for human nutrition."

Nevertheless, easier, quicker, and less costly proxy methods exist. We aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of several proxy methods: the spectrophotometer, iCheck Carotene, and near-infrared spectroscopy using both a desktop (dNIRS) and a portable (pNIRS) device for the measurement of total carotenoid concentration (TCC) and all-trans-β-carotene concentration (trans-BC) in 30 fresh cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) storage roots in comparison with HPLC. The spectrophotometer presented the highest predictability for TCC, followed by iCheck, dNIRS, and pNIRS. The dNIRS showed the highest predictability and agreement for trans-BC. The pNIRS showed the poorest repeatability and greatest underestimations compared with HPLC. The agreement between all methods was lower for higher carotenoid concentration, with the exception of the spectrophotometer. According to our results, and for screening purposes, the measurement of carotenoids in fresh cassava roots can be carried out by spectrophotometer, iCheck Carotene and NIRS methods depending on the availability of equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2907089385,"DNA helicases are motor proteins that couple the chemical energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to the mechanical functions required for DNA unwinding. Studies of several helicases have identified strand-separating “pin” structures that are positioned to intercept incoming dsDNA and promote strand separation during helicase translocation. However, pin structures vary among helicases and it remains unclear whether they confer a conserved unwinding mechanism. Here, we tested the biochemical and cellular roles of a putative pin element within the Escherichia coli PriA DNA helicase. PriA orchestrates replication restart in bacteria by unwinding the lagging-strand arm of abandoned DNA replication forks and reloading the replicative helicase with the help of protein partners that combine with PriA to form what is referred to as a primosome complex. Using in vitro protein–DNA cross-linking, we localized the putative pin (a β-hairpin within a zinc-binding domain in PriA) near the ssDNA–dsDNA junction of the lagging strand in a PriA–DNA replication fork complex. Removal of residues at the tip of the β-hairpin eliminated PriA DNA unwinding, interaction with the primosome protein PriB, and cellular function. We isolated a spontaneous intragenic suppressor mutant of the priA β-hairpin deletion mutant in which 22 codons around the deletion site were duplicated. This suppressor variant and an Ala-substituted β-hairpin PriA variant displayed wildtype levels of DNA unwinding and PriB binding in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2907080439,"Background Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) testing and management in Morocco is associated with delays resulting in late commencement of treatment. To reduce delays and to increase access of women to GDM care, a country-adapted intervention targeting primary health care providers was designed to test the hypothesis that detection and initial management of GDM at the primary level of care improves newborn outcomes in terms of lower birthweights and less cases of macrosomia and impacts on maternal weight gain, glucose balance and pregnancy outcomes. Materials and methods We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in two districts of Morocco. In each district, 10 health centers were randomly selected to serve either as intervention or control sites. Pregnant women attending antenatal care in the study facilities were eligible to participate. At the intervention sites, women were offered GDM screening by capillary glucose testing following International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups/WHO criteria. Women diagnosed with GDM received counselling on nutrition and exercise and were followed up through their health center whereas at control facilities routine practice was applied. Primary outcome was birthweight and secondary outcomes maternal weight gain, glucose control and pregnancy complications. We further assessed GDM prevalence in the intervention arm. Statistical analysis was performed on 210 recruited women. Continuous variables were reported using means while categorical variables using frequencies with tests of independence applying chi-squared tests. Differences of outcome variables between the two groups were estimated by mixed-effects regression models and effect sizes adjusted for confounders. The trial is registered under NCT02979756 at ClinicalTrials.gov. Results GDM prevalence reached 23.7% in Marrakech. Birthweight in the intervention group was 147grams lower than in the control group (p = 0.08) as was the proportion of macrosomes (3.5% versus 18.4%; p< 0.001). In the intervention arm, women did two times more follow-ups than at control sites (p = 0.001) and mean follow-up intervals were shorter (11.3 days versus 18.7 days; p < 0.001). Overall, 30% more fasting blood sugar values were balanced (p = 0.005) and mean weekly maternal weight gain 49 grams lower (p = 0.032) in the intervention group. More women from control facilities had a delivery complication whereas more newborn complications were observed in women from intervention facilities. No difference between the two groups existed regarding mode of delivery and mean gestational age at delivery. One of the main limitations of the study was the Hawthorn-effect at control sites that might have led to an underestimation of the effect size. Conclusion A high GDM prevalence in Morocco calls for a context-adapted screening and management approach to enable early interventions. GDM detection and care through antenatal care at primary health facilities may have positively impacted on newborn birthweight but findings are inconclusive. Results of this study will contribute to the decision on a potential upscaling of the intervention in Morocco. Future research could examine long term metabolic changes including diabetes type 2 in the cohort of women and their children."
https://openalex.org/W2908467255,"In sub-Saharan Africa, most women who test HIV negative at the first antenatal care encounter are rarely tested again during pregnancy and postpartum, yet data suggests that pregnancy is associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition compared to non-pregnant women. We describe HIV incidence during pregnancy and postpartum in Lesotho, a high prevalence setting, and factors associated with HIV seroconversion. We enrolled a cohort of HIV negative women presenting at health facilities for antenatal care and followed them through delivery up to 24 months postpartum. Women were repeatedly tested for HIV according to the Lesotho Ministry of Health routine rapid HIV testing guidelines and responded to risk behavior questionnaire every three months. We estimated HIV incidence and associated 95% confidence intervals. We used mixed effects Cox regression models to identify independent factors associated with seroconversion accounting for repeated assessment. The estimated overall HIV incidence rate was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.05-2.28) per 100 person- years. The estimated HIV incidence rate during pregnancy (2.61 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 1.12-5.14) was almost double the estimated HIV incidence during postpartum (1.36 per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 0.83-2.10). Women's age (14-24 years compared to 25-45 years), multiple sexual partnerships, urethral discharge and no condoms nor pre-exposure prophylaxis were independently associated with HIV infection. There is an increased need for counseling and support of HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women to stay HIV-negative, including provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis during this high-risk period, particularly among adolescent and young women."
https://openalex.org/W2907812291,"Zinc is an essential trace element that serves as a cofactor for enzymes in critical biochemical processes and also plays a structural role in numerous proteins. Zinc transporter ZIP4 (ZIP4) is a zinc importer required for dietary zinc uptake in the intestine and other cell types. Studies in cultured cells have reported that zinc stimulates the endocytosis of plasma membrane–localized ZIP4 protein, resulting in reduced cellular zinc uptake. Thus, zinc-regulated trafficking of ZIP4 is a key means for regulating cellular zinc homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we used mutational analysis, immunoblotting, HEK293 cells, and immunofluorescence microscopy to identify a histidine-containing motif (398HTH) in the first extracellular loop that is required for high sensitivity to low zinc concentrations in a zinc-induced endocytic response of mouse ZIP4 (mZIP4). Moreover, using synthetic peptides with selective substitutions and truncated mZIP4 variants, we provide evidence that histidine residues in this motif coordinate a zinc ion in mZIP4 homodimers at the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that 398HTH is an important zinc-sensing motif for eliciting high-affinity zinc-stimulated endocytosis of mZIP4 and provide insight into cellular mechanisms for regulating cellular zinc homeostasis in mammalian cells.

Baker D. Dempski R.E. Computation and functional studies provide a model for the structure of the zinc transporter hZIP4.J. Biol.

However, the functional significance of dimerization of full-length ZIP4 and its subcellular localization are not understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved 398HTH motif in the external loop between the second and third TMD is required for endocytosis of mZIP4 in response to low micromolar concentrations of zinc ions. Site-directed mutations in the 398HTH motif resulted in a considerable decrease in zinc-sensitive endocytosis of the transporter. Using an in vitro assay, we provide evidence that two 398HTH motifs within adjacent mZIP4 proteins coordinate one zinc ion. Furthermore, we found that mZIP4 exists in homodimer form at the plasma membrane based on co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking experiments. These findings identify a key extracellular motif required for high sensitivity zinc-induced endocytosis of mZIP4 necessary for fine-tuned cellular zinc homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that low micromolar zinc concentrations were sufficient to stimulate rapid endocytosis of the mouse ZIP4 protein from the plasma membrane, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are unknown (10Dufner-Beattie J.

A simple hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that zinc may bind to extracellular region(s) of the mZIP4 protein, which then triggers conformational changes of mZIP4 resulting in increased endocytosis, possibly by stimulating interactions between an endocytic targeting motif of mZIP4 and the cellular trafficking machinery. In addition to the cytoplasmic histidine-rich loop domain connecting TMD 3 and 4, which is required for zinc-stimulated mZIP4 degradation (19Mao X. Kim B.E. Wang F. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. A histidine-rich cluster mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the human zinc transporter, hZIP4, and protects against zinc cytotoxicity.J. Biol.

The N-terminal extracellular domains of both hZIP4 and mZIP4 are rich in clustered histidine residues that may bind to zinc (20Jeong J. Eide D.J. The SLC39 family of zinc transporters.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34 (23506894): 612-61910.1016/j.mam.2012.05.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 29Zhang T. Sui D. Hu J.

Another histidine-containing extracellular region of mZIP4 is the loop region between TMD 2 and 3, which includes the sequence 398HTHGGEGHTHEEE410 (Fig. 1A). This extracellular loop may also be important for substrate binding because of the high frequency of histidines and glutamates, which are potential zinc-binding amino acids. Furthermore, mutations in potential metal-binding residues in this region of the mZIP4-related Irt1 transporter of Arabidopsis were found to either disrupt transport function altogether or change the metal selectivity (33Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Altered selectivity in an Arabidopsis metal transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (11035780): 12356-1236010.1073/pnas.210214197Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These results suggest the first extracellular loop between TMD 2 and 3 in mZIP4 proteins may play a general role in binding and/or sensing zinc. To investigate the role of potential metal-binding residues in regulating zinc-responsive mZIP4 trafficking, we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach targeting the loop domain as well as the NED (Fig. 1). Two deletion mutants were created, including ΔNED (which lacks the N-terminal extracellular domain) and Δ398–410 (which completely lacks the two HTH motifs). Alone (398HTH-ATA) or in combination (398HTH-ATA and 405HTH-ATA, hereafter 398/405HTH-ATA), we replaced individual histidine residues with alanines in the two HTH sequences in the first extracellular loop to disrupt potential metal binding while maintaining the general structure of the region (Fig. 1A). After confirming these mutations by DNA sequencing, HEK293 cells were stably transfected with the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mZIP4 constructs (mZIP4-HA) bearing these mutations and individual cell clones were selected for puromycin resistance. Immunoblot analysis was used to identify clones in which the expression of each mZIP4-HA variant was similar (Fig. 1B). Each mZIP4-HA variant migrated as a 90-kDa protein, with the exception of the truncated ΔNED mutant. Although the calculated molecular mass of mZIP-HA is ∼73 kDa, glycosylation is known to increase its apparent molecular mass to 90 kDa in HEK293 cells (31Wang F. Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. Acrodermatitis enteropathica mutations affect transport activity, localization and zinc-responsive trafficking of the mouse ZIP4 zinc transporter.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13 (14709598): 563-57110.1093/hmg/ddh049Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As expected, there was no signal in HEK293 cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 1B). Additional immunoblot analyses using available antibodies confirmed that HEK293 cells express little, if any, endogenous human ZIP4 protein (Fig. S1). To characterize the function of the N-terminal extracellular domain in the zinc-responsive endocytosis of mZIP4-HA, we tested the zinc sensitivity of this response using an antibody uptake assay (Fig. 2A). The extracellular orientation of the HA-epitope tag on the C terminus of mZIP4-HA allowed mZIP4-HA endocytosis to be indirectly determined by measuring the levels of internalized anti-HA antibody added to the growth medium of living cells (18Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. Zn2+-stimulated endocytosis of the mZIP4 zinc transporter regulates its location at the plasma membrane.J. Biol.

This was achieved by incubating live cells with anti-HA antibody, allowing sufficient time for internalization via endocytosis (5 min), and removal of surface-bound antibodies using acidic buffer followed by immunoblotting for the anti-HA antibody. This procedure was performed using cells grown in medium made zinc-deficient using Chelex 100; zinc was added back in the form of ZnCl2. The level of surface-bound anti-HA antibodies was similar in cells expressing the ΔNED-mZIP4-HA and wildtype (WT)-mZIP4-HA and incubated in Chelex-treated medium (Fig. 2B). This observation confirmed that both proteins accumulated at the plasma membrane at similar levels. As expected, the addition of zinc to the medium resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the endocytosis of WT-mZIP4-HA, as measured by the uptake of anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, endocytosis of the ΔNED-mZIP4-HA protein in response to zinc was significantly greater than WT-mZIP4-HA (Fig. 2, C and D). These finding suggest that loss of the N-terminal domain of mZIP4 increases the sensitivity to zinc-stimulated endocytosis. In additional experiments, WT-mZIP4-HA and ΔNED-mZIP4-HA were expressed in HEK293 cells pre-grown in Chelex-treated medium for 3 h to maximize protein levels at the plasma membrane and then exposed to zinc-containing medium containing anti-HA antibodies to permit internalization of these antibodies over time. The internalization of anti-HA antibodies by the ΔNED-mZIP4-HA mutant was markedly greater relative to the WT mZIP4-HA protein (Fig. 2, E and F). These results indicate that the ΔNED-mZIP4-HA mutant is internalized from the plasma membrane at a faster rate than the WT-mZIP4-HA protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the steady-state localization of each mZIP4-HA mutant protein in cells cultured in zinc-replete basal medium, and the ability of each protein to accumulate at the plasma membrane in response to zinc limitation. The WT-mZIP4 protein (WT-mZIP4-HA) was located in cytoplasmic vesicles when cells were cultured in basal medium (Fig. 3A, first column). Consistent with our previous observations (18Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. Zn2+-stimulated endocytosis of the mZIP4 zinc transporter regulates its location at the plasma membrane.J. Biol.

In contrast to WT-mZIP4, the NED deletion mutant protein (ΔNED-mZIP4-HA) was distributed in intracellular vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm in cells cultured in basal medium (Fig. 3A, second column). This distribution was quite distinct from that of the WT-mZIP4, which was more concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3A, first column). When zinc availability was limited by TPEN treatment, there was increased plasma membrane localization of the ΔNED-mZIP4-HA mutant, suggesting that the loss of the N-terminal extracellular domain did not grossly interfere with mZIP4-HA trafficking under zinc-deficient conditions. Compared with WT mZIP4, the steady-state localization of the TMD 2 and 3 loop region mutants (Δ398–410, 398/405HTH-ATA, and 398HTH-ATA) was shifted toward the cell periphery in both basal- and TPEN-treated medium, suggesting that these mutants may interfere with zinc-induced endocytosis (Fig. 3A, third to fifth columns). To more quantitatively assess the surface levels of mZIP4-HA mutant proteins under varying zinc concentrations, we used immunoblotting to detect levels of the extracellular HA-epitope tag at the plasma membrane of live cells (Fig. 2A) (18Kim B.E.

Live cells were placed on ice to inhibit endocytosis, incubated with anti-HA antibody, washed, and then cell lysates were prepared to detect anti-HA antibodies by immunoblotting. Using this approach, a low abundance of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane was observed for cells expressing WT-mZIP4-HA and ΔNED-mZIP4-HA grown in basal medium, as evident from low levels of surface-bound anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5). Consistent with the earlier immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3A, first and second columns), pre-treatment of cells for 1 h with 10 μm TPEN resulted in an increase in the WT-mZIP4-HA protein (Fig. 3B, lane 4) and the ΔNED-mZIP4-HA mutant protein at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B, lane 6). However, all three mutants in the first external loop region showed higher surface level amounts in zinc-replete basal medium compared with the WT protein (Fig. 3, B, lanes 7, 9, and 11, and C), and zinc depletion by TPEN treatment did not further increase surface levels of the mZIP4-HA loop deletion mutant (Fig. 3, B, lane 8, and C), despite the equivalent amounts of total mZIP4 protein as shown by Western blotting controls (Fig. 1B). Note that the overall abundance of these mZIP4 mutant proteins was not significantly altered by th"

Puerto Ricans are among the US citizens with higher HPV prevalence and lower screening rates and access to treatment. This bleak statistic was as a motivation to detect biomarkers for early diagnosis of HPV in this population. We collected both urine and cervical swabs from 43 patients attending San Juan Clinics. Cervical swabs were used for genomic DNA extractions and HPV genotyping with the HPV SPF10-LiPA25 kit, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed on the urine-derived products for metabolomics analyses. We aimed at discriminating between patients with different HPV categories: HPV negative (HPV-), HPV positive with simultaneous low and high-risk infections (HPV+B) and HPV positive exclusively high-risk (HPV+H). We found that the metabolome of HPV+B is closer to HPV- than to HPV+H supporting evidence that suggests HPV co-infections may be antagonistic due to viral interference leading to a lower propensity for cervical cancer development. In contrast, metabolites of patients with HPV+H were significantly different from those that were HPV-. We identified three urinary metabolites 5-Oxoprolinate, Erythronic acid and N-Acetylaspartic acid that discriminate HPV+H cases from negative controls. These metabolites are known to be involved in a variety of biochemical processes related to energy and metabolism and may likely be biomarkers for HPV high-risk cervical infection. However, further validation should follow using a larger patient cohort and diverse populations to confirm our finding."

We hypothesized that circRNAs might be related with the pathophysiology of chronic epilepsy and evaluated the altered circRNA expressions and their possible regulatory effects on their target miRNAs and mRNAs in a mouse epilepsy model. The circRNA expression profile in the hippocampus of the pilocarpine mice was analyzed and compared with control. The correlation between the expression of miRNA binding sites (miRNA response elements, MRE) in the dysregulated circRNAs and the expression of their target miRNAs was evaluated. As miRNAs also inhibit their target mRNAs, circRNA–miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, comprised of dysregulated RNAs that targets one another were searched. For the identified networks, bioinformatics analyses were performed. As the result, Forty-three circRNAs were dysregulated in the hippocampus (up-regulated, 26; down-regulated, 17). The change in the expression of MRE in those circRNAs negatively correlated with the change in the relevant target miRNA expression (r = -0.461, P<0.001), supporting that circRNAs inhibit their target miRNA. 333 dysregulated circRNA–miRNA-mRNA networks were identified. Gene ontology and pathway analyses demonstrated that the up-regulated mRNAs in those networks were closely related to the major processes in epilepsy. Among them, STRING analysis identified 37 key mRNAs with abundant (≥4) interactions with other dysregulated target mRNAs. The dysregulation of the circRNAs which had multiple interactions with key mRNAs were validated by PCR. We concluded that dysregulated circRNAs might have a pathophysiologic role in chronic epilepsy by regulating multiple disease relevant mRNAs via circRNA−miRNA−mRNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2907248936,"Kawasaki disease (KD), first identified in 1967, is a pediatric vasculitis of unknown etiology that has an increasing incidence in Japan and many other countries. KD can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Its epidemiological characteristics, such as seasonality and clinical picture of acute systemic inflammation with prodromal intestinal/respiratory symptoms, suggest an infectious etiology for KD. Interestingly, multiple host genotypes have been identified as predisposing factors for KD. To explore experimental methodology for identifying etiological agent(s) for KD and to optimize epidemiological study design (particularly the sample size) for future studies, we conducted a pilot study. For a 1-year period, we prospectively enrolled 11 patients with KD. To each KD patient, we assigned two control individuals (one with diarrhea and the other with respiratory infections), matched for age, sex, and season of diagnosis. During the acute phase of disease, we collected peripheral blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and feces. We also determined genotypes, to identify those that confer susceptibility to KD. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the risk genotypes between KD patients and control subjects. We also used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to analyze these samples. Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 (TTV7) in two patients with KD (18%), but not in control subjects (P = 0.111). Sanger sequencing revealed that the TTV7 found in the two KD patients contained almost identical variants in nucleotide and identical changes in resulting amino acid, relative to the reference sequence. Additionally, we estimated the sample size that would be required to demonstrate a statistical correlation between TTV7 and KD. Future larger scale studies with carefully optimized metagenomic sequencing experiments and adequate sample size are warranted to further examine the association between KD and potential pathogens, including TTV7."

To better understand the mechanisms involved in the cellular response to ER stress in cardiomyocytes, we previously conducted a genome-wide screening in an in vitro ER stress model of rat cardiomyocytes, which highlighted amino acid transporter heavy chain, member 2 (SLC3A2) as an important factor in ER stress. In the present study, we characterized the role of SLC3A2 during the unfolded protein response (UPR), as one of the primary pathways activated during ER stress. First, we confirmed the induction of Slc3a2 mRNA expression following treatment with various ER stress inducers in rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) and neural cells (PC12). Knockdown of Slc3a2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) revealed that the encoded protein functions upstream of three important UPR proteins: ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of both SLC3A2 and mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTOR1) revealed that mTOR1 acts as a mediator between SLC3A2 and the UPR. RNA sequencing was then performed to gain a more thorough understanding of the function of SLC3A2, which identified 23 highly differentially regulated genes between the control and knockdown cell lines, which were related to the UPR and amino acid transport. Notably, flow cytometry further showed that SLC3A2 inhibition also enhanced the apoptosis of rat cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these results highlight SLC3A2 as a complex, multifunctional signaling protein that acts upstream of well-known UPR proteins with anti-apoptotic properties, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ER stress-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2907681988,"Mathematical models are useful tools to predict fluid shifts between body compartments in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The ability of a model to accurately describe the transport of water between cells and interstitium (Jv,ISIC), and the consequent changes in intracellular volume (ICV), is important for a complete assessment of fluid distribution and plasma refilling. In this study, we propose a model describing transport of fluid in the three main body compartments (intracellular, interstitial and vascular), complemented by transport mechanisms for proteins and small solutes.The model was applied to data from 23 patients who underwent standard HD. The substances described in the baseline model were: water, proteins, Na, K, and urea. Small solutes were described with two-compartment kinetics between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Solute transport across the cell membrane took place via passive diffusion and, for Na and K, through the ATPase pump, characterized by the maximum transport rate, JpMAX. From the data we estimated JpMAX and two other parameters linked to transcapillary transport of fluid and protein: the capillary filtration coefficient Lp and its large pores fraction αLP. In an Expanded model one more generic solute was included to evaluate the impact of the number of substances appearing in the equation describing Jv,ISIC.In the baseline model, median values (interquartile range) of estimated parameters were: Lp: 11.63 (7.9, 14.2) mL/min/mmHg, αLP: 0.056 (0.050, 0.058), and JpMAX: 5.52 (3.75, 7.54) mmol/min. These values were significantly different from those obtained by the Expanded model: Lp: 8.14 (6.29, 10.01) mL/min/mmHg, αLP: 0.046 (0.038, 0.052), and JpMAX: 16.7 (11.9, 25.2) mmol/min. The relative RMSE (root mean squared error)averaged between all simulated quantities compared to data was 3.9 (3.1, 5.6) %.The model was able to accurately reproduce most of the changes observed in HD by tuning only three parameters. While the drop in ICV was overestimated by the model, the difference between simulations and data was less than the measurement error. The biggest change in the estimated parameters in the Expanded model was a marked increase of JpMAX indicating that this parameter is highly sensitive to the number of species modeled, and that the value of JpMAX should be interpreted only in relation to this factor."
https://openalex.org/W2908112180,"Copper-only superoxide dismutases (SODs) represent a new class of SOD enzymes that are exclusively extracellular and unique to fungi and oomycetes. These SODs are essential for virulence of fungal pathogens in pulmonary and disseminated infections, and we show here an additional role for copper-only SODs in promoting survival of fungal biofilms. The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans expresses three copper-only SODs, and deletion of one of them, SOD5, eradicated candidal biofilms on venous catheters in a rodent model. Fungal copper-only SODs harbor an irregular active site that, unlike their Cu,Zn-SOD counterparts, contains a copper co-factor unusually open to solvent and lacks zinc for stabilizing copper binding, making fungal copper-only SODs highly vulnerable to metal chelators. We found that unlike mammalian Cu,Zn-SOD1, C. albicans SOD5 indeed rapidly loses its copper to metal chelators such as EDTA, and binding constants for Cu(II) predict that copper-only SOD5 has a much lower affinity for copper than does Cu,Zn-SOD1. We screened compounds with a variety of indications and identified several metal-binding compounds, including the ionophore pyrithione zinc (PZ), that effectively inhibit C. albicans SOD5 but not mammalian Cu,Zn-SOD1. We observed that PZ both acts as an ionophore that promotes uptake of toxic metals and inhibits copper-only SODs. The pros and cons of a vulnerable active site for copper-only SODs and the possible exploitation of this vulnerability in antifungal drug design are discussed."

The study aim was to investigate asylum seeking women's experiences and perceived needs during pregnancy and early motherhood whilst living in state-provided accommodation in one federal state in Southern Germany, with a particular focus on psychosocial factors.In this exploratory case study, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants in pregnancy and up to the six-week postnatal assessment. Two female interviewers performed interviews assisted by female professional interpreters. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. An inductive approach was taken to content analysis of interview material.21 interviews were performed with nine women seeking asylum in pregnancy and early motherhood. Women shared experiences and perceived consequences on their psychosocial health. The following five key themes were identified during content analysis: a) psychosocial stressors, b) stressful living circumstances, c) stressful relationships, d) social support and e) coping styles. Psychosocial factors were a significant source of mental stress for participants, especially due to future uncertainties linked with the asylum seeking process. Living circumstances were also marked by stressors including a lack of privacy, verbal and physical threats and experiences of powerlessness. Further strain and emotional pressure were caused by stressful relationships with the unborn child's father. Social support and personal coping styles provided relief for some participants.This study provides in-depth insights into the experiences and perceived needs of pregnant asylum seekers and new mothers living in state-provided accommodation. Key results identified psychosocial factors such as future uncertainties, stressful living circumstances and stressful relationships, as social determinants of health that were perceived to adversely affect women's health. Adequate social support and individual coping styles increased resilience and counterbalanced psychosocial stressors during the asylum seeking process."

Given the antioxidant properties of P28GST, we evaluated its anti-inflammatory potential when administered locally after colitis induction in the absence of adjuvant.Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by rectal administration of TNBS, followed by two intraperitoneal injections of P28GST at day 1 and day 2. Mice were sacrificed 48h after TNBS administration and evaluated for macroscopic and histological scores, myeloperoxidase (MPO) quantification and cytokine messenger RNA expression in the colonic tissues.Both clinical and histological scores significantly decreased in mice treated with P28GST at 5 or 50μg/kg when compared to vehicle- treated mice. A significant reduction of MPO was detected in colonic tissues from P28GST-treated mice, similarly to mice treated with methylprednisolone as the reference treatment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, mRNA as well as serum levels were down-regulated in mice colonic tissues treated with P28GST at 5 or 50μg/kg. In addition, a significant decrease of mRNA expression levels of T-bet, and ROR-γ, respective markers of Th1 and Th17 cells was observed. Whereas no significant effect was detected on Gata3 mRNA, a marker of Th2 cells, the Arg/iNOS mRNA levels significantly increased in P28GST-treated mice, suggesting the induction of M2 macrophages.These findings provide evidence that P28GST injected locally after colitis induction induces a potent decrease of colitis inflammation in mice, associated to downregulation of Th1/Th17 response, and induction of anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2906808640,"Zebrafish gata4/5/6 genes encode transcription factors that lie on the apex of the regulatory hierarchy in primitive myelopoiesis. However, little is known about the roles of microRNAs in gata4/5/6-regulated processes. Performing RNA-Seq deep sequencing analysis of the expression changes of microRNAs in gata4/5/6-knockdown embryos, we identified miR-210-5p as a regulator of zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis. Knocking down gata4/5/6 (generating gata5/6 morphants) significantly increased miR-210-5p expression, whereas gata4/5/6 overexpression greatly reduced its expression. Consistent with inhibited primitive myelopoiesis in the gata5/6 morphants, miR-210-5p overexpression repressed primitive myelopoiesis, indicated by reduced numbers of granulocytes and macrophages. Moreover, knocking out miR-210 partially rescued the defective primitive myelopoiesis in zebrafish gata4/5/6-knockdown embryos. Furthermore, we show that the restrictive role of miR-210-5p in zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis is due to impaired differentiation of hemangioblast into myeloid progenitor cells. By comparing the set of genes with reduced expression levels in the gata5/6 morphants to the predicted target genes of miR-210-5p, we found that foxj1b and slc3a2a, encoding a forkhead box transcription factor and a solute carrier family 3 protein, respectively, are two direct downstream targets of miR-210-5p that mediate its inhibitory roles in zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis. In summary, our results reveal that miR-210-5p has an important role in the genetic network controlling zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2908334789,"Among traditional Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data representations such as raster grid, triangulated irregular network, point clouds and octree, the explicit 3D nature of voxel-based representation makes it a promising alternative. Despite the benefit of voxel-based representation, voxel-based algorithms have rarely been used for building detection. In this paper, a voxel segmentation-based 3D building detection algorithm is developed for separating building and nonbuilding voxels. The proposed algorithm first voxelizes the LIDAR point cloud into a grayscale voxel structure in which the grayscale of the voxel corresponds to the quantized mean intensity of the LIDAR points within the voxel. The voxelized dataset is segmented into multiple 3D-connected regions depending on the connectivity and grayscale similarity among voxels. The 3D-connected regions corresponding to the building roof and facade are detected sequentially according to characteristics such as their area, density, elevation difference and location. The obtained results for the detected buildings are evaluated by the LIDAR data provided by working group III/4 of ISPRS, which demonstrate a high rate of success. Average completeness, correctness, quality, and kappa coefficient indexes values of 90.0%, 96.0%, 88.1% and 88.7%, respectively, are obtained for buildings."

Although GSH may still play a biological role in trypanosomatid parasites beyond being a building block of T(SH)2, most of its functions are replaced by T(SH)2 in these organisms. Consequently, trypanosomes have several enzymes adapted to using T(SH)2 instead of GSH, including the glutaredoxins (Grxs). However, the mechanistic basis of Grx specificity for T(SH)2 is unknown. Here, we combined fast-kinetic and biophysical approaches, including NMR, MS, and fluorescent tagging, to study the redox function of Grx1, the only cytosolic redox-active Grx in trypanosomes. We observed that Grx1 reduces GSH-containing disulfides (including oxidized trypanothione) in very fast reactions (k > 5 × 105 m−1 s−1). We also noted that disulfides without a GSH are much slower oxidants, suggesting a strongly selective binding of the GSH molecule. Not surprisingly, oxidized Grx1 was also reduced very fast by T(SH)2 (4.8 × 106 m−1 s−1); however, GSH-mediated reduction was extremely slow (39 m−1 s−1). This kinetic selectivity in the reduction step of the catalytic cycle suggests that Grx1 uses preferentially a dithiol mechanism, forming a disulfide on the active site during the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle and then being rapidly reduced by T(SH)2 in the reductive half. Thus, the reduction of glutathionylated substrates avoids GSSG accumulation in an organism lacking GSH reductase.

https://openalex.org/W2907640609,"Ion pairs are key stabilizing interactions between oppositely charged amino acid side chains in proteins. They are often depicted as single conformer salt bridges (hydrogen-bonded ion pairs) in crystal structures, but it is unclear how dynamic they are in solution. Ion pairs are thought to be particularly important in stabilizing single α-helix (SAH) domains in solution. These highly stable domains are rich in charged residues (such as Arg, Lys, and Glu) with potential ion pairs across adjacent turns of the helix. They provide a good model system to investigate how ion pairs can contribute to protein stability. Using NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray light scattering (SAXS), and molecular dynamics simulations, we provide here experimental evidence that ion pairs exist in a SAH in murine myosin 7a (residues 858-935), but that they are not fixed or long lasting. In silico modeling revealed that the ion pairs within this α-helix exhibit dynamic behavior, rapidly forming and breaking and alternating between different partner residues. The low-energy helical state was compatible with a great variety of ion pair combinations. Flexible ion pair formation utilizing a subset of those available at any one time avoided the entropic penalty of fixing side chain conformations, which likely contributed to helix stability overall. These results indicate the dynamic nature of ion pairs in SAHs. More broadly, thermodynamic stability in other proteins is likely to benefit from the dynamic behavior of multi-option solvent-exposed ion pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2907408476,"Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the affected genes. Hallmarks of polyQ diseases include the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, leading to neuronal degeneration and cell death. PolyQ diseases are currently incurable, highlighting the urgent need for approaches that inhibit the formation of disaggregate cytotoxic polyQ protein inclusions. Here, we screened for bisamidine-based inhibitors that can inhibit neuronal polyQ protein inclusions. We demonstrated that one inhibitor, AQAMAN, prevents polyQ protein aggregation and promotes de-aggregation of self-assembled polyQ proteins in several models of polyQ diseases. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that AQAMAN significantly reduces polyQ protein aggregation and specifically suppresses polyQ protein–induced cell death. Using a recombinant and purified polyQ protein (thioredoxin–Huntingtin–Q46), we further demonstrated that AQAMAN interferes with polyQ self-assembly, preventing polyQ aggregation, and dissociates preformed polyQ aggregates in a cell-free system. Remarkably, AQAMAN feeding of Drosophila expressing expanded polyQ disease protein suppresses polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. In addition, using inhibitors and activators of the autophagy pathway, we demonstrated that AQAMAN's cytoprotective effect against polyQ toxicity is autophagy-dependent. In summary, we have identified AQAMAN as a potential therapeutic for combating polyQ protein toxicity in polyQ diseases. Our findings further highlight the importance of the autophagy pathway in clearing harmful polyQ proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2907715905,"It can be difficult to recognise new instances of an unfamiliar face. Recognition errors in this particular situation appear to be viewpoint dependent with error rates increasing with the angular distance between the face views. Studies using front views for comparison have shown that recognising faces rotated in yaw can be difficult and that recognition of faces rotated in pitch is more challenging still. Here we investigate the extent to which viewpoint dependent face recognition depends on the comparison view. Participants were assigned to one of four different comparison view groups: front, ¾ yaw (right), ¾ pitch-up (above) or ¾ pitch-down (below). On each trial, participants matched their particular comparison view to a range of yaw or pitch rotated test views. Results showed that groups with a front or ¾ yaw comparison view had superior overall performance and more successful generalisation to a broader range of both pitch and yaw test views compared to groups with pitch-up or pitch-down comparison views, both of which had a very restricted generalisation range. Regression analyses revealed the importance of image similarity between views for generalisation, with a lesser role for 3D face depth. These findings are consistent with a view interpolation solution to view generalisation of face recognition, with front and ¾ yaw views being most informative."
https://openalex.org/W2907983100,"Assessment of lameness in cattle after foot surgery is important to monitor the recovery period, to improve the long-term success and the cows` welfare. This longitudinal multicenter retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of automated tools of weight bearing and gait analysis following foot surgery to support the clinician to monitor lameness in cattle. For this purpose, the effect of involvement of different anatomical structures and the use of different surgery methods on gait parameters of post-operative recovery was assessed. The study consisted of 2 experiments and included cattle with unilateral foot pathologies located in the digital region which needed 1 (experiment 1; n = 30) or 2 (experiment 2; n = 4) surgical interventions. The surgical techniques were debridement, joint lavage, partial resection of bones, tendons or synovial structures, total resection of the sesamoid bone and digit amputation. Two accelerometers (400 Hz; kinematic outcome = stance phase duration; kinetic outcome = foot load and toe-off), a 4-scale weighing platform (difference of mean weight distribution across the limbs; Δweight) and a subjective locomotion score were used to evaluate gait parameters every 3 to 4 days after surgery. A repeated measures ANOVA was used in experiment 1 and a receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values in experiment 2. Results showed that the differences across limbs for the pedogram variables of stance phases and peaks of foot load and toe-off, Δweight and the locomotion score were highest if joints or sesamoid bones were involved, suggesting that these cattle were more severely lame compared to cattle with more superficial foot pathologies. There was a significantly lower degree of lameness after surgical debridement and after digit amputation compared to partial and total resection of anatomical structures of the foot. The use of accelerometers and a 4-scale weighing platform represent promising objective tools for post-operative monitoring of lameness and can support the clinician in gait assessment to improve the long-term success of surgical interventions in the area of the foot."

Their role in chronic viral hepatitis C (CHC) and contribution to the progression of liver disease is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of secreted semaphorins with the severity of liver disease in patients with CHC. Serum concentrations of semaphorins were measured in 114 treatment-naive CHC patients and 36 healthy controls. Serum concentrations of SEMA3A, SEMA3C, SEMA5A, SEMA6B and SEMA6D were significantly increased in patients with CHC compared to controls. While serum concentrations of SEMA3C and SEMA6D significantly increased with fibrosis stage in both HCV-g1 and HCV-g3 infections, the concentration of SEMA5A inversely correlated with fibrosis stage in both HCV genotypes. ROC analysis showed that serum concentrations of SEMA3C (>4.0ng/mL, AUC 0.88) and SEMA6D (>4.5, AUC 0.82) had higher AUC than widely used APRI (AUC 0.71) and FIB-4 (AUC 0.74) scores. Serum concentrations of SEMA3C and SEMA6D significantly decreased after DAA and PEG IFN-α/ribavirin therapy, while the serum concentration of SEMA5A significantly increased after DAAs therapy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of SEMA3C and SEMA5A in hepatocytes, endothelial cells and lymphocytes of cirrhotic livers from CHC patients but not in controls. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that SEMA3C, SEMA5A and SEMA6D can be considered as markers of liver injury in CHC."

Although most well-known for its phosphodiesterase activity removing stalled topoisomerase 2 from DNA, TDP2 has also been shown to interact with both survival and apoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Moreover, it facilitates enterovirus replication and has been genetically linked to neurological disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease to dyslexia. To accurately evaluate TDP2 as a therapeutic target, we need to understand how TDP2 performs such a wide diversity of functions. Here, we use cancer cell lines modified with CRISPR/Cas9 or stably-expressed TDP2-targeted shRNA and transfection of various TDP2 mutants to show that its expression is regulated at the translational level via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that initiates translation at codon 54, the second in-frame methionine of the TDP2 coding sequence. We observed that this IRES drives expression of a shorter, N-terminally truncated isoform of TDP2, ΔN-TDP2, which omits a nuclear localization sequence. Additionally, we noted that ΔN-TDP2 retains phosphodiesterase activity and is protective against etoposide-induced cell death, but co-immunoprecipitates with fewer high-molecular-weight ubiquitinated peptide species, suggesting partial loss-of-function of TDP2's ubiquitin-association domain. In summary, our findings suggest the existence of an IRES in the 5′ coding sequence of TDP2 that translationally regulates expression of an N-terminally truncated, cytoplasmic isoform of TDP2. These results shed light on the regulation of this multifunctional protein and may inform the design of therapies targeting TDP2 and associated pathways.

Since higher protein intake during the first weeks of life predicted a healthier body composition in adulthood in our previous studies, we hypothesized that it would also predict a favorable cardiometabolic profile.The Helsinki Study of VLBW Adults includes 166 VLBW and preterm infants born between 1978 and 1985. We collected postnatal nutrition data among 125 unimpaired subjects, who attended two study visits at the mean ages of 22.5 and 25.1 years. We evaluated the effects of energy and macronutrient intakes during the first three 3-week periods of life on key cardiometabolic risk factors with multiple linear regression models. We also report results adjusted for prenatal, postnatal and adult characteristics.Macronutrient and energy intakes were not associated with blood pressure, heart rate, or lipid levels in adulthood. Intakes were neither associated with fasting glucose or most other markers of glucose metabolism. An exception was that the first-three-weeks-of-life intakes predicted higher fasting insulin levels: 1 g/kg/day higher protein intake by 37.6% (95% CI: 8.0%, 75.2%), and 10 kcal/kg/day higher energy intake by 8.6% (2.6%, 14.9%), when adjusted for sex and age. These early intakes similarly predicted the adult homeostasis model assessment index. Further adjustments strengthened these findings.Among VLBW infants with relatively low early energy intake, early macronutrient and energy intakes were unrelated to blood pressure, lipid levels and intravenous glucose tolerance test results. Contrary to our hypothesis, a higher macronutrient intake during the first three weeks of life predicted higher fasting insulin concentration in young adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2908213189,"Herd protection, resulting from the interruption of transmission and asymptomatic carriage, is an important element of the effectiveness of vaccines against the meningococcus. Whilst this has been well established for conjugate polysaccharide vaccines directed against the meningococcal capsule, two uncertainties surround the potential herd protection provided by the novel protein-based vaccines that are used in place of serogroup B (MenB) polysaccharide vaccines (i) the strain coverage of such vaccines against carried meningococci, which are highly diverse; and (ii) the generation of a protective immune response in the mucosa. These considerations are essential for realistic estimates of cost-effectiveness of new MenB vaccines. Here the first of these questions is addressed by the whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of meningococci isolated from healthy military recruits and university students in Greece. The study included a total of 71 MenB isolates obtained from 1420 oropharyngeal single swab samples collected from military recruits and university students on voluntary basis, aged 18-26 years. In addition to WGS analysis to identify genetic lineage and vaccine antigen genes, including the Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type (BAST), the isolates were examined with the serological Meningococcal antigen Typing System (MATS) assay. Comparison of these data demonstrated that the carried meningococcal population was highly diverse with 38% of the carriage isolates showed expression of antigens matching those included in the 4CMenB vaccine. Our data may suggest a limited potential herd immunity to be expected and be driven by an impact on a subset of carriage isolates."

However, due to the complexity of the angiogenic pathways there is a lack of valid predictive biomarkers for anti-angiogenic agents. Here, we describe and optimize a procedure for simultaneous dynamic profiling of multiple angiogenesis related proteins in patient serum to explore associations with the response and acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.Patients (n=22) were selected from a clinical trial investigating maintenance treatment with bevacizumab alone after response to induction chemotherapy + bevacizumab in mCRC. Serum samples were analysed for 55 unique angiogenesis related proteins using a commercial proteome profiler array and a publicly available image analysis program for quantification. Samples were collected at baseline before induction treatment start, at start of maintenance treatment, and at end of treatment after tumour progression.For eight proteins, the antibody array signals were below detection range in all patient samples. None of the proteins showed levels at baseline or at start of maintenance with strong evidence for correlation to time to progression (lowest nominal p-value 0.03). The dynamic ranges of protein levels measured during the induction treatment period and during the maintenance period were analysed separately for time trends. Evidence for changing trends (up/down) in the levels of MMP-8, TIMP-4 and EGF was observed both during response to induction treatment and at progressive disease, respectively. For three of the proteins (IL-8, Activin A and IGFBP-2), weak evidence for correlation between increasing protein levels during induction with chemotherapy and bevacizumab and time to progression was observed. In conclusion, semi-quantitative profiling of angiogenesis related proteins in patient serum may be a versatile tool to screen for protein patterns aiming at identifying resistance mechanisms of anti-angiogenic treatment in patients with mCRC."

https://openalex.org/W2907473814,"Background The agreement between invasive and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) readings in the first days of life of preterm infants is contentiously debated. Objective To compare mean, systolic and diastolic invasive (IBP) and non-invasive BP (NBP) readings obtained during routine care in the first four weeks of life of extremely preterm infants. Methods We extracted pairs of IBP and NBP readings obtained from preterm infants born below 28 weeks of gestation from the local database. After exclusion of erroneous measurements, we investigated the repeated measures correlation and analyzed the agreement (bias) and precision adjusted for multiple measurements per individual. Results Among 335 pairs of IBP and NBP readings obtained from 128 patients, we found correlation coefficients >0.65 for mean, systolic and diastolic BP values. The bias for mean BP readings was -0.4 mmHg (SD 6.1), for systolic BP readings 6.2 mmHg (SD 8.1), and for diastolic BP readings -4.3 mmHg (SD 6.5). Overestimation of systolic IBP and underestimation of diastolic IBP by the non-invasive measurement were found both in the group with gestational age from 23 to 25.9 weeks and in the group with gestational age from 26 to 27.9 weeks. Systolic NBP readings tended to exceed invasive readings in the range <50 mmHg (bias 9.9 mmHg) whereas diastolic NBP readings were lower than invasive values particularly in the range >30 mmHg (bias -5.5 mmHg). Conclusion The disagreement between invasive and non-invasive BP readings in infants extends to the first four weeks of life. Biases differ for mean, systolic and diastolic BP values. Our observation implies that they may depend on the range of the blood pressure. Awareness of these biases and preemptive concomitant use of IBP and NPB readings may contribute to reducing over- or under-treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2907548439,"Introduction Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgical procedure associated with high morbidity and prolonged length of stay. Enhanced recovery after surgery principles have reduced complications rate and length of stay for multiple types of operations. We hypothesized that implementation of a standardized perioperative care pathway would facilitate safe discharge by five days after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy 18 months prior to and 18 months following implementation of a perioperative care pathway at a quaternary center performing high volume pancreatic surgery. Results A total of 145 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (mean age 63 ± 10 years, 52% female), 81 before and 64 following pathway implementation, and the groups were similar in terms of preoperative comorbidities. The percentage of patients discharged within 5 days of surgery increased from 36% to 64% following pathway implementation (p = 0.001), with no observed differences in post-operative serious adverse events (p = 0.34), pancreatic fistula grade B or C (p = 0.28 and p = 0.27 respectively), or delayed gastric emptying (p = 0.46). Multivariate regression analysis showed length of stay ≤5 days three times more likely after pathway implementation. Rates of readmission within 30 days (20% pre- vs. 22% post-pathway (p = 0.75)) and 90 days (27% pre- vs. 36% post-pathway (p = 0.27)) were unchanged after pathway implementation, and were no different between patients discharged before or after day 5 at both 30 days (19% ≤5 days vs. 23% ≥ 6 days (p = 0.68)) and 90 days (32% ≤5 days vs. 30% ≥ 6 days (p = 0.81)). Conclusions Standardizing perioperative care via enhanced recovery protocols for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy facilitates safe discharge by post-operative day five."

This study evaluated the dose of PRRSV challenge needed to cause and maintain viraemia in PRRS Type 2 MLV-vaccinated pigs and assessed clinical responses to various doses of virulent challenge. This controlled, randomised, blinded vaccination-challenge study involved 95 pigs who were either vaccinated with 2 mL of a PRRS Type 2 MLV on Day 0 or left unvaccinated. On Day 28, pigs were challenged intranasally with virulent PRRSV isolate (dose range <1.5 to 4 log10 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL). Five pigs were left unchallenged and served as environmental controls. Viraemia levels, pyrexia, average daily weight gain and clinical signs were assessed. At all challenge doses, vaccinated groups had reduced viraemia levels and clinical signs, and higher average daily weight gain compared with non-vaccinated groups. Vaccinated groups challenged with ≤2 log had similar viraemia levels and clinical performance (days pyrexic and average daily weight gain) as the non-challenged group. Vaccinated groups had significantly reduced pyrexic days compared with non-vaccinated groups across all challenge doses (P <.05). Vaccinated pigs challenged with <3 log had significantly improved average daily weight gain (P <.05). In vaccinated groups, challenge dose correlated positively with viraemia levels and number of days pyrexic, and negatively with average daily weight gain. This is the first study to use a challenge-dose model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination against PRRSV. PRRS Type 2 MLV was shown to mitigate the consequences of PRRSV infection at all evaluated PRRSV challenge doses. Lower levels of challenge had minimal impact on health and performance of vaccinated pigs, supporting the benefit of vaccinating swine with PRRS Type 2 MLV."

First, word-context co-occurrence counts were collected using corpora of transcribed English child-directed speech.

The categorization outcome was regressed over three main distributional predictors computed for each word, including frequency, contextual diversity, and average conditional probability given all the co-occurring contexts. Results show that both contextual diversity and frequency have a positive effect while the average conditional probability has a negative effect. This indicates that words are easier to categorize in the face of uncertainty: categorization works best for words which are frequent, diverse, and hard to predict given the co-occurring contexts. This shows how, in order for the learner to see an opportunity to form a category, there needs to be a certain degree of uncertainty in the co-occurrence pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2908061163,"The life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent responsible for malaria, depends on both cytosolic and apicoplast translation fidelity. Apicoplast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are bacterial-like enzymes devoted to organellar tRNA aminoacylation. They are all encoded by the nuclear genome and are translocated into the apicoplast only after cytosolic biosynthesis. Apicoplast aaRSs contain numerous idiosyncratic sequence insertions: An understanding of the roles of these insertions has remained elusive and they hinder efforts to heterologously overexpress these proteins. Moreover, the A/T rich content of the Plasmodium genome leads to A/U rich apicoplast tRNA substrates that display structural plasticity. Here, we focus on the P. falciparum apicoplast tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Pf-apiTyrRS) and its cognate tRNATyr substrate (Pf-apitRNATyr). Cloning and expression strategies used to obtain an active and functional recombinant Pf-apiTyrRS are reported. Functional analyses established that only three weak identity elements in the apitRNATyr promote specific recognition by the cognate Pf-apiTyrRS and that positive identity elements usually found in the tRNATyr acceptor stem are excluded from this set. This finding brings to light an unusual behavior for a tRNATyr aminoacylation system and suggests that Pf-apiTyrRS uses primarily negative recognition elements to direct tyrosylation specificity."

Second, we show that the optimal control problem admits an optimal control and present the optimality system for solving the optimal control problem. Next, we solve some optimal control models to get their respective optimal dynamic discount pricing strategies. Finally, we examine the effect of some factors on the maximum marketing profit. These results contribute to gaining insight into viral marketing."

In hypertensive rodents, pre-stroke craniotomy increased survival and decreased body weight loss post-MCAO. Here we determined the effect, in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats following 60 minutes MCAO, with or without pre-surgical craniotomy, on post-stroke outcomes in terms of weight loss, neurological deficit, lesion volume and functional outcomes. There was no effect of pre-stroke craniotomy on indicators of wellbeing including survival rate (P = 0.32), body weight loss (P = 0.42) and neurological deficit (P = 0.75). We also assessed common outcome measures following experimental stroke and found no effect of pre-stroke craniotomy on lesion volume as measured by T2-weighted MRI (P = 0.846), or functional performance up to 28 days post-MCAO (staircase test, P = 0.32; adhesive sticker test, P = 0.49; cylinder test, P = 0.38). Thus, pre-stroke craniotomy did not improve animal welfare in terms of body weight loss and neurological deficit. However, it is important, given that a number of drug delivery studies utilise the craniotomy procedure, to note that there was no effect on lesion volume or functional outcome following experimental stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2908348540,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious lesions that can arise in cells after ionizing radiation or radiometric drug treatment. In addition to prompt DSBs, DSBs may also be produced during repair, evolving from a clustered DNA damaged site, which is composed of two or more distinct lesions that are located within two helical turns. A specific type of cluster damage is the heat-sensitive clustered site (HSCS), which transforms into DSBs upon treatment at elevated temperatures. The actual lesions or mechanisms that mediate the HSCS transformation into DSBs are unknown. However, there are two possibilities; either these lesions are transformed into DSBs due to DNA lesion instability, e.g., transfer of HSCS into single-strand breaks (SSBs), or they are formed due to local DNA structure instability, e.g., DNA melting, where two SSBs on opposite strands meet and transform into a DSB. The importance of these processes in living cells is not understood, but they significantly affect estimates of DSB repair capacity. In this study, we show that HSCS removal in human cells is not affected by defects in DSB repair or inhibition of DSB repair. Under conditions where rejoining of prompt DSBs was almost completely inhibited, heat-sensitive DSBs were successfully rejoined, without resulting in increased DSB levels, indicating that HSCS do not transfer into DSB in cells under physiological conditions. Furthermore, analysis by atomic force microscopy suggests that prolonged heating of chromosomal DNA can induce structural changes that facilitate transformation of HSCS into DSB. In conclusion, the HSCS do not generate additional DSBs at physiological temperatures in human cells, and the repair of HSCS is independent of DSB repair."
