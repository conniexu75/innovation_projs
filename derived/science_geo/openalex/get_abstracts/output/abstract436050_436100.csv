https://openalex.org/W2098668286,"Adipose tissues regulate metabolism, reproduction, and life span. The development and growth of adipose tissue are due to increases of both adipocyte cell size and cell number; the latter is mediated by adipocyte progenitors. Various markers have been used to identify either adipocyte progenitors or mature adipocytes. The fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), commonly known as adipocyte protein 2 (aP2), has been extensively used as a marker for differentiated adipocytes. However, whether aP2 is expressed in adipogenic progenitors is controversial. Using Cre/LoxP-based cell lineage tracing in mice, we have identified a population of aP2-expressing progenitors in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of both white and brown adipose tissues. The aP2-lineage progenitors reside in the adipose stem cell niche and express adipocyte progenitor markers, including CD34, Sca1, Dlk1, and PDGFRα. When isolated and grown in culture, the aP2-expressing SVF cells proliferate and differentiate into adipocytes upon induction. Conversely, ablation of the aP2 lineage greatly reduces the adipogenic potential of SVF cells. When grafted into wild-type mice, the aP2-lineage progenitors give rise to adipose depots in recipient mice. Therefore, the expression of aP2 is not limited to mature adipocytes, but also marks a pool of undifferentiated progenitors associated with the vasculature of adipose tissues. Our finding adds to the repertoire of adipose progenitor markers and points to a new regulator of adipose plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2079374878,"Autonomic dysfunction is a well-known feature in neurodegenerative dementias, especially common in α-synucleinopathies like dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease with dementia. The most common symptoms are orthostatic hypotension, incontinence and constipation, but its relevance in clinical practice is poorly understood. There are no earlier studies addressing the influence of autonomic dysfunction on clinical course and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the three most common features of autonomic dysfunction and analyze how it affects survival.Thirty patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease with dementia were included in this prospective, longitudinal follow-up study. Presence of incontinence and constipation was recorded at baseline. Blood pressure was measured at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months according to standardized procedures, with 5 measurements during 10 minutes after rising. Orthostatic hypotension was defined using consensus definitions and persistent orthostatic hypotension was defined as 5 or more measurements with orthostatic hypotension. Difference in survival was analyzed 36 months after baseline.There was a high frequency of persistent orthostatic blood pressure (50%), constipation (30%) and incontinence (30%). Patients with persistent orthostatic hypotension had a significantly shorter survival compared to those with no or non-persistent orthostatic hypotension (Log rank x(2) = 4.47, p = 0.034). Patients with constipation and/or urinary incontinence, in addition to persistent orthostatic hypotension, had a poorer prognosis compared to those with isolated persistent orthostatic hypotension or no orthostatic hypotension (Log rank x(2) = 6.370, p = 0.041).According to our findings, the identification of autonomic dysfunction seems to be of great importance in clinical practice, not only to avoid falls and other complications, but also as a possible predictor of survival."

Because cerebral deposition of Aβ species might be critical for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, BACE1 has emerged as a key target for the treatment of this disease. Here, we report the discovery and comprehensive preclinical characterization of AZD3839, a potent and selective inhibitor of human BACE1. AZD3839 was identified using fragment-based screening and structure-based design. In a concentration-dependent manner, AZD3839 inhibited BACE1 activity in a biochemical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, Aβ and sAPPβ release from modified and wild-type human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse N2A cells as well as from mouse and guinea pig primary cortical neurons. Selectivity against BACE2 and cathepsin D was 14 and >1000-fold, respectively. AZD3839 exhibited dose- and time-dependent lowering of plasma, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ levels in mouse, guinea pig, and non-human primate. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of mouse and guinea pig data showed a good correlation between the potency of AZD3839 in primary cortical neurons and in vivo brain effects. These results suggest that AZD3839 effectively reduces the levels of Aβ in brain, CSF, and plasma in several preclinical species. It might, therefore, have disease-modifying potential in the treatment of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. Based on the overall pharmacological profile and its drug like properties, AZD3839 has been progressed into Phase 1 clinical trials in man. β-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) is one of the key enzymes involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and formation of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) species.

https://openalex.org/W2039275997,"Six volunteers experienced severe inflammatory response during the Phase I clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody that was designed to stimulate a regulatory T cell response. Soon after the trial began, each volunteer experienced a “cytokine storm”, a dramatic increase in cytokine concentrations. The monoclonal antibody, TGN1412, raised serum concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines το very hiγh values during the first day, while lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations plummeted. Because the subjects were healthy and had no prior indications of immune deficiency, this event provided an unusual opportunity to study the dynamic interactions of cytokines and other measured parameters. Here, the response histories of nine cytokines have been modeled by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. A general search procedure identifies parameters of the model, whose response fits the data well during the five-day measurement period. The eighteenth-order model reveals plausible cause-and-effect relationships among the cytokines, showing how each cytokine induces or inhibits other cytokines. It suggests that perturbations in IL2, IL8, and IL10 have the most significant inductive effect, while IFN-γ and IL12 have the greatest inhibiting effect on other cytokine concentrations. Although TNF-α is a major pro-inflammatory factor, IFN-γ and three other cytokines have faster initial and median response to TGN1412 infusion. Principal-component analysis of the data reveals three clusters of similar cytokine responses: [TNF-α, IL1, IL10], [IFN-γ, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. IL1, IL6, IL10, and TNF-α have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates. This study illuminates details of a cytokine storm event, and it demonstrates the value of linear modeling for interpreting complex, coupled biological system dynamics from empirical data."
https://openalex.org/W2074814578,"Skeletal muscle responds to passive overstretch through sarcomerogenesis, the creation and serial deposition of new sarcomere units. Sarcomerogenesis is critical to muscle function: It gradually re-positions the muscle back into its optimal operating regime. Animal models of immobilization, limb lengthening, and tendon transfer have provided significant insight into muscle adaptation in vivo. Yet, to date, there is no mathematical model that allows us to predict how skeletal muscle adapts to mechanical stretch in silico. Here we propose a novel mechanistic model for chronic longitudinal muscle growth in response to passive mechanical stretch. We characterize growth through a single scalar-valued internal variable, the serial sarcomere number. Sarcomerogenesis, the evolution of this variable, is driven by the elastic mechanical stretch. To analyze realistic three-dimensional muscle geometries, we embed our model into a nonlinear finite element framework. In a chronic limb lengthening study with a muscle stretch of 1.14, the model predicts an acute sarcomere lengthening from 3.09m to 3.51m, and a chronic gradual return to the initial sarcomere length within two weeks. Compared to the experiment, the acute model error was 0.00% by design of the model; the chronic model error was 2.13%, which lies within the rage of the experimental standard deviation. Our model explains, from a mechanistic point of view, why gradual multi-step muscle lengthening is less invasive than single-step lengthening. It also explains regional variations in sarcomere length, shorter close to and longer away from the muscle-tendon interface. Once calibrated with a richer data set, our model may help surgeons to prevent muscle overstretch and make informed decisions about optimal stretch increments, stretch timing, and stretch amplitudes. We anticipate our study to open new avenues in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery and enhance treatment for patients with ill proportioned limbs, tendon lengthening, tendon transfer, tendon tear, and chronically retracted muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2082009815,"During development of the cerebral cortex, neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo a temporal switch from proliferative (symmetric) to neuron-generating (asymmetric) divisions. We investigated the role of Schwann cell factor 1 (SC1/PRDM4), a member of the PRDM family of transcription factors, in this critical transition. We discovered that SC1 recruits the chromatin modifier PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase that catalyzes symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3me2s) and that this modification is preferentially associated with undifferentiated cortical NSCs. Overexpressing SC1 in embryonic NSCs led to an increase in the number of Nestin-expressing precursors; mutational analysis of SC1 showed that this was dependent on recruitment of PRMT5. We found that SC1 protein levels are down-regulated at the onset of neurogenesis and that experimental knockdown of SC1 in primary NSCs triggers precocious neuronal differentiation. We propose that SC1 and PRMT5 are components of an epigenetic regulatory complex that maintains the “stem-like” cellular state of the NSC by preserving their proliferative capacity and modulating their cell cycle progression.

https://openalex.org/W2084698827,"The formation of hybrids of nanofibrillated cellulose and titania nanoparticles in aqueous media has been studied. Their transparency and mechanical behavior have been assessed by spectrophotometry and nanoindentation. The results show that limiting the titania nanoparticle concentration below 16 vol% yields homogeneous hybrids with a very high Young's modulus and hardness, of up to 44 GPa and 3.4 GPa, respectively, and an optical transmittance above 80%. Electron microscopy shows that higher nanoparticle contents result in agglomeration and an inhomogeneous hybrid nanostructure with a concomitant reduction of hardness and optical transmittance. Infrared spectroscopy suggests that the nanostructure of the hybrids is controlled by electrostatic adsorption of the titania nanoparticles on the negatively charged nanocellulose surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2148616314,"We test a recently proposed model of commuting networks on 80 case studies from different regions of the world (Europe and United-States) and with geographic units of different sizes (municipality, county, region). The model takes as input the number of commuters coming in and out of each geographic unit and generates the matrix of commuting flows betwen the geographic units. We show that the single parameter of the model, which rules the compromise between the influence of the distance and job opportunities, follows a universal law that depends only on the average surface of the geographic units. We verified that the law derived from a part of the case studies yields accurate results on other case studies. We also show that our model significantly outperforms the two other approaches proposing a universal commuting model (Balcan et al. (2009); Simini et al. (2012)), particularly when the geographic units are small (e.g. municipalities)."

Gap junction channels communicate the cytoplasms of two cells and are formed by head to head association of two hemichannels, one from each of the cells. Gap junction channels and hemichannels are permeable to ions and hydrophilic molecules of up to M(r) 1,000, including second messengers and metabolites. Intercellular Ca(2+) signaling can occur by movement of a number of second messengers, including Ca(2+), through gap junction channels, or by a paracrine pathway that involves activation of purinergic receptors in neighboring cells following ATP release through hemichannels. Understanding Ca(2+) permeation through Cx26 hemichannels is important to assess the role of gap junction channels and hemichannels in health and disease. In this context, it is possible that increased Ca(2+) influx through hemichannels under ischemic conditions contributes to cell damage. Previous studies suggest Ca(2+) permeation through hemichannels, based on indirect arguments. Here, we demonstrate for the first time hemichannel permeability to Ca(2+) by measuring Ca(2+) transport through purified Cx26 hemichannels reconstituted in liposomes. We trapped the low affinity Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo-5N into the liposomes and followed the increases in intraliposomal [Ca(2+)] in response to an imposed [Ca(2+)] gradient. We show that Ca(2+) does move through Cx26 hemichannels and that the permeability of the hemichannels to Ca(2+) is high, similar to that for Na(+). We suggest that hemichannels can be a significant pathway for Ca(2+) influx into cells under conditions such as ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1985750241,"Recent studies have shown that Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in Pailin province, along the border between Thailand and Cambodia, have become resistant to artemisinin derivatives. To better define the epidemiology of P. falciparum populations and to assess the risk of the possible spread of these parasites outside Pailin, a new epidemiological tool named ""Focused Screening and Treatment"" (FSAT), based on active molecular detection of asymptomatic parasite carriers was introduced in 2010. Cross-sectional malariometric surveys using PCR were carried out in 20 out of 109 villages in Pailin province. Individuals detected as P. falciparum carriers were treated with atovaquone-proguanil combination plus a single dose of primaquine if the patient was non-G6PD deficient. Interviews were conducted to elicit history of cross-border travel that might contribute to the spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites. After directly observed treatment, patients were followed up and re-examined on day 7 and day 28. Among 6931 individuals screened, prevalence of P. falciparum carriers was less than 1%, of whom 96% were asymptomatic. Only 1.6% of the individuals had a travel history or plans to go outside Cambodia, with none of those tested being positive for P. falciparum. Retrospective analysis, using 2010 routine surveillance data, showed significant differences in the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers discovered by FSAT between villages classified as ""high risk"" and ""low risk"" based on malaria incidence data. All positive individuals treated and followed-up until day 28 were cured. No mutant-type allele related to atovaquone resistance was found. FSAT is a potentially useful tool to detect, treat and track clusters of asymptomatic carriers of P. falciparum along with providing valuable epidemiological information regarding cross-border movements of potential malaria parasite carriers and parasite gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W1979412088,"The envelope of the influenza virus undergoes extensive structural change during the viral life cycle. However, it is unknown how lipid and protein components of the viral envelope contribute to its mechanical properties. Using atomic force microscopy, here we show that the lipid envelope of spherical influenza virions is ∼10 times softer (∼0.05 nanonewton nm(-1)) than a viral protein-capsid coat and sustains deformations of one-third of the virion's diameter. Compared with phosphatidylcholine liposomes, it is twice as stiff, due to membrane-attached protein components. We found that virus indentation resulted in a biphasic force-indentation response. We propose that the first phase, including a stepwise reduction in stiffness at ∼10-nm indentation and ∼100 piconewtons of force, is due to mobilization of membrane proteins by the indenting atomic force microscope tip, consistent with the glycoprotein ectodomains protruding ∼13 nm from the bilayer surface. This phase was obliterated for bromelain-treated virions with the ectodomains removed. Following pH 5 treatment, virions were as soft as pure liposomes, consistent with reinforcing proteins detaching from the lipid bilayer. We propose that the soft, pH-dependent mechanical properties of the envelope are critical for the pH-regulated life cycle and support the persistence of the virus inside and outside the host."
https://openalex.org/W2004322755,"Cigarette smoke (CigS) exposure is associated with increased bronchial epithelial permeability and impaired barrier function. Primary cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to CigS exhibit decreased E-cadherin expression and reduced transepithelial electrical resistance. These effects were mediated by hyaluronan (HA) because inhibition of its synthesis with 4-methylumbelliferone prevented these effects, and exposure to HA fragments of <70 kDa mimicked these effects. We show that the HA receptor layilin is expressed apically in human airway epithelium and that cells infected with lentivirus expressing layilin siRNAs were protected against increased permeability triggered by both CigS and HA. We identified RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) as the signaling effectors downstream layilin. We conclude that HA fragments generated by CigS bind to layilin and signal through Rho/ROCK to inhibit the E-cadherin gene and protein expression, leading to a loss of epithelial cell-cell contact. These studies suggest that HA functions as a master switch protecting or disrupting the epithelial barrier in its high versus low molecular weight form and that its depolymerization is a first and necessary step triggering the inflammatory response to CigS.

https://openalex.org/W1969280935,"The amount and quality of nutrients consumed by organisms have a strong impact on stress resistance, life-history traits and reproduction. The balance between energy acquisition and expenditure is crucial to the survival and reproductive success of animals. The ability of organisms to adjust their development, physiology or behavior in response to environmental conditions, called phenotypic plasticity, is a defining property of life. One of the most familiar and important examples of phenotypic plasticity is the response of stress tolerance and reproduction to changes in developmental nutrition. Larval nutrition may affect a range of different life-history traits as well as responses to environmental stress in adult.Here we investigate the effect of larval nutrition on desiccation, starvation, chill-coma recovery, heat resistance as well as egg to adult viability, egg production and ovariole number in Drosophila ananassae. We raised larvae on either protein rich diet or carbohydrate rich diet. We found that flies consuming protein rich diet have higher desiccation and heat shock resistance whereas flies developed on carbohydrate rich diet have higher starvation and cold resistance. Egg production was higher in females developed on protein rich diet and we also found trade-off between egg production and Egg to adult viability of the flies. Viability was higher in carbohydrate rich diet. However, sex specific viability was found in different nutritional regimes. Higher Egg production might be due to higher ovariole number in females of protein rich diet.Thus, Drosophila ananassae adapts different stress tolerance and life-history strategies according to the quality of the available diet, which are correlated with phenotypic adjustment at anatomical and physiological levels."
https://openalex.org/W1991512152,"In many insect species olfaction is a key sensory modality. However, examination of the chemical ecology of insects has focussed up to now on insects living above ground. Evidence for behavioral responses to chemical cues in the soil other than CO2 is scarce and the role played by olfaction in the process of finding host roots below ground is not yet understood. The question of whether soil-dwelling beetle larvae can smell their host plant roots has been under debate, but proof is as yet lacking that olfactory perception of volatile compounds released by damaged host plants, as is known for insects living above ground, occurs. Here we show that soil-dwelling larvae of Melolontha hippocastani are well equipped for olfactory perception and respond electrophysiologically and behaviorally to volatiles released by damaged host-plant roots. An olfactory apparatus consisting of pore plates at the antennae and about 70 glomeruli as primary olfactory processing units indicates a highly developed olfactory system. Damage induced host plant volatiles released by oak roots such as eucalyptol and anisol are detected by larval antennae down to 5 ppbv in soil air and elicit directed movement of the larvae in natural soil towards the odor source. Our results demonstrate that plant-root volatiles are likely to be perceived by the larval olfactory system and to guide soil-dwelling white grubs through the dark below ground to their host plants. Thus, to find below-ground host plants cockchafer larvae employ mechanisms that are similar to those employed by the adult beetles flying above ground, despite strikingly different physicochemical conditions in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2126044189,"The emerging demand for programmable functionalization of existing base nanocarriers necessitates development of an efficient approach for cargo loading that avoids nanoparticle redesign for each individual application. Herein, we demonstrate in vivo a postformulation strategy for lipidic nanocarrier functionalization with the use of a linker peptide, which rapidly and stably integrates cargos into lipidic membranes of nanocarriers after simple mixing through a self-assembling process. We exemplified this strategy by generating a VCAM-1-targeted perfluorocarbon nanoparticle for in vivo targeting in atherosclerosis (ApoE-deficient) and breast cancer (STAT-1-deficient) models. In the atherosclerotic model, a 4.1-fold augmentation in binding to affected aortas was observed for targeted vs. nontargeted nanoparticles (P<0.0298). Likewise, in the breast cancer model, a 4.9-fold increase in the nanoparticle signal from tumor vasculature was observed for targeted vs. nontargeted nanoparticles (P<0.0216). In each case, the nanoparticle was registered with fluorine ((19)F) magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the nanoparticle perfluorocarbon core, yielding a quantitative estimate of the number of tissue-bound nanoparticles. Because other common nanocarriers with lipid coatings (e.g., liposomes, micelles, etc.) can employ this strategy, this peptide linker postformulation approach is applicable to more than half of the available nanosystems currently in clinical trials or clinical uses."
https://openalex.org/W1965983565,"After a long period of stagnation, traditionally explained by the voluntary nature of the programme, a considerable increase in routine measles vaccine uptake has been recently observed in Italy after a set of public interventions aiming to promote MMR immunization, whilst retaining its voluntary aspect. To account for this take-off in coverage we propose a simple SIR transmission model with vaccination choice, where, unlike similar works, vaccinating behaviour spreads not only through the diffusion of “private” information spontaneously circulating among parents of children to be vaccinated, which we call imitation, but also through public information communicated by the public health authorities. We show that public intervention has a stabilising role which is able to reduce the strength of imitation-induced oscillations, to allow disease elimination, and to even make the disease-free equilibrium where everyone is vaccinated globally attractive. The available Italian data are used to evaluate the main behavioural parameters, showing that the proposed model seems to provide a much more plausible behavioural explanation of the observed take-off of uptake of vaccine against measles than models based on pure imitation alone."

In the current study, we set out to explore pathogenic mechanisms mediated by ERK1/2 activation in the pathogenesis of LMNA cardiomyopathy. We focused on the Dusp family of phosphatases, which catalyze dephosphorylation of tyrosine and serine/threonine residues on MAP kinases, some of which are induced in an ERK1/2-dependent manner, and establish feedback inhibition (11Brondello J.M.

Dusp4 transgenic mice were generated at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center Transgenic Mouse Facility (Columbia University Medical Center). Dusp4 cDNA was subcloned into pPSKII-MHC-GH downstream of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter and upstream of a human growth hormone polyadenylation signal. Minigenes of ∼7.3 kb containing Dusp4 cDNA were microinjected into superovulated CBA/B6F1 fertilized oocytes and transferred to pseudopregnant females. One surviving founder, identified by PCR of extracted DNA from tails using primer sets indicated in supplemental Table S3, was backcrossed to WT B6/CBAF1 to produce male transgenic positive breeders (F1). The male breeders were backcrossed to female WT CBA/B6F1 (F2) to obtain an adequate number of mice for the experiments. Only F2 mice were used in the study. Autophagy was induced in vivo by fasting mice (given only water) for 24 h. RNAseq and data analysis were performed at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center Next Generation Sequencing Laboratory (Columbia University Medical Center). Briefly, total RNA from mouse ventricular tissue of 8-week-old Dusp4 Tg+ and Tg− mice (n = 3/group) was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA from the isolated RNA was generated using TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit v2 followed by library construction with TruSeq single-read cluster kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). The resulting cDNA library was sequenced with HiSeq 2000 genome analyzer (Illumina) using 2 × 107 single-ended 100 base pair reads. Sequenced reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome UCSC version mm9 with TopHat version 1.3.3, and differentially expressed genes were assessed using Cuffdiff, a part of the Cufflinks version 1.3.0 package (14Trapnell C.

Differential gene and transcript expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with TopHat and Cufflinks.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 562-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A scatter plot was generated using multiplot function from Genepattern (15Reich M. Liefeld T. Gould J. Lerner J. Tamayo P. Mesirov J.P. GenePattern 2.0.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes (as determined by Cuffdiff, q < 0.05) were separated into the up-regulated or down-regulated list. The gene lists were further filtered to eliminate low expressing genes (Cuffdiff expression value <1). The filtered gene lists were separately entered into DAVID to identify enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The resulting functional clusters were filtered based on enrichment score and p value. Classification stringency was set to “high,” which resulted in a more defined GO terms with sizable number of genes grouped into annotated clusters. C2C12 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and subcultured at ∼60–70% confluency. Unmodified and stable C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Viral packaging cell line 293T cells were maintained in the same media. WT AMPKγ1, AMPKγ1 H150R, WT AMPKα2, and K45R AMPKα2 were obtained from Addgene. Working concentrations of 200 μm 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng ml−1 EGF (MP Biomedicals), 100 μm H2O2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 200 nm insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 ng ml−1 TGF-β (PeproTech) were prepared from stocks dissolved in water. Working concentrations of 4 μm ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 μm PD98059 (EMD Biosciences) were prepared from stocks dissolved in Me2SO. Glucose uptake was measured using a glucose assay kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were plated onto 10-cm plates, and the media were replaced 8 h later after cell attachment. The cells were incubated for 48 h, after which glucose consumption was calculated by subtracting glucose concentrations in culture media from the original 25 mm glucose concentration in DMEM. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) activity converting NAD+ to NADH was measured in extracts from 50 mg of mouse ventricular tissue using the isocitrate dehydrogenase activity assay kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol and cDNAs generated from 1 μg primed with a 1:1 ratio of random hexameric primers and oligo(dT) using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase II (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed on an ABI 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green (USB). qPCR primers for Acadl, Atf4, cFos, cJun, Col1a1, Col1a2, Elk4, Fn1, Hprt, Idh3a, Myl7, Myl4, Nppa, Nppb, Pdk4, Pkm2, and Sln have been described elsewhere (6Muchir A.

Hprt mRNA was assessed to ensure equal fidelity in enzymatic reactions and was used as internal control to normalize qPCR results. Fold changes in gene expression were determined by the ΔΔCt method and are presented as fold change over WT controls. Whole cell extracts were isolated using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. 15–30 μg were loaded for SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: phospho-ACC (antibody 3661), ACC (antibody 3676), phospho-AKT (Ser-473 antibody 4060, Thr-308 antibody 4056), AKT (antibody 4691), phospho-AMPKα (Thr-172 antibody 2535), AMPKα (antibody 2532), phospho-ERK1/2 (antibody 9101), LC3B (antibody 2775), phospho-MEK1/2 (antibody 9121), MEK1/2 (antibody 9122), phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448 antibody 2971), mTOR (antibody 2972), p62/SQSTM1 (antibody 5114), phospho-S6 (Ser-240/244 antibody 2215), S6 (antibody 2217), phospho-ULK1 (Ser-757 antibody 6888), and ULK1 (antibody 8054). The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: ERK1/2 (sc-94), Dusp4 (sc-1200), lamin A (sc-20680), β-actin (sc-47778), and α-tubulin (sc-12462-R). Quantification of blots was performed with ImageJ (18Abramoff M.D. Magalhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Image Processing with ImageJ.Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar), normalized to loading controls as indicated, and presented as arbitrary units or fold change over untreated or WT controls. H222P-lamin A point mutant was generated from WT cDNA using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), which replaced an adenine to a cytosine at nucleotide 665. WT lamin A or H222P-lamin A and FLAG coding sequences were cloned into pBabe-puro (Addgene). Murine Dusp4 cDNA was isolated from reverse transcribed C2C12 mRNA and cloned into pBabe-puro. pBabe-retro vectors encoding lamin A, H222P-lamin A, Dusp4, GFP-LC3 (Addgene), and pBabe vector with no insert were co-transfected with pCL-Eco into 293T cells to generate retroviruses. For stable knockdown of Dusp4, we used three independent shRNAs in pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Open Biosystems) targeting the following sequences: CAATCACTTTGAGGGTCATTA (Sh1), CGAGTACATCGACGCAGTAAA, and GTCTCTTCAGACTGTCCCAAT (data not shown). The lentiviral vectors were co-transfected into 293T cells with the packaging vectors pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene). DNA sequencing was performed at the DNA sequencing lab at Columbia University Medical Center to confirm all constructs. Virus-infected cells were selected with 2 μg ml−1 puromycin. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on stable C2C12 cells using standard protocols with FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunofluorescence images were captured using a LSM 510 confocal laser scanning system (Carl Zeiss) in the Confocal and Specialized Microscopy Core at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (Columbia University Medical Center) using the 488-nm line of argon laser. For fluorescence microscopy of stable C2C12 cells expressing GFP-LC3B, fixed cells were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) and visualized under a DP72 fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Fluorescent images were captured using DP72 basic software package, and the image analysis (puncta count) was performed manually using ImageJ (18Abramoff M.D. Magalhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Image Processing with ImageJ.Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Dusp4 transgenic mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane and placed on a heating pad (37 °C) attached to an electrocardiographic monitor. Echocardiography was performed using Vevo 770 imaging system (VisualSonics) equipped with a 30-MHz transducer. The parameters were measured for at least three cardiac cycles. A “blinded” echocardiographer performed the examinations and interpreted the results. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining was performed using the Dead Cell apoptosis kit with annexin V Alexa Fluor® 488 and propidium iodide (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence signals were acquired using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). To induce autophagy, stable C2C12 cells cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS were gradually adapted to 10% bovine calf serum (BCS) (Invitrogen) over a 48-h period. Following adaptation to BCS, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with glucose and sodium pyruvate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) with or without 10% BCS for indicated times. Alternatively, C2C12 cells in DMEM with 10% BCS were treated with 100 nm temsirolimus (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h. Lysosomal protease inhibition during glucose deprivation was performed by adding 10 μg ml−1 pepstatin and 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin (both Sigma-Aldrich) in glucose- and sodium pyruvate-free DMEM with 10% BCS. Graphpad (Prism Software) was used to perform statistical analyses. Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test with a value of p < 0.05 considered significant. Values with error bars shown in the figures are the means ± standard errors of means. The sample sizes are indicated in the figure legends. Statistically significant enrichment with DAVID was based on the Fisher's exact test p value with p < 0.05 considered significant and enrichment score (negative log of averaged p values of all subclusters). We originally focused on the Dusp family of phosphatases, with the initial intent of understanding the mechanism of ERK1/2 activation. This was based on the observation that activation of MEK1/2, an upstream kinase that phosphorylates ERK1/2, was not observed in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice (data not shown), suggesting a defect in ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Of 12 Dusp mRNAs assessed by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), we observed a specific increase of Dusp4 (∼4-fold) in hearts of 16-week-old male LmnaH222P/H222P mice (Fig. 1A). This was contrary to our expectation and suggested that high Dusp4 expression resulted from ERK1/2 activation. Enhanced Dusp4 mRNA expression was observed in cardiac and to a lesser extent (∼2-fold) in quadriceps muscle but not in other tissues examined (Fig. 1B). It was observed in hearts from LmnaH222P/H222P and Lmna−/− mouse models of LMNA cardiomyopathy (13Arimura T. Helbling-Leclerc A. Massart C. Varnous S. Niel F. Lacène E. Fromes Y. Toussaint M.

Invest. 2007; 117: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that also develop dilated cardiomyopathy (Fig. 1C). Dusp4 mRNA and the encoded protein were both increased in hearts of 4-week-old LmnaH222P/H222P mice, coincident with ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 1D). Enhanced Dusp4 expression occurred prior to detectable signs of cardiomyopathy (13Arimura T. Helbling-Leclerc A. Massart C. Varnous S. Niel F. Lacène E. Fromes Y. Toussaint M. Mura A.M. Keller D.I. Amthor H. Isnard R. Malissen M. Schwartz K. Bonne G. Mouse model carrying H222P-Lmna mutation develops muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy similar to human striated muscle laminopathies.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and up-regulation of natriuretic factors encoded by Nppa and Nppb (Fig. 1E), which are expressed as a consequence of left ventricular dilatation. Similarly high Dusp4 expression occurred in female LmnaH222P/H222P mice but with delayed kinetics (data not shown), consistent with the later onset of cardiomyopathy relative to male mice (13Arimura T. Helbling-Leclerc A. Massart C. Varnous S. Niel F. Lacène E. Fromes Y. Toussaint M. Mura A.M. Keller D.I. Amthor H. Isnard R. Malissen M. Schwartz K. Bonne G.

Genet. 2005; 14: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hence, Dusp4 appears to be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy rather than affected as a consequence. To dissect the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for enhanced Dusp4 expression in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice, we used C2C12 cell culture model. Although C2C12 cells are myoblasts of murine skeletal muscle origin, they are relatively easy to culture and genetically manipulate and have or can adopt some features of cardiomyocytes (21McMahon D.K. Anderson P.A. Nassar R. Bunting J.B. Saba Z. Oakeley A.E. Malouf N.N. C2C12 cells. Biophysical, biochemical, and immunocytochemical properties.Am. J.

C2C12 skeletal muscle cells adopt cardiac-like sodium current properties in a cardiac cell environment.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H439-H450Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We used retroviral transduction to generate cells stably expressing either FLAG-tagged WT (C2-WT) or a variant (C2-H222P) lamin A identical to that in LmnaH222P/H222P mice. These cells stably expressed the respective proteins, but because expression of H222P-lamin A alone did not induce Dusp4 expression or ERK1/2 activation, we tested various conditions to recapitulate the pattern of expression in the hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice. Of several stimuli tested, AICAR and glucose deprivation significantly induced Dusp4 mRNA expression (∼2-fold) in C2-H222P but not C2-WT cells, suggesting that C2C12 cells expressing H222P-lamin A had enhanced Dusp4 mRNA expression under energy deficit (Fig. 2A). To test whether the enhanced Dusp4 expression was correlated with ERK1/2 activation, as in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice, we assessed phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in C2-WT and C2-H222P cells subjected to AICAR or glucose deprivation. As expected, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased in C2-H222P relative to C2-WT cells (Fig. 2B). Responses to AICAR or glucose deprivation were comparable between unmodified C2C12 and cells stably transduced with retrovirus carrying empty vector or C2-WT cells (data not shown). These results demonstrated a correlation between enhanced Dusp4 expression and ERK1/2 activation in energy-deprived C2-H222P, recapitulating the expression pattern in hearts from LmnaH222P/H222P mice. We next asked whether ERK1/2 activation drives the enhanced Dusp4 expression. We inhibited MEK1/2 with PD98059 in C2-WT and C2-H222P cells stimulated by either AICAR or glucose deprivation. In cells treated with AICAR, PD98059 pretreatment decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and abrogated Dusp4 mRNA induction (Fig. 2C, left panel). In contrast, cells subjected to glucose deprivation circumvented MEK1/2 inhibition to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Dusp4 mRNA induction (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results suggest that ERK1/2 activity is required for Dusp4 expression. Similar results were obtained with U0126, another MEK1/2 inhibitor (data not shown). We also measured Dusp4 mRNA in the hearts of 16-week-old LmnaH222P/H222P mice treated with 1 mg kg−1 day−1 of PD98059 for 4 weeks, which improves cardiac function (7Muchir A. Shan J. Bonne G. Lehnart S.E. Worman H.J. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling to prevent cardiomyopathy caused by mutation in the gene encoding A-type lamins.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Dusp4 mRNA expression was reduced by ∼60% in PD98059-treated mice relative to controls given Me2SO (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data demonstrated that high cardiac Dusp4 expression in LmnaH222P/H222P mice and energy-deprived C2-H222P was primarily ERK1/2-dependent. Given that the enhanced Dusp4 expression was observed in C2-H222P cells only after subjecting them to conditions that activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), we assessed the phosphorylation status of Thr-172 on the AMPKα subunit and observed that phosphorylation of this site does not significantly increase with either AICAR treatment or glucose deprivation (Fig. 2E). However, given that AMP and AMP-mimetics like AICAR can induce allosteric activation of AMPK without increasing Thr-172 phosphorylation, we further assessed its potential involvement by utilizing constitutively active and dominant negative forms of AMPK. When we expressed constitutively active point mutant AMPKγ1 H150R in C2-H222P cells, ERK1/2 phosphorylation or Dusp4 expression were not enhanced (Fig. 2F). This suggested that AMPK activation in and of itself was not sufficient to drive Dusp4 expression. In addition, when C2-H222P cells expressing dominant negative AMPKα2 K45R were subjected to glucose deprivation, we still observed enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Dusp4 expression (Fig. 2G). These results suggest that AMPK is not significantly involved in Dusp4 expression in C2-H222P cells after AICAR treatment or under glucose deprivation. To directly determine whether enhanced cardiac Dusp4 expression contributes to development of cardiomyopathy, we generated a transgenic mouse line with cardiac-selective overexpression (Fig. 3, A and B). Two founders were produced, one of which died at 8 weeks of age. The transgenic mice bred normally, producing 42% male and 58% female (of 131 total mice) offspring with the transgene detected in ∼50%. DUSP4 protein expression was ∼3.7-fold higher in hearts of transgene positive (Tg+) mice compared with transgene negative littermates (Tg−), with a corresponding decrease in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 3C) and expression of mRNAs encoded by genes it activates (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the cardiac phenotypes observed in these transgenic mice are the result of Dusp4 expression alone without the influ"

The objective of the present study was to use the Taormina definition of occult HBV infection, together with stringent amplification conditions, to determine the prevalence and characteristics of HBV infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naïve HIV+ve adults in a rural cohort in South Africa. The presence of HBV serological markers was determined by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) tests. HBV DNA-positivity was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of at least two of three different regions of the HBV genome. HBV viral loads were determined by real-time PCR. Liver fibrosis was determined using the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index. Of the 298 participants, 231 (77.5%) showed at least one HBV marker, with 53.7% HBV DNA−ve (resolved) and 23.8% HBV DNA+ve (current) [8.7% HBsAg+ve: 15.1% HBsAg−ve]. Only the total number of sexual partners distinguished HBV DNA+ve and HBV DNA−ve participants, implicating sexual transmission of HBV and/or HIV. It is plausible that sexual transmission of HBV and/or HIV may result in a new HBV infection, superinfection and re-activation as a consequence of immunesuppression. Three HBsAg−ve HBV DNA+ve participants had HBV viral loads <200 IU/ml and were therefore true occult HBV infections. The majority of HBsAg−ve HBV DNA+ve participants did not differ from HBsAg+ve HBV DNA+ve (overt) participants in terms of HBV viral loads, ALT levels or frequency of liver fibrosis. Close to a quarter of HIV+ve participants were HBV DNA+ve, of which the majority were HBsAg−ve and were only detected using nucleic acid testing. Detection of HBsAg−ve HBV DNA+ve subjects is advisable considering they were clinically indistinguishable from HBsAg+ve HBV DNA+ve individuals and should not be overlooked, especially if lamivudine is included in the ART."
https://openalex.org/W2030593202,"Pathological angiogenesis in the retina is driven by dysregulation of hypoxia-driven stimuli that coordinate physiological vessel growth. How the various components of the neovascularization signaling network are integrated to yield pathological changes has not been defined. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an inducible matricellular protein that plays a major role in fibroproliferative disorders. Here, we show that CTGF/CCN2 was dynamically expressed in the developing murine retinal vasculature and was abnormally increased and localized within neovascular tufts in the mouse eye with oxygen-induced retinopathy. Consistent with its propitious vascular localization, ectopic expression of the CTGF/CCN2 gene further accelerated neovascularization, whereas lentivirus-mediated loss-of-function or -expression of CTGF/CCN2 harnessed ischemia-induced neovessel outgrowth in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. The neovascular effects of CTGF/CCN2 were mediated, at least in part, through increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, which drives vascular remodeling through degradation of matrix and non matrix proteins, migration and invasion of endothelial cells, and formation of new vascular patterns. In cultured cells, CTGF/CCN2 activated the MMP-2 promoter through increased expression and tethering of the p53 transcription factor to a highly conserved p53-binding sequence within the MMP-2 promoter. Concordantly, the neovascular effects of CTGF/CCN2 were suppressed by p53 inhibition that culminated in reduced enrichment of the MMP-2 promoter with p53 and decreased MMP-2 gene expression. Our data identified new gene targets and downstream effectors of CTGF/CCN2 and provided the rational basis for targeting the p53 pathway to curtail the effects of CTGF/CCN2 on neovessel formation associated with ischemic retinopathy.

Consistent with its propitious vascular localization, ectopic expression of the CTGF/CCN2 gene further accelerated neovascularization, whereas lentivirus-mediated loss-of-function or -expression of CTGF/CCN2 harnessed ischemia-induced neovessel outgrowth in oxygen-induced retinopathy mice. The neovascular effects of CTGF/CCN2 were mediated, at least in part, through increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, which drives vascular remodeling through degradation of matrix and non matrix proteins, migration and invasion of endothelial cells, and formation of new vascular patterns. In cultured cells, CTGF/CCN2 activated the MMP-2 promoter through increased expression and tethering of the p53 transcription factor to a highly conserved p53-binding sequence within the MMP-2 promoter. Concordantly, the neovascular effects of CTGF/CCN2 were suppressed by p53 inhibition that culminated in reduced enrichment of the MMP-2 promoter with p53 and decreased MMP-2 gene expression. Our data identified new gene targets and downstream effectors of CTGF/CCN2 and provided the rational basis for targeting the p53 pathway to curtail the effects of CTGF/CCN2 on neovessel formation associated with ischemic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2165139892,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severe inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease with an autoimmune background. Despite the variety of therapeutics available against MS, the development of novel approaches to its treatment is of high importance in modern pharmaceutics. In this study, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Dark Agouti rats has been treated with immunodominant peptides of the myelin basic protein (MBP) encapsulated in mannosylated small unilamellar vesicles. The results show that liposome-encapsulated MBP(46-62) is the most effective in reducing maximal disease score during the first attack, while MBP(124-139) and MBP(147-170) can completely prevent the development of the exacerbation stage. Both mannosylation of liposomes and encapsulation of peptides are critical for the therapeutic effect, since neither naked peptides nor nonmannosylated liposomes, loaded or empty, have proved effective. The liposome-mediated synergistic effect of the mixture of 3 MBP peptides significantly suppresses the progression of protracted EAE, with the median cumulative disease score being reduced from 22 to 14 points, compared to the placebo group; prevents the production of circulating autoantibodies; down-regulates the synthesis of Th1 cytokines; and induces the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the central nervous system. Thus, the proposed formulation ameliorates EAE, providing for a less severe first attack and rapid recovery from exacerbation, and offers a promising therapeutic modality in MS treatment."

Although the mechanisms regulating ERK activation are not fully understood, we previously demonstrated that ERK phosphorylation is elevated by heparanase, an enzyme associated with aggressive behavior of many cancers. In the present study, myeloma cell lines expressing either high or low levels of heparanase were utilized to determine how heparanase stimulates ERK signaling. We discovered that the insulin receptor was abundant on cells expressing either high or low levels of heparanase, but the receptor was highly phosphorylated in heparanase-high cells compared with heparanase-low cells. In addition, protein kinase C activity was elevated in heparanase-high cells, and this enhanced expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the principle intracellular substrate for phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Blocking insulin receptor function with antibody or a small molecule inhibitor or knockdown of IRS-1 expression using shRNA diminished heparanase-mediated ERK activation in the tumor cells. In addition, up-regulation of the insulin signaling pathway by heparanase and the resulting ERK activation were dependent on heparanase retaining its enzyme activity. These results reveal a novel mechanism whereby heparanase enhances activation of the insulin receptor signaling pathway leading to ERK activation and modulation of myeloma behavior."

Both proteins are components of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules and show cytoplasmic mislocalization in affected tissues. Recently, ataxin-2 was identified as a potent modifier of TDP-43 toxicity in an RNA-dependent manner. This study investigated to clarify how ataxin-2 modifies the TDP-43 and FUS pathological pathway. The expression of cytoplasmic TDP-43, the 35-kDa C-terminal fragment (TDP-p35f), and mutant FUS recruited ataxin-2 to mRNP granules, whereas increased ataxin-2 inhibited the mRNP granule formation of the 35-kDa C-terminal fragment and mutant FUS. A subcellular compartment analysis showed that the overexpressed ataxin-2 increased the cytoplasmic concentrations of both proteins, whereas it decreased their nuclear distributions. These data indicate that increased ataxin-2 impairs the assembly of TDP-43 and FUS into mRNP granules, leading to an aberrant distribution of RNA-binding proteins. Consequently, these sequences may exacerbate the impairment of the RNA-quality control system mediated by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal lobar degeneration-associated RNA-binding proteins, which forms the core of the degenerative cascade.

https://openalex.org/W1994902291,"Tumorigenesis is accompanied by changes in the DNA methylation pattern. Our aim was to test a novel approach for identification of transcripts at whole transcript level which are regulated by DNA methylation. Our approach is based on comparison of data obtained from transcriptome profiling of primary human samples and in vitro cell culture models. Epithelial cells were collected by LCM from normal, adenoma, and tumorous colonic samples. Using gene expression analysis, we identified downregulated genes in the tumors compared to normal tissues. In parallel 3000 upregulated genes were determined in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cell culture model after DNA demethylation treatment. Of the 2533 transcripts showing reduced expression in the tumorous samples, 154 had increased expression as a result of DNA demethylation treatment. Approximately 2/3 of these genes had decreased expression already in the adenoma samples. Expression of five genes (GCG, NMES-1, LRMP, FAM161B and PTGDR), was validated using RT-PCR. PTGDR showed ambiguous results, therefore it was further studied to verify the extent of DNA methylation and its effect on the protein level. Results confirmed that our approach is suitable for genome-wide screening of genes which are regulated or inactivated by DNA methylation. Activity of these genes possibly interferes with tumor progression, therefore genes identified can be key factors in the formation and in the progression of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2058838500,"The molecular chaperone GRP78/BiP is a key regulator of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, and it plays a pivotal role in cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. Inhibition of its function has therefore been an important strategy for inhibiting tumor cell growth in cancer therapy. Previous efforts to achieve this goal have used peptides that bind to GRP78/BiP conjugated to pro-drugs or cell-death-inducing sequences. Here, we describe a peptide that induces prostate tumor cell death without the need of any conjugating sequences. This peptide is a sequence derived from the cochaperone Bag-1. We have shown that this sequence interacts with and inhibits the refolding activity of GRP78/BiP. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that it modulates the unfolded protein response in ER stress resulting in PARP and caspase-4 cleavage. Prostate cancer cells stably expressing this peptide showed reduced growth and increased apoptosis in in vivo xenograft tumor models. Amino acid substitutions that destroyed binding of the Bag-1 peptide to GRP78/BiP or downregulation of the expression of GRP78 compromised the inhibitory effect of this peptide. This sequence therefore represents a candidate lead peptide for anti-tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2108181089,"The chaperonin, GroEL, is an essential molecular chaperone that mediates protein folding together with its cofactor, GroES, in Escherichia coli.

These results demonstrate that the same reactions take place independently in both rings of the football-shaped complex to facilitate protein folding. Chaperonins are a major class of molecular chaperones that assist protein folding in the cell (1.Horwich A.L. Fenton W.A. Chapman E. Farr G.W. Two families of chaperonin.

Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). The best characterized chaperonin is Escherichia coli GroEL, which functions together with its cofactor, GroES (3.Horwich A.L. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. GroEL-GroES-mediated protein folding.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1917-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4.Horwich A.L. Fenton W.A. Chaperonin-mediated protein folding. Using a central cavity to kinetically assist polypeptide chain folding.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2009; 42: 83-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GroEL is a large, cylindrical complex arranged as two heptameric rings composed of 57-kDa subunits, and these rings are stacked back-to-back. The cochaperonin, GroES, is arranged as a single heptameric ring composed of 10-kDa subunits that interacts with GroEL in a nucleotide-dependent manner. The commonly accepted model of GroEL-mediated protein folding is as follows. First, one of the GroEL rings captures a denatured protein via its hydrophobic sites, and GroES binds to the same ring in an ATP-dependent manner (the ring is called the cis-ring). GroES binding induces the displacement of the captured protein into the GroEL cavity, where productive folding proceeds for proteins up to ∼60 kDa (5.Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. On the maximum size of proteins to stay and fold in the cavity of GroEL underneath GroES.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Next, hydrolysis of ATP in the cis-ring is followed by subsequent ATP binding to the opposite ring (trans-ring), which causes the dissociation of GroES and ADP and release of the substrate protein from the cis-ring. At the same time, the second GroES binds to the trans-ring to reorient a new cis-ring and starts the next ATPase cycle (6.Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L.

In short, because GroES binds alternatively to each ring of GroEL (two-stroke model), an asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex (termed the bullet-shaped complex) exists throughout the reaction cycle, whereas a symmetric GroEL-(GroES)2 complex (termed the football-shaped complex) is not formed. In contrast, the existence of the football-shaped complex in the presence of ATP has been suggested by electron microscopic observation (8.Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R.

The specimen was illuminated with a 635-nm laser (Radius 635-25; Coherent) to mark the position of Cy5-labeled GroEL and then illuminated with a 488-nm laser (Sapphire 488-75 CDRH; Coherent) to visualize GFP fluorescence through an inverted microscope (IX-71; Olympus) with an oil immersion objective (UApo 150× OTIRF, NA 1.45; Olympus) and dichroic mirrors (a custom-made mirror for Cy5; Chroma Technology and 505DRLP for GFP; Omega Optical). Fluorescence signals from Cy5 and GFP were collected through an objective on a microscope equipped with dichroic mirrors and emission filters (FF01-692/40-25 for Cy5 and FF01-520/35-25 for GFP; Semrock). Fluorescence images were recorded using an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera (C9100-13; Hamamatsu Photonics) with a time resolution of 200 ms. SBP-GFP (5 μm) was denatured in HKM buffer containing 0.1 m HCl for 5 min at 23 °C. The denatured SBP-GFP was diluted to a final concentration of 100 nm with HKM buffer containing 25 nm Cy5bio-EL133/398. After incubation for 5 min, the mixture was diluted and EL133/398 complexed with denatured SBP-GFP was immobilized on the quartz slide surface via biotinylated BSA and streptavidin as described (31.Taguchi H.

Experimental results were obtained in HKM buffer containing caged nucleotide(s) (1 mm caged ATP or 1 mm caged ATP + 1 mm caged ADP), 2 μm GroES, and an oxygen scavenging system. The appearance of SBP-GFP fluorescence at the position of EL133/398 after photolysis of caged ATP was visualized at 23 °C by prism-type TIRFM (33.Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T.

The specimen was illuminated with a 635-nm laser to mark the position of Cy5-EL133/398 and then illuminated with a 488-nm laser to visualize SBP-GFP fluorescence. Fluorescence signals from Cy5 and SBP-GFP were collected through an objective (UApo 150× OTIRF) on a microscope (IX-71) equipped with a dichroic mirror (FF409-Di03-25×36, Semrock), a long pass filter (FF01-409/LP-25, Semrock) and emission filters (FF01-692/40-25 and FF01-520/35-25). Fluorescence images were obtained with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera with a time resolution of 200 ms. For photolysis of caged nucleotides, the specimens were illuminated with a 250-ms pulse of UV light from a 100-W mercury lamp (USH-102D; Ushio Lighting) via a band-pass filter (FF01-357/44-25; Semrock) and a dichroic mirror (FF409-Di03-25×36). Approximately 35% of the caged nucleotides were split under the experimental conditions. The recorded images were analyzed using a homemade program on a Halcon image processor (MVTec Software GmbH, Munich, Germany) to obtain time trajectories of the fluorescence intensities of Cy5 and GFP molecules. The number of folded SBP-GFP molecules was plotted as a function of time. In the football condition, the number of molecules is expressed as the sum of the number of the first refolded and second refolded SBP-GFP molecules. The histograms of the time required for SBP-GFP folding were fitted by using the following equation,N(t)=Ntotalk1•k2(k2-k1){exp(-k1•t)-exp(-k2•r)}(Eq. 1) where N(t) is the number of refolded SBP-GFP molecules in GroEL-GroES complexes at time t and Ntotal is the total number of refolded SBP-GFP molecules. In addition, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of a two-step reaction with different rate constants. Rate constants for SBP-GFP folding were determined by fitting to the cumulative frequency distributions using the following equation.∫0tN(τ)dτ=Ntotal[1-{k2•exp(-k1•t)-k1•exp(-k2•t)]/ (k2-k1)}](Eq. 2) Data fitting was performed using the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software). First, we examined how many GFP molecules can fold within the football-shaped complex at the single-molecule level. To this end, the D398A variant of GroEL (EL398) was used. EL398 hydrolyzes ATP much more slowly than wtEL and then forms a long-lived football-shaped complex upon the addition of ATP to retain refolded GFP molecules in the complex (half-time of ∼30 min) (6.Rye H.S.

EL398 was fluorescently labeled with Cy5 monofunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (termed Cy5-EL398) because it does not contain reactive cysteine residues. A cysteine-introduced GroES variant (ES98C) (24.Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M.

Cy5-EL398 (25 nm) and bio-ES98C (500 nm) were incubated with acid-denatured GFP (100 nm) and nucleotide(s) to form GroEL-GroES complexes. The complexes were immobilized on a glass surface via a biotin-streptavidin linkage (Fig. 1A). Observations of single-molecule fluorescence were performed by objective-type TIRFM. The positions of the GroEL-GroES complexes were determined from the fluorescence of Cy5 attached to EL398 (Fig. 1B, GroEL). As expected, the fluorescence of GFP molecules was detected at the positions of the GroEL-GroES complexes (Fig. 1B, GFP), indicating that refolded GFP was encapsulated in the GroEL-GroES complexes. In the fluorescence time traces of GFP, a stepwise decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed, which reflected the photobleaching of individual GFP molecules (Fig. 1C). The number of photobleaching steps was equivalent to the number of refolded GFP molecules within the GroEL-GroES complexes. Then we counted the number of steps required for photobleaching of the GFP molecules to determine the number of GFP molecules within the GroEL-GroES complexes (Fig. 1D). In the presence of ATP, conditions in which EL398 forms the football-shaped complexes (14.Sameshima T. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Ishii N. Terada N. Okabe K. Funatsu T. Football- and bullet-shaped GroEL-GroES complexes coexist during the reaction cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23765-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), two GFP molecules were observed in 17 ± 1.2% (mean ± S.E.) of the GroEL-GroES complexes, whereas one GFP molecule was observed in 35 ± 2.5% (mean ± S.E.) of the complexes (Fig. 1D, row 1). Three GFP molecules were rarely detected in the complexes (less than 0.3%). Only half of GroEL-GroES complexes contain refolded GFP because denatured GFP can be easily released from GroEL-GroES complexes into the bulk medium (35.Motojima F. Yoshida M. Polypeptide in the chaperonin cage partly protrudes out and then folds inside or escapes outside.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 4008-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that two GFP molecules can refold in the football-shaped complex. However, there remained the possibility that two GFP molecules refolded in the same ring, not in both rings. In an earlier study (5.Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. On the maximum size of proteins to stay and fold in the cavity of GroEL underneath GroES.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it was shown that a fusion protein of GFP and its blue fluorescent variant can fold in the cis-ring. To exclude the possibility that two GFP molecules fold in one ring of the GroEL-GroES complexes, control experiments were performed. In the presence of both ATP and ADP, EL398 forms the bullet-shaped complexes because ADP inhibits the binding of ATP to the trans-ring of GroEL (14.Sameshima T. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Ishii N. Terada N. Okabe K. Funatsu T. Football- and bullet-shaped GroEL-GroES complexes coexist during the reaction cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23765-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). With the addition of ATP and ADP to EL398, the percentage of the GroEL-GroES complexes containing two GFP molecules was drastically reduced to 2.7 ± 0.70% (mean ± S.E.; Fig. 1D, row 2), indicating that one GFP molecule completed the folding in the bullet-shaped complex. We also used the single-ring variant of EL398 (SR398) (6.Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Distinct actions of cistrans ATP within the double ring of the chaperonin GroEL.Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The detection rate of two GFP molecules in SR398-GroES complexes was negligible (0.78 ± 0.13%, mean ± S.E.; Fig. 1D, row 3). These experiments demonstrated that two GFP molecules did not refold in the same ring under the experimental conditions used. In summary, GFP can be encapsulated and refold in both rings of the football-shaped complex. We next performed real time imaging of GFP folding in the football-shaped and bullet-shaped complexes (Fig. 2, A and E). To this end, we prepared an EL398 variant in which Ala-133 located on the outer surface of the equatorial domain was mutated to cysteine (EL133/398) (23.Yamasaki R. Hoshino M. Wazawa T. Ishii Y.

EL133 was easily and specifically modified with fluorophore and biotin, and the chaperonin function was not perturbed on the glass surface (data not shown). EL133/398 was modified with Cy5-maleimide and biotin-maleimide (termed Cy5bio-EL133/398). Cy5bio-EL133/398 complexed with acid-denatured GFP was immobilized on the quartz slide via a biotin-streptavidin linkage to allow the folding of GFP to be monitored. The final solution contained 2 μm GroES and caged nucleotide(s) (1 mm caged ATP or 1 mm caged ATP + 1 mm caged ADP)"
https://openalex.org/W2071837555,"Genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of numerous susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes. Among them is Cdkal1, which is associated with reduced β-cell function and insulin release. Recently, CDKAL1 has been shown to be a methylthiotransferase that modifies tRNA(Lys) to enhance translational fidelity of transcripts, including the one encoding proinsulin. Here, we report that out of several CDKAL1 isoforms deposited in public databases, only isoform 1, which migrates as a 61-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE, is expressed in human islets and pancreatic insulinoma INS-1 and MIN6 cells. We show that CDKAL1 is a novel member of the tail-anchored protein family and exploits the TCR40/Get3-assisted pathway for insertion of its C-terminal transmembrane domain into the endoplasmic reticulum. Using endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and peptide:N-glycosidase F sensitivity assays on CDKAL1 constructs carrying an N-glycosylation site within the luminal domain, we further established that CDKAL1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein. Moreover, we observed that silencing CDKAL1 in INS-1 cells reduces the expression of secretory granule proteins prochromogranin A and proICA512/ICA512-TMF, in addition to proinsulin and insulin. This correlated with reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into the role of CDKAL1 in insulin-producing cells and help to understand its involvement in the pathogenesis of diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2049568685,"VAPB (VAMP- associated protein B) is an ER protein that regulates multiple biological functions. Although aberrant expression of VAPB is associated with breast cancer, its function in tumor cells is poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence that VAPB regulates breast tumor cell proliferation and AKT activation. VAPB protein expression is elevated in primary and metastatic tumor specimens, and VAPB mRNA expression levels correlated negatively with patient survival in two large breast tumor datasets. Overexpression of VAPB in mammary epithelial cells increased cell growth, whereas VAPB knockdown in tumor cells inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic mammary gland allografts. The growth regulation of mammary tumor cells controlled by VAPB appears to be mediated, at least in part, by modulation of AKT activity. Overexpression of VAPB in MCF10A-HER2 cells enhances phosphorylation of AKT. In contrast, knockdown of VAPB in MMTV-Neu tumor cells inhibited pAKT levels. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT significantly reduced three-dimensional spheroid growth induced by VAPB. Collectively, the genetic, functional and mechanistic analyses suggest a role of VAPB in tumor promotion in human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2078734575,"It has been suggested that irreducible sets of states in Probabilistic Boolean Networks correspond to cellular phenotype. In this study, we identify such sets of states for each phase of the budding yeast cell cycle. We find that these ""ergodic sets"" underly the cyclin activity levels during each phase of the cell cycle. Our results compare to the observations made in several laboratory experiments as well as the results of differential equation models. Dynamical studies of this model: (i) indicate that under stochastic external signals the continuous oscillating waves of cyclin activity and the opposing waves of CKIs emerge from the logic of a Boolean-based regulatory network without the need for specific biochemical/kinetic parameters; (ii) suggest that the yeast cell cycle network is robust to the varying behavior of cell size (e.g., cell division under nitrogen deprived conditions); (iii) suggest the irreversibility of the Start signal is a function of logic of the G1 regulon, and changing the structure of the regulatory network can render start reversible."

Most ligand-activated channels in the brain desensitize in the presence of their respective agonists but mechanisms that remove neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft and around synapses such as degradation, reuptake, and diffusion minimize desensitization by keeping the exposure brief. In the instance of ASICs, pH fluctuations in microdomains of the brain evoked by neuronal activity have been documented (13Kaila K. Chesler M. pH and Brain Function. Wiley-Liss, Inc, 1998Google Scholar). However, the intensity and time course of variations in H+ concentration have not been resolved yet, in large extend because of limits of the techniques used to report rapid pH changes in poorly accessible perisynaptic spaces of the intact brain. The purpose of this work was to investigate hASIC1a responses to high frequency stimulation and to provide a quantitative analysis of the decrease in peak current magnitude upon repetitive stimuli. The results indicate that hASIC1a exhibits slow desensitization and slow recovery. We demonstrate the existence of two desensitized states with markedly different stability, their contribution to the time course of recovery from desensitization, the role of TM1 in stabilizing the long-lasting desensitized state; lastly, we provide a kinetic model that predicts the attenuation of hASIC1a currents upon repetitive stimulation. N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma and HEK-293 cell lines (both from ATCC) were maintained on DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an incubator set at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were grown on 25 cm2 flasks and were transferred to acid-washed cover slips pre-coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine for experiments. The coding region of human ASIC1a cDNA (hASIC1a) was cloned from total RNA extracted from HEK-293 cells using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript RT III, Invitrogen) and polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers corresponding to the first 27 (Forward primer: ATGGAACTGAAGGCCGAGGAGGAGGAG) and last 26 base pairs (Reverse primer: GCAGGTAAAGTCCTCGAACGTGCCTC) of the coding sequence of the human gene ACCN2 (NCBI Reference sequence NM 020039.2). The PCR product was ligated to pCDNA3.1/V5 (Invitrogen) plasmid, and the DNA was sequenced from five independent clones. Chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) was originally cloned in our laboratory (14Coric T.

Chimeras of human and chicken ASIC1 were made by a two-step approach. First, unique restriction sites were introduced in the junctions to swap domains (MfeI or NdeI). Second, the restriction sites were reverted by site-directed mutagenesis using Quickchange (Agilent) to keep the original amino acids. All constructs and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Oocytes were harvested from female Xenopus laevis frogs according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. RNAs were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGEmMACHINE, Agilent). 5 ng of cRNA were injected per oocyte in ≤50 nl. Cells were maintained at 16 °C for 24 to 48 h until used for experiments. Function and expression level of ASIC1a wild type, chimeras, and mutants were evaluated in injected oocytes by the TEVC (oocyte Clamp OC-725-B, PowerLab 4/30 ADInstruments). Whole-cells currents were elicited by changing the perfusate from a solution of pH 7.4 to 6.5 as previously described (Li et al., 2009). Oocytes expressing ≥20μA of current while the membrane potential was clamped at −60 mV were selected for patch clamp studies. Patch clamp recordings from oocytes were conducted in excised patches in the outside-out configuration. Patch pipettes were pulled from PG150T glass (Warner Instruments) to tip diameter of 2–4 μm after heat polishing. In outside-out patches the pipette solution was (mm): 120 KCl, 5 EDTA, 20 HEPES titrated with KOH to pH 7.4. Experiments that evaluated the effect of internal pH, the pipette's pH solution was either 7.4 or 6.5 buffered with 30 mm HEPES.

Bath and activating solutions were (mm): 120 NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 HEPES buffered to pH 7.4 or 6.5. Recordings were made using an EPC-9 amplifier and the Pulse acquisition program v8.78 (HEKA Electronic). Membrane potential was held at −30 mV unless indicated. Experiments were conducted at room temperature. Measurements of ASIC currents in N1E-115 and HEK 293 cells were conducted in the whole-cell configuration. Solutions were applied using a Perfusion Fast Step device SF-77B (Warner Instruments) controlled by the data acquisition program Pulse v8.78. In experiments requiring short perfusion times (milliseconds as shown in Fig. 3) two solution streams, pH 7.4 and 6.5, flowed from a pulled theta-glass capillary with a tip diameter of ∼300 μm to a stationary outside-out patch. The flow velocity of the solutions was 75–150 μm/ms, chosen to form a sharp solution interface while minimizing the chance of breaking the patch. Mechanical vibration artifacts were reduced by decreasing the stepper motor drive voltage, and the residual artifacts were removed by subtracting averaged null traces from the trace with channel activity. After each experiment, the rate of the solution switching was measured by monitoring the current steps resulting from changes in the liquid junction potential. In a typical experiment, the time between the 10 and 90% amplitude points of the junction potential change was 1 ms. The first peak current (PC) and subsequent ones were expressed as: PC1, PC2 = 1 − PS1 to PCn = 1 − PS1, where PS is the component of the peak current that remains in the long-lasting desensitized state. The value of the peak current at sweep n is expressed by Equation 1. PCn=1-PSn-1=1-[(PCn-1×βα+β)+ (1-PCn-1)(PCn-1×βα+β)](Eq. 1) Equation 1 has two components in the brackets: the first one reflects the fraction of channels entering the long-lasting desensitized state after each sweep. The second one reflects the current that remains in the long-lasting desensitized state for each recovery time, Tr, expressed in seconds. δ is the rate of the transition from the slow-recovery desensitized state to the open state measured at pH 7.4 (Fig. 5A) (15Colquhoun D.

Channels were activated by a solution of pH 6.5 applied for 10 s; this stimulus produced transient inward currents that completely desensitized in 10 s. It was followed by perfusion for 10, 30, or 180 s with pH 7.4 to recover channels from the desensitized state. There are 10 sweeps in each of the representative examples shown for HEK 293 (Fig. 1A) and N1E-115 (Fig. 1B), which were obtained from independent cells. The first sweep is always indicated in black and subsequent ones in gray. The examples show that consecutive stimuli progressively attenuate the peak current and that the attenuation decreases by lengthening the recovery time (Tr): compare peak currents at 10 versus 180 s intervals. These results reproduce rundown of mammalian ASIC1a reported previously by several groups (1Neaga E. Amuzescu B. Dinu C. Macri B. Pena F. Flonta M.L.

In addition to the desensitization-dependent attenuation of ASIC1a currents in the time range of 10 to 300 s, we also observed a gradual and irreversible loss of channel activity in both whole-cell and excised patch configurations. Typically, after obtaining a high resistance seal a patch was activated by pH 6.5 and returned to pH 7.4 for 20 to 40 min before applying a second pulse of pH 6.5. The peak current of the second pulse was usually smaller, 0.6 to 0.8, than the first one. This much slower form of current loss or actual rundown differs from the one examined in this study and was not pursued here. The results in Fig. 1 show equal magnitude and time course of peak current changes in endogenous and heterologous expressed ASIC1a making it unlikely that an auxiliary protein, with expression restricted to neurons, accounts for this phenomenon. Most likely it arises from an intrinsic property of mammalian ASIC1a channels or from conditions under which measurements are recorded. Chen and Gründer reported that it was caused by acidification of the cytoplasm due to permeation of H+ through rat ASIC1a (3Chen X. Gründer S. Permeating protons contribute to tachyphylaxis of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). According to this explanation one may posit that the effect of cytosolic H+ ions decreases ASIC1a activity by screening charges in the channel protein that favor a desensitized conformation. Alternatively, H+ may neutralize negative charges of phospholipids from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane reducing their apparent concentration in the vicinity of the channel. To test the effect of intracellular pH (pHi), we compared excised patches in the outside-out configuration with pipette solutions of pH 6.5 or 7.4 buffered with 30 mm HEPES to ensure constant pHi even in the event of H+ permeation. Currents were evoked by pH 6.5 for 10 s followed by 3 s of recovery at pH 7.4. Fig. 2A shows the desensitization rate faster at pHi 6.5 than at 7.4, and it follows two exponentials. Approximately half of the current (0.53 ± 0.05) desensitized with a time constant of τ1 0.71 ± 0.1 s and the other half (0.47 ± 0.08) with τ2 0.03 ± 0.004 s. In patches with pHi 7.4 the desensitization had a single time constant of 0.77 ± 0.08 s. These results indicate that internal H+ ions accelerate the process of desensitization but they do not influence its recovery. We next examined the possibility of H+-mediated screening of negatively charged phospholipids leading to an apparent depletion of phospahtidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PIP2, which is the most abundant phospholipid in the plasma membrane and has been shown to modulate the activity of channels closely related to ASIC1a, namely ENaC (18Yue G. Malik B. Yue G. Eaton D.C. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) stimulates epithelial sodium channel activity in A6 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11965-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Pochynyuk O. Tong Q. Medina J. Vandewalle A. Staruschenko A. Bugaj V. Stockand J.D.

Fig. 2B shows that supplementing the pipette solution with a short-chain PIP2 (50 μm C8-PIP2) was not effective. Furthermore, co-expression and activation of a muscarinic receptor that hydrolysis endogenous PIP2 (20Falkenburger B.H. Jensen J.B. Hille B.

Physiol. 2010; 135: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) did not diminish hASIC1a currents (Fig. 2C). Addition of 0.5 mm ATP in the pipette solution also did not alter the decrease of peak currents in consecutive stimuli (Fig. 2D). Another possible modification is oxidation of intracellular cysteines introduced by washout of cytosolic reducing factors in whole-cell and excised patches. This consideration is underscored by a previous study that reported application of oxidizing agents to the external side of ASIC1a decreased channel currents in mouse neurons while the reducing reagent DTT reverted the effect (21Chu X.P. Close N. Saugstad J.A. Xiong Z.G. ASIC1a-specific modulation of acid-sensing ion channels in mouse cortical neurons by redox reagents.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5329-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are four free cysteines in the intracellular C terminus of hASIC1a and none in the N terminus that could be targeted by oxidation while most cysteines in the extracellular domain form disulfide bridges. We compared the response of hASIC1a in patches containing 0 or 5 mm DTT. Fig. 2E shows no detectable difference in the two conditions. Since modifications targeted to the channel protein, both endogenous and recombinant, and to the environment immediately surrounding ASIC1a, did not alter the decrease in peak currents induced by repetitive stimuli we conclude that it most likely reflects a structural property intrinsic to the channel protein. Trains of consecutive stimuli predict progressive attenuation and even suppression of hASIC1a currents. To cope with effect channels must either recover rapidly from desensitization or prevent it. The previous experiments indicate that decrease in peak currents arises from the desensitized state since channels were exposed to pH 6.5 for 10 s that induces complete desensitization every single sweep. However, it remains possible that deactivation, unbinding of H+ from open channels, is enough to induce desensitization. We examined this possibility by activating channels for short periods of time: 20, 100, or 500 ms with pH 6.5, followed by a fixed recovery time with pH 7.4 for 5 s. If opening is enough to induce desensitization, then the magnitude of the peak currents should decrease on consecutive stimulations. Fig. 3A shows that repetitive H+ stimuli shorter than 100 ms did not decrease the peak currents; they remained constant even after 100 sweeps, whereas peak currents progressively decreased after a few stimuli longer than ≥500 ms. Fig. 3B summarizes the relation of peak currents as a function of the stimulus duration. These results demonstrate that hASIC1a desensitizes slowly and that deactivated channels do not lead to desensitization. However, we have not proved yet that currents remain stable under high frequency stimulation, which is the prevalent form of signaling in the CNS. We addressed this issue by decreasing the time of recovery at pH 7.4 from 5 s to 200 ms, the limit speed of our patch perfusion system. As shown in Fig. 3C, channels were activated for 10 ms with pH 6.5 and recovered for 200 ms with pH 7.4; peak currents remained stable over the first 8 consecutive sweeps shown in Fig. 3C. Together these results indicate that the decrease of peak current on consecutive stimuli originates only from the desensitized state and that short stimuli, even if applied at high frequency, keep ASIC1a response stable. We next examined the kinetics of recovery from desensitization in outside-out patches exposed to pH 6.5 for 10 s followed by recovery times, Tr, of increasing duration, from 0.5 to 180 s. For each recovery time the protocol was repeated until a steady state current was reached. Only patches with initial peak current equal or greater than 500 nA were examined. A single condition was used per patch to avoid accumulation of inactive channels induced by mechanisms acting on a longer time scale. Currents were normalized to facilitate comparison of patches examined at various Tr values, representative examples are shown in Fig. 4A. Steady-state peak currents are plotted as a function of the recovery time in Fig. 4B where the line is the fit to a single exponential with time constant τ of 48 ± 2 s. This time constant however does not represent the life-time of the desensitized state(s) as explained in the analysis below. The most parsimonious explanation for the progressive decrease of the magnitude of the peak current (PC) is described in the kinetic scheme shown in Fig. 5A. Here, open channels desensitize to two states with different stability: short-lasting and long-lasting desensitized states. After each stimulus, the PC decreases owing to channels remaining in the long-lasting state, which in turn depends inversely to the length of the recovery time, Tr, as shown in Fig. 5B and described by Equation 1 in “Experimental Procedures.” The Equation 1 can be rewritten as Equation 2. PCn=1-[1(PCn-1×αα+β)]e-δTr(Eq. 2) When n = 2 and Tr is short, Equation 2 reduces to: PC2 = α/(α+β), where α and β are the rate constants to the two desensitized states, respectively. A plot of experimentally obtained PC2 values for various Tr is shown in Fig. 5C. Accordingly, PC2 has value of 0.8 indicating that after each sweep ∼80% of open channels enter the short-lasting desensitized state and 20% enter the long-lasting desensitized state. On the other hand, when the peak current reaches steady state after many sweeps, P∞, Equation 2 can be expressed as Equation 3. PCn=PC∞=1-e-δTr1-αα+βe-δTr=1-e-δTr1-0.8e-δTr(Eq. 3) Solving Equation 3 for δ gives the expression in Equation 4. δ=-1Tr[ln(1-PC∞1-0.8PC∞)](Eq. 4) Data values for PC∞ obtained at various recovery times are shown in the table in Fig. 5D, and plotted in Fig. 5E. Circles are mean data points and the line is the fit to Equation 4, which yields a calculated value for δ of 0.00437 s−1. This analysis is consistent with hASIC1a having at least two desensitized states that are distinguishable by their different stabilities. At any H+-activating stimulus, 80% of open channels enter the short-lasting desensitized state whose τDs is estimated to be <0.5 s. The remaining channels enter a stable and long-lasting desensitized state with a τDl of 229 ± 12 s (tDl = 1/δ). All the ASIC1a channels from mammals studied to date exhibit slow recovery from desensitization but it is not known whether this property is shared by other species. Here we examined chicken ASIC1a (cASIC1a) since it is the only channel of this class with solved atomic structures in several conformational states: open (22Baconguis I. Gouaux E.

We used the same protocol as in hASIC1a except that the stimulus duration was reduced from 10 to 5 s since cASIC1a exhibits faster desensitization rate. Fig. 6A shows representative examples of sequential activation at various Tr values, from 0.5 to 30 s. The recovery from desensitization was also dependent on the duration of Tr though it differed markedly from hASIC1a. Here, for all Tr examined a steady state was reached at the second sweep rather than the slow and progressive decrease over many sweeps before reaching steady state observed with hASIC1a currents. However, expansion of the traces at Tr 0.5 s (inset, Fig. 6A) shows that only after several sweeps the steady state was reached, suggesting the presence of a second desensitized state. Thus in cASIC1a the two desensitized states differ only slightly in stability; detection of the difference was barely within the limits of the exchange solution system. A plot of the stabilized peak current as a function of Tr is shown in Fig. 6B where the line is the fit to a single exponential with t of 4.5 ± 0.6 s. This τ value applies for the two desensitized states of cASIC1a. These results show a broad variability in the stability of the two desensitized states among ASIC1 channels. As indicated in the previous section, the τD values of the short- and long-lasting desensitized states of hASIC1 are ∼300-fold different. In contrast, we show here that the τD values of the desensitized states of cASIC1a are both so close to 4.5 s that they are barely distinguishable, given the impress"
https://openalex.org/W2056855376,"Cone photoreceptors show lower light sensitivity and briefer light responses than rod photoreceptors. The light detection signal in these cells is amplified through a phototransduction cascade. The first step of amplification in the cascade is the activation of a GTP-binding protein, transducin (Tr), by light-activated visual pigment (R*). We quantified transducin activation by measuring the binding of GTPγS in purified carp rod and cone membrane preparations with the use of a rapid quench apparatus and found that transducin activation by an R* molecule is ∼5 times less efficient in cones than in rods. Transducin activation terminated in less than 1 s in cones, more quickly than in rods. The rate of GTP hydrolysis in Tr*, and thus the rate of Tr* inactivation, was ∼25 times higher in cones than in rods. This faster inactivation of Tr* ensures briefer light responses in cones. The expression level of RGS9 was found to be ∼20 times higher in cones than in rods, which explains higher GTP hydrolytic activity and, thus, faster Tr* inactivation in cones than in rods. Although carp rods and cones express rod- or cone-versions of visual pigment and transducin, these molecules themselves do not seem to induce the differences significantly in the transducin activation and Tr* inactivation in rods and cones. Instead, the differences seem to be brought about in a rod or cone cell-type specific manner."

We have shown previously that Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) administration was sufficient to improve the systemic metabolic disorder and cardiac dysfunction in diabetic models.To investigate the precise role of APS therapy in the pathogenesis of myocardial lipotoxity in diabetes, db/db diabetic mice and myosin heavy chain (MHC)- peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α mice were characterized and administrated with or without APS with C57 wide- type mice as normal control. APS treatment strikingly improved the myocyte triacylglyceride accumulation and cardiac dysfunction in both db/db mice and MHC-PPARα mice, with the normalization of energy metabolic derangements in both db/db diabetic hearts and MHC-PPARα hearts. Consistently, the activation of PPARα target genes involved in myocardial fatty acid uptake and oxidation in both db/db diabetic hearts and MHC-PPARα hearts was reciprocally repressed by APS administration, while PPARα-mediated suppression of genes involved in glucose utilization of both diabetic hearts and MHC-PPARα hearts was reversed by treatment with APS.We conclude that APS therapy could prevent the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy through a mechanism mainly dependent on the cardiac PPARα-mediated regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2063904419,"Chronic hemiplegia is a common long-term consequence of stroke, and subsequent motor recovery is often incomplete. Neurophysiological studies have focused on motor execution deficits in relatively high functioning patients. Much less is known about the influence exerted by processes related to motor preparation, particularly in patients with poor motor recovery.The current study investigates motor preparation using a modified response-priming experiment in a large sample of patients (n = 50) with moderate-to-severe chronic hemiparesis. The behavioural results revealed that hemiparetic patients had an increased response-priming effect compared to controls, but that their response times were markedly slower for both hands. Patients also demonstrated significantly enhanced midline late contingent negative variation (CNV) during paretic hand preparation, despite the absence of overall group differences when compared to controls. Furthermore, increased amplitude of the midline CNV correlated with a greater response-priming effect. We propose that these changes might reflect greater anticipated effort to respond in patients, and consequently that advance cueing of motor responses may be of benefit in these individuals. We further observed significantly reduced CNV amplitudes over the lesioned hemisphere in hemiparetic patients compared to controls during non-paretic hand preparation, preparation of both hands and no hand preparation. Two potential explanations for these CNV reductions are discussed: alterations in anticipatory attention or state changes in motor processing, for example an imbalance in inter-hemispheric inhibition.Overall, this study provides evidence that movement preparation could play a crucial role in hemiparetic motor deficits, and that advance motor cueing may be of benefit in future therapeutic interventions. In addition, it demonstrates the importance of monitoring both the non-paretic and paretic hand after stroke and during therapeutic intervention."

Objective Here we compared longitudinal disease activity in SPMS and PPMS in the context of international multicenter clinical trials. Methods We analyzed all objective outcome measures that were systematically collected over 2 years for all subjects randomized to placebo arms in one SPMS and one PPMS clinical trial over the last decade. Conventional and exploratory definitions of clinical disease activity were used. Disease activity was analyzed in 3 different categories intermittent activity, progression, and improvement. Conventional MRI measures and one patient reported outcome measure of quality of life were included when available for comparison. Heat maps were drawn for all results followed by hierarchical clustering. Results There were 101 outcome variables from 206 SPMS subjects and 79 outcome variables from 135 PPMS subjects. The comparison revealed that SPMS and PPMS subjects exhibited similar disease activity over 2 years in all but two of the variables in common worsening in the EDSS sensory system was more common in PPMS while worsening on the 9 hole PEG was more common in SPMS. Intermittent activity was the most common pattern of disease activity in SPMS and PPMS. Clinical worsening and improvement occurred at similar frequency in both.

Here, we investigate genetic differences among populations of the granite outcrop-dwelling lizard Ctenophorus ornatus, a phenotypically variable species with a wide geographical distribution across the south-west of Western Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed two distinct evolutionary lineages that have been isolated for more than four million years within the C. ornatus complex. This evolutionary split is associated with a change in dorsal colouration of the lizards from deep brown or black to reddish-pink. In addition, analysis of microsatellite data revealed high levels of genetic structuring within each lineage, as well as strong isolation by distance at multiple spatial scales. Among the 50 outcrop populations’ analysed, non-hierarchical Bayesian clustering analysis revealed the presence of 23 distinct genetic groups, with outcrop populations less than 4 km apart usually forming a single genetic group. When a hierarchical analysis was carried out, almost every outcrop was assigned to a different genetic group. Our results show there are multiple levels of genetic structuring in C. ornatus, reflecting the influence of both historical and contemporary evolutionary processes. They also highlight the need to recognise the presence of two evolutionarily distinct lineages when making conservation management decisions on this species."
https://openalex.org/W2068290579,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression and signaling are altered in a variety of cancers, but the functional impact of these alterations is uncertain. In this study we investigated the impact of expression of multiple BMPs and their signaling pathway components in human B-cell lymphoma. BMP messages, in particular BMP7, were detected in normal and malignant B cells. Addition of exogenous BMPs inhibited DNA synthesis in most lymphoma cell lines examined, but some cell lines were resistant. Tumor specimens from three out of five lymphoma patients were also resistant to BMPs, as determined by no activation of the BMP effectors Smad1/5/8. We have previously shown that BMP-7 potently induced apoptosis in normal B cells, which was in contrast to no or little inhibitory effect of this BMP in the lymphoma cells tested. BMP-resistance mechanisms were investigated by comparing sensitive and resistant cell lines. While BMP receptors are downregulated in many cancers, we documented similar receptor levels in resistant and sensitive lymphoma cells. We found a positive correlation between activation of Smad1/5/8 and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Gene expression analysis of two independent data sets showed that the levels of inhibitory Smads varied across different B-cell lymphoma. Furthermore, stable overexpression of Smad7 in two different BMP-sensitive cell lines with low endogenous levels of SMAD7, rendered them completely resistant to BMPs. This work highlights the role of Smads in determining the sensitivity to BMPs and shows that upregulation of Smad7 in cancer cells is sufficient to escape the negative effects of BMPs."

Knowledge on features influencing protein production and secretion could be employed to improve enzyme production levels in industrial bioprocesses via protein engineering. A large set, over 600 homologous and nearly 2,000 heterologous fungal genes, were overexpressed in Aspergillus niger using a standardized expression cassette and scored for high versus no production. Subsequently, sequence-based machine learning techniques were applied for identifying relevant DNA and protein sequence features. The amino-acid composition of the protein sequence was found to be most predictive and interpretation revealed that, for both homologous and heterologous gene expression, the same features are important: tyrosine and asparagine composition was found to have a positive correlation with high-level production, whereas for unsuccessful production, contributions were found for methionine and lysine composition. The predictor is available online at http://bioinformatics.tudelft.nl/hipsec. Subsequent work aims at validating these findings by protein engineering as a method for increasing expression levels per gene copy."
https://openalex.org/W2126525381,"We previously demonstrated that the Bcr-Abl oncogene, p210bcr-abl, through its unique GEF domain, specifically activates RhoA and induces spontaneous amoeboid motility. We intend to study the pathways downstream RhoA controlling amoeboid motility. Mouse prolymphoblastic cells (Ba/F3 cell line) expressing different forms of Bcr-Abl were embedded in 3-dimensional (3D) Matrigel to study motility and explore the effects of inhibiting Rho pathway (inhibitors and siRNAs). The phosphorylation levels of cofilin-1 and destrin were analyzed by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Composition of Bcr-Abl signalplex in different conditions was determined by coimmunoprecipitation. Ba/F3p190 and Ba/F3 expressing a mutant form of p210bcr-abl (unable to activate RhoA) cells presented a spontaneous motility, but not an amoeboid type. p210bcr-abl-induced amoeboid motility in a 3D matrix requires isoform-specific RhoA/ROCK-1/destrin signaling. Next to the conventional Rho/ROCK/MLC/myosin pathway, this pathway is a crucial determinant for amoeboid motility, specific for the destrin isoform (and not its coexpressed homologue cofilin-1). Also, the presence of destrin (and not cofilin-1) in the p210bcr-abl complex is dependent on ROCK1, and this signalplex is required for amoeboid motility. This underscores isoform-specific function within the ADF/cofilin family and provides new insight into Bcr-Abl signaling to amoeboid motility and possible impact on understanding chronic myeloid leukemia progression.—Rochelle, T., Daubon, T., Van Troys, M., Harnois, T., Waterschoot, D., Ampe, C., Roy, L., Bourmeyster, N., Constantin, B. p210bcr-abl induces amoeboid motility by recruiting ADF/destrin through RhoA/ROCK1.

https://openalex.org/W2145014408,"Leukocyte chemotaxis is deemed instrumental in initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. It is mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors (e.g., CCR2 and CCR5), the activity of which is controlled by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). In this study, we analyzed the effect of hematopoietic deficiency of a potent regulator kinase of chemotaxis (GRK2) on atherogenesis. LDL receptor-deficient (LDLr(-/-)) mice with heterozygous hematopoietic GRK2 deficiency, generated by bone marrow transplantation (n=15), displayed a dramatic attenuation of plaque development, with 79% reduction in necrotic core and increased macrophage content. Circulating monocytes decreased and granulocytes increased in GRK2(+/-) chimeras, which could be attributed to diminished granulocyte colony-forming units in bone marrow. Collectively, these data pointed to myeloid cells as major mediators of the impaired atherogenic response in GRK2(+/-) chimeras. LDLr(-/-) mice with macrophage/granulocyte-specific GRK2 deficiency (LysM-Cre GRK2(flox/flox); n=8) failed to mimic the aforementioned phenotype, acquitting these cells as major responsible subsets for GRK2 deficiency-associated atheroprotection. To conclude, even partial hematopoietic GRK2 deficiency prevents atherosclerotic lesion progression beyond the fatty streak stage, identifying hematopoietic GRK2 as a potential target for intervention in atherosclerosis."

The transcription factor HB9, encoded by the homeobox gene B9 (HLXB9), is involved in the development of pancreatic beta- and motor neuronal cells. In addition, HLXB9 is recurrently rearranged in young children with acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a chromosomal translocation t(7;12)-HLXB9/TEL and concomitant high expression of the unrearranged, wild-type HLXB9 allele. However, target genes of HB9 in hematopoietic cells are not known to date. In this study, we used ChIP-on-chip analysis together with expression profiling and identified PTGER2 (prostaglandin E receptor 2) as a target gene of HB9 in a hematopoietic cell line. The functional HB9 homeodomain as well as the HB9 binding domain within the PTGER2 promoter are essential for binding of HB9 to the PTGER2 promoter region and down-regulation of PTGER2 expression. Functionally, HB9 conducted down-regulation of PTGER2 results in a reduced content of intracellular cAMP mobilization and furthermore the decreased PTGER2 gene expression is valid in bone marrow cells from translocation t(7;12) positive patients. Among the primary and secondary target genes of HB9 in the myeloid cell line HL60, 78% of significantly regulated genes are down-regulated, indicating an overall repressive function of HB9. Differentially regulated genes were preferentially confined to pathways involved in cell-adhesion and cell-cell interactions, similar to the gene expression footprint of HLXB9-expressing cells from t(7;12) positive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2042536832,"We have investigated the interaction between human DNA polymerase η (hpol η) and the Werner syndrome protein (WRN). Functional assays revealed that the WRN exonuclease and RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domains are necessary for full stimulation of hpol η-catalyzed formation of correct base pairs. We find that WRN does not stimulate hpol η-catalyzed formation of mispairs. Moreover, the exonuclease activity of WRN prevents stable mispair formation by hpol η. These results are consistent with a proofreading activity for WRN during single-nucleotide additions. ATP hydrolysis by WRN appears to attenuate stimulation of hpol η. Pre-steady-state kinetic results show that k(pol) is increased 4-fold by WRN. Finally, pulldown assays reveal a bipartite physical interaction between hpol η and WRN that is mediated by the exonuclease and RQC domains. Taken together, these results are consistent with alteration of the rate-limiting step in polymerase catalysis by direct protein-protein interactions between WRN and hpol η. In summary, WRN improves the efficiency and fidelity of hpol η to promote more effective replication of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2158689230,"Treating infections with exogenous NO, which shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, appears to be effective. Similar to NO biosynthesis, biosynthesis of α-1-acid glycoprotein variant A (AGPa), with a reduced cysteine (Cys149), increases markedly during inflammation and infection. We hypothesized that AGPa is an S-nitrosation target in acute-phase proteins. This study aimed to determine whether S-nitrosated AGPa (SNO-AGPa) may be the first compound of this novel antibacterial class against multidrug-resistant bacteria. AGPa was incubated with RAW264.7 cells activated by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. The antimicrobial effects of SNO-AGPa were determined by measuring the turbidity of the bacterial suspensions in vitro and survival in a murine sepsis model in vivo, respectively. Results indicated that endogenous NO generated by activated RAW264.7 cells caused S-nitrosation of AGPa at Cys149. SNO-AGPa strongly inhibited growth of gram-positive, gram-negative, and multidrug-resistant bacteria and was an extremely potent bacteriostatic compound (IC50: 10–9 to 10–6 M). The antibacterial mechanism of SNO-AGPa involves S-transnitrosation from SNO-AGPa to bacterial cells. Treatment with SNO-AGPa, but not with AGPa, markedly reduced bacterial counts in blood and liver in a mouse sepsis model. The sialyl residues of AGPa seem to suppress the antibacterial activity, since SNO-asialo AGPa was more potent than SNO-AGPa.—Watanabe, K., Ishima, Y., Akaike, T., Sawa, T., Kuroda, T., Ogawa, W., Watanabe, H., Suenaga, A., Kai, T., Otagiri, M., Maruyama, T.

https://openalex.org/W2009066041,"It is poorly understood how hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCNs) function.We have identified a leucine zipper in the S5 segment of HCNs, regulating hyperpolarization-activated and instantaneous current components.The leucine zipper is essential for HCN channel gating.The identification and functional characterization of the leucine zipper is an important step toward the understanding of HCN channel function. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are pacemakers in cardiac myocytes and neurons. Although their membrane topology closely resembles that of voltage-gated K(+) channels, the mechanism of their unique gating behavior in response to hyperpolarization is still poorly understood. We have identified a highly conserved leucine zipper motif in the S5 segment of HCN family members. In order to study the role of this motif for channel function, the leucine residues of the zipper were individually mutated to alanine, arginine, or glutamine residues. Leucine zipper mutants traffic to the plasma membrane, but the channels lose their sensitivity to open upon hyperpolarization. Thus, our data indicate that the leucine zipper is an important molecular determinant for hyperpolarization-activated channel gating. Residues of the leucine zipper interact with the adjacent S6 segment of the channel. This interaction is essential for voltage-dependent gating of the channel. The lower part of the leucine zipper, at the intracellular mouth of the channel, is important for stabilizing the closed state. Mutations at these sites increase current amplitudes or result in channels with deficient closing and increased min-P(o). Our data are further supported by homology models of the open and closed state of the HCN2 channel pore. Thus, we conclude that the leucine zipper of HCN channels is a major determinant for hyperpolarization-activated channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2172078490,"The nonreceptor Syk kinase is detected in epithelial cells, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, in addition to its well-established role in immunoreceptor-based signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. Thus, several carcinomas and melanomas have subnormal concentrations of Syk. Although Syk is mainly localized at the plasma membrane, it is also present in centrosomes, where it is involved in the control of cell division. The mechanisms responsible for its centrosomal localization and action are unknown. We used wild-type and mutant fluorescent Syk fusion proteins in live-cell imaging (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, total internal reflection fluorescence, and photoactivation) combined with mathematical modeling to demonstrate that Syk is actively transported to the centrosomes via the microtubules and that this transport depends on the dynein/dynactin molecular motor. Syk can only target the centrosomes if its kinase activity is intact and it is catalytically active at the centrosomes. We showed that the autophosphorylated Y130 Syk residue helps to uncouple Syk from the plasma membrane and to promote its translocation to the centrosome, suggesting that the subcellular location of Syk depends on its autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues. We have thus established the details of how Syk is trafficked intracellularly and found evidence that its targeting to the centrosomes is controlled by autophosphorylation.—Fargier, G., Favard, C., Parmeggiani, A., Sahuquet, A., Mérezègue, F., Morel, A., Denis, M., Molinari, N., Mangeat, P.

https://openalex.org/W1970660895,"The regulatory mechanism underlying the interaction of the Rabex-5 MIU domain with ubiquitinated cargos remains unclear.Rabex-5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) mutants affected interactions of ubiquitinated cargos.GDP/GTP exchange in the GEF domain controls the MIU domain interactions with the ubiquitinated cargos.Rabex-5 GEF activity acts as an intramolecular switch for spatiotemporal trafficking of the ubiquitinated cargos. Ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent endocytosis of membrane proteins requires precise molecular recognition of ubiquitinated cargo by Ub-binding proteins (UBPs). Many UBPs are often themselves monoubiquitinated, a mechanism referred to as coupled monoubiquitination, which prevents them from binding in trans to the ubiquitinated cargo. However, the spatiotemporal regulatory mechanism underlying the interaction of UBPs with the ubiquitinated cargo, via their Ub-binding domains (UBDs) remains unclear. Previously, we reported the interaction of Rabex-5, a UBP and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5, with ubiquitinated neural cell adhesion molecule L1, via its motif interacting with Ub (MIU) domain. This interaction is critical for the internalization and sorting of the ubiquitinated L1 into endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The present study demonstrated that the interaction of Rabex-5 with Rab5 depends specifically on interaction of the MIU domain with the ubiquitinated L1 to drive its internalization. Notably, impaired GEF mutants and the Rabex-5(E213A) mutant increased the flexibility of the hinge region in the HB-VPS9 tandem domain, which significantly affected their interactions with the ubiquitinated L1. In addition, GEF mutants increased the catalytic efficiency, which resulted in a reduced interaction with the ubiquitinated L1. Furthermore, the coupled monoubiquitination status of Rabex-5 was found to be significantly associated with interaction of Rabex-5 and the ubiquitinated L1. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanism, wherein the GEF activity of Rabex-5 acts as an intramolecular switch orchestrating ubiquitinated cargo-binding activity and coupled monoubiquitination to permit the spatiotemporal dynamic exchange of the ubiquitinated cargos."
https://openalex.org/W2070014486,"A key ingredient to modern data analysis is probability density estimation. However, it is well known that the curse of dimensionality prevents a proper estimation of densities in high dimensions. The problem is typically circumvented by using a fixed set of assumptions about the data, e.g., by assuming partial independence of features, data on a manifold or a customized kernel. These fixed assumptions limit the applicability of a method. In this paper we propose a framework that uses a flexible set of assumptions instead. It allows to tailor a model to various problems by means of 1d-decompositions. The approach achieves a fast runtime and is not limited by the curse of dimensionality as all estimations are performed in 1d-space. The wide range of applications is demonstrated at two very different real world examples. The first is a data mining software that allows the fully automatic discovery of patterns. The software is publicly available for evaluation. As a second example an image segmentation method is realized. It achieves state of the art performance on a benchmark dataset although it uses only a fraction of the training data and very simple features."
