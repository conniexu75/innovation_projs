https://openalex.org/W2022129165,"Epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor can stimulate the production of the second messenger inositol trisphosphate in responsive cells, but the biochemical pathway for these signaling events has been uncertain because the reactions have not been reconstituted with purified molecules in vitro. A reconstitution is described that requires not only the growth factor, its receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, and the soluble phospholipase C-gamma 1, but also the small soluble actin-binding protein profilin. Profilin binds to the substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inhibits its hydrolysis by unphosphorylated phospholipase C-gamma 1. Phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase overcomes the inhibitory effect of profilin and results in an effective activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1."

https://openalex.org/W1661985738,"Abstract Activated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) convert molecular oxygen into superoxide anion, a process known as the respiratory burst, through the activity of a latent multicomponent NADPH-dependent oxidase. Components of this respiratory burst oxidase include the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 and the cytosolic factors p47-phox and p67-phox. We initiated these studies based on three observations: 1) that stimulation of PMN oxidase activity is associated with translocation of the cytosolic oxidase components to the plasma membrane; 2) that p47-phox is phosphorylated during PMN activation and that there is a sequential relationship between phosphorylation of p47-phox in the cytosol and appearance of the phosphoprotein in the membran; and 3) that the predicted amino acid sequences of p47-phox and of p67-phox contain regions of homology to the SH3 or A domain of the src family of tyrosine kinases, a region found in a variety of proteins which interact with the cytoskeleton or the subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton. Thus the purpose of our studies was to examine the role of protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation in the stimulus-induced association of p47-phox and p67-phox with the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Using the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) as the agonist, we found that activation of the respiratory burst oxidase was associated with translocation of cytosolic p47-phox and p67-phox to the plasma membrane as well as redistribution of p47-phox to the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the PKC inhibitor staurosporine inhibited phosphorylation of p47-phox, interrupted the redistribution of cytosolic oxidase factors, and blocked PMA-induced generation of superoxide anion. Taken together these results indicate that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of p47-phox correlates with association of p47-phox with the cytoskeleton and with translocation of p47-phox and p67-phox to the plasma membrane, with the ensuing assembly of an active superoxide-generating NADPH-dependent oxidase."

These results provide direct evidence that gelsolin, which promotes both actin assembly and disassembly in vitro, is an important element in fibroblast locomotion and demonstrate that the manipulation of intracellular machinery can increase cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W1541988093,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been transfected with either a full-length cDNA encoding human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II; EC 3.4.15.1) (ACE) or a mutated cDNA, in which the last C-terminal 47 amino acids, including the putative transmembrane domain, are not translated. Cell lines expressing high levels of the wild-type ACE or the mutant were established. The cells transfected with the wild-type cDNA (CHO-ACE) express a membrane-bound ectoenzyme with an intracellular C terminus, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence using an antiserum (28A7) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the deduced C terminus of ACE. This enzyme is structurally, immunologically, and enzymatically identical to human kidney ACE. In addition, CHO-ACE cells also produce a secreted form of the enzyme. Neither this secreted form nor the enzyme purified from human plasma is recognized by the antiserum 28A7, indicating that they undergo a truncation in the C-terminal region. On the other hand, the transfected cells expressing the C-terminally truncated mutant (CHO-ACE delta COOH) do not retain ACE in the plasma membrane, but secrete it into the medium. These results indicate that ACE is anchored to the plasma membrane by the predicted C-terminal transmembrane domain, and the secreted form is derived from the membrane-bound form by a post-translational proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1519083075,"The signal for the rapid internalization of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor has been previously localized to the inner half of the 163-amino acid cytoplasmic tail, including tyrosine 24 and tyrosine 26 (Lobel, P., Fujimoto, K., Ye, R. D., Griffiths, G., and Kornfeld, S. (1989) Cell 57, 787-796). To define this signal more precisely, we generated a series of truncation and substitution mutants and analyzed them for their ability to mediate the endocytosis of extracellular lysosomal enzymes. Mutant receptors containing cytoplasmic domains of 29 or more amino acids functioned normally in endocytosis whereas a mutant receptor with a 28-amino acid cytoplasmic domain was internalized extremely slowly. Alanine scanning of the region between amino acids 19 and 30 identified tyrosine 26 and valine 29 as the most important residues for rapid receptor internalization. Tyrosine 24 and lysine 28 also contributed to the signal while the other amino acids were not critical. The tyrosine residues could be substituted with phenylalanines with no loss of activity, indicating the requirement for an aromatic residue in these positions rather than tyrosine specifically. Conservative substitutions of arginine or histidine for lysine 28 also preserved the internalization signal. These results indicate that the sequence Tyr-Lys-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Val serves as the internalization signal for the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor. The crucial elements of this sequence are present in the cytoplasmic tails of a number of other membrane receptors and proteins known to undergo rapid internalization."

https://openalex.org/W1993532945,"The main route of information flow in the cerebral cortex is from the middle layers of cortex to upper and lower layers. However, upper layers of the cat primary visual cortex can be directly driven by inputs from secondary visual cortex when activity in middle layers is disrupted. Upper-layer activity can be driven either by middle layers or by direct corticocortical inputs. One consequence of this result is that areas of cortex thought to be carrying out low-order analysis may be able to extract considerable information from higher order areas."

https://openalex.org/W2058606944,"Deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a candidate genetic disorder for somatic cell gene therapy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients affected by ADA- SCID were transduced with a retroviral vector for human ADA and injected into immunodeficient mice. Long-term survival of vector-transduced human cells was demonstrated in recipient animals. Expression of vector-derived ADA restored immune functions, as indicated by the presence in reconstituted animals of human immunoglobulin and antigen-specific T cells. Retroviral vector gene transfer, therefore, is necessary and sufficient for development of specific immune functions in vivo and has therapeutic potential to correct this lethal immunodeficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1533952678,"To examine the effect of the introduction of a disulfide bond on the stability of Escherichia coli ribonuclease H, a disulfide bond was engineered between Cys13, which is present in the wild-type enzyme, and Cys44, which is substituted for Asn44 by site-directed mutagenesis. The disulfide bond was only formed between these residues upon oxidation in vitro with redox buffer. The conformational and thermal stabilities were estimated from the guanidine hydrochloride and thermal denaturation curves, respectively. The oxidized (cross-linked) mutant enzyme showed a Tm of 62.3 degrees C, which was 11.8 degrees C higher than that observed for the wild-type enzyme. The free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, delta G[H2O], and the mid-point of the denaturation curve, [D]1/2, of the oxidized mutant enzyme were also increased by 2.1-2.8 kcal/mol and 0.36-0.48 M, respectively. Introduction of a disulfide bond thus greatly enhanced both the thermal and conformational stabilities of the enzyme. In addition, kinetic analyses for the enzymatic activities of mutant enzymes suggest that Thr43 and Asn44 are involved in the substrate-binding site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1529524323,"Based on predictions of the structure of proteinase 3C of poliovirus, mutations have been made at residues that are supposed to constitute the catalytic triad. Wild-type and mutant 3C were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized by the ability to cleave a synthetic peptide substrate or an in vitro translated polypeptide consisting of part of the polyprotein of poliovirus. Additionally, the ability of autocatalytic processing of a precursor harboring wild-type or mutant 3C sequences was tested. Single substitutions of the residues His-40, Glu-71, and Cys-147 by Tyr, Gln, and Ser, respectively, resulted in an inactive enzyme. Replacement of Asp-85 by Asn resulted in an enzyme that was as active as wild-type enzyme in trans cleavage assays but whose autoprocessing ability was impaired. Our results are consistent with the proposal that residues His-40, Glu-71, and Cys-147 constitute the catalytic triad of poliovirus 3C proteinase. Furthermore, residue Asp-85 is not required for proper proteolytic activity despite being highly conserved between different picornaviruses. This indicates that Asp-85 might be involved in a different function of 3C."
https://openalex.org/W1567146715,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain, is known to interact with a subclass of receptors that activate a ligand-gated chloride ion channel. Exposure of cultured embryonic chick neurons to physiological concentrations of GABA results in a time-dependent down-regulation of these GABAA receptors. To delineate the cellular mechanism(s) responsible for agonist-induced down-regulation of GABAA receptors we quantified the levels of GABAA receptor alpha subunit messenger RNAs, which encode the subunit(s) containing agonist recognition site(s), and observed a marked reduction in alpha subunit mRNAs following exposure of embryonic chick neurons to GABA. Both the down-regulation of GABAA receptors and the reduction in alpha subunit mRNAs induced by GABA were completely antagonized by the specific GABAA receptor antagonist SR-95531. These data demonstrate the presence of an agonist-induced receptor-mediated mechanism for regulating the expression of receptor subunit-encoding mRNAs that may be involved in the development of tolerance to the pharmacological actions of drugs known to act via GABAA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1501146982,"Recombinant DNA-derived apolipoprotein(a) was used to demonstrate that the apo(a) moiety of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is responsible for the binding of Lp(a) to other apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (apoB-Lp) including LDL2, a subclass of low density lipoproteins (d = 1.030-1.063 g/ml). The r-apo(a).LDL2 complexes exhibited the same binding constant as Lp(a).LDL2 (10(-8) M). Treatment of either recombinant apo(a) or Lp(a) with a reducing agent destroyed binding activity. A synthetic polypeptide corresponding to a portion of apo(a)'s kringle-4 inhibited the binding (K1 = 1.9 x 10(-4) M) of LDL2 to Lp(a). Therefore, we concluded that binding to apoB-Lp was mediated by the kringle-4-like domains on apo(a). Using ligand chromatography which can detect complexes having a KD as low as 10(-2) M, we demonstrated the binding of plasminogen to apoB-Lp. Like Lp(a), binding of plasminogen to apoB-Lp was mediated by the kringle domain(s). The differences in binding affinity may be due to amino acid substitutions in the kringle-4-like domain. In most of the kringle-4-like domains of apo(a), the aspartic residue critical for binding to lysine was substituted by valine. Consistent with this substitution, we found that L-proline and hydroxyproline, but not L-lysine, inhibited the binding of LDL2 to apo(a). Inhibition by L-proline could be reversed in the binding studies by increasing the amount of apo(a); and L-proline-Sepharose bound plasma Lp(a), suggesting that L-proline acted as a ligand for the kringle-4-like domain(s) of apo(a) involved in the binding of apoB-Lp. The binding of apo(a) to proline and hydroxyproline could be responsible for the binding of apo(a) to the subendothelial extracellular matrix, i.e. domains of proteins rich in proline or hydroxyproline (e.g. collagen and elastin)."
https://openalex.org/W1593791751,"A novel serine/threonine protein phosphatase is identified, and the catalytic subunit, obtained from a detergent extraction of the pellet generated by a 100,000 x g centrifugation of a whole bovine brain homogenate, is purified and characterized. The protein phosphatase, designated as PP3, has a Mr of 36,000, does not require divalent cations for activity, is stimulated rather than inhibited by inhibitor 2, is inhibited by both okadaic acid and microcystin-LR with an intermediate IC50 compared to type 1 and type 2A protein phosphatases, and preferentially dephosphorylates the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase. Substrate specificity, immunoblotting with type-specific antisera, and the amino acid sequences of peptides derived from PP3 indicate that PP3 is not an isoform of any known serine/threonine protein phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1547719903,"Endothelial cells from brain microvessels (BCEC) express high affinity receptor sites for endothelin-1 that recognize endothelin-3 with a low affinity (Vigne, P., Marsault, R., Breittmayer, J.P. & Frelin, C. (1990) Biochem. J. 266, 415-420). Binding experiments using 125I-endothelin-3 showed the presence in BCEC of a new class of receptor sites that had a high affinity for endothelin-3 (Kd = 0.8 nM), endothelin-1 (Kd = 0.8 nM), and sarafotoxin S6b (Kd = 0.3 nM). Endothelins activated phospholipase C in BCEC and produced transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ with properties of a low affinity endothelin-3 receptor. Endothelins also increased 22Na+ uptake via the Na+/H+ antiporter in BCEC. Concentrations for half-maximum activation (endothelin-1, 0.5 nM; sarafotoxin S6b, 1 nM; endothelin-3, 2 nM) were close to the Kd values determined in 125I-endothelin-3-binding experiments. The action of endothelins on Na+/H+ exchange was not mimicked by phorbol myristate acetate, it was not reversed by staurosporine, and it did not correlate with the phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein. These results indicated that the action of endothelins on Na+/H+ exchange did not involve protein kinase C. It is concluded that BCEC coexpress two types of functional receptor sites for endothelins: (i) a high affinity endothelin-1, low affinity endothelin-3 receptor that is coupled to phospholipase C and to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and (ii) a high affinity endothelin-1, high affinity endothelin-3 receptor that controls Na+/H+ exchange activity via a protein kinase C-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1577259864,"It was shown previously that 422 (aP2) protein, a 15-kDa fatty acid binding protein, is phosphorylated on Tyr19 both in vitro by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and in intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin and phenylarsine oxide (PAO). Phospho-422(aP2) protein (pp15) accumulates in cells treated with insulin and PAO because the arsenical blocks turnover of the phosphoryl group of pp15. These findings suggest that a PAO-sensitive enzyme mediates turnover of the pp15 tyrosine phosphoryl group. We have purified and characterized two membrane protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes that catalyze hydrolysis of phospho-Tyr19 of authentic pp15. These enzymes, designated PTPases HA1 and HA2, were purified approximately 20,000-fold and approximately 15,000-fold, respectively, and shown to differ markedly in their sensitivity to both vanadate and phosphotyrosine. Both enzymes are inhibited by PAO and accordingly can be labeled with 4-[125I]iodo-PAO. By this method, it was demonstrated that PTPases HA1 and HA2 have molecular masses of approximately 60 kDa and approximately 38 kDa, respectively. Both enzymes exhibit substrate preference for pp15 when compared with other phosphotyrosine-containing protein substrates. Proteins containing phosphoserine and phosphothreonine do not serve as substrates for the enzymes. The pp15 PTPase HA2 is expressed both in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes, whereas pp15 PTPase HA1 is expressed only in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1518711776,"This report explores the potential side-chain functional groups required for interaction of the bronchodilator neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), with its receptor. The binding affinity and biological activity of native VIP have been found to be sensitive to the removal of amino- and carboxyl-terminal residues. This data suggests that elements within the entire primary sequence of the VIP molecule appear to be necessary for recognition by VIP receptors. The introduction of alanine residues substituted into the VIP molecule is utilized to probe for side-chain functional groups that are crucial for eliciting high receptor binding affinity in vitro and high biological potency in vivo. The VIP pharmacophore appears to be identical in guinea pig lung and human lung and consists of multiple binding sites most likely involving positions Asp3, Phe6, Thr7, Tyr10, Tyr22, and Leu23. These findings could be exploited to enhance the biological potency of VIP by increasing the binding energy at these positions."
https://openalex.org/W1560293757,"The goal of these experiments was to identify and characterize binding sites in the rat hypothalamus for the peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP). The 27 amino acid form of PACAP (PACAP27) was used as the radiolabeled ligand in these experiments. Binding of [125I]PACAP27 to hypothalamic membrane preparations was rapid, reversible on addition of unlabeled peptide, and at least partially regulated by GTP. Nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), guanosine-5-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS), and guanylylimidophosphate (GppNHp) also displaced [125I]PACAP27 binding to hypothalamic membrane preparations in a dose-dependent manner. The order of potency for the three analogs was GTPγS > GDPβS > GppNHp. Both forms of the peptide, PACAP27 and PACAP38, were highly potent in displacing bound [125I]PACAP27, whereas VIP or PACAP(1–23) were unable to displace binding at concentrations of up to 500 nM. Scatchard analysis of the PACAP27 and PACAP38 displacement curves revealed that the fit of both curves was consistent with a single class of high-affinity binding sites, although the site exhibited a greater affinity for PACAP38 compared with PACAP27 (PACAP27 Kd = 1452 ± 59 pM; PACAP38 Kd = 175 ± 13 pM; Bmax 23.2 ± 1.1 pmol/mg protein). The possibility of the existence of a class of binding sites with extremely low affinity cannot be discounted. After covalent cross-linking of [125I]PACAP27 with its receptor, the molecular weights of the complexes were estimated by electrophoresis and autoradiography. A major band of 60 Kd was evident when membranes were incubated with VIP or PACAP(1–23). Previous incubation with unlabeled PACAP27 or PACAP38 eliminated visualization of this band. These results suggest that a specific, high-affinity binding site for PACAP27 is present in rat hypothalamus, and that this site shows a greater affinity for PACAP38 compared with PACAP27. The molecular weight of the peptide-receptor complex is 60,000 kDa, and therefore the receptor itself has an apparent molecular weight 57,000.—Gottschall, P. E.; Tatsuno, I.; Arimua, A.

https://openalex.org/W1479917310,"We investigated the ability of natural polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine to provoke a left-handed Z-DNA conformation in a recombinant plasmid (pDHg16) with a 23-base pair insert of (dG-dC)n.(dG-dC)n sequences. Using a monoclonal anti-Z-DNA antibody (Z22) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocol, we found that spermidine and spermine were capable of converting pDHg16 to the Z-DNA form. The concentrations of spermidine and spermine at the midpoint of the B-DNA to Z-DNA transition were 280 and 5 microM, respectively, in buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.15 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. A plot of ln[Na+] versus ln [spermine4+], where [Na+] is the bulk NaCl concentration and [spermine4+] is the spermine concentration at the midpoint of the B-DNA to Z-DNA transition, gave a straight line with a slope of 1.2. Structural specificity was clearly evident in the efficacy of three spermidine homologs to induce the Z-DNA conformation in pDHg16. Putrescine and acetylspermidines had no effect on the conformation of the plasmid DNA up to a 3 mM concentration. Control experiments with the parental plasmid (pDPL6) showed no binding of the plasmid DNA with Z22. These results indicate that spermidine and spermine are capable of provoking the left-handed Z-DNA conformation in small blocks of (dG-dC)n sequences embedded in a right-handed B-DNA matrix. Since blocks of (dG-dC)n sequences are found in certain native DNAs, conformational alterations of these regions to the Z-DNA form in the presence of polyamines may have important gene regulatory effects."

Two clones, one of which (1C) expressed some 3.5 pmol/mg membrane protein of the receptor as assessed by the specific binding of [3H]yohimbine and one (4D) which did not express detectable amounts of the receptor were selected for further study. When cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was performed with [32P]NAD on membranes of these cells in the absence of added guanine nucleotides, radioactivity was incorporated into a polypeptide(s) of 40 kDa in addition to the 45- and 42-kDa forms of Gs alpha. Addition of the selective alpha 2 receptor agonist U.K.14304 enhanced markedly, in a dose-dependent manner, the cholera toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the 40-kDa polypeptide(s), but not the 45- or 42-kDa polypeptides, in membranes of the 1C cells. Dose response curves for U.K.14304 enhancement of cholera toxin-labeling of the 40-kDa polypeptide(s) and stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity were identical. By contrast, U.K.14304 was ineffective in either assay in membranes from the 4D cells, demonstrating this effect to be dependent upon receptor activation. Furthermore, the alpha 2 receptor antagonist yohimbine blocked all effects of U.K.14304. The agonist promotion of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi was completely blocked by guanine nucleotides. Whether GDP or GDP + fluoroaluminate (as a mimic of GTP) was used, blockade of the agonist effect was complete and indeed both conditions prevented agonist-independent labeling by cholera toxin of the 40-kDa polypeptide(s). Mg2+ produced an agonist-independent cholera toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the 40-kDa polypeptide(s) but even in the presence of [Mg2+], agonist-stimulation of cholera toxin-labeling of the 40-kDa polypeptide(s) was observed and was additive with the effect of [Mg2+]. Agonist stimulation of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi was completely attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, which prevents contact between receptors and G-proteins which are substrates for this toxin. By contrast, pretreatment of the cells with concentrations of cholera toxin able to down-regulate essentially all of the membrane-associated Gs alpha did not prevent agonist stimulation of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1671215381,"We have identified two novel enzyme systems in human HeLa nuclear extracts that can nick at specific sites of DNA molecules with base mismatches, in addition to the T/G mismatch-specific nicking enzyme system (Wiebauer, K., and Jiricny, J. (1989) Nature 339, 234-236). One enzyme (called all-type) can nick all eight base mismatches with different efficiencies. The other (A/G-specific) nicks only DNA containing an A/G mismatch. The all-type enzyme can be separated from the T/G-specific and A/G-specific nicking enzymes by Bio-Rex 70 chromatography. Further purification on a DEAE-5PW column separated the A/G-specific nicking enzyme from the T/G-specific nicking enzyme. Therefore, at least three different enzyme systems are able to cleave mismatched DNA in HeLa nuclear extracts. The all-type and A/G-specific enzymes work at different optimal salt concentrations and cleave at different sites within the mismatched DNA. The all-type enzyme can only cleave at the first phosphodiester bond 5' to the mispaired bases. This enzyme shows nick disparity to only one DNA strand and may be involved in genetic recombination. The A/G-specific enzyme simultaneously makes incisions at the first phosphodiester bond both 5' and 3' to the mispaired adenine but not the guanine base. This enzyme may be involved in an A/G mismatch-specific repair similar to the Escherichia coli mutY (or micA)-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1573574172,"We examined the effect of fatty acids on phosphatidylcholine synthesis and cytidylyltransferase activity in Hep G2 cells. Treatment of Hep G2 cells with oleic acid caused an increase in the incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline into phosphatidylcholine and a corresponding decrease in radioactivity in choline phosphate using a pulse-chase procedure. This result is consistent with a fatty acid-induced increase in the cytidylyl-transferase step in the choline pathway. We measured cytidylyltransferase activity in membrane fractions and in cytosol (100,000 x g supernatant or soluble enzyme released by digitonin). The activity increased in both membrane and cytosol. Thus, an increase in total activity occurred. Cytidylyltransferase protein determined by Western blot immunoassay increased after oleic acid treatment. Immunotitration of cytidylyltransferase protein also indicated that an increase in enzyme protein resulted from oleic acid treatment. Cycloheximide did not prevent the oleic acid-induced increase in cytidylyltransferase activity. The increase in enzyme activity was apparent when we measured the activity in the presence or absence of lipid activators. Separation of cytosolic cytidylyltransferase into H- and L-forms showed that the increase in cytosolic activity was due to an increase in H-form. The amount of L-form did not change. We interpret these results to suggest that fatty acid treatment of Hep G2 cells promoted the formation of active cytidylyltransferase (H-form) from a preexisting inactive form. The increased activity was distributed between membranes and the lipoprotein form in cytosol (H-form)."
https://openalex.org/W1602240975,"The transposon Tn10-encoded tetA gene product is a metal-tetracycline/proton antiporter (Yamaguchi, A., Udagawa, T., and Sawai, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4809-4813). Its tetracycline transport activity was inhibited by a histidine-specific reagent, diethyl pyrocarbonate. Among five histidine residues in this antiporter, only His257 is located in the putative transmembrane helices. Thus, His257 was replaced by Glu or Asp. Inverted vesicles containing the Glu257 and Asp257 mutant proteins showed only 20 and 10% of the tetracycline uptake of wild-type vesicles, respectively. In contrast to wild-type vesicles, the mutant vesicles showed no tetracycline-dependent proton translocation, indicating that the mutant proteins had lost the tetracycline/H+ antiport activity. The significant 60Co2+ uptake without proton translocation by the mutant vesicles also confirmed that the mutant carriers act as uniporters of a metal-tetracycline complex. The metal-tetracycline uniport by the mutant proteins was not inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate, indicating that His257 is the only histidine residue essential for proton translocation. These mutant proteins conferred about half-level resistance to tetracycline, probably due to their catalyzing downhill efflux of a metal-tetracycline complex out of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508275953,"Rapid kinetics of both glucose-6-P uptake and hydrolysis in fasted rat liver microsomes were investigated with a recently developed fast-sampling, rapid-filtration apparatus. Experiments were confronted with both the substrate transport and conformational models currently proposed for the glucose-6-phosphatase system. Accumulation in microsomes of 14C products from [U-14C]glucose-6-P followed biexponential kinetics. From the inside to outside product concentrations, it could be inferred that mostly glucose should accumulate inside the vesicles. While biexponential kinetics are compatible with the mathematical predictions of a simplified substrate transport model, the latter fails in explaining the in total glucose production over a similar time scale to that used for the uptake measurements. Since the initial rate of the burst phase in untreated microsomes exactly matched the steady-state rate of glucose production in detergent-treated vesicles, it can be definitely concluded that the substrate transport model does not describe adequately our results. While the conformational model accounts for both the burst of glucose production and the kinetics of glucose accumulation into the vesicles, it cannot explain the burst in 32Pi production from [32P]glucose-6-P measured under the same conditions. Since the amplitude of the observed bursts is not compatible with a presteady state in enzyme activity, we propose that a hysteretic transition best explains our results in both untreated and permeabilized microsomes, thus providing a new rationale to understand the molecular mechanism of the glucose-6-phosphatase system."

Bt2cAMP induced a 5.3 +/- 0.8-fold increase in alpha 2A receptor mRNA abundance as did forskolin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide which both increase cAMP accumulation in these cells. Bt2cAMP increased alpha 2A receptor number up to 2.4 +/- 0.3-fold. The rate of alpha 2A receptor gene transcription increased 7.8 +/- 3.2-fold in cells treated with Bt2cAMP for 2 h; after 24 h, the transcription rate was 3.7 +/- 1.7-fold higher than in controls. The increased rate of transcription occurred in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The half life of the alpha 2A receptor mRNA in cells incubated with Bt2cAMP for 2 h increased by 1.5-fold but returned to the original value after exposure to Bt2cAMP for 24 h. The increased expression of alpha 2A receptors was associated with an increased efficacy of inhibition of cAMP accumulation mediated by the alpha 2 adrenergic agonist UK14304. Using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid containing 5'-flanking sequences of the alpha 2A receptor gene, we found that co-transfection of JEG-3 cells with expression vectors containing cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit cDNA with mutations at both cAMP binding sites inhibited basal and Bt2cAMP-stimulated expression of CAT activity. These results demonstrate that an alpha 2A adrenergic receptor gene is regulated by the second messenger cAMP via cAMP-dependent protein kinase, mainly by controlling the rate of transcription, which leads to an increased expression of these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1577421752,"Mouse embryos at the two-cell stage, like other cells, can recover from an intracellular acid-load. Our previous work has shown, surprisingly, that there is no contribution to this recovery by Na+/H+ antiport activity. Here we show that the recovery similarly is not affected by inhibition of other known intracellular pH (pHi) regulatory mechanisms. Specifically, the recovery is unaffected by lack of external Na+, inhibition of anion exchange, or lack of bicarbonate, which eliminates the Na(+)-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchanger as a possible mechanisms. These conditions also eliminate any possible Na+,HCO3- cotransporter operating to relieve acid-loading. Recovery is unaffected similarly by nonspecific inhibitors of H(+)-ATPase activity. These observations lead to the conclusion that recovery from acid-load is a passive process in the two-cell mouse embryo. Similarly, the mean base-line pHi (6.84) is not dependent on known pHi regulatory mechanisms. The embryos exhibit a marked intracellular alkalinization when exposed to Cl(-)-free medium in the presence of bicarbonate. This response is eliminated by an inhibitor of anion exchange and by lack of bicarbonate, but is independent of Na+. These results indicate that there is probably a Na(+)-independent HCO3-/Cl- exchanger active in these cells, presumably functioning to alleviate alkaline loads."
https://openalex.org/W1595161767,"Various plasma proteins, for example, transferrin, are synthesized not only in the liver, but also in the brain. The proportion of transferrin mRNA in total RNA from different regions of brains from various mammalian species was studied by Northern blot analysis. Absolute amounts of transferrin mRNA were determined in brain, choroid plexus, and liver from rats, sheep, and pigs by hybridization in solution followed by ribonuclease protection assay. Corrections for differences in yields of RNA were made using internal RNA standards. Large proportions of transferrin mRNA in total RNA and high absolute levels of transferrin mRNA in choroid plexus were found only in rats. Small proportions of transferrin mRNA were observed in RNA from choroid plexus from mice, dogs, and rabbits, while no transferrin mRNA at all was detected in choroid plexus from humans, sheep, pigs, cows, and guinea pigs. In further analysis of sheep and pigs, various amounts of transferrin mRNA were found in many parts of the brain, in contrast to the absence of transferrin mRNA from choroid plexus. In conclusion, a striking species specificity was observed for the pattern of cerebral expression of the transferrin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1548023071,"Na+/H+ antiporters play important physiological roles in most biological membranes. Although they were first discovered in mitochondria (Mitchell, P., and Moyle, J. (1969) Eur. J. Biochem. 9, 149-155), the mitochondrial Na+/H+ antiporter has not yet been reconstituted nor has the protein responsible for its activity been identified. We used detergents to extract proteins from beef heart mitochondria and reconstituted these proteins into lipid vesicles loaded with the fluorescent probe, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate. The vesicles exhibited spontaneous, electroneutral Na+ transport that was inhibited by Li+ and Mn2+ with appropriate kinetic constants. These protocols were then used to follow fractionation of the solubilized proteins with DEAE-cellulose columns. We obtained a fraction that catalyzed Na+/H+ antiport with Vmax values of 75-120 mumol/mg protein/min, 500-700 times faster than observed in intact mitochondria. Na+ transport was inhibited by Li+ with I50 values of 0.5-1.0 mM and by Mn2+ with I50 value of 0.5 mM. The Km for Na+ was 31 mM. These values correspond to those found in intact mitochondria, and we conclude that the solubilized mitochondrial Na+/H+ antiporter has been partially purified in a reconstitutively active state."
https://openalex.org/W2060939129,"In E. coli strain EC::71CW chromosome replication is under the control of the R1 miniplasmid pOU71. A dnaA850::Tn10 derivative of EC::71CW was viable, which confirmed that R1 can replicate in the absence of the DnaA protein. The frequency of initiation of replication was, however, lowered and cell division was severely disturbed due to underreplication of the chromosome. Both replication and cell division could be restored to normal by increasing the production of RepA, the rate-limiting protein for initiation of replication from the integrated R1 origin. Therefore, the RepA protein seems to compensate for the absence of DnaA in the initiation of replication and assembly of replisomes. The role of the DnaA protein in the initiation of DNA replication, and as an overall regulator of the chromosome replication and cell division cycles of E. coli, is discussed in view of these results."
https://openalex.org/W1557235975,"The function of ras protein and its relationship to growth-factor mediated signal transduction remain unclear. The demonstration that the expression of transforming ras (v-ras) can block the stimulation of growth-related gene expression and cell division mediated by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may provide a model for the functional interation of ras with growth factor receptors. In the current studies, we have demonstrated that this blockade by v-ras of PDGF-BB signal transduction occurs very early in signal transduction, at the level of PDGF receptor autophosphorylation. Although the expression of PDGF receptor as detected by Western blot with anti-PDGF receptor antibody was not diminished in v-ras-transformed murine Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, the autophosphorylation of PDGF receptor in response to ligand (recombinant PDGF-BB homodimer) stimulation was profoundly suppressed. This same phenomenon of v-ras-mediated PDGF receptor autophosphorylation inhibition was also demonstrated in normal rat kidney fibroblasts. Further, factor(s) present in v-ras-expressing fibroblasts found in the membrane fractions of these cells can dominantly inhibit the autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor obtained from normal fibroblasts. These findings suggest a role for ras in one of the earliest steps of the signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1679202163,"Two equilibrative (facilitated diffusion) nucleoside transport processes and a concentrative Na(+)-dependent co-transport process contribute to zero-trans inward fluxes of nucleosides in L1210 mouse leukemia cells. Na(+)-linked inward adenosine fluxes in L1210/AM cells (a clone deficient in adenosine, deoxyadenosine, and deoxycytidine kinase activities) were measured as initial rates of [3H]adenosine influx in medium containing Na+ salts and 10 microM dipyridamole. The Na(+)-linked transporter distinguished between the D- and L-enantiomers of adenosine, the latter being a virtual nonpermeant in the initial-rate assay. Adenine arabinoside, inosine, 2‘-deoxyadenosine and 2‘-deoxyadenosine derivatives with halogen atoms at the purine C-2 position were recognized as substrates of the Na(+)-linked system because of their inhibition of adenosine (10 microM) fluxes under the condition of Na(+)-dependence with IC50 values ranging between 25 and 183 microM; uridine, deoxycytidine, and cytosine arabinoside (each at 400 microM) inhibited adenosine fluxes by 10-40%. Inward Na(+)-linked adenosine fluxes were saturable with respect to extracellular adenosine and Na+ concentrations [( Na+]o); Km and Vmax values for adenosine influx were 9.4 +/- 2.6 microM and 1.67 +/- 0.2 pmol/microliter cell water/s when [Na+]o was 100 mM. The stoichiometry of Na+:adenosine co-transport, determined by Hill analysis of the dependence of adenosine fluxes on [Na+]o, was 1:1. The thiol-reactive agents, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), showdomycin and p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonate (pCMPS), inhibited Na(+)-linked adenosine fluxes with IC50 values of 40, 10, and 2 microM, respectively. This inhibition was partially reversed by the presence of adenosine in incubation media containing pCMPS, but not NEM. Thiol groups accessible to pCMPS may be involved in substrate recognition by the transporter and in the permeation step."
https://openalex.org/W2100296138,"A recombinant analog of human choriogonadotropin beta-subunit descarboxyl-terminal peptide (115-145 residues, delhCG beta) was obtained by the expression of corresponding beta cDNA in the baculovirus expression system. The efficiency of expression and secretion was high. The recombinant delhCG beta was purified by immunoaffinity using a specific monoclonal antibody against hCG beta and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The hCG beta analog lacked the carboxyl-terminal 31-residue peptide as well as the four O-linked carbohydrates. Also, the N-linked complex type carbohydrates in the deletion mutant were modified to the high mannose type. The apparent molecular weights of delhCG beta in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions were found to be 19,000 and 27,500 respectively. delhCG beta on hydrolysis with endo N-acetylglucosaminidase F or H yielded a 17,500 protein band whereas treatment with N-glycanase gave a protein band with a molecular weight of 16,000. The carbohydrate analysis of delhCG beta, calculated on the basis of 4 residues of N-acetylglucosamine, showed 3 or 4 fucose, 0.6 N-acetylgalactosamine, and 11.4 mannose residues, indicating the high mannose type structures of the two N-linked carbohydrate chains. Despite the carbohydrate modification of the N-linked carbohydrates and the carboxyl-terminal deletion, the delhCG beta had about 87% of the immunological activity of the native hCG beta, indicating no significant conformational alteration induced by the mutation. The delhCG beta combined readily with native hCG alpha, and the reconstituted hCG alpha del beta required 0.031 pmol to achieve 50% inhibition of binding of the tracer with rat lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor compared with 0.039 pmol by native hCG. Like native hCG, hCG alpha del beta also had most comparable ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation and progesterone production in rat Leydig cells. Thus it is clear from the data that the carboxyl-terminal deletion and thereby the deletion of four O-linked carbohydrates had no effect on its in vitro immunological and biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W1561104226,"Bovine adrenodoxin in the reduced form has been measured by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. By comparing the spectrum of reduced adrenodoxin with that of the oxidized protein, resonances have been assigned for the aromatic residues. The spin-lattice relaxation time for the resonances due to histidine residues was found to depend on the reduction state of adrenodoxin. The distance from the paramagnetic center is calculated by using the Solomone-Bloembergen equation. The resonances from Tyr-82 and Ala-81 show large chemical shift changes upon reduction of adrenodoxin. The conformational change of adrenodoxin manifested by chemical shift difference between reduced and oxidized forms is found in the sequence around Tyr-82 and Ala-81. Modification with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at Glu-74, Asp-79, and Asp-86 inhibited the interaction with both adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome P-450scc (Lambeth, D. J., Geren, L. M., and Millett, F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10025-10029; Geren, L. M., O'Brien, P., Stonehuerner, J., and Millett, F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2155-2160). Thus, the sequence of these amino acids was assigned to the interaction site with the redox partners. The present 1H NMR investigation of adrenodoxin demonstrates that a conformational change upon reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster occurs in the sequence of negatively charged amino acids that is a putative site for interaction with redox partners. This could offer the structural basis of the electron transfer mechanism in which adrenodoxin functions as a mobile electron carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2169323802,"The mammalian insulin-like growth factor II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/CIMPR) mediates both targeting and endocytosis of mannose 6-phosphate-containing proteins and binds insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CDMPR) lacks an IGF-II-binding site and participates only in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. During terminal differentiation of the myogenic C2 cell line, there is an increase in cell surface expression of the IGF-II/CIMPR in parallel with a rise in secretion of IGF-II (Tollefsen, S.E., Sadow, J.L., and Rotwein, P. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 1543-1547). In this study we show that IGF-II/CIMPR mRNA increases by more than 10-fold during the initial 48 h of C2 muscle differentiation with kinetics similar to the rise in IGF-II mRNA. Comparable levels of both mRNAs are expressed in C2 myotubes and in primary cultures of fetal muscle. By contrast, no change is observed in CDMPR transcript abundance during differentiation, and only a small, transient increase is seen in the enzymatic activities and mRNA levels of several lysosomal enzymes. The differential regulation of the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors during muscle differentiation suggests that they may serve distinct functions in development."
https://openalex.org/W1508465056,"Actin, one of the most abundant cellular proteins, circulates at micromolar concentrations in peripheral blood. Because actin released from dying cells may be trapped in fibrin clots that form at sites of tissue injury, we examined the effects of actin upon lysis of fibrin clots in vitro. Incorporation of native rabbit skeletal muscle actin into fibrin clots slowed their rates of lysis for periods of up to 24 h, an effect not seen when comparable concentrations of human IgG or bovine serum albumin were added instead. Actins isolated from a variety of sources inhibited plasmin's hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate S-2251 in a noncompetitive manner, with a Ki of a 0.6-3.1 microM. Inhibition was rapid, but covalent actin-plasmin complexes were not formed. Both epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid prevented actin's inhibition of plasmin, suggesting that accessible lysine residues of actin interact with the kringle (lysine-binding) regions of plasmin. Neither of the high-affinity actin-binding proteins of plasma (plasma gelsolin and vitamin D-binding protein) prevented actin from inhibiting plasmin. These findings suggest that actin released into the extracellular space following cell death may modulate plasmin action, and hence a number of plasmin-dependent biological responses, at sites of inflammation and tissue injury."

https://openalex.org/W1560016432,"Abstract Stimulation of the antigen receptor of WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells with anti-receptor antibodies (anti-IgM) induces irreversible growth arrest. Anti-IgM stimulates two kinds of transmembrane signaling events, phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosyl residues and breakdown of inositol phospholipids, which results in increases of inositol phosphates, diacylglycerol, and calcium. The roles of these reactions in mediating the growth arrest of the B lymphoma cells have not been established. To examine this issue, we took a genetic approach. Mutants of WEHI-231 cells were isolated that were resistant to anti-IgM-induced growth arrest. Five out of seven independent mutants analyzed had normal cell-surface expression of antigen receptors. Although each of these five mutants had tyrosine protein phosphorylation patterns comparable to wild-type cells, they exhibited alterations in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. Four of the mutants had decreased phosphoinositide breakdown, probably due to an alteration in phospholipase C. Decreased second messenger production may be responsible for the growth-resistant phenotype. Full growth arrest was restored upon addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin, suggesting that the limiting second messenger was intracellular free calcium. The final mutant appeared to be altered in a component(s) that responds to diacylglycerol and calcium. Taken together, these results provide further evidence that the phosphoinositide pathway is at least partly responsible for mediating antigen receptor regulation of B lymphoma cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1607593453,"The contractile sensitivity of smooth muscle to changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+] is dependent on the form of stimulation. Both myosin phosphorylation and force are less sensitive to increases in [Ca2+]i derived from Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels than to increases in [Ca2+] induced by agents which release internal Ca2+ stores. We hypothesized that activation of receptor-operated channels should produce a [Ca2+]i sensitivity similar to that induced by opening L channels. Aequorin-estimated myoplasmic [Ca2+] and myosin light chain phosphorylation were measured in swine carotid media tissues stimulated with ATP, an activator of the only known receptor-operated cation channel in smooth muscle. ATP, via activation of a P2x purinergic receptor, induced large, transient increases in [Ca2+]i, yet only small transient elevations in phosphorylation or force. Rapid desensitization to ATP was partially, but not completely, caused by hydrolysis of ATP into adenosine since 1) alpha-beta-methylene ATP (a poorly hydrolyzable analog of ATP) produced larger, yet still transient increases in [Ca2+]i, phosphorylation, and force; 2) BW A1433U, a P1 (adenosine) receptor antagonist, enhanced ATP-induced contractions; and 3) ATP, but not alpha-beta-methylene ATP increased bath [adenosine]. The [Ca2+]i sensitivity of phosphorylation during P2x receptor activation was similar to that observed with KCl-depolarization-induced opening of L channels, supporting the hypothesis that transplasmalemmal Ca2+ influx produces less phosphorylation and force than mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Cumulative additions of higher alpha-beta-methylene ATP concentrations induced repeated transient contractions, indicative of an unusual form of receptor desensitization which could be explained if the affinity of the P2x receptor for ATP, but not the receptor number were rapidly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1585694723,"Mice homozygous for chromosomal deletions at or around the albino locus on chromosome 7 express reduced levels of a group of liver genes, including tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and generally die perinatally. Sequences within the deleted region are thought to encode a regulatory factor(s) that affects expression of these genes in trans. To facilitate study of the putative factors, we immortalized hepatocytes derived from newborn cch wild-type and c14CoS deletion homozygous mice as well as cch/c14CoS heterozygous mice using a SV40 temperature-sensitive A255 mutant virus. Three c14CoS deletion homozygous hepatocyte lines were characterized and compared with the homozygous wild-type and heterozygous lines. The SV40 tsA255 mutant-transformed hepatocyte lines were temperature-sensitive for maintenance of transformation and expressed many liver-specific genes. In agreement with in vivo studies, hepatocyte lines derived from mice homozygous for the deletion expressed reduced mRNA levels of a number of liver genes including TAT, PEPCK, X1, X2, and X7 in comparison with heterozygous and wild-type cell lines. Similar mRNA levels of transferrin and albumin, genes whose expression is unaffected by the mutation in vivo, were observed in all cell lines. The expression of two genes, X5 and metallothionein, reported to be reduced in newborn mutant mice, did not differ appreciably among cell lines. TAT and PEPCK have been shown to respond poorly to glucocorticoids and cAMP in newborn mutant mice. Interestingly, all affected liver genes tested were responsive to glucocorticoids and dibutyryl cAMP in deletion homozygous cell lines as well as in wild-type and heterozygote-derived cell lines. This may suggest that effects of the deletion on expression of liver-specific genes do not cause loss of responsiveness to glucocorticoids and cAMP. These immortalized hepatocyte lines, which express most, if not all, liver-specific genes, should provide a useful means for further investigation of the effects of the albino lethal deletion."
