https://openalex.org/W2106414999,"Recent work has suggested that some proportion of excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells that express NMDA receptors (NMDARs) may not express functional AMPA receptors (AMPARs), thus making these synapses silent at the resting membrane potential. In agreement with this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that it is possible to stimulate synapses that yield no detectable excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) when the cell is held at -60 mV; yet at positive holding potentials (+30 to +60 mV), EPSCs can be elicited that are completely blocked by the NMDAR antagonist, D-APV. When these functionally silent synapses are subjected to an LTP induction protocol, EPSCs mediated by AMPARs appear and remain for the duration of the experiment. This conversion of silent synapses to functional synapses is blocked by D-APV. These results suggest that LTP may involve modification of AMPARs that, prior to LTP, were either not present in the postsynaptic membrane or electrophysiologically silent. This mechanism may account for several experimental results previously attributed to presynaptic changes in quantal content."

https://openalex.org/W2101699819,"Members of the CED-3/interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) protease family have been implicated in cell death in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In this report, we show that peptide inhibitors of ICE arrest the programmed cell death of motoneurons in vitro as a result of trophic factor deprivation and in vivo during the period of naturally occurring cell death. In addition, interdigital cells that die during development are also rescued in animals treated with ICE inhibitors. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that ICE or an ICE-like protease plays a regulatory role not only in vertebrate motoneuron death but also in the developmentally regulated deaths of other cells in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2042412331,"We report the cloning and characterization of a novel basophil CC chemokine receptor, K5-5, from the human immature basophilic cell line KU-812. The predicted protein sequence of K5-5 shows only 49% identity to the macrophage inflammatory protein-1α/RANTES receptor (CC CKR-1) and 47% identity to monocyte chemotactic protein-1 receptor (b form), suggesting that this cDNA encodes a novel member of the CC chemokine receptor family. Analysis of K5-5 mRNA expression indicates that it is restricted to leukocyte-rich tissues. In addition, we have shown significant levels of K5-5 mRNA in human basophils, which were up-regulated by treatment with interleukin-5. The CC chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were able to stimulate a Ca2+-activated chloride channel in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with K5-5 cRNA, whereas no signal was detected in response to monocyte chemotactic protein-2, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, or the CXC chemokine, interleukin-8. Taken together, these results indicate for the first time the presence of a CC chemokine receptor on basophils, which functions as a “shared” CC chemokine receptor and may therefore be implicated in the pathogenesis of basophil-mediated allergic diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1967533792,"Cell lineage analysis in the cortex has revealed two clonal patterns, clustered and widespread clones. To determine the relationship of these patterns, progenitor cells were infected with a retroviral library encoding alkaline phosphatase, and cortical sibling cells were identified using PCR. Clones labeled at E15 consisted of single cells or small cells clusters (52%) or of widespread cells (48%). However, widespread clones consisted of multiple neuronal or glial cell types, spaced systematically at 2-3 mm intervals. The data suggest that migratory multipotential progenitors divide asymmetrically at intervals defined by cell cycle length, producing single cells or clusters of cells in different cortical regions. Transition from multipotentiality to more restricted potential may correspond to changes in migratory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2012693939,"The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in the cerebellum was explored using a new, organic, membrane-impermeant form of caged NO. NO photolytically released inside Purkinje neurons mimicked parallel fiber (PF) activity in synergizing with brief postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTD. Such LTD required a delay of < 50 ms between the end of photolysis and the onset of depolarization, was prevented by intracellular Ca2+ chelation, and was mutually occlusive with LTD conventionally produced by PF activation plus depolarization. Bath application of NO synthase inhibitor or of myoglobin, a NO trap, prevent LTD induction via PF stimulation, but not that from intracellular uncaged NO, whereas intracellular myoglobin blocked both protocols. NO is therefore an anterograde transmitter in LTD induction. A biochemical requirement for simultaneous NO and elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ would explain why PF activity must coincide with postsynaptic action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2005746771,"To analyze cell lineage in the rhesus monkey necorotex, we used recombinant retroviruses to label individual progenitor cells in the ventricular zone (VZ), then determined histochemically the distribution of their progeny during and after the period of cortical neurogenesis. Distribution patterns of labeled cells in the VZ suggested the coexistence of asymmetrically and symmetrically dividing progenitor cells, indicating that both postmitotic and mitotic progeny are produced during cortical neurogenesis. In the cortex, several distinct patterns of clonal distribution were observed and interpreted as follows: clones aligned radially suggested that asymmetrically dividing progenitors generate sequential ""siblings"" that migrate, in tandem, along a common radial path to the cortex. In contrast, clones oriented horizontally within a single lamina suggested that symmetric divisions produce multiple, laterally displaced progenitors which, in turn, simultaneously generate ""cousin"" cells that migrate, in concert, to the same cortical layer. Thus, we propose that different mitotic lineages, which coexist in the monkey VZ, produce distinct radial or laminar patterns of clone deployment that foreshadow the cytological organization of the adult neocortex."

https://openalex.org/W2022924617,"CA2+-regulated protein kinases play critical roles in long-term potentiation (LTP). To understand the role of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) signaling pathways in synaptic transmission better, Ca2+/CaM was injected into hippocampal CA1 neurons. Ca2+/CaM induced significant potentiation of excitatory synaptic responses, which was blocked by coinjection of a CaM-binding peptide and was not induced by injections of Ca2+ or CaM alone. Reciprocal experiments demonstrated that Ca2+/CaM-induced synaptic potentiation and tetanus-induced LTP occluded one another. Pseudosubstrate inhibitors or high-affinity substrates of CaMKII or PKC blocked Ca2/CaM-induced potentiation, indicating the requirement of CaMKII and PKC activities in synaptic potentiation. We suggest that postsynaptic levels of free Ca2+/CaM is a rate limiting factor and that functional cross-talk between Ca2+/CaM and PKC pathways occurs during the induction of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1579501226,"Inhalation of allergens produced by the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) elicits IgE antibody formation and the development of asthma in genetically predisposed individuals. We compared the allergenic importance of two cockroach (CR) allergens, Bla g 1 and Bla g 2, and determined the complete amino acid sequence of the major 36-kDa allergen, Bla g 2. A survey of 106 sera from CR allergic patients showed the prevalence of IgE antibodies to Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 to be 30.2% and 57.6%, respectively. Immediate skin tests on 7 selected patients gave positive reactions using 10-3μg/ml either allergen, whereas controls showed no response to 10 μg/ml. Natural Bla g 2 was purified and the sequence of the NH2 terminus and tryptic peptides, comprising 36% of the molecule, was determined. The cDNA for Bla g 2 was cloned from a B. germanica expression library and encoded a 24-amino acid signal peptide and a 328-amino acid mature protein, which showed sequence homology to aspartic proteases. Bla g 2 showed the highest degree of identity to mosquito (Aedes aegypti) lysosomal aspartic protease (30.8%), with similar identity to pepsin, cathepsins D and E, renin, and chymosin. Bla g 2 mRNA and protein were detected in B. germanica, but not in Periplaneta americana, the other principal domiciliary CR species in the U. S. High concentrations of Bla g 2 were found in CR digestive organs (esophagus, gut, and proventriculus).

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to environmental allergens (e.g. pollens, dust mites, animal danders) occur in ~20% of Western populations and are a characteristic feature of common allergic illnesses, principally allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis.

This problem is particularly acute in the United States, where in some towns and cities up to 60% of patients with asthma are allergic to CR (15Bernton H.S. McMahon T.F. Brown H. Br. J. Dis.

Epidemiologic studies have shown that sensitization to CR allergens is an important risk factor for admission to hospital emergency rooms with asthma(21Call R.S. Smith T.F. Morris E.

S. are Blattella germanica (German CR) and Periplaneta americana (American CR). The molecular structure and biologic functions of allergens produced by either species are poorly understood. Moreover, in spite of the widespread use of CR in biology and in biomedical research, there is limited structural data on CR proteins. Previous serologic studies, using IgE Ab and murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb), have identified allergens from both B. germanica (Bla g 1 and Bla g 2), and P. americana (Per a 1 and Per a 3)(16Kang B.

We have used molecular cloning techniques to determine the primary structures of allergens from B. germanica (the most common cause of allergic sensitization in the U. S.). We recently described the structure of a cockroach calycin allergen, termed Bla g 4(29Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Benjamin D.C. Chapman M.D. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Here, we report the complete nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the major B. germanica allergen, Bla g 2, and show that this allergen shares homology with the aspartic protease family of enzymes. The allergen is concentrated in organs of the digestive tract, suggesting that it may function as a digestive enzyme. B. germanica frass (feces, secretions, egg cases, and body parts) was extracted in borate-buffered saline, pH 8.0 (BBS), overnight at 4°C. After centrifugation at 18,000rpm, the supernatant was dialyzed against BBS and ether-extracted. Bla g 1 was purified from frass extract by preparative isoelectric focusing and size exclusion HPLC(28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Google Scholar). Bla g 2 was purified by affinity chromatography over mAb 8F4 immunosorbent (28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin.

Alternatively, mAb affinity-purified Bla g 2 was further purified by electroelution from SDS-PAGE gels using a micro-electroelutor (Centrilutor, Amicon, Beverly, MA) according to the method of LeGendre and Matsudaira(30LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 49-69Google Scholar). Fifty μg of affinity-purified allergen were applied to 8 lanes of a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and the 36-kDa bands were excised, electroeluted for 2 h, and concentrated by centrifugation. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE using either an 8-25% silver-stained gel on a PhastSystem (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or a Coomassie Blue-stained 12% gel. Amino-terminal amino acid sequences of HPLC-purified allergens were determined by Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer (model 470-A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Seven tryptic peptides (7-22 residues) of electroeluted Bla g 2, comprising 84 amino acid residues, were sequenced. Affinity-purified Bla g 2 was also separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The NH2-terminal amino acid residues of the 36- and 70-kDa bands were sequenced off the membrane (14 and 10 residues, respectively). Total RNA was extracted from adult B. germanica or P. americana of mixed sexes, with 5 M guanidinium thiocyanate using the method of Chirgwin et al.(31Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was obtained using a FastTrack kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A B. germanica cDNA library was prepared from 10 μg of mRNA in the UniZAP-XR expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was screened using polyclonal mouse anti-Bla g 2 antiserum, with an IgG Ab titer >100,000 as determined by ELISA. Recombinant plaques were grown on NZY agar, and protein expression was induced using nitrocellulose filters soaked in 10 mM isopropyl-1-thio-βD-galactopyranoside. Filters were incubated in blocking solution (1% dried milk, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% goat serum, 0.03% gelatin), followed by a 1:5,000 dilution mouse anti-Bla g 2 antiserum, pre-absorbed with Escherichia coli lysate. Positive plaques were identified using 1:2,000 dilution alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-mouse IgG and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). A single positive plaque, containing a 1,317-base pair cDNA insert coding for Bla g 2, was isolated after screening 296,000 plaque-forming units of B. germanica cDNA library. Both strands of the Bla g 2 cDNA were sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.)(32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Protein or peptide sequences were compared with the National Biomedical Research Foundation, Swiss-Prot, and GenBank data bases using FASTA, and sequence alignments were carried out using the GCG program(33Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar). Sera were obtained from 93 CR allergic patients who either had been recruited from the University of Virginia Allergy Clinics or had previously presented to hospital emergency rooms with asthma(21Call R.S. Smith T.F. Morris E. Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Pediatrics. 1992; 121: 862-866Google Scholar, 22Gelber L.E. Seltzer L. Bouzoukis J.K. Pollart S.M. Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Am. Rev.

An additional 13 sera were collected from CR allergic patients living in New York or Puerto Rico. All patients had asthma, and the majority were adults (>16 years old). Eight patients were children (aged 4-10). All patients had serum IgE Ab to CR allergens detectable by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) (CR RAST > 40 units/ml; 1 unit = ~0.1 ng of IgE)(34Pollart S.M. Chapman M.D. Fiocco G.P. Rose G. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1989; 83: 875-882Google Scholar). Sera from 18 non-allergic individuals were used as controls. Quantitative intradermal skin tests were carried out using serial 10-fold dilutions of B. germanica extract (1/20, w/v; Allergy Laboratories of Ohio, Columbus, OH), or purified Bla g 1 or Bla g 2, from 10 to 10-6μg/ml, as described previously(28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Google Scholar). Skin testing, and collection of sera for use in these studies, was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the University of Virginia. Serum IgE Ab to Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 were measured using a mAb-based solid-phase RIA(28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of mAb 10A6 (anti-Bla g 1) or 8F4 (anti-Bla g 2) was coated onto plastic microtiter wells, followed by successive incubations with 0.5 μg of B. germanica frass extract and human sera, diluted 1:2 and 1:10. Bound IgE Ab were detected using 2 ng of 125I-labeled anti-human IgE. The assays were quantitated using sera from two CR allergic patients (B. S. and M. A.) with high levels of IgE Ab to Bla g 1 or Bla g 2, respectively, to construct control curves. Each serum was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1,000 units/ml of IgE Ab. Twenty μg of electroeluted Bla g 2 were radiolabeled with 1 mCi 125I using the chloramine T technique (specific activity 18.5 μCi/μg)(35Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 587-592Google Scholar). Serial doubling dilutions of Bla g 2, B. germanica frass extract, or B. germanica commercial extract (Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC) were used to inhibit the binding of 125I-Bla g 2 to mouse IgG anti-Bla g 2 Ab. Allergens were incubated for 2 h with 0.1 ml of a 1:4,000 dilution of mouse anti-Bla g 2 antiserum, followed by 3 ng of 125I-Bla g 2 for 2 h, and precipitated overnight at 4°C with 1:15 dilution goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, El Segundo, CA). Precipitates were washed with BBS and counted in a γ counter. Expression of Bla g 2 was compared in P. americana extracts. Whole body extract was prepared by homogenizing 133 g of CR with BBS in a blender, extracting at 1:5 (w/v) overnight at 4°C, and decanting the supernatant after centrifugation (6,000 rpm × 30 min). Frass extract was prepared as for B. germanica. Commercial P. americana extracts (n = 11) were obtained from 10 United States allergen manufacturers: Allergy Laboratories of Oklahoma (Oklahoma City, OK), Center Laboratories (Port Washington, NY), Greer Laboratories (Lenoir, NC), Miles Laboratories (Elkhart, IN), Antigen Labs (Liberty, MO), Nelco (Deer Park, NY), ALK/Berkeley (Milford, CO), Bencard (Bencard, MS), Meridian (Round Rock, TX), and Iatric (Tempe, AZ). For Northern blots, B. germanica and P. americana mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Samples containing 0.5-6 μg of mRNA were electrophoresed in formaldehyde denaturing 1% agarose gels, followed by transfer to a Zetabind nylon membrane (Cuno, Meridien, CT). A 1.3-kb SmaI/KpnI restriction fragment from a pBluescript phagemid DNA comprising the complete Bla g 2 cDNA, and an 8.6-kb BamHI fragment containing Neurospora crassa ribosomal DNA (pRW528) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming and used to probe the blots(36Russell P.J. Wagner S. Rodland K.D. Feinbaum R.L. Russel J.P. Bret-Harte M.S. Free S.J. Metzenberg R.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 275-282Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at 37°C, as described previously(6Arruda L.K. Mann B.J. Chapman M.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3354-3359Google Scholar). To prepare tissue extracts, CR were dissected and body parts identified according to the method of Bell(37Bell W.J. The Laboratory Cockroach. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1981Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer and extracted overnight in 0.5 ml of BBS at 4°C. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, extracts were stored at −20°C until assayed. Bla g 2 levels in CR tissues were measured by mAb ELISA(38Pollart S.M. Smith T.F. Morris E. Gelber L.E. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 505-510Google Scholar). Sera from 106 CR allergic patients with asthma living in different geographic areas in the United States were analyzed for IgE Ab to Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 by mAb-based RIA. The results showed that 30.2% and 57.6% of these patients had detectable IgE Ab to Bla g 1 or Bla g 2, respectively. The prevalence of IgE Ab to Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 was higher among patients with IgE Ab to CR of >200 RAST units/ml (40% and 70%, respectively, n = 58), as compared to the group with <200 RAST units/ml (19% and 42%, respectively, n = 48) (Fig. 1). The biologic activity of purified Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 was assessed by quantitative intradermal skin testing of seven selected CR allergic patients. These patients gave positive immediate skin reactions (>8 × 8-mm wheal) to allergen concentrations down to 10-3.5μg/ml, whereas non-allergic controls showed no reaction to concentrations up to 10 μg/ml (and had no detectable serum IgE Ab) (Table 1). Skin test reactivity correlated with serum IgE Ab to Bla g 1 and Bla g 2, and distinct patterns of reactivity to the allergens were observed. Some patients had positive skin tests and IgE Ab to both Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 (S. W. and M. B), whereas others were exclusively sensitive to either allergen (compare B. S. and R. M.; Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We focused on sequencing Bla g 2, because of its allergenic importance and because this protein has been used extensively as a marker of environmental CR allergen exposure(21Call R.S. Smith T.F. Morris E. Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Pediatrics. 1992; 121: 862-866Google Scholar, 22Gelber L.E. Seltzer L. Bouzoukis J.K. Pollart S.M. Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 573-578Google Scholar, 38Pollart S.M. Smith T.F. Morris E. Gelber L.E. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 505-510Google Scholar). The Bla g 2 sequence was determined using a combination of protein sequencing and cDNA cloning. Previous studies showed that single-step mAb affinity chromatography yielded 36-kDa Bla g 2, as well as additional bands of 20 and 70 kDa, which co-purified with the allergen(28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Google Scholar). For amino acid sequencing, Bla g 2 was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC or electroelution from SDS-PAGE gels. Three protein peaks were obtained on reverse phase HPLC, which separated Bla g 2 from the 20-kDa contaminant (Fig. 2, panelA). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of Bla g 2 (35 residues) was determined from HPLC peak 2. This sequence was subsequently confirmed by sequencing Bla g 2 (14 residues) that had been electroeluted onto PVDF membrane (Fig. 2B and 3). The NH2-terminal sequence of the 20-kDa protein did not share significant homology to Bla g 2 or other proteins, suggesting that it was not a breakdown product of Bla g 2 (data not shown). Tryptic peptides were prepared from electroeluted Bla g 2, and internal peptide sequences (comprising 84 residues) were obtained, which, together with the NH2-terminal sequence, comprised 36.3% of the entire molecule. In addition, the first 10 residues of the 70-kDa protein sequenced off PVDF membrane were identical to the NH2-terminal sequence of Bla g 2, suggesting that the 70-kDa band was a dimer of Bla g 2. Although ~60% of CR allergic patients had IgE Ab to Bla g 2, attempts to screen the B. germanica cDNA library with pooled IgE Ab, to identify a Bla g 2 cDNA clone, were unsuccessful. The cDNA coding for Bla g 2 was identified using mouse polyclonal IgG anti-Bla g 2 Ab. The full-length cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1,056 nucleotides, encoding a 24-amino acid putative signal peptide and a 328-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 35,939 Da (Fig. 3). Inspection of the nucleotide sequence identified a polyadenylation signal 22 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail and three potential N-linked glycosylation sites. However, the close agreement between the molecular mass obtained by sequencing and by SDS-PAGE analysis suggests that the allergen is not glycosylated. The deduced amino acid sequence of Bla g 2 showed 91% identity to the amino acid sequences determined by Edman degradation from Bla g 2 protein (Fig. 3). Sequence similarity searches showed significant homology between Bla g 2 and aspartic proteases from several species(39Cho W.-L. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21823-21829Google Scholar, 40Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Chirgwin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4910-4914Google Scholar, 41Imai T. Miyazaki H. Hirose S. Hori H. Hayashi T. Kageyama R. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Murakami K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7405-7409Google Scholar, 42Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mizukami Y. Ichihara Y. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5306-5311Google Scholar, 43Foltmann B. Pedersen V.B. Kauffman D. Wybrandt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8447-8456Google Scholar). The highest degree of identity was between Bla g 2 and mosquito (A. aegypti) lysosomal aspartic protease (30.8%); however, identity was observed with other aspartic proteases including human cathepsin D (27%), human pepsinogen (26.7%), human renin (25.8%), and bovine chymosin (29.5%) (Fig. 4A). The two aspartic acid residues involved in the catalytic activity of aspartic proteases (at positions 31 and 215 in Bla g 2), as well as surrounding amino acid residues, are conserved in Bla g 2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Alignments of these sequences revealed that Bla g 2 is likely to be synthesized as a pro-enzyme, but the pro-peptide sequence is much shorter than in other aspartic proteases (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether Bla g 2 was also expressed by P. americana, we compared antigenic cross-reactivity and expression of Bla g 2 mRNA in the two CR species. Binding of 125I-Bla g 2 to polyclonal mouse IgG anti-Bla g 2 was inhibited >90% by Bla g 2 and by B. germanica extracts in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, P. americana extracts, including frass and whole body extracts prepared in our laboratory and 11 commercial extracts marketed for allergy diagnosis, gave <5% inhibition (Fig. 5). It was possible that the murine IgG antibodies were directed against “species-specific” epitopes on Bla g 2 and did not recognize the allergen in P. americana extracts. To investigate this possibility, mRNA expression was compared by Northern analysis. A 1.8-kb mRNA encoding Bla g 2 was detected by hybridization to a 32P-labeled Bla g 2 cDNA probe. This message was detected using 0.5-2 μg of B. germanica mRNA, whereas no Bla g 2 message was detected using up to 6 μg of mRNA from P. americana (Fig. 6). These results strongly suggest that P. americana does not express a protein that is closely homologous to Bla g 2. The tissue distribution of Bla g 2 was assessed by comparing the ratios of Bla g 2 to total protein in dissected B. germanica tissues and body parts. Although Bla g 2 was present in all tissues, the highest concentrations relative to protein content were detected in organs of the digestive system, principally esophagus, proventriculus, and gut (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We report the complete nucleotide sequence of cDNA coding for a major cockroach allergen, Bla g 2. The allergenic importance of Bla g 2 had been suggested by previous studies showing IgE binding to a 36-kDa B. germanica allergen on immunoblotting(24Helm R.M. Bandele E.O. Swanson M.C. Campbell A.R. Wynn S.R. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1988; 87: 230-238Google Scholar). In the present study, an extensive survey of sera from several localities in the United States confirmed a high prevalence of IgE Ab to Bla g 2 among CR allergic patients (~60%). The results also showed that the allergen exhibited classical immediate hypersensitivity responses on skin testing, and that these responses were specific. Although the prevalence of IgE Ab to Bla g 1 (~30%) was significantly lower than to Bla g 2, some patients showed comparable skin test reactivity to the two allergens, or to Bla g 1 in the absence of responses to Bla g 2, suggesting that Bla g 1 can be an important allergen for some individuals. Sequence analysis revealed that Bla g 2 shares homology to the aspartic proteases: a widespread group of enzymes that have two essential aspartic acid residues at their catalytic site(44Szecsi P.B. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1992; 52: 5-22Google Scholar). Most aspartic proteases are single-chain enzymes with a molecular mass of ~35,000 Da and are active at low pH. The group includes both intracellular enzymes such as cathepsin D (40Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Chirgwin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4910-4914Google Scholar) and cathepsin E(45Azuma T. Pals G. Mohandas T.K. Couvreur J.M. Taggart R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16748-16753Google Scholar), and extracellular digestive enzymes, such as pepsin (42Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mizukami Y. Ichihara Y. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5306-5311Google Scholar) and chymosin(43Foltmann B. Pedersen V.B. Kauffman D. Wybrandt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8447-8456Google Scholar), and human renin(41Imai T. Miyazaki H. Hirose S. Hori H. Hayashi T. Kageyama R. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Murakami K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7405-7409Google Scholar). Assignment of Bla g 2 to the aspartic proteases was based on sequence homology and presence of the aspartic acid and adjacent amino acid residues in conserved positions. Several aspartic proteases are secreted as pro-enzymes and undergo self-activation upon exposure to acidic pH. Upon activation, an NH2-terminal pro-peptide of up to 50 amino acids long is released. Sequence alignment showed homology between the NH2-terminal sequence of Bla g 2 and the pro-peptide sequences, particularly bovine chymosin, and suggested that Bla g 2 may be produced as a zymogen with a short pro-peptide. Pro-peptide sequences as short as 6 amino acid residues occur in albumin and trypsin(46Geisow M.J. Smyth D.G. Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. The Enzymology of Post-translational Modification of Proteins. Academic Press Inc., New York1980: 259-287Google Scholar). In keeping with these observations, purification of natural Bla g 2 has always been performed at high or neutral pH(28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Google Scholar). Further studies are being carried out to determine the effects of low pH treatment on the stability of Bla g 2 and on release of the pro-peptide. The homology of Bla g 2 to aspartic proteases raised the possibility that this allergen functions as a digestive enzyme in CR. Unlike the A. aegypti aspartic protease, which is located in lysosomes and concentrated in the insect fat body, Bla g 2 is concentrated in the digestive organs, particularly the gut, with much lower levels in the fat body. Our experiments are consistent with previous immunofluoresence studies using IgE Ab, which showed localization of CR allergens to epithelial cells in the intestinal tract and to Malpighian vessels (the major excretory organs in the CR)(47Zwick H. Popp W. Sertl K. Rauscher H. Wanke T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 626-630Google Scholar). Previous RAST inhibition studies showed that CR feces are a potent source of allergens(48Lehrer S.B. Horner E. Menon P. Stankus R.P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 574-580Google Scholar). Thus we speculate that Bla g 2 is a digestive enzyme that is secreted or excreted along with CR feces. B. germanica and P. americana are the most prevalent domiciliary CR species found in the United States. Although CR allergic patients usually give positive skin prick tests to extracts of both species, the molecular basis of the antigenic relationships between them is poorly understood. Northern analyses have consistently shown that mRNA encoding Bla g 2 is not detectable in P. americana. In agreement with this, Bla g 2 protein could not be measured in any extracts of P. americana using mAb ELISA or inhibition RIA using polyclonal Ab. These results suggested that the previously reported immunologic cross-reactivity between the two CR species must be related to allergens other than Bla g 2(17Twarog F.J. Picone F.J. Strunk R.S. So J. Colten H.R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1977; 59: 154-160Google Scholar, 26Stankus R.P. Horner W.E. Lehrer S.B. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1990; 86: 781-786Google Scholar). These include Bla g 1 and Per a 1, which have been purified from both species and show antigenic cross-reactivity(27Schou C. Lind P. Fernandez-Caldas E. Lockey R.F. Lowenstein H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1990; 86: 935-946Google Scholar, 28Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Google Scholar). Phylogenetically, B. germanica and P. americana belong to distantly related families, the Blattellidae and Blattidae, respectively(49McKittrick F.A. Evolutionary Studies of Cockroaches. Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, New York State College of Agriculture, Ithaca, NY1964Google Scholar). In keeping with this, another B. germanica allergen, Bla g 4, recently cloned in our laboratory, was only expressed in B. germanica(29Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Benjamin D.C. Chapman M.D. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Conversely, a 72-kDa P. americana allergen (Per a 3) has been isolated, and mAb to this allergen failed to bind to B. germanica or B. orientalis extracts on immunoblotting or ELISA(50Wu C.-H. Chiang B.T. Fann M.C. Lan J.L. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1990; 20: 675-681Google Scholar). Thus of the cloned or purified CR allergens that have been defined to date, most (three-fourths) appear to be species-specific. In the case of Bla g 2, this is unusual, since it might be expected that both B. germanica and P. americana would produce an aspartic protease. However, we have been unable to detect Bla g 2 mRNA in P.americana, and attempts to amplify Bla g 2 from P. americana genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction have been unsuccessful (data not shown). While these negative experiments strongly suggest that P. americana does not produce a Bla g 2 homologue, there is a possibility that the degree of homology with a putative P. americana aspartic protease is too low to be detected by the probes used in our hybridization studies. However, we believe this possibility is unlikely. The Bla g 2 cDNA is being subcloned into expression vectors to produce recombinant allergen, which will provide pure protein for diagnostic purposes; for structural and immunologic studies and, potentially, for allergen immunotherapy. The sequence information reported here is essential for identifying B cell and T cell epitopes on Bla g 2 and offers the prospect of developing T cell-based vaccines for CR allergy. Preliminary studies indicate that Bla g 2 causes T cell proliferation in CR allergic patients with asthma. Thus T cell peptides from Bla g 2 could be used to develop new forms of immunotherapy, similar to those that are currently undergoing clinical trials for cat and ragweed allergy(13Norman P.S. Ohman J.L. Long A.A. Creticos P.S. Gefter M.L. Shaked Z. Wood R.A. Eggleston P.A. Lichtenstein L.M. Jones N.H. Nicodemus C.F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95 (abstr.): 259Google Scholar). Cloning of other CR allergens has recently been reported, and, based on the prevalence of IgE reactivity with these allergens (30-70%), it seems likely the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic reagents will need to include several of the most important allergens from either species(29Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Benjamin D.C. Chapman M.D. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 51Wu C.-H. Lee M.-F. Liao S.-C. J. Allergy Clin.

Further immunologic and molecular studies of Bla g 2 and other CR allergens will lead to a better understanding of CR-induced IgE responses and their role in asthma.

To determine whether the damaged nucleotide, 2-hydroxydeoxyadenosine triphosphate (2-OH-dATP), is incorporated into a growing DNA, and to reveal the kinds of nucleotides opposite which 2-OH-dATP is incorporated, calf thymus DNA polymerase α and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were used in in vitro DNA synthesis in the presence of 2-OH-dATP. DNA polymerase α incorporated the nucleotide opposite T and C in the DNA template. On the other hand, in an experiment using the Klenow fragment, incorporation of 2-OH-dATP was observed only opposite T. Steady-state kinetic studies indicated that incorporation of 2-OH-dATP by DNA polymerase α opposite T was favored over that opposite C by a factor of only 4.5.

Oxygen radicals produced in cells damage DNA and nucleotides, and these processes are probably involved in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis.

Together with the fact that DNA polymerases incorporate 8-OH-dGTP as a substrate(7Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Google Scholar, 9Maki H.

A question that has arisen is whether other modified nucleotides that are produced by oxygen radicals are incorporated by DNA polymerases, and whether the incorporated nucleotides induce mutations. We report here that when dA, dATP, and DNA were treated with oxygen radicals (Fe2+-EDTA)(10Nofre C. Ceer A. Lefier A. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1961; 5: 530-536Google Scholar), hydroxylation at the C-2 position of adenine occurred to form 2-OH-Ade (2-hydroxyadenine, 1,2-dihydro-2-oxoadenine, or isoguanine) and that the hydroxylation in dATP and dA occurred more frequently than that in DNA. Although Switzer et al.(11Switzer C.Y. Moroney S.E. Benner S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8322-8323Google Scholar, 12Switzer C.Y. Moroney S.E. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10489-10496Google Scholar) observed that the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (KF) and other DNA polymerases incorporate 2-OH-dATP (“d-iso-GTP” in their reports) opposite T in a template DNA, they studied 2-OH-Ade as a component of additional base pairs in nucleic acids, and not as oxidative damage. They did not investigate the possibility of the incorporation opposite A and G (C was used as a control). Moreover, they did not use mammalian enzymes, which are important for studies of carcinogenesis. We describe the results of in vitro DNA synthesis reactions with mammalian DNA polymerase α (pol α) and KF in the presence of 2-OH-dATP. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Toyobo Co. Calf thymus pol α was obtained from Molecular Biology Resources Inc. The Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I was from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf thymus DNA, dA, dG, dATP, and dGTP, which were used in the Fe2+-EDTA treatment, were from Sigma. The FPLC-grade deoxynucleoside triphosphates used in the DNA polymerase reactions were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. 2-OH-dA was prepared from 2,6-diaminopurine-9-deoxyriboside (Sigma) according to the method of Davoll(13Davoll J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 3174-3176Google Scholar). Single- and double-stranded DNA, dA, dG, dATP, or dGTP (1 mg) was treated with Fe2+-EDTA (5 mM FeSO4, 5 mM EDTA) in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 1.0 ml at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were then analyzed directly (for monomers) or after enzymatic digestion (for DNA) by reverse-phase HPLC. Separation of 2-OH-dA was done using two Ultrasphere ODS 5 μ columns (4.6 × 250 mm, Beckman) connected in series, with an isocratic system consisting of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). A single Ultrasphere ODS 5-μm column (4.6 × 250 mm) was used for 8-OH-dG, with an isocratic system consisting of 10 mM NaH2PO4 and 8.0% methanol. 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP were separated by HPLC using a YMC-pack ODS-AM-303 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm), with an isocratic system consisting of 12.5 mM citric acid, 25 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM acetic acid, and 30 mM sodium hydroxide. Detection was performed with a Hewlett Packard 1040M HPLC Detection System. dATP (5 mg), dissolved in 1 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), was treated with 25 mM Fe2+-EDTA in an open 10-ml test tube by shaking at 37°C for 120 min. The reaction mixture was directly injected into the HPLC column, and 2-OH-dATP was purified by reverse-phase HPLC, as described above. Primers (10 pmol) were labeled at the 5′-ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units) in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP (0.74 MBq, DuPont NEN) in a buffer solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in a total volume of 10 μl. After incubation at 37°C for 60 min, the unincorporated ATP was removed with NENSORB™ 20 (Du Pont NEN). Reactions catalyzed by KF were carried out in a buffer solution containing oligonucleotide templates annealed with primers (0.05 μM), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, various amounts of dNTP(s), and enzyme in a total volume of 10 μl at 20°C. Experiments with pol α were conducted at 25°C in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing oligonucleotide templates annealed with primers (0.05 μM), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 3.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml), and various amounts of dNTP(s) and enzyme. Reactions were stopped by the addition of termination solution (95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). Samples were heated at 95°C for 3 min and were then applied to a 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiograms were obtained with a Fujix BAS 2000 bioimage analyzer. Experiments with KF were done under the conditions described above using 0.05-50 μM dNTP and 0.002 units (one unit incorporates 10 nmol of deoxyribonucleotides into acid-precipitable material in 30 min at 37°C) of the enzyme at 20°C for 1-6 min. Reactions with pol α were measured under the conditions described above, using 0.05-200 μM dNTP and 0.14-0.7 units (one unit incorporates 1 nmol of deoxyribonucleotides in 1 h at 37°C) of the enzyme at 25°C for 3-30 min. The Michaelis constant (Km) and the maximum velocity of the reaction (Vmax) were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots of the kinetic data(14Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1977: 91-92Google Scholar). Insertion frequencies (Fins) were determined relative to A•T or C•G according to the equations developed by Mendelman et al.(15Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Google Scholar). F = (Vmax/Km of wrong pair)/(Vmax/Km of right pair), with the “wrong pair” defined as any base pair with 2-OH-Ade. All reaction rates were linear during the course of the reaction, in which less than 20% of the primer was extended(16Dosanjh M.K. Galeros G. Goodman M.F. Singer B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11595-11599Google Scholar). When dATP and dA were treated with Fe2+-EDTA, formation of modified monomers, which were separated from starting materials by HPLC, was observed. Fig. 1shows the HPLC elution profile when the reaction mixture of dATP was injected. The peak, indicated as 2-OH-dATP by the arrow (retention time, 5.5 min), showed the UV spectrum characteristic of 2-OH-dA or 2-OH-Ade derivatives (17Sepiol J. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Z. Naturforsch. 1976; 31C: 361-370Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, inset). The modified monomer obtained by Fe2+-EDTA treatment of dA also showed similar UV spectrum (data not shown), suggesting that 2-OH-dA was formed. The structure of the modified dA was confirmed to be 2-OH-dA by comparing its chromatographic behavior with that of the synthetic sample(13Davoll J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 3174-3176Google Scholar). Although we have no standard of 2-OH-dATP, the dephosphorylated product of the 5.5-min peak, which was obtained by Fe2+-EDTA treatment of dATP, was eluted at the same retention time as the synthetic 2-OH-dA (data not shown). Therefore, it was concluded that 2-OH-dA and 2-OH-dATP were produced by Fe2+-EDTA treatment of dA and dATP, respectively. The yields of 2-OH-dA and 2-OH-dATP were 800/105 dA and 650/105 dA, respectively, and were 3.6- and 5.7-fold less than those of 8-OH-dG and 8-OH-dGTP (Table 1). On the other hand, the formation of 2-OH-Ade was less efficient, about 40-fold less than that of 8-OH-Gua, when double- and single-stranded DNA were treated (9.7 and 17.7/105 dA, Table 1). Therefore, 2-OH-Ade appears to be produced more efficiently in monomers than in polynucleotides.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed the incorporation of 2-OH-dAMP during in vitro DNA synthesis in the presence of 2-OH-dATP. Template 1 (15-mer) annealed with a 33P-labeled primer 1 (10-mer) was used in the reactions (Table 2). The primer was elongated to an 11-mer when either dAMP or 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated by a DNA polymerase opposite the T residue in the template. Subsequent incorporations of dGMP and of dGMP and dCMP generated the 12-mer and the 13-mer, respectively. The incorporation of dGMP, dCMP, and dTMP after the insertion of dAMP or 2-OH-dAMP generated a 14-mer and/or 15-mer. When a nucleotide was inserted incorrectly, an extra band was observed in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 2shows the PAGE analysis of the primer extensions catalyzed by KF. In control experiments in which dATP was used, the primer was extended by one nucleotide by the addition of dATP (Fig. 2A, lane2). The primer was further extended, corresponding to the nucleotides added (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-5). A similar pattern was observed in the presence of 2-OH-dATP, and no extra elongations were detected (Fig. 2A, lanes6-9). These results indicate that KF incorporated 2-OH-dAMP only opposite T. This conclusion was confirmed by the polymerase reactions in the presence of the three dNTPs and 2-OH-dATP. Namely, the primed template was treated with KF in the presence of three of the four dNTPs. The full-length product was produced when the added 2-OH-dATP was used by the DNA polymerase instead of the missing dNTP. The fully elongated product was observed only when 2-OH-dATP was added to the reaction lacking A (Fig. 2B, lanes2 and 3). Again, it was concluded that KF incorporated 2-OH-dAMP only opposite T. Moreover, these results indicate that the incorporated 2-OH-dAMP did not terminate the reaction and was further elongated (in this case, KF incorporated dGMP next to the inserted 2-OH-dAMP). We obtained the same conclusion when another template (template 2, Table 2) was used (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In experiments using primed template 1 and 2-OH-dATP, the primer was elongated by pol α to an 11-mer by the addition of the modified nucleotide (Fig. 3A, lane2). Furthermore, a small amount of 12-mer was detected in the presence of a single 2-OH-dATP (Fig. 3A, lane2). This indicated that 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated opposite C in the template, in addition to T. No extra bands were observed in the other lanes (Fig. 3A, lanes3 and 4), indicating that 2-OH-dATP was not inserted opposite G and A in the template. Similar results were obtained when template 2 was used in the reactions. In this case, the base at position 11 in the template is C, and T is located at position 13 (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 3B, 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated opposite C (lane2). The extra 13-mer in the reaction containing 2-OH-dATP and dCTP was possibly produced by the insertion of 2-OH-dAMP opposite T (Fig. 3B, lane3). These results indicate that pol α inserted 2-OH-dAMP opposite C in addition to T. We recently found that DNA polymerases (DNA polymerases α and β and KF) misincorporated dAMP opposite 2-OH-Ade in a template DNA(18Kamiya H. Ueda T. Ohgi T. Matsukage A. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 761-766Google Scholar). However, we did not detect the incorporation of 2-OH-dATP opposite A in template DNAs, as shown in Fig. 2and Fig. 3. Since the nucleotide sequence used in the previous study (5′-dGCTA∗ATATTCCGTCAT-3′, where A∗ represents 2-OH-Ade) was different from those used in this study, we tested whether 2-OH-dATP was inserted opposite A in a template with the same flanking sequences as used in the previous study (Table 2, template 3). However, pol α did not insert 2-OH-dATP opposite A, whereas the enzyme incorporated the nucleotide opposite T and C (data not shown). The modified nucleotide was incorporated opposite T and C, but not opposite A, even in the sequence where dAMP is inserted opposite 2-OH-Ade. We measured the kinetic parameters during in vitro DNA synthesis. The incorporation of 2-OH-dATP opposite T and C, using templates 1 and 2, respectively, was studied. Table 3shows the parameters of the reactions. In reactions catalyzed by KF, the Kmvalue of 2-OH-dATP was 96 times higher than that of dATP. The Vmax value of 2-OH-dATP was 8 times lower than that of dATP. The relative Vmax/Km (the Fins) of 2-OH-dATP was 1.3 × 10-3, which means that the insertion of 2-OH-dAMP opposite T was disfavored by a factor of 745 over that of dAMP. With pol α, the Km value of 2-OH-dATP was 445 times higher than that of dATP. On the other hand, the Vmax value of 2-OH-dATP was higher than that of dATP. The relative Vmax/Km (the Fins) of 2-OH-dATP was 3.4 × 10-3, which means that the insertion of 2-OH-dAMP opposite T was disfavored by a factor of 288 over that of dAMP. In reactions containing pol α and template 2, the Km value of 2-OH-dATP was 88 times higher than that of dGTP. The Vmax value of 2-OH-dATP was 14 times lower than that of dGTP. The Fins of 2-OH-dATP was 7.5 × 10-4, which means that the insertion of 2-OH-dAMP opposite C was disfavored by a factor of 1232 over that of dGMP. Thus, the incorporation of 2-OH-dAMP opposite T was favored only 4.5 times over that opposite C. These results suggest that the formation of 2-OH-dATP will be mutagenic because it is incorporated incorrectly by pol α.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In this study we found that 2-OH-dATP is efficient produced from dATP by treatment with oxygen radicals and that it is incorporated into DNA incorrectly. It is interesting to compare the efficiency of incorporation of 2-OH-dATP into DNA with that of 8-OH-dGTP. The relative Vmax/Km values of 8-OH-dGTP opposite C and A are 4.4 × 10-4 and 7.2 × 10-4, respectively, with exonuclease-free KF(19Purmal A.A. Kow Y.K. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3930-3935Google Scholar). The obtained relative Vmax/Kmvalues (the Fins) of 2-OH-dATP opposite T and C (Table 3) were comparable to those of 8-OH-dGTP reported with exonuclease-free KF(19Purmal A.A. Kow Y.K. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3930-3935Google Scholar). Therefore, 2-OH-dATP appears to be incorporated as effectively as 8-OH-dGTP by DNA polymerases. In aqueous solution, the major tautomers of the 9-methyl and ribosyl derivatives of 2-OH-Ade are in the N(1)H, 2-keto form(17Sepiol J. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Z. Naturforsch. 1976; 31C: 361-370Google Scholar). The keto and enol forms are calculated to be about 90% and about 10%, respectively, of the total in water(17Sepiol J. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Z. Naturforsch. 1976; 31C: 361-370Google Scholar). The postulated base pairs of 2-OH-Ade with T and C are shown in Fig. 4(A and B). With T, the enol tautomer of 2-OH-Ade can form a pair in a Watson-Crick manner, although the keto tautomer can also pair in a wobble alignment. In this putative Watson-Crick pair, the two bases form three hydrogen bonds as G•C. With C, both tautomers of 2-OH-Ade can form wobble pairs. The kinetic data obtained in this study indicated that the Vmax value of T•2-OH-Ade with pol α was larger than that of T•A, although the Km value of T•2-OH-Ade was larger (Table 3). This fact may be explained by the small ratio of the enol tautomer in the solution used in this study, and by rapid phosphodiester bond formation due to the more stable hydrogen bonding of T•2-OH-Ade (enol) than T•A. We recently found that KF and pol α inserted dAMP as well as dTMP opposite 2-OH-Ade in in vitro DNA synthesis(18Kamiya H. Ueda T. Ohgi T. Matsukage A. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 761-766Google Scholar). On the other hand, the two DNA polymerases did not insert 2-OH-dATP opposite A in template DNAs, and pol α incorporated 2-OH-dATP opposite C (Figs. 2 and 3). This discrepancy may depend on the different sequence contexts used in both studies (see “Results”). However, we did not observe the incorporation of 2-OH-dATP opposite A and G in the template that has the same flanking sequences near the target position (Table 2). The reasons for the different tendencies remain to be resolved. One possibility is that 2-OH-Ade can form a base pair with A when the modified base is in the enol form (Fig. 4C). Sepiol et al. reported that the equilibrium between the keto and enol forms of 2-OH-Ade shifts in the direction of the enol form with a decrease in the solvent polarity(17Sepiol J. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Z. Naturforsch. 1976; 31C: 361-370Google Scholar). It is known that a base moiety in DNA is surrounded by neighboring bases that are stabilized by stacking, and is in a more hydrophobic environment than the monomer. Therefore, the structure of 2-OH-Ade in DNA may shift more to the 2-enol form than in the monomer. Furthermore, the DNA molecule is surrounded by a DNA polymerase when DNA synthesis occurs. The polarity of the active site of a DNA polymerase may be less polar than water. Thus, the structure of 2-OH-Ade in a template DNA to which a DNA polymerase binds may significantly shift to the enol form, as suggested by Switzer et al.(11Switzer C.Y. Moroney S.E. Benner S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8322-8323Google Scholar), and may pair with A (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, the ratio of the enol form in 2-OH-dATP is probably similar to that in the 9-methyl and ribosyl derivatives of 2-OH-Ade. If the equilibrium shifts from the keto to the enol form slowly, then 2-OH-dATP exists almost in the keto form, even near the active site of a DNA polymerase, and could dissociate from the position opposite A in a template. In contrast, the facts that 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated opposite C (Fig. 3), and that dCTP was not inserted opposite 2-OH-Ade in the template(18Kamiya H. Ueda T. Ohgi T. Matsukage A. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 761-766Google Scholar), may be explained if C pairs with the keto form of 2-OH-Ade (Fig. 4B). In the case of 8-OH-dGTP, the MutT protein and its homologues prevent the mutagenic nucleotide from being incorporated into DNA, by hydrolyzing 8-OH-dGTP to 8-OH-dGMP(9Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Google Scholar, 20Mo J.-Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11021-11025Google Scholar). A MutT-like activity that destroys 2-OH-dATP may be present in bacterial and mammalian cells. In this report, we have shown that 2-OH-Ade is formed by oxygen radicals, and that KF and a replicative polymerase, pol α, incorporated 2-OH-dATP. The latter enzyme inserted the nucleotide opposite C, in addition to T, in template DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2070307293,"The formation of brain circuits requires molecular recognition between functionally related neurons. We report the cloning of a molecule that participates in these interactions. The limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member with 3 Ig domains and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. In the developing forebrain, lamp is expressed mostly by neurons comprising limbic-associated cortical and subcortical regions that function in cognition, emotion, memory, and learning. The unique distribution of LAMP reflects its functional specificity. LAMP-transfected cells selectively facilitate neurite outgrowth of primary limbic neurons. Most striking, administration of anti-LAMP in vivo results in abnormal growth of the mossy fiber projection from developing granule neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, suggesting that LAMP is essential for proper targeting of this pathway. Rather than being a general guidance cue, LAMP likely serves as a recognition molecule for the formation of limbic connections."

In contrast, these receptors retained the ability to mediate NGF-promoted survival and TIS8 and TIS11 immediate-early gene induction. The mutated receptor also mediated unimpaired autophosphorylation; SHC, PLC-gamma 1, and ERK tyrosine phosphorylation; and PI-3 kinase and ERK activation. However, SNT protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which wild-type receptors mediate via a ras-independent pathway, was undetectable. These findings indicate that the KFG sequence is indispensable for activating a ras-independent NGF signaling pathway involved in promoting neuronal differentiation and highlight potential roles of non-tyrosine-containing receptor domains in growth factor signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1565691495,"Polyhistidine-tagged horseradish peroxidase (hHRP) and its F41A, H42A, and H42V mutants have been expressed in an insect cell system. Kinetic studies show that the rates of Compound I formation and peroxidative catalysis are greatly decreased by the His-42 mutation. Furthermore, Compound II is not detected during turnover of the His-42 mutants. Compounds I and II are the two- and one-electron oxidized intermediates, respectively, of hHRP. In peroxygenative catalysis, the F41A and H42A mutants catalyze thioanisole sulfoxidation 100 and 10 times faster, respectively, than hHRP. Styrene epoxidation is catalyzed by both the Phe-41 and His-42 mutants but not by wild-type hHRP. The higher peroxygenase activity of the mutants reflects increased accessibility of the ferryl species. This is indicated by the finding that, contrary to the reaction with wild-type hHRP, reaction of phenyldiazene with the F41A mutant yields a new and unidentified product, and the same reaction with the His-42 mutants yields phenyl-iron complexes. Phe-41 and His-42 thus shield the iron-centered catalytic species, and His-42 plays a key catalytic role in the formation of Compound I.

Biol. 1994; 235: 331-344Google Scholar) indicate that the catalytic machinery required to activate H2O2 is highly conserved. The key catalytic residues are a histidine and an adjacent arginine in the distal heme site. The histidine is thought to facilitate formation of the initial iron-peroxide complex by deprotonating the peroxide and subsequently to promote cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond by protonating the distal oxygen (Fig. 1)(12Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Google Scholar). The arginine is proposed to facilitate oxygen-oxygen bond scission by electrostatic stabilization of dioxygen bond cleavage(12Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Google Scholar). Experimental support for these catalytic roles comes from site-specific mutagenesis of cytochrome c peroxidase, which demonstrates that replacement of the catalytic histidine (His-52) or arginine (Arg-48) by a leucine decreases the rate of formation of Compound I by a factor of 105(13Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9798-9806Google Scholar) or 102(14Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Google Scholar), respectively. Initial data on the corresponding HRP site-specific mutant suggest that the distal arginine (Arg-38) is also important for catalysis(15Sanders S.A. Bray R.C. Thorneley R.N.F. Burke J.F. Smith A.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23 (in press)Google Scholar), but the function of the distal histidine in HRP has not yet been directly tested. In addition to the catalytic histidine and arginine, a phenylalanine or tryptophan is found adjacent to the histidine in the active sites of the four peroxidases for which crystal structures are available. Sequence alignments suggest that an aromatic residue is adjacent to the catalytic histidine in all plant and fungal peroxidases (Fig. 2)(5Welinder K.G. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 32: 89-107Google Scholar, 21Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar, 22Ator M. David S.K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14954-14960Google Scholar). We have furthermore advanced the hypothesis that sequestration of the ferryl species is responsible, at least in part, for the fact that peroxidases catalyze electron abstraction (peroxidase) rather than ferryl oxygen transfer (peroxygenase) reactions(2Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 32: 89-107Google Scholar, 23Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Accts. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 289-294Google Scholar). The evidence marshaled in support of this argument includes the finding that reaction of HRP with phenylhydrazine (PhNHNH2), via its oxidation product phenyldiazene (PhN=NH), results in either addition of the phenyl moiety to the δ-meso-carbon of the heme group or abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the 8-methyl group to give, eventually, the 8-hydroxymethyl heme derivative(21Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar). Similar reactions have been observed with other peroxidases(24DePillis G.D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7947-7952Google Scholar, 25DePillis G.D. Gold M.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 217-223Google Scholar). In contrast, the reaction of phenyldiazene with hemoproteins in which the iron is known to be within an open active site produce σ-bonded phenyl-iron (Fe-Ph) complexes. This has been observed with myoglobin(26Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Kerr D.E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2-4Google Scholar), hemoglobin, (27Kunze K.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 1380-1381Google Scholar) catalase (28Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kerr D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10558-10563Google Scholar), and cytochrome P450 (29Raag R. Swanson B.S. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8119-8126Google Scholar, 30Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) and is unambiguously confirmed by crystal structures of the myoglobin and cytochrome P450cam complexes(26Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Kerr D.E.

Denaturation of the phenyl-iron complexes under acidic, aerobic conditions results in migration of the phenyl group from the iron to the nitrogens of the porphyrin to yield N-phenylheme. This is followed by loss of the iron to give N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX(26Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Kerr D.E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2-4Google Scholar, 27Kunze K.L.

The aromatic residue adjacent to the catalytic histidine, and the histidine itself, may be part of the proposed barrier that restricts access of substrates to the ferryl species. Evidence that the aromatic residue plays such a role is provided by our finding that mutation of Phe-41 to a leucine or threonine enhances the peroxygenase activity of HRP(19Ozaki S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4487-4488Google Scholar, 20Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ozaki S. Newmyer S.L. Miller V.P. Hartmann C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 223-227Google Scholar). These two mutants oxidize aryl alkyl thioethers to their sulfoxides at higher rates and, in the case of the F41L mutant, with higher enantioselectivity than native HRP. Furthermore, these mutations convey on HRP the ability to epoxidize styrene(20Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ozaki S. Newmyer S.L. Miller V.P. Hartmann C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 223-227Google Scholar). These results agree with our finding that replacement of the distal tryptophan in cytochrome c peroxidase by an alanine enhances both the accessibility of the iron and the peroxygenase activity of that enzyme (32Miller V.P. DePillis G.D. Ferrer J.C. Mauk A.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8936-8942Google Scholar). To investigate the catalytic role of the distal histidine and to determine if the histidine and the adjacent phenylalanine shield the ferryl species we have developed a new system for the heterologous expression and purification of HRP mutants and have expressed the F41A, H42A, and H42V mutants of HRP. We have examined the activities of these enzymes in the peroxidation of guaiacol, the sulfoxidation of thioanisole, and the epoxidation of styrene and have identified major differences in the catalytic activities of the mutants. The reactions of the three mutants with phenyldiazene have then been used to rationalize the differences in their peroxygenase activities in terms of differences in both the rate of Compound I formation and the accessibility of the heme iron. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, and Life Technologies, Inc. Native HRP and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Hemin, 30% H2O2, styrene, trans-β-methylstyrene, (R)-styrene oxide, racemic styrene oxide, thioanisole, acetophenone, mCPBA, and ABTS were from Aldrich; guaiacol and Sephadex G-25 from Sigma; and methyl phenyldiazene carboxylate azoester from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). Modified heme derivatives were prepared by reaction of phenyldiazene with HRP as described previously(21Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar). H2O2 and mCPBA solutions were quantitated by titration with iodide (λmax-353 = 25,900 M-1 cm-1 for I3-)(33Ramettes R.W. Sanford Jr., R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 82: 5001-5005Google Scholar). In the H2O2 titration, trace amounts of HRP were added to promote complete reaction. Styrene was purified by passage through neutral alumina. In quantitating HRP, the Soret absorbance value for the HRP mutants was assumed to be the same as that for the native protein (ϵ = 95,000 M-1 cm-1). All assay buffers were treated with Bio-Rad Chelex 100 resin to remove trace metals. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained in spinner flasks at 27°C (75 rpm) in Hink's TNM-FH insect cell medium supplemented with Grace's medium (JRH Biosciences) containing 10% heat-inactivated, 0.2 μm-filtered fetal calf serum (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture facility). Trichoplusia ni cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in suspension in Sf900-II SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a rotary shaker incubator at 27°C (130 rpm). Plasmids were transformed into and maintained in Escherichia coli strain DH5α grown in LB. Transformed vectors were selected by ampicillin resistance. Plasmid preparation was afforded through Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) or Promega (Madison, WI) Wizard® minipreparations. Plasmid fragments from restriction enzyme digests were typically isolated by subjecting the digest to electrophoresis on an agarose gel and extracting the DNA with a gel extraction kit (Bio101 GeneClean or Qiagen gel extraction kit). DNA sequencing either was carried out with the Sequenase kit, version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or was performed by the University of California, San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center. The construct pUC-HRP, containing a synthetic version of the HRP gene cloned into pUC19 (British Biotechnologies), was used for subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis. To append the sequence encoding the N-terminal polyhistidine tag from the pET-19b vector (Novagen) to the 5′ end of the HRP gene, the HRP gene was isolated from pUC-HRP by NdeI/EcoRI digestion and subcloned into pET-19b. The resulting hHRP insert was then subcloned into the baculovirus vector pACGP67B (Pharminogen). This vector encodes a sequence for the glycoprotein 67 leader peptide at the 5′ end of the multiple cloning site which targets the translated HRP gene product for secretion. NcoI digestion of the pET-HRP construct yielded a fragment containing the polyhistidine sequence and a portion of the HRP sequence. This fragment was ligated into baculovirus vector pACGP67B that had been digested with NcoI. Isolated plasmid containing the correctly oriented gene fragment (GPNcoIHis HRP) was used as the construct for introducing the SacI/EcoRI-cut pUC-HRP, restoring the full length of the HRP gene. SacI/EcoRI fragments from mutated pUC-HRP were similarly ligated into the baculovirus vector. pUC-HRP mutants were generated through cassette mutagenesis. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides that corresponded to the region of the HRP sequence flanked by NdeI and SacI sites were synthesized by the University of California, San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center. Individual cassettes were generated for the F41A, H42A, and H42V HRP mutations. The annealed cassette was ligated to NdeI/SacI-cut pUC-HRP, and the resulting mutant was subcloned into SacI/EcoRI-digested GPNcoIHisHRP, as outlined above. Recombinant virus production, purification, and amplification were performed in Sf9 cells. The sequence encoding hHRP was introduced into wild-type Autographica californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus with the Baculogold® transfection kit (Pharminogen). The resulting transfection medium was isolated by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min) and subjected to one round of plaque purification. Plaques that represent infection by a single virus particle were individually isolated and mixed with 1 ml of complete medium. Viral amplification of this initial stock was achieved through successive rounds of infection. To begin amplifying the virus for expression purposes, a 900-μl volume was used to infect a monolayer of Sf9 cells in a 60-mm Petri dish (106 cells/ml, 3 ml final volume). After a 4-day incubation, the medium was isolated through centrifugation (5 min, 1,000 × g), and the existence of the hHRP insert was verified by performing polymerase chain reaction on the isolated viral DNA. In a second round of amplification, 250 μl of this viral stock was used to infect a monolayer of Sf9 cells seeded on a 100-mm Petri dish (5 × 106 cells, 10 ml final volume). After incubating the cells for 4 days, the medium was harvested by centrifugation as above. A final round of amplification used 500 μl of this latter viral stock to infect 100 ml of Sf9 in suspended culture (2 × 106 cells/ml). After a 3-day incubation the medium was harvested by centrifugation. This series of amplification steps gave a viral stock with a viral titer of 1-3 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Expression was performed in T. ni cells. Typically a 1-liter culture of cells (1.5-2 × 106 cells/ml) was inoculated with virus (multiplicity of infection ~1). A 10-ml volume of 0.2 μm filtered hemin/bovine serum albumin solution was added at the time of inoculation (0.24 mM hemin, 0.4 mM bovine serum albumin, in 75 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2)(34Tenhunen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Google Scholar). The expression was harvested after 60-64 h. The expression medium was separated from the cells by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was concentrated and ultrafiltered at room temperature with an Amicon Spiral-Wound Cartridge Concentrator CH2PRS (S1Y10, 10,000 molecular weight cutoff spiral membrane) to a 150-200-ml volume in 20 mM Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl (binding buffer). Particulate material was removed from the ultrafiltrate by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was stirred with 7.5-10 ml of Ni(II) nitrilotriacetic acid (Invitrogen) at 4°C. After 1.5-2 h, the resin was collected in a 1.5-cm-diameter column support. The resulting column was washed at 75 ml/min with binding buffer until the eluent ran clear. In a similar manner the resin was washed with binding buffer adjusted to pH 6.0. Successive washes included the pH 6.0 buffer containing 0.1 and 1 M imidazole. The latter wash was dialyzed against 20 mM Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.0). The dialysate was run through a 1.5 × 10-cm Pharmacia Sepharose QFF (gravity flow) column. The total amount of protein was measured after each purification step by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Compound I was generated by adding 1 equivalent of H2O2 and Compound II by adding 1 equivalent of K4Fe(CN)6 to Compound I. Excess H2O2 or mCPBA was required to obtain Compound I in the case of the His-42 mutants. Attempts to detect Compound II species for H42A hHRP and H42V hHRP involved adding 1 equivalent of K4Fe(CN)6 to Compound I and allowing the Compound I formed with mCPBA to decay spontaneously. The rate of Compound I formation was determined at 25°C by following the decay of the absorption at 411 nm (an isosbestic point between Compound II and the resting state) using a stopped flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics Limited, model SF.17MV) with a slit width of 0.25 mm. To observe Compound I formation under pseudofirst-order conditions, the enzyme (0.25 μM) in 20 mM Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.0) was allowed to react with excess levels of H2O2 (2.5, 5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 15.0, and 25.0 μM). The following set of equations, based on the kinetic scheme in the Introduction, was used to derive the rate constant for Compound I formation. −d[HRP]/dt=k1[HRP][H2O2](Eq. 1) −d[HRP]/dt=k(obs)[HRP](Eq. 2) k(obs)=k1[H2O2](Eq. 3) The decay in absorption was fit to the equation At = A0e-k(obs)t + C. The second-order rate constant was determined by taking the slope of the plot, k(obs)versus the H2O2 concentration. Increased H2O2 concentrations (0.025-1.5 M) were required with H42A hHRP to see the 411 nm decay. Steady-state kinetics were studied by measuring the initial rates for the oxidation of ABTS at 25°C as the concentrations of ABTS (1.25, 1.67, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mM) and H2O2 (65, 85, 125, 250, and 500 mM) were varied. These H2O2 levels did not oxidize ABTS detectably in the absence of the enzyme. The final assay volume was 1 ml and contained 500 nM His-42 hHRP mutant in 100 mM KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0). ABTS oxidation was followed at 414 nm (ϵ414 = 3.6 × 104M-1 cm-1). describes the native HRP activity. Typically, the rate of conversion of Compound II to resting state is slower than the rate of conversion of Compound I to Compound II (k3 < k2), which reduces Equation 4 to Equation 5. 2[HRP]0/v=((k2+k3)/(k2k3))(1/[ABTS])+(1/k1)(1/[H2O2])(Eq. 4) 2[HRP]0/v=(1/k3)(1/[ABTS])+(1/k1)(1/[H2O2])(Eq. 5) Guaiacol activity was measured to monitor the activity of hHRP during purification and to compare the peroxidase activity of the native plant and recombinant enzymes. Sample activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 20°C using the value ϵ470 = 5.53 cm-1 mM-1. This absorbance value, derived from a plot of the enzyme-catalyzed change in absorbance at 470 nm versus H2O2 concentration, was used to calculate the amount of guaiacol consumed. In a typical assay, the enzyme (~10 pmol) was mixed with 5.1 mM guaiacol in 20 mM Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.0 (1 ml final volume), and H2O2 (0.5 mM, final) was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction of a solution of the enzyme (25 μM) and thioanisole (5 mM) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) on ice was initiated by the addition of H2O2 (683 μM, added every 2 min). As found earlier with the native enzyme(35Harris R.Z. Newmyer S.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1637-1645Google Scholar), product formation is not linear with respect to time if peroxide is not supplemented periodically. At various time points, 500-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken, 50 nmol of acetophenone internal standard was added to each aliquot, and each of the mixtures was extracted with 500 μl of CH2Cl2. The organic layer was concentrated under a stream of argon to a volume of ~10 μl, diluted with 50 μl of 80% hexanes, 20% isopropyl alcohol, and loaded onto a Chiracel OD HPLC column (Daicel Chemical Industries). The (R)- and (S)-thioanisole sulfoxides were eluted isocratically with the same solvent mixture at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on a Hewlett Packard model 1040A instrument equipped with a diode array detector set at 454 nm with a 6-nm bandwidth(35Harris R.Z. Newmyer S.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1637-1645Google Scholar). The retention times of acetophenone and the (S)- and (R)-thioanisole sulfoxides were 20.9, 27.0, and 46.2 min, respectively(35Harris R.Z. Newmyer S.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1637-1645Google Scholar). To a solution of the enzyme (25 μM) and styrene (10 mM) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) on ice was added H2O2 (683 μM every 2 min). At various time points, 500-μl aliquots were taken, and 4.6 nmol of trans-β-methylstyrene was added to each as an internal standard. Each of the mixtures was then extracted with 500 μl of CH2Cl2, and the organic layer was concentrated to a volume of ~10 μl under a stream of argon. The concentrated extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Hewlett Packard model 5890 instrument equipped with a DB-1 column (0.25 mm × 30 m, J & W Scientific) programmed to run at 80°C for 3 min and then rise at 4°C/min to 150°C. The retention times for trans-β-methylstyrene and styrene oxide were 9.0 and 10.0 min, respectively. The stereochemistry of styrene epoxidation was determined by isocratic gas chromatography (90°C) on a 0.25-mm × 30-m Chiraldex G-TA capillary column (Advanced Separation Technologies, Whippany, NJ). The retention times for the (S)- and (R)-styrene oxides were 26.8 and 28.1 min, respectively. The enantiomer configurations were established by comparison with authentic samples of the racemic and (R)-styrene oxides. HRP, hHRP, and the three mutants in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) were allowed to react at 25°C with phenyldiazene prepared by diluting 2 μl of 5.67 M methyl phenyldiazene carboxylate azoester in 200 μl of 0.1 M KOH solution. A 2-μl aliquot of the phenyldiazene solution was added every 5 min until no further changes were observed spectrophotometrically (for 2 ml of 10 μM enzyme, 10 μl of the phenyldiazene solution was sufficient). After incubating for an additional 10 min, 50 μl of a 50 mM ascorbate solution or a few grains of ascorbate were added, and the resulting solution was filtered through a 1.5 × 10-cm Sephadex G-25 column. The eluted protein was acidified with glacial acetic acid (final 25% v/v) and was then extracted with three 1-ml volumes of ether. The extract was concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, and the residue was resuspended in 100 μl of 6:4:1 MeOH:H2O:AcOH (solution A). The sample was analyzed by HPLC on a Partisil ODS-3.5 μm Alltech column eluted with 80% solution A, 20% solution B (10:1 MeOH:AcOH) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 416 nm. A polyhistidine tag was fused to the N terminus of the HRP gene to facilitate enzyme purification and to circumvent possible difficulties in the purification of mutant enzymes. The specific activity and RZ value obtained after each step in the purification of wild-type hHRP (Table 1) and a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the purified protein (Fig. 3) demonstrate the utility of the polyhistidine tag. Nevertheless, even though the chelating column purified hHRP 351-fold, there is a significant (67%) loss of total hHRP activity. The majority of the hHRP activity is retained by the resin, but a significant amount elutes with the 0.1 M imidazole wash used to elute contaminants from the column. Less protein loss is generally observed in the purification of hHRP mutants. The overall yields of the purified, expressed proteins range from 5 to 15 mg/liter of expression medium. N-terminal sequencing of hHRP yielded the sequence ADLGS encoded by the 5′ end of the multiple cloning site. This confirmed that the glycoprotein 67 leader sequence was removed from the mature protein.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The spectra of the resting ferric states of wild-type and His-42 hHRP mutants, like that of the native enzyme, exhibit asymmetric Soret peaks with maxima at λmax = 402 nm. However, F41A hHRP has a 4 nm red-shifted, shoulderless Soret absorption at λmax = 406 nm. The Compound I and Compound II spectra of hHRP and F41A hHRP are indistinguishable from the corresponding spectra of native HRP. In the case of the H42A and H42V mutants, 1,000 rather than 1 equivalent of H2O2 is required to observe the decrease in Soret absorption characteristic of Compound I.

Some of these enzymes carry out a concomitant abasic (apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP)) lyase reaction at a rate approximately equal to that of the glycosylase step. As a generalization of the mechanism described for T4 endonuclease V, a repair glycosylase/AP lyase that is specific for ultraviolet light-induced cis-syn pyrimidine dimers, a hypothesis concerning the mechanism of these repair glycosylases has been proposed. This hypothesis describes the initial action of all DNA glycosylases as a nucleophilic attack at the sugar C-1′ of the damaged base nucleoside, resulting in scission of the N-glycosylic bond. It is proposed that the enzymes that are only glycosylases differ in the chemical nature of the attacking nucleophile from the glycosylase/AP lyases. Those DNA glycosylases, which carry out the AP lyase reaction at a rate approximately equal to the glycosylase step, are proposed to use an amino group as the nucleophile, resulting in an imino enzyme-DNA intermediate. The simple glycosylases, lacking the concomitant AP lyase activity, are proposed to use some nucleophile from the medium, e.g. an activated water molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2045081659,"Many genes induced by type I interferons (IFNs) are also induced by double-stranded (ds) RNA. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of this induction process. Using cell lines from which the type I IFN genes have been deleted, we established that induction by dsRNA of the IFN-inducible 561 gene is direct and not mediated by the intermediate synthesis of IFN. Unlike 561 mRNA, the IFN-inducible 6-16 mRNA was induced poorly by dsRNA. Transfection studies demonstrated that the sequence difference between the core IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) of these two genes is not responsible for their differential inducibility by dsRNA. A point mutation in the 561 ISRE that abolished its response to IFN-α also made it unresponsive to dsRNA, thus demonstrating that the ISRE is the relevant cis-acting element for dsRNA signaling. The roles of different known ISRE-binding protein and tyrosine kinases in transducing the signal elicited by dsRNA were evaluated in genetically altered cell lines. dsRNA failed to induce 561 mRNA in cells expressing an antisense RNA for interferon regulatory factor 1, whereas it was induced strongly in cells expressing the corresponding sense mRNA. 561 mRNA was also induced strongly by dsRNA, but not by IFN-α, in mutant cell lines that do not express functional tyrosine kinases Tyk2 or JAK1 or ISRE binding protein, p48, or STAT2, all of which are required for IFN-α signaling. However, in cells devoid of functional STAT1, which is also required for IFN-α signaling, the induction of 561 mRNA by dsRNA was very low. Expression of transfected STAT1α protein, but not of STAT1β protein, in these cells greatly enhanced the dsRNA inducibility of the 561 gene. These studies indicate that the major ISRE-mediated signaling pathway used by dsRNA requires interferon regulatory factor 1 and STAT1α. This pathway, however, does not require the other known cytoplasmic components used for IFN-α signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1603416910,"Mouse mast cell protease 7 (mMCP-7) is a tryptase stored in the secretory granules of mast cells. At the granule pH of 5.5, mMCP-7 is fully active and is bound to heparin-containing serglycin proteoglycans. To understand the interaction of mMCP-7 with heparin inside and outside the mast cell, this tryptase was first studied by comparative protein modeling. The “pro” form of mMCP-7 was then expressed in insect cells and studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Although mMCP-7 lacks known linear sequences of amino acids that interact with heparin, the three-dimensional model of mMCP-7 revealed an area on the surface of the folded protein away from the substrate-binding site that exhibits a strong positive electrostatic potential at the acidic pH of the granule. In agreement with this calculation, recombinant pro-mMCP-7 bound to a heparin-affinity column at pH 5.5 and readily dissociated from the column at pH > 6.5. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the prediction that the conversion of His residues 8, 68, and 70 in the positively charged region into Glu prevents the binding of pro-mMCP-7 to heparin. Because the binding requires positively charged His residues, native mMCP-7 is able to dissociate from the protease/proteoglycan macromolecular complex when the complex is exocytosed from bone marrow-derived mast cells into a neutral pH environment. Many hematopoietic effector cells store positively charged proteins in granules that contain serglycin proteoglycans. The heparin/mMCP-7 interaction, which depends on the tertiary structure of the tryptase, may be representative of a general control mechanism by which hematopoietic cells maximize storage of properly folded, enzymatically active proteins in their granules. Mouse mast cell protease 7 (mMCP-7) is a tryptase stored in the secretory granules of mast cells. At the granule pH of 5.5, mMCP-7 is fully active and is bound to heparin-containing serglycin proteoglycans. To understand the interaction of mMCP-7 with heparin inside and outside the mast cell, this tryptase was first studied by comparative protein modeling. The “pro” form of mMCP-7 was then expressed in insect cells and studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Although mMCP-7 lacks known linear sequences of amino acids that interact with heparin, the three-dimensional model of mMCP-7 revealed an area on the surface of the folded protein away from the substrate-binding site that exhibits a strong positive electrostatic potential at the acidic pH of the granule. In agreement with this calculation, recombinant pro-mMCP-7 bound to a heparin-affinity column at pH 5.5 and readily dissociated from the column at pH > 6.5. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the prediction that the conversion of His residues 8, 68, and 70 in the positively charged region into Glu prevents the binding of pro-mMCP-7 to heparin. Because the binding requires positively charged His residues, native mMCP-7 is able to dissociate from the protease/proteoglycan macromolecular complex when the complex is exocytosed from bone marrow-derived mast cells into a neutral pH environment. Many hematopoietic effector cells store positively charged proteins in granules that contain serglycin proteoglycans. The heparin/mMCP-7 interaction, which depends on the tertiary structure of the tryptase, may be representative of a general control mechanism by which hematopoietic cells maximize storage of properly folded, enzymatically active proteins in their granules."
https://openalex.org/W1986465162,"Neural tissues controlling circadian rhythmicity have been identified in a variety of organisms and are often closely associated with the visual system. In Drosophila, the clock gene period (per), which is required for circadian rhythms, is expressed in many neurons and glia throughout the eye and brain. We asked whether biological rhythms could be generated if per expression were restricted to a subset of these cells that is involved in photoreception. Here we demonstrate that expression of per under the control of the glass promoter confers both behavioral and molecular rhythmicity. glass is required for development of Drosophila photoreceptors, and this promoter is active in eyes, ocelli, and certain cells of the central brain. When we genetically removed all external photoreceptor cells, rhythms persisted in these transgenic animals. This suggests that a few central brain cells producing glass and per are capable of generating biological rhythms."

In a cell-free system consisting of plasma membrane and cytosol from human neutrophils, phorbol esters activated phospholipase D in an adenosine nucleotide triphosphate-dependent manner. ATPγS (adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)) was 2-3-fold more effective than ATP, while ADP and AppNHp (adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate) were ineffective, and activation was blocked by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. In cytosol depleted of protein kinase C by chromatography on threonine-Sepharose, phorbol ester-dependent activation was lost, but was restored upon addition of purified rat brain protein kinase C. The target for phosphorylation was shown to be the plasma membrane: plasma membrane was phosphorylated using ATPγS/phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and protein kinase C and was reisolated to remove activators. Upon adding nucleotide-depleted cytosol, activator-independent phospholipase D activity was seen. Using this prephosphorylation protocol, PKC-dependent activation of plasma membranes was found to require micromolar calcium, implicating a conventional protein kinase C. Using recombinant isoforms of protein kinase C, only the conventional isoforms showed significant activation, with the following rank order of potency: β1 > α > γ; the β2, δ, ϵ, δ, and ζ isoforms showed little or no activity.

https://openalex.org/W1994331800,"The 104 kDa irreC-rst protein, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, mediates homophilic adhesion in cell cultures. In larval optic chiasms, the protein is found on recently formed axon bundles, not on older ones. In developing visual neuropils, it is present in all columnar domains of specific layers. The number of irreC-rst-positive neuropil stratifications increases until the midpupal stage. Immunoreactivity fades thereafter. The functional importance of the restricted expression pattern is demonstrated by the severe projection errors of axons in the first and second optic chiasms in loss of function mutants and in transformants that express the irreC-rst protein globally. Epigenesis of the phenotypes can be explained partially on the bases of homophilic irreC-rst interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2053726766,"A point mutation (D136G) predicting the substitution of glycine for aspartate in position 136 of the human muscle Cl- channel (hClC-1) causes recessive generalized myotonia. Heterologous expression of a recombinant D136G produces functional Cl- channels with profound alterations in voltage-dependent gating, without concomitant changes in pore properties. The mutant exhibits slowly activating current upon hyperpolarization, in contrast to wild-type channels, which display time-dependent current decay (deactivation) at negative membrane potentials. Steady-state activation of D136G depends upon the transmembrane Cl- gradient, reaching zero at voltages positive to the Cl- reversal potential in physiological Cl- distribution. This explains the reduced sarcolemmal Cl- conductance that causes myotonia. The functional disturbances exhibited by D136G may stem from a defect in the ClC-1 voltage sensor."

Levels of the other members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) family, including LDLR, the very low density lipoprotein receptor, and LRP-1, were reduced. When LDL catabolism was examined in these cells, it was found that the treated cells endocytosed and degraded at 10-fold higher levels than untreated cells. The increased LDL uptake coincided with increased LRP-2 activity of the treated cells, as measured by uptake of both 125I-labeled monoclonal LRP-2 antibody and the LRP-2 ligand prourokinase. The ability of LDL to bind to LRP-2 was demonstrated by solid-phase binding assays. This binding was inhibitable by LRP-2 antibodies, receptor-associated protein (the antagonist of ligand binding for all members of the LDLR family), or antibodies to apoB100, the major apolipoprotein component of LDL. In cell assays, LRP-2 antibodies blocked the elevated 125I-LDL internalization and degradation observed in the retinoic acid/dibutyryl cyclic AMP-treated F9 cells. A low level of LDL endocytosis existed that was likely mediated by LDLR since it could not be inhibited by LRP-2 antibodies, but was inhibited by excess LDL, receptor-associated protein, or apoB100 antibody.

https://openalex.org/W1987797147,"The slow afterhyperpolarization in hippocampal pyramidal neurons is mediated by a calcium-activated potassium current (IAHP) and is a target for variety of different neurotransmitters. The characteristics of the channels underlying IAHP and how they are modulated by neurotransmitters are, however, unknown. In this study, we have examined the properties of the channels underlying IAHP using fluctuation analysis of the macroscopic current. Our results indicate that this channel has a unitary conductance of 2-5 pS and a mean open time of about 2 ms. When the peak amplitude of IAHP was maximal, these channels have an open probability of 0.4. Noradrenaline and carbachol reduced IAHP amplitude by lowering open channel probability. These result indicate that a novel calcium-activated potassium channel underlies IAHP. This channel is modulated in a similar fashion by two different transmitter systems that utilize distinct protein kinases."

Biophys. Acta 1266, 261-267). In the present study, we characterized the phosphoprotein and studied changes in its localization upon activation of phagocytes. The 21-kDa phosphoprotein was rapidly dephosphorylated upon activation not only with opsonized zymosan but also with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and arachidonic acid. The peptide fragments derived from the 21-kDa phosphoprotein were found to have the same amino acid sequences as those of cofilin, an actin-binding protein. The phosphoprotein reacted exclusively with anti-cofilin antibody on two-dimensional immunoblots. Accordingly, together with its apparent molecular weight, isoelectric point, and detection of phosphoserine as a phosphoamino acid, we concluded that the 21-kDa phosphoprotein was a phosphorylated form of cofilin. The amount of cofilin in membranous fractions was increased upon activation. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that cofilin existed diffusely in the cytosol and nuclear region of the resting cells, while in the activated cells, it was accumulated at the plasma membrane area, forming ruffles or endocytic vesicles on which O should be produced.

These studies showed that both fibulins are widely expressed intercellular components of connective tissues present in matrix fibers and basement membranes. The association of fibulins with these ECM structures presumably involves their ability to bind to any of a number of ECM proteins including fibronectin (4Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Google Scholar; 12Godyna S. Mann D.M. Argraves W.S.

The concentration of fibulin-1 in blood is 30-50 μg/ml, whereas fibulin-2 is present at very low levels, 20 ng/ml. Fibulin-1 is representative of a small number of ECM proteins including fibronectin, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor, whose concentration in blood exceeds that of other ECM proteins such as laminin, type IV collagen, or thrombospondin by several orders of magnitude. Numerous biological functions have been ascribed to plasma fibronectin, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor, particularly with respect to hemostasis and thrombosis; however, the function of plasma fibulin-1 is not known. In this report we demonstrate that plasma fibulin-1 can bind to fibrinogen and incorporate into fibrin clots formed in vitro and in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteinsFibulin-1 was isolated from human placenta by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously in Argraves et al.(1990). Human thrombin and Fg (having 95% clottability) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). Fg fragments, designated DH, DY, DL, E3, αC (residues 220-581), and TSD, were prepared from bovine Fg according to methods described previously (24Medved L.V. Litvinovich S.V. Privalov P.L.

Recombinant human αC domain of Fg (residues Gln221-Val610 of α chain) was provided by Dr. Ken Ighman (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Fibronectin (FN) was purified as described by 27Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Google Scholar. Recombinant human factor XIII (activated form, FXIIIa) was obtained from ZymoGenetics Inc. (Seattle, WA). Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) was purified from human platelets by adsorption to barium citrate followed by heparin-agarose chromatography according to 1Alexander R.J. Detwiler T.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 67-71Google Scholar. Ovalbumin was obtained from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin was obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Human immunoglobulin was purchased from Cappel (Gaithersburg, MD).AntibodiesThe anti-fibulin-1 monoclonal antibody 3A11 has been described previously (Argraves et al., 1990). 3A11 IgG was purified by protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography. Monoclonal antibody against human Fg was provided by Dr. Bryan Butman (PerImmune, Rockville, MD). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human Fg was provided by Plasma Derivatives Laboratory, American Red Cross.RadiolabelingFibulin-1, FN, bovine serum albumin, and TSP1 (100 μg of each) were radioiodinated in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Corp.) using 20 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce) and 0.25 mM of NaI as carrier. The radiolabeled proteins were separated from the free iodine by using gel filtration on Sephadex G-25M columns (Pharmacia). The typical specific activities obtained ranged from 1 to 10 μCi/μg.Fibulin-1 Purification from Human PlasmaHuman plasma (100 ml) was precipitated by slowly adding ammonium sulfate (saturated) with continual stirring at room temperature in order to reach a concentration that was 20% that of the saturated solution, as described by 15Green A.A. Hughes W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 67-90Google Scholar. The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 × g at 4°C, and the pellet was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl buffer (TBS). The dissolved precipitate was applied to either fibulin-1 monoclonal (3A11) IgG-Sepharose or normal IgG-Sepharose at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of TBS and then eluted with 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4. The eluted fractions were dialyzed extensively against TBS, and aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-containing 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels and stained with Coomassie Blue.Immunoblotting AssaysSamples separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Unoccupied protein binding sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation in 3% nonfat dried milk. Antibodies diluted in 3% nonfat dried milk, 0.05% Tween 20, TBS were incubated with the filters for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with goat or rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by using the chromogenic substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).Gel Blot Overlay AssayNitrocellulose membranes containing proteins transferred from SDS-PAGE were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk, TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 18 h at 4°C with 125I-fibulin-1 (20 nM) in the same buffer containing 5 mM CaCl2. Following the incubation, the filters were washed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and used to expose Kodak X-OMAT AR film (Rochester, NY) at −70°C.Solid Phase Binding AssaysSolid phase binding of fibulin-1 to Fg and its fragments or Fg to fibulin-1 were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described by Balbona et al. (1992). Binding of fibulin-1 to Fg or Fg fragments was detected by using the fibulin monoclonal antibody (3A11). Binding of Fg to fibulin-1 was detected by using a polyclonal Fg antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by using either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) and the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Kiekegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). For ELISAs used to examine the interaction of fibulin-1 with fibrin, microtiter wells were coated by diluting monomeric fibrin (10 μg/ml, kept at acidic pH) in microtiter wells containing 1 M Tris buffer, pH 8.5. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of fibulin-1 binding to Fg, Fg subfragments, or fibrin were estimated by fitting the binding data as described previously (Balbona et al., 1992).To determine the Kd for the binding of fibulin-1 and Fg, a surface plasmon resonance-based method (reviewed in Fisher and Fivash(1994); 9Chaiken I. Rose S. Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 197-210Google Scholar) was used. This methodology involved conjugating fibulin-1 (100 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.1) to carboxymethyl-dextran on the surface of a sensor chip. Solutions containing various amounts of Fg (0.15-4 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 were added, and using a biosensor instrument (Fisons, model IAsys), changes in the optical phenomenon of plasmon resonance (changes in mass concentration on the chip surface) were measured as the two molecules bound. From the resulting sensorgram the association of the fibulin-1•Fg complex was followed in real time, and when a protein-free buffer was added the dissociation of the complex was also monitored. The kinetic parameters ka and kd were both obtained and the dissociation constant was derived from the equation Kd=kd/ka.Fluorescence AnisotropyFluorescein-labeled fibulin-1 was prepared according to the method of 8Busby T.F. Ingham K.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6127-6135Google Scholar using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Briefly, fibulin-1 was dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.5, and mixed with a 40-fold molar excess of FITC. The labeling reaction proceeded in the dark for 4 h at room temperature, after which the FITC-fibulin-1 was separated from the free FITC by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 M column (Pharmacia). The degree of labeling was determined optically as described by 18Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 670: 181-189Google Scholar. A typical labeling efficiency was 4-5 mol of FITC/mol of fibulin-1.Fluorescent anisotropy measurements were performed in TBS at room temperature using an SLM-8000C fluorometer in a T format with emission and excitation wavelengths set at 494 and 524 nm, respectively. Fg or FN in TBS was added to a 0.1 μM FITC•fibulin-1, TBS solution using a motorized syringe while continually stirring. The change in anisotropy (ΔA) as a function of titrant concentration was fitted to a single class of binding sites by using the following equation, ΔA=ΔAmax[titrant]Kd+[titrant](Eq. 1) where Kd is the apparent dissociation constant and [titrant] is the concentration of free Fg or FN. ΔAmax is the maximum anisotropy change that would be achieved at saturating concentrations of titrant (19Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Isaacs B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4624-4628Google Scholar).Incorporation of Fibulin-1 into Fibrin ClotsFibrin clots were formed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes using purified human Fg and thrombin as described by 33Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 923-933Google Scholar and 5Bale M.D. Westrick L.G. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7502-7808Google Scholar. Human Fg (0.8 mg/ml) was mixed with 125I-fibulin-1 (64 nM), fibulin-1 (50 μg/ml, 641 nM), and 10 mM CaCl2. A molecular mass of 78,842 daltons (determined from laser desorption mass spectroscopy) was used to calculate the molar concentration of fibulin-1 containing solutions in which the protein concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient of A0.1%280 nm = 0.467. Radiolabeled TSP1, FN, and bovine serum albumin were used in parallel experiments. For all the proteins studied by this assay, a 1:10 molar ratio of radiolabeled to unlabeled protein was used. Clot formation was initiated by the addition of thrombin (0.2 units/ml), and the fibrin formation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37°C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g the pelleted fibrin clots were washed three times with TBS and solubilized with an equal volume of 8 M urea, 10% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.16 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The amount of radiolabeled protein incorporated into the fibrin clots was determined by using a γ-counter. In some experiments, factor XIIIa was added to a final concentration of 6.0 μg/ml prior to the initiation of fibrin formation.Turbidity Measurements during Fibrin PolymerizationTurbidity measurements were made throughout the course of in vitro fibrin polymerization as described by 6Bale M.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 862-868Google Scholar using a Perkin Elmer (model Lambda 5) spectrophotometer. Fibrin clot formation was initiated by the addition of thrombin (0.02 NIH units/ml) to a 10-mm disposable cuvette containing purified Fg (270 μg/ml) in a solution of TBS, 3.2 mM CaCl2 and various concentrations of fibulin-1 (50-150 μg/ml). To measure changes in turbidity of the polymerizing fibrin, light absorbance at 600 nm was monitored continuously for 60 min. The lateral aggregation rate of the reaction was characterized by determining the slope of a line drawn tangent to the absorbance curve such that a maximal slope value was derived. The lag time to turbidity rise was considered to be the x intercept of the tangent line. The final turbidity was measured 18-24 h after initiation of clot formation.Localization of Fibulin-1 in Clots Present in Human Atherectomy SpecimensHuman atherectomy specimens were fixed postoperatively for 1 h at room temperature with 10% formalin. Following fixation, the tissues were placed in 70% ethanol and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5-μm thickness. Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and graded ethanol. Immunohistochemical staining was done as described in Roark et al.(1995) using either monoclonal antibodies to fibulin-1 or Fg and reagents supplied in a commercial staining kit (Elite, Sigma), which included horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG and the chromogenic substrate DAB. Sections were subjected to Fraser-Lendrum staining (Lendrum et al., 1962) in order to chemically stain fibrin red.RESULTSFibrinogen Co-purifies with Fibulin-1 Isolated from PlasmaPrevious studies have shown that fibulin-1 is a blood glycoprotein present at a concentration of 30-50 μg/ml (Argraves et al., 1990; Kluge et al., 1990). To isolate fibulin-1 from blood, human plasma was fractionated by ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation. Aliquots of the resulting AS fractions were evaluated for fibulin-1 content by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1D, fibulin-1 was most abundant in the 10-20% saturated AS fraction. This fraction was applied to a monoclonal anti-fibulin IgG column, and bound fibulin-1 was eluted by using a buffer containing urea. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane2), in addition to the expected 80-kDa fibulin-1 polypeptide, a prominent polypeptide having a Mr of ~300,000 was also present in the eluate. Neither of the two polypeptides bound to plain Sepharose (data not shown) or to a column of bovine IgG (or mouse IgG) coupled to Sepharose (Fig. 2A, lane1). Under reducing conditions four polypeptides having Mr values of 100,000, 66,000, 55,000, and 45,000 were apparent (Fig. 2B, lane2). The 100-kDa polypeptide under nonreducing conditions migrated with a Mr value of 80,000 and corresponded to fibulin-1 as determined by its immunoreactivity with monoclonal fibulin-1 antibody (Fig. 2D, lane2). The Mr values of the three other reduced polypeptides were consistent with their being the Fg Aα, Bβ, and γ chains. Fg is a dimer having a mass of 345 kDa, composed of 2 pairs of disulfide-linked chains designated Aα, Bβ, and γ that have mass values of 67.6, 54.7, and 46.4 kDa, respectively (23McKee P.A. Mattock P. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 738-744Google Scholar; 28Mosesson M.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 97-113Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the three polypeptides seen in the reduced SDS-PAGE profiles of the anti-fibulin-1 IgG-Sepharose eluate were the Fg Aα, Bβ, and γ chains (Fig. 2C, lane2). The results indicate that Fg co-purifies with fibulin-1 isolated from plasma.Figure 2:Fibrinogen co-purifies with fibulin-1 isolated from plasma by immunoabsorption on anti-fibulin-1 IgG-Sepharose. A 10-20% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate of human plasma was solubilized in TBS and applied to either normal IgG-Sepharose or fibulin-1 monoclonal (3A11) IgG-Sepharose. Aliquots of proteins eluted from the normal mouse IgG-Sepharose (lane1) and mouse anti-fibulin-1 IgG-Sepharose (lane2) as well as the unbound material from the anti-fibulin-1 IgG-Sepharose (lane3) were electrophoresed on SDS-containing 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing (panelsB-D) or nonreducing conditions (panelA). PanelsA and B are Coomassie Blue-stained gels, panelC is an immunoblot using Fg monoclonal antibody, and panelD is an immunoblot using fibulin-1 monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fibulin-1 Binds to Fibrinogen in Solid Phase and Fluid Phase ConditionsTo determine whether fibulin-1 could bind directly to Fg, several types of in vitro solid phase binding assays were used. As shown in Fig. 3B, 125I-fibulin-1 bound to human and bovine Fg that was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane after being electrophoresed in the absence of reducing agent on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels. 125I-fibulin-1 did not bind to the individual Fg Aα, Bβ, or γ chains after they were electrophoresed on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels in the presence of reducing agent (data not shown). In addition, fibulin-1 did not bind to filter-immobilized myosin, β-galactosidase, phosphorylase B, bovine serum albumin, or ovalbumin present in the molecular weight standards lane (Fig. 3B, lane1). The proteins contained within various AS fractions of plasma were also probed with 125I-fibulin-1 after their transfer to nitrocellulose from SDS-PAGE. 125I-fibulin bound to a polypeptide having a Mr corresponding to that of Fg present in an AS fraction (Fig. 1B) that, based on immunoblotting analysis, was most enriched for Fg (Fig. 1C). The results indicate that 125I-fibulin-1 is capable of binding to Fg and that the disulfide-bonded structure of Fg is required for the binding.Figure 3:125I-Fibulin-1 binds to fibrinogen in gel blot overlay assay. Human Fg (lane2), bovine Fg (lane3) and molecular weight standards (lane1) were electrophoresed on SDS-containing 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels that were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue (panelA) or electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and the membrane probed with 125I-fibulin-1 (30 nM) (panelB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ELISAs were also performed to evaluate the fibulin-1 interaction with Fg and fibrin. The results showed that fibulin-1 bound to microtiter wells coated with Fg in a dose-dependent manner but not to ovalbumin-coated wells (Fig. 4A). Conversely, Fg was found to bind in a dose-dependent manner to microtiter wells coated with fibulin-1 (Fig. 4C). EDTA at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 50 mM did not inhibit the binding of fibulin-1 to Fg (data not shown), indicating that the interaction was not dependent on divalent cations. The ability of fibulin-1 to bind to immobilized fibrin was also examined, and as shown in Fig. 4B, fibulin-1 bound in a dose-dependent manner to wells coated with human fibrin.Figure 4:Fibulin-1 binds to fibrinogen in both solid and fluid phase conditions. In panelsA-C, microtiter wells were coated with Fg, fibrin, fibulin-1, or ovalbumin (3 μg/ml). Increasing concentrations of fibulin-1 (0.0005-10 μM) (panelsA and B) or Fg (0.0015-30 μM) (panelC) were added to the coated wells and incubated for 18 h at 4°C. Bound fibulin-1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal fibulin-1 antibody (3A11), goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate, and a peroxidase substrate. Bound Fg was detected with a rabbit polyclonal Fg antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate, and a peroxidase substrate. The data shown in panelsA-C are mean values of duplicate determinations with the range indicated by bars and are representative of three experiments. In panelD, changes in fluorescence anisotropy are indicated as a function of the concentration of Fg that was added to a solution of FITC-labeled fibulin-1. The data shown in panelD are representative of three experiments. The curve represents the best fit of the data to a single class of sites using the equation described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To estimate the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for the binding of fibulin-1 to Fg or fibrin, the data from the microtiter well binding assays were fit to a form of the binding isotherm as described in Balbona et al.(1992). As has been experienced previously with studies of in vitro binding of fibulin-1 to fibronectin (Balbona et al., 1992), saturable binding of fibulin-1 to Fg or fibrin was not achieved. This was attributed to the fact that fibulin-1 can self-associate (Balbona et al., 1992). An apparent Kd of 4.5 ± 1.7 μM (n = 6) was obtained from the best fit of the ELISA data for the binding of fibulin-1 to Fg. A Kd of 3.2 ± 0.7 μM (n = 2) was estimated for the binding of Fg to immobilized fibulin-1. In contrast, the apparent affinity of fibulin-1 binding to fibrin was higher (Kd = 2.56 ± 0.99 μM, n = 3) than its binding to Fg.Using the technique of measuring changes in plasmon resonance as two proteins bind on the surface of a sensor chip, we determined a Kd value of 2.9 ± 1.6 μM (n = 4) for Fg binding to immobilized fibulin-1. This value is in good agreement with Kd values estimated from ELISA. In control experiments, no changes in plasmon resonance occurred when BSA was incubated with the fibulin-1-coated sensor chip.To determine if the fibulin-1-Fg interaction could occur in fluid phase, fluorescein-labeled fibulin-1 was titrated with Fg while monitoring the change in fluorescence anisotropy. As shown in Fig. 4D, there was a dose-dependent increase in the anisotropy with the addition of Fg, whereas the change in anisotropy was negligible when FN (not shown) was added. By fitting the data to the equation for a single class of homogenous binding sites (Ingham et al., 1988) a Kd of 6.7 ± 0.7 μM (n = 3) was determined for the fibulin-1-Fg interaction. The inability of FN to elicit a change in anisotropy was consistent with previous results that showed the interaction of fibulin-1 and FN to occur only when one or the other protein was immobilized (Balbona et al., 1992).The Fibulin-1 Binding Site Maps to the Carboxyl-terminal Region of the Bβ Chain of FgTo localize the regions on Fg that mediate the interaction with fibulin-1, various proteolytic fragments of bovine Fg were coated on microtiter wells and tested for their ability to promote binding of fibulin-1. As shown in Fig. 5B, the D region-derived fragments designated DH, DL, and DY (see diagram in Fig. 5A) bound to fibulin-1 in a dose-dependent manner, but other fragments such as the E, αC (recombinant or proteolytically derived), or TSD did not bind (Fig. 5B). The coating efficiency of each of the Fg fragments was evaluated and found to be similar (data not shown). An apparent Kd of 2.3 ± 0.2 μM (n = 4) was determined for the binding of fibulin-1 to Fg fragment DH. Since the smallest fibulin-1 binding fragment (DY) differs from the nonbinding TSD fragment principally by the presence of the COOH-terminal portion of the Bβ chain that includes residues 216-468 (Litvinovich et al., 1995), the fibulin-1 binding site is likely contained within this portion of the Bβ chain. The binding of fibulin-1 to the DY fragment was consistently of lower affinity than the binding to DH and DL (Fig. 5B) perhaps indicating that the conformation of the fibulin-1 binding site within the Bβ chain might be stabilized by the γ and/or γC domains.Figure 5:Fibulin-1 binding to subfragments of the D region of fibrinogen. Shown in panelA is a schematic diagram of the domain structure of Fg and the scheme for generation of subfragments of the D region of Fg (see “Materials and Methods”). For the ELISAs shown in panelB, microtiter wells were coated with Fg fragments (DH, DL, DY, E, αC, or TSD) or ovalbumin (3 μg/ml). Increasing concentrations of fibulin-1 (0.004-8 μM) were added and incubated for 18 h at 4°C. The wells were washed, and bound fibulin-1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal fibulin-1 antibody (3A11), goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate, and a peroxidase substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Fibulin-1 on Polymerization of FibrinThe portion of the Bβ chain implicated in the binding of fibulin-1 also contains the fibrin polymerization site that is complementary to the Gly-His-Arg-containing site in the E domain (10Doolittle R.F.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 239-242Google Scholar). Thus one can expect that binding of fibulin-1 could influence the fibrin polymerization process. We evaluated this possibility by comparing polymerization of fibrin in the presence and absence of fibulin-1 while monitoring changes in turbidity at 600 nm. As was shown by 17Hantgan R.R. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11272-11281Google Scholar such changes reflect the course of fibrin assembly. A delay of turbidity increase (lag period) corresponds to the first polymerization step, during which two-stranded protofibrils are"

The subcellular localization of the recombinant proteins was analyzed by in vivo phorbol ester binding, immunocytochemistry, and cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting. Results revealed several regions of PKC∊ that contain putative subcellular localization signals. The presence either of the hinge region or of a 33-amino-acid region including the pseudosubstrate sequence in the recombinant proteins resulted in association with the plasma membrane and cytoskeletal components.

A GPI-anchored protein is coded for as a preproprotein containing both NH2- and COOH-terminal signal peptides (Fig. 1). As the nascent chain is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum the NH2-terminal signal peptide is removed giving rise to the proprotein. Cleavage of the COOH-terminal signal peptide from the proprotein occurs concomitantly with the condensation of the ethanolamine group of GPI with the COOH group of the newly formed COOH-terminal amino acid (ω site). Apparently both processes occur in a single step catalyzed by what has been assumed to be a transamidase. We have studied this process using rough microsomal membranes (RM) from various cells coupled to a translational system with mRNA coding for an engineered form of human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) as a template. In the latter, the catalytic domain and all the glycosylation sites were removed to form a much smaller product (miniPLAP). With this system, the translation of preprominiPLAP mRNA and the subsequent steps in its processing to mature GPI-linked miniPLAP can be readily monitored (Fig. 1) (24Kodukula K. Maxwell S.E.

Processing of GPI proteins by a transamidase would involve a nucleophilic attack by the ethanolamine group of GPI on an activated carbonyl on the ω residue of the pro form of a protein. In a previous report(26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar), we presented evidence that water, a highly abundant nucleophile, competes with GPI and gives rise to a mature form of miniPLAP (free miniPLAP) that is also cleaved at the ω site but does not contain the GPI anchor. In RM from most cells, although GPI-linked miniPLAP is the major product, it is always accompanied by some free miniPLAP (Fig. 1). In RM from GPI-deficient cells, free miniPLAP is formed in amounts comparable to the GPI form(26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HeLa cells were grown in a Biolafitte bioreactor in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium at 37°C. Several different GPI-deficient cell lines were used. The Ltk- cell line, a derivative of L929 cells which is deficient in synthesizing the GPI intermediate N-acetylglucosamine phosphatidylinositol (30Kamitani T. Chang H.-M. Rollins C. Waneck G.L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20733-20736Google Scholar), was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The C1 cells, a derivative of M31/25 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The M31/25-C1 cells are a derivative of YH16/33 cells and are deficient in transferring N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol(31Thomas L.J. DeGasperi R. Sugiyama E. Chang H.-M. Beck P.J. Orlean P. Urakaze M. Kamitani T. Sambrook J.F. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23175-23184Google Scholar). Both Ltk- and M31/25 cells were gifts from E. T. H. Yeh of Texas Biotechnology Corporation. RM were prepared as described previously (26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar) and resuspended in 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM triethanolamine (TEA), pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 50 A280 units/ml. These preparations of RM were frozen on dry ice and stored at −70°C. Unless otherwise noted, translations were carried out with mRNA encoding preprominiPLAP ωSer-208 which was transcribed from the corresponding cDNA (37Gerber L.D. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12168-12173Google Scholar) and purified using an RNaid kit (Bio 101). Translations were carried out in 25-μl volumes at 30°C using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) as described previously (32Kodukula K. Cines D. Amthauer R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1350-1353Google Scholar) except that the 2 min preincubation prior to addition of RM was omitted. Times of incubation are in the figure legends. The RM from each cell type were added to a final concentration of ~8 A280 units/ml. Where indicated, 1.0 μl of 260 mM hydrazine or hydroxylamine was added to yield a final concentration of 10 mM. Maximal rates of formation of 23-kDa products were achieved at somewhat lower concentrations of the two reagents, but 10 mM was chosen to ensure saturation. When cotranslational processing is carried out for a short period of time isolated RM contain large amounts of prominiPLAP, the substrate of the putative transamidase, and only small amounts of GPI linked miniPLAP (33Amthauer R. Kodukula K. Brink L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6124-6128Google Scholar). Such RM are considered to be preloaded since on further incubation under suitable conditions prominiPLAP is converted to GPI-linked miniPLAP. Scaled up preparations of preloaded RM were made essentially as described previously(33Amthauer R. Kodukula K. Brink L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6124-6128Google Scholar). Prior to addition of RM the translation mixture (84.0 μl) was incubated for 2 min at 30°C. The RM (16.0 μl) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 18 min at 30°C and then placed on ice for 5 min to stop the reaction. Samples were pooled and 200 μl of reaction mixture were layered over a step gradient consisting of a 100-μl spacer layer (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM TEA, pH 7.5) over a 500-μl cushion of 500 mM sucrose, 50 mM TEA, pH 7.5. Following centrifugation at 267,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C in a TLA 100.2 rotor, the supernatants were removed and the pellets rinsed with 500 μl of the 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM TEA, pH 7.5, buffer. The same buffer was used to resuspend the preloaded RM (200 μl of buffer/600 μl of starting material). RM preloaded for 60 min were prepared in the same manner except that after pelleting they were resuspended in half of their original volume. Under these conditions the GPI-linked form is the major miniPLAP product. Preloaded RM (12.5 μl) were diluted with an equal volume of buffer containing 20 mM creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphate kinase, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 160 mM potassium acetate, 8 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, and bestatin) 4 μg/ml each. Hydrazine, hydroxylamine, or water were added (1 μl) prior to incubation at 30°C for the time indicated. PI-PLC cleaves the GPI anchor between the phosphate group of phosphatidylinositol and the hydrophobic diacylglycerol moiety. PI-PLC treatment of PLAP was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl containing 150 pmol of PLAP, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 units of PI-PLC (34Sundler R. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4175-4179Google Scholar). For [3H]myristyl VSG, 0.5 μg of protein (~5000 counts/min) was treated with 17 units of PI-PLC in a final volume of 25 μl of the same buffer. Samples were incubated for 2.5 h at 30°C. Treatment with hydrazine or hydroxylamine (100 mM) was carried out under the same conditions. Because of its GPI moiety PLAP is a fairly hydrophobic protein and under certain conditions much of it can be extracted from an aqueous into an organic phase. To determine whether GPI had been cleaved by any of the procedures that were used, phase separations were performed as described by Bordier(35Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar). Triton X-114 was the organic phase and 0.15 M NaCl the aqueous phase. Following separation of the two phases, the aqueous layer was removed, and an aliquot was immediately assayed for PLAP enzyme activity using the method of McComb and Bowers(36McComb R.B. Bowers Jr., G.N. Clin. Chem. 1972; 18: 97-104Google Scholar). Any lipid material cleaved from [3H]myristyl VSG following various treatments in 25 μl was extracted into 500 μl of water-saturated butanol by vortexing vigorously for 1 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2.5 min, and a 400-μl aliquot of the butanol was removed for measurement of radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Samples were diluted with an equal volume of 10% SDS, 8%β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) and boiled for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, an equal volume of water was added, and aliquots were removed for immunoprecipitation with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal IgG (38Bailey C.A. Gerber L. Howard A.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 22-26Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE(26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid containing 45% methanol, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. Results were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Background radiation was subtracted using the object average function of ImageQuant version 4.1 (Molecular Dynamics). For calibration purposes, [35S]methionine-labeled miniPLAP-Δ179 (free miniPLAP) was expressed using the corresponding mRNA (21Kodukula K. Cines D. Amthauer R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1350-1353Google Scholar) in the cotranslational system. Aliquots of immunoprecipitated protein containing increasing amounts of radioactivity were subjected to SDS-PAGE, then monitored, and quantified on the PhosphorImager. Linearity was shown over the entire range of density obtained in all experiments. Data in the figures are based on duplicate samples from a single experiment. In each case, similar values were obtained in two or more independent experiments carried out on different days and with different preparations of RM. We have used two types of experimental conditions to study GPI addition in cell-free systems, cotranslational and post-translational. In the latter the translational elements are separated from the RM after a defined period of translation(33Amthauer R. Kodukula K. Brink L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6124-6128Google Scholar). We refer to these as preloaded RM. During short periods of incubation, RM from HeLa cells can be preloaded so that they contain an appreciable amount of substrate, prominiPLAP, but little mature GPI-linked or free miniPLAP. The post-translational system was chosen for initial studies because we felt that it provided a more direct study of COOH-terminal processing and were concerned that hydrazine and hydroxylamine might interfere with translation in our cotranslational system. What we were looking for was conversion of prominiPLAP to either the hydrazide or hydroxamate of miniPLAP. Since the latter substituents are fairly small (31 and 32 Da, respectively), the miniPLAP derivatives would be expected to migrate with free mature miniPLAP on SDS-PAGE. Initial studies were carried out with HeLa RM preloaded for 20 min. Surprisingly, when these were incubated further, the amount of GPI-linked miniPLAP (24.7 kDa) initially present in the preloaded RM was reduced accompanied by an even larger increase in 23-kDa product(s) (data not shown). This unexpected finding could be explained by an exchange in which the GPI anchor was removed from miniPLAP and the corresponding hydrazide or hydroxamate formed. The following experiments were carried out to verify this. The unexpected observation that both hydrazine and hydroxylamine could apparently cleave the GPI moiety from mature GPI-linked miniPLAP in preloaded RM was further investigated using HeLa RM that were preloaded for 60 min rather than the usual 20 min. The longer than usual preloading time was to increase the amount of mature GPI-linked protein prior to addition of the nucleophilic agents. Under those conditions, about 60% of the total amount of all forms of miniPLAP in the preloaded RM was present as the mature GPI-linked form (Fig. 2, lanes A and B). There was also a small amount of ~23-kDa material as free miniPLAP. On further incubation for 30 min, there was no additional processing (Fig. 2, lanes C and D). However, when incubations were carried out in the presence of hydrazine or hydroxylamine for the additional 30 min the amount of GPI-linked miniPLAP decreased by almost 50% accompanied by an increase in 23-kDa product(s), presumably representing the corresponding hydrazide or hydroxamate of miniPLAP (Fig. 2, lanes E and G). When the RM were heated prior to addition of the nucleophilic reagents conversion to a 23-kDa product was markedly diminished (Fig. 2, lanes F and H), strongly suggesting that the reaction was enzyme catalyzed. The following experiments were carried out to rule out the possibility of chemical cleavage of GPI from the protein by the two nucleophilic agents. To demonstrate further that the cleavage of GPI-linked proteins by hydrazine and hydroxylamine is catalyzed by an enzyme resident in functional RM and not simply through chemical cleavage, we treated two isolated GPI-linked proteins, PLAP and VSG with either hydrazine, hydroxylamine, or PI-PLC. The latter, which is known to cleave diacylglycerol from the GPI moiety(14Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Google Scholar), served as a positive control. Following each treatment, reaction mixtures were subjected to partitioning between Triton X-114 and 0.015 M NaCl to detect cleavage of a hydrophobic moiety. In the case of untreated PLAP, ~20% of the enzyme activity appeared in the aqueous phase after partitioning between detergent and the aqueous phase (Fig. 3). This is in accord with previous reports(32Kodukula K. Cines D. Amthauer R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1350-1353Google Scholar, 39Low M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 427-454Google Scholar). Removal of the lipid moiety of GPI from PLAP by treatment with PI-PLC reversed the pattern of distribution, ~80% now remaining in the aqueous phase. However, when PLAP was treated with either hydrazine or hydroxylamine there was no change in its distribution (~20% remaining in the aqueous phase) indicating that the GPI anchor had not been cleaved from the protein by either of the nucleophilic agents. To investigate the effects of hydrazine and hydroxylamine on another GPI protein, VSG, the glycolipoprotein, labeled with tritium in its myristic acid residues, was treated with either of the two nucleophiles or with PI-PLC. It is known that diacylglycerol, produced by treatment of VSG with PI-PLC and free GPI that may be formed, are extractable into butanol, whereas VSG is not(40Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Brodbeck U. Bordier C. Post-translational Modification of Proteins by Lipids. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 9-15Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4only 3% of the radioactivity of untreated VSG was extracted. After PI-PLC treatment 97% of the radioactivity was extracted by butanol. In contrast, on treatment of VSG with hydrazine or hydroxylamine the radioactivity extractable by butanol was again only about 3%. As with PLAP, the nucleophilic agents, by themselves, did not cleave the GPI moiety from VSG. It should be noted that concentrations of the nucleophiles at least 10 times higher were used here than in the studies with RM. These findings are further evidence that the conversion of GPI miniPLAP (24.7 kDa) to a 23-kDa moiety in RM in the presence of 10 mM hydrazine or hydroxylamine at neutral pH and 30°C is not due to chemical cleavage but is enzymatically catalyzed. Our original goal was to demonstrate an interaction of prominiPLAP with the nucleophilic agents that would yield a product of essentially the same mass as free mature miniPLAP. However, in RM from HeLa cells the relatively large amounts of free miniPLAP formed under preloading conditions (Fig. 2) and the contribution of 23-kDa material produced by the enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of GPI-linked miniPLAP by the nucleophilic agents, presumably the corresponding hydrazide or hydroxamate of miniPLAP, obscured any contribution of 23-kDa product(s) that might arise from a direct interaction of the nucleophiles with prominiPLAP. Nevertheless, we consistently observed 30-40% increases in the total amount of mature miniPLAP species (24.7 kDa plus 23 kDa) in the presence of the nucleophiles, all in the 23-kDa product(s) suggesting that some of the 23-kDa material arose by direct interaction of the nucleophilic agents with prominiPLAP (27 kDa). Cotranslational experiments with RM from various cells were carried out to explore this further. For the reasons stated above, experiments with preloaded RM from HeLa cells only suggested that both hydrazine and hydroxylamine could react with an activated transamidase-prominiPLAP intermediate to cleave the signal peptide and yield the corresponding hydrazide or hydroxamate of miniPLAP. In spite of the possibility that the nucleophilic agents would interfere with translation, we elected to test them in the cotranslational system. Hydroxylamine did interfere with translation and studies with it were abandoned. However, hydrazine up to 10 mM was without effect on translation. All further experiments were, therefore, carried out in the presence of 10 mM hydrazine. It should be noted that this concentration is only one-tenth of that used in the treatment of isolated PLAP or VSG in the absence of RM. Cotranslational processing by RM from HeLa cells in the presence of hydrazine caused a reproducible (~30%) increase in the total amount of the mature forms of miniPLAP, (24.7 and 23 kDa) (Fig. 5, lanes A and B). Again such an increase (all in the 23 kDa species) is consistent with the formation of some miniPLAP hydrazide directly from prominiPLAP. We therefore turned to RM from GPI-deficient Ltk- and M31/25-C1 cells because of their limited ability to produce GPI-linked proteins while producing large amounts of the precursor prominiPLAP. Such RM also produce much less free mature miniPLAP for reasons stated previously (26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar). If hydrazine could act as an effective acceptor for an enzyme activated ω carbonyl intermediate, its addition to the cotranslational system should increase the amount of 23-kDa product(s) processed by the RM. As shown in Fig. 5, cotranslational processing of miniPLAP mRNA in the presence of hydrazine resulted in a ~200% increase in the total amount of mature products in Ltk- RM (lanes C and D) and a ~110% increase in C1 RM (lanes E and F). Most importantly, in each case, all of the increase was in the 23-kDa product(s), consistent with the formation of the hydrazide of miniPLAP. The studies above were all carried out with ωSer miniPLAP mRNA. While prominiPLAP with serine at the ω site is by far the best precursor for GPI addition(41Kodukula K. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Tamburrini M. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4464-4470Google Scholar), it also yields the largest amount of free mature miniPLAP, presumably because the putative ω carbonyl form of serine reacts to an inordinate extent with water compared to other amino acids at that site(26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar). To minimize the amount of free mature miniPLAP formed due to hydrolysis of an intermediate, we utilized ωGly miniPLAP mRNA. As shown in Fig. 5(lane G), the proportion of prominiPLAP converted to mature GPI-linked miniPLAP (24.7 kDa) in HeLa RM was markedly reduced and, as we expected(26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar), smaller amounts of the hydrolysis product (23 kDa) appeared. Addition of hydrazine (lane H) during cotranslational processing by HeLa RM increased the amount of 23-kDa product(s) with a small increase in total products (24.7 and 23 kDa). Again we found it necessary to use RM from the mutant cells Ltk- and M31/25-C1 to minimize the production of GPI-linked proteins. The findings clearly indicate that in the presence of hydrazine, processing to mature products is increased; 114% for Ltk- RM (Fig. 5, lanes I and J) and 44% for RM from M31/25-C1 cells (lanes K and L). Furthermore, in each case all the increase was in a product that migrated with a mass of 23 kDa. This is again consistent with the formation of the hydrazide of mature miniPLAP concomitant with cleavage of the signal peptide. Observations similar to the ones with glycine were also obtained with constructs containing aspartic acid, alanine, and cysteine at their ω sites (data not shown). All the above experiments show convincingly that both hydrazine and hydroxylamine catalyze the formation of 23-kDa product(s) in amounts greatly in excess of the GPI-linked miniPLAP formed in the absence of the nucleophiles. However, they do not entirely rule out the possibility of GPI-linked miniPLAP being an obligatory intermediate in the formation of 23-kDa product(s). To investigate this further, studies with preloaded RM from GPI-deficient Ltk- cells were carried out. As shown in Fig. 6(lane A), the preloaded RM contained small amounts of GPI-linked miniPLAP and a somewhat larger amount of 23-kDa product(s). On further incubation of the preloaded RM, there was a gradual increase in free miniPLAP (23 kDa) reaching maximal values by 60 min (lane B). When incubation was carried out in the presence of the nucleophilic agents there were also gradual increases in 23-kDa product(s) with essentially no change in the amount of GPI-linked miniPLAP. Again maximal values were attained by about 60 min (lanes D and F). Heated RM were totally inactive. In fact, with hydrazine and hydroxylamine the amounts of 23-kDa product(s) formed were far greater than the total of 24.7- and 23-kDa products originally present in the preloaded RM. This could only have arisen by direct conversion from prominiPLAP. While the overall biosynthetic pathway of GPI proteins has been deduced and has been demonstrated in cell-free systems, one of the key components of the overall reaction, the enzyme(s) that catalyzes condensation of the ethanolamine of GPI with the COOH at the ω site of a proprotein along with the elimination of a signal peptide remains elusive. In fact, evidence that the condensing enzyme is a transamidase is still only indirect. Ferguson and Williams (14Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Google Scholar) concluded that the reaction is so rapid that condensation and signal peptide elimination must be concomitant reactions as would be catalyzed by a transamidase. Mayor et al.(42Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 61-71Google Scholar) have shown that membrane fractions from trypanosomes incorporate GPI into VSG (i.e. condense the ethanolamine of GPI with the ω carboxyl of pro-VSG) in the absence of an energy source. Production of an amide or a peptide bond requires energy unless it is catalyzed by a transamidase or transpeptidase. Amthauer et al.(33Amthauer R. Kodukula K. Brink L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6124-6128Google Scholar) showed that while ATP increased conversion of prominiPLAP to GPI-linked miniPLAP in RM, the energy was required to release the chaperonin BiP and not for formation of the amide bond of the GPI protein. More recently, Maxwell et al.(26Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Google Scholar) demonstrated that during the cell-free processing of prominiPLAP in RM from GPI-deficient cells, while the major product was GPI linked, as much as 40% was cleaved at the correct ω site, but with the addition of the elements of water instead of GPI. Evidence was presented that the latter product arose through a competition of water, an abundant nucleophile, with the ethanolamine of GPI, for condensation with an active carbonyl moiety at the ω site of prominiPLAP. Activation of a carboxyl group in the absence of an energy source so that it can condense with an appropriate nucleophile is the hallmark of a transamidase. The present studies with hydrazine and hydroxylamine give further credence to the transamidase nature of the condensing enzyme. Nevertheless, these experiments, too, are not as conclusive as they could be because the amounts of product formed were too small (~10-100 fmol) to permit chemical identification. There is a colorimetric assay for hydroxamates(43Wellner V.P. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 872-879Google Scholar), but it requires far greater amounts of material than were formed in these studies. Another factor that makes clear interpretation difficult is that the reaction products of the nucleophiles with prominiPLAP, the corresponding hydrazide or hydroxamate of miniPLAP, are of about the same size as free miniPLAP, 23 kDa. The latter, which is formed by the reaction of prominiPLAP with water, always appears as a side product during the processing of prominiPLAP. It would, therefore, be expected to comigrate with any hydrazide or hydroxamate of miniPLAP that was formed. At present we can only surmise that the 23-kDa products formed in the presence of the nucleophilic agents are the corresponding hydrazides or hydroxamates. On the positive side, hydrazine, in the cotranslational system, increased the amount of 23-kDa product(s) 2-3-fold when added to RM from GPI deficient Ltk- and M31/25-C1 cells. These large increases did not occur when the RM were heated prior to treatment with hydrazine or when incubations were carried out at 4°C. In addition, reaction with hydrazine or hydroxylamine was found to be concentration- and time-dependent. All of the above are clear indicators of enzyme catalysis. The findings with preloaded GPI-deficient RM (Fig. 6) are most cogent. They show that GPI-linked miniPLAP is not an intermediate in the conversion of prominiPLAP to 23-kDa product(s) in the presence of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. There remains the remote possibility that for some reason GPI-linked miniPLAP (24.7 kDa) is formed but does not accumulate in Ltk- RM as it does in RM of cells that produce normal amounts of GPI. The finding that both hydrazine and hydroxylamine can convert preformed GPI miniPLAP (24.7 kDa) to 23-kDa product(s) in the presence of RM was at first disturbing. However, this reaction too is enzyme catalyzed since heated or disaggregated RM were inactive. Furthermore, hydroxylamine and hydrazine, at concentrations far higher than were used in the experiments with RM, did not cleave GPI from two isolated GPI proteins, PLAP and VSG. In addition, GPI-linked miniPLAP, isolated from HeLa RM that had been detergent extracted and heated, was not cleaved by the nucleophilic agents (data not shown). The best explanation for a catalytic conversion of GPI-miniPLAP to the putative hydrazide or hydroxamate with the elimination of GPI is the following. In our in vitro system, at least, the GPI protein remains in contact with the transamidase. As in prominiPLAP, the ω carboxyl of GPI-miniPLAP could then be activated to a carbonyl moiety which in turn could be attacked by potent or more abundant nucleophiles such as hydrazine or hydroxylamine. In the process the GPI moiety would be cleaved and the nucleophile elements added. There are precedents for such an enzymatically catalyzed attack of hydrazine or hydroxylamine on the end product of a transamidation reaction. For example, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGT) normally catalyzes the transfer of a glutamate residue of glutathione to cysteine to form γ-glutamyl-cysteine(27Tate S.S. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3320-3333Google Scholar). The latter, in the presence of γGT and hydrazine or hydroxylamine can be converted to the γ-glutamyl hydrazide or hydroxamate with the release of cysteine. In this case, cysteine in the dipeptide may be considered to be the equivalent of GPI. Another example of a nucleophilic attack of hydrazine on an enzymatic product of a transpeptidase in the presence of the enzyme is provided by glutaminase(28Buchanan J.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1973; 39: 91-183Google Scholar). In accord with the above, the enzyme-catalyzed exchange of hydrazine or hydroxylamine for GPI on mature miniPLAP does not require the addition of ATP or GTP to the preloaded RM and occurs even in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP or GTP (data not shown). The nucleophiles unquestionably cleave the GPI moiety from miniPLAP and apparently form the corresponding hydrazide or hydroxamate. This raises the question whether the 23-kDa material that is formed in the presence of hydrazine or hydroxylamine arises by a direct nucleophilic attack on prominiPLAP as in Fig. 7(c and d), or in two steps with GPI miniPLAP as an intermediate (Fig. 7, a and e or a and f). The large increases in 23-kDa product(s) formed cotranslationally in RM, particularly from Ltk- and M31/25-C1 cells, unquestionably indicate that the reaction with hydrazine by whichever pathway is enzyme catalyzed. Since even in the presence of hydrazine some GPI miniPLAP appears, it is likely that under cotranslational conditions miniPLAP hydrazide (23 kDa) arises via both pathways. However, the findings with preloaded RM from Ltk- cells clearly show that 23-kDa product(s) can also be formed directly from prominiPLAP without GPI miniPLAP appearing as an intermediate (Fig. 7, c and d). Thus, it may be possible to monitor GPI transamidase activity in the absence of GPI, unless, as has been suggested(44Kodukula K. Amthauer R. Cines D. Yeh E.T.H. Brink L. Thomas L.J. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4982-4985Google Scholar), enzymatically active transamidase exists as a GPI•enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1969965954,"Class I major histocompatibility complex heavy chains bind to calnexin before associating with β2-microglobulin (β2m) and peptides. Calnexin has been shown to retain in the endoplasmic reticulum those class I heavy chains which have not assembled properly and, thus, to serve as a quality control mechanism. In addition, calnexin may direct the folding of class I subunits or their subsequent assembly. We asked whether calnexin plays a role in the initial folding of HLA-B∗0702 heavy chains by assessing disulfide bond formation in vivo. Our results show that class I heavy chains form intrachain disulfide bonds very soon after translation, and that calnexin is bound to both reduced and oxidized forms during this process. When a cell-permeable reducing agent, dithiothreitol, was added to cells, disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized heavy chains was substantially blocked, as was their association with calnexin. The reducing agent appeared to affect calnexin directly, since binding was similarly abolished to a subset of proteins which do not contain internal disulfide bonds. Addition of the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine to cells, shown previously to disrupt calnexin binding to ligands, slowed formation of disulfide bonds but did not decrease the amount of assembled heavy chain-β2m complexes that formed. Our data suggest that calnexin can promote disulfide bond formation in class I heavy chains but does not directly facilitate subsequent binding to β2m. Class I major histocompatibility complex heavy chains bind to calnexin before associating with β2-microglobulin (β2m) and peptides. Calnexin has been shown to retain in the endoplasmic reticulum those class I heavy chains which have not assembled properly and, thus, to serve as a quality control mechanism. In addition, calnexin may direct the folding of class I subunits or their subsequent assembly. We asked whether calnexin plays a role in the initial folding of HLA-B∗0702 heavy chains by assessing disulfide bond formation in vivo. Our results show that class I heavy chains form intrachain disulfide bonds very soon after translation, and that calnexin is bound to both reduced and oxidized forms during this process.

The kinetochore is a multifunctional trilaminar structure on the centromere surface believed to be responsible for, at a minimum, microtubule attachment and chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. The composition of this specialized nucleic acid and protein complex remains poorly identified(1Rattner J.B.

Proper chromosome segregation during mitosis depends on the coordinated bipolar assembly of spindle fibers emanating from microtubule organizing centers toward components of the kinetochore. Kinetochore dysfunction is thought to be involved in the genesis of aneuploidy, a form of genomic instability that can lead to tumorigenesis(5Epstein C.J. Ann. Rev. Genetics. 1988; 22: 51-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of kinetochore structure and function is essential to elucidate the mechanism underlying the fidelity of chromosome movement. A number of centromere/kinetochore proteins have been identified using antibodies obtained from the sera of patients with autoimmune diseases or derived by using chromosomal scaffolds as immunogens. These proteins can be broadly classified into two groups.

Accurate targeting to the centromere/kinetochore region and the exact function(s) of these proteins are still being investigated. To date, the N-terminal 28-amino acid region of CENP-B, which binds centromeric DNA, is the only identified centromeric targeting signal(13Pluta A.F. Saitoh N. Goldberg I. Earnshaw W.C. J.

A 350-kDa, facultative kinetochore protein named mitosin has recently been discovered by its association with retinoblastoma protein. 2Zhu, X., Mancini, M.

Mitosin is a nuclear phosphoprotein of 3,113 amino acid residues and does not exhibit significant homology to any known proteins in GenBank™. The expression of mitosin is cell cycle-dependent.2 Mitosin is undetectable during most of G1 and appears in a uniform, fine speckled pattern throughout the nucleus just prior to S but is absent in nucleoli. During progression into M phase, the nuclear localization of mitosin is dramatically reorganized into paired dots at the kinetochore and the spindle apparatus and to the midbody in telophase just prior to its complete disappearance at the end of telophase. The dynamic spatial reorganization of mitosin coincides with its temporal phosphorylation pattern; mitosin is underphosphorylated in interphase and maximally phosphorylated during mitosis. Identification of the role played by mitosin during cell division was explored through examination of potential dominant-negative effects on cell cycle progression by transiently over-expressing a series of deletion mutants.2 Overexpression of N-terminal deletion mutants, which retain their ability to locate within the nucleus, result in accumulation of cells mainly in G2/M phase.2 In order to understand the mechanism by which mitosin influences mitotic progression, we have extended our characterization of its biochemical and biological properties. In this paper, we have further defined that mitosin specifically localizes heterogeneously on the coronal surface of the outer kinetochore plate by electron microscopy. Through analyses of a series of deletion forms of mitosin, essential motifs required for nuclear localization and centromere/kinetochore targeting have been mapped to its C terminus. This region, containing three leucine heptads, may be a required structural motif for homodimerization and heterodimerization with a candidate mitosin-associated protein. For studies in mammalian cells, DNA fragments of mitosin were cloned into pCEP4FLAG, a mammalian expression plasmid derived from pCEP4 (Invitrogen) to express FLAG-tagged fusion proteins.2 All subsequent constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing analysis to ensure the correct reading frames and modification. To identify the nuclear targeting signal in mitosin, a series of constructs were engineered (see Fig. 1). The construction of pCF-10 (construct A; aa 632-3,113) and pCF-10Xh (construct E; aa 1,582-3,113) was described previously.2 Construct B (containing aa 632-2,513) was made by removing the AccI-HindIII fragment (~5.7 kb) from construct A. Construct C (pCF-10RV; aa 632-1,767) was constructed by removing the EcoRV-HindIII fragment (~4.3 kb) from pCF-10 (construct A). For the construction of construct EΔL, (aa 2,927-3,113; containing basic regions I and II; see Fig. 1), one of the two lysine residues at the end of the FLAG tag (which may itself resemble the bipartite nuclear targeting motif KKLARASGKRQR) (15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) was deleted by treatment with mung bean nuclease after HindIII cleavage, and the subsequent vector was ligated with a 10-base BamHI linker (New England BioLabs) to maintain the correct reading frame. To construct EΔC1 (aa 1,582-2,947; containing basic regions I and II), the BspMI site at nucleotide 8,916 of mitosin cDNA in construct E was destroyed by filling in with Klenow enzyme to create a new stop codon after five additional residues, ARELF. Construct EΔC2 (aa 1,582-3,037; basic regions I, II, and III) was made by self-ligation after removal of the PflMI-HindIII fragment (~0.48 kb) from construct E. Construct EΔRvB was made by deleting the EcoRV-BspMI fragment (~3.5 kb; 1,767-2,945; with only basic region III) from construct E, followed by Klenow fill in and religation. To define the centromere/kinetochore targeting region of mitosin, the series of deletion mutants was expanded. Construct EΔN (aa 2,094-3,113) was made by deleting the XhoI-SfiI fragment (~1.5 kb) from construct E and then treating the remaining fragment with mung bean nuclease before religation. Construct EΔR (aa 1,582-3,113, and deleted from aa 2,178 to 2,359) was made by self-ligation of the vector after removing the EcoRI fragment (~0.5 kb) from construct E. EΔG (aa 2,488-3,113) was created by cloning the StuI-BglII fragment (~2.0 kb) into pCEP4F cleaved by NheI (fill in with Klenow) and BamHI. Construct EΔZ (aa 1,582-3,113, and deleted from aa 2,489-2,901) was constructed by deleting the EcoNI fragment (~1.2 kb) from construct E and filling in the resulting vector with Klenow before religation. EΔNB was made by self-ligation of the vector after removing the SstI fragment (aa 2,666-2,756). Mouse kidney CV1 cells were transfected with 20 μg of the expression plasmid by the calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with cold methanol and then immunostained by using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) and anti-mitosin antibodies (α10C), and then they were analyzed as described previously.2 Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma). Cells of interest were photographed using Ektachrome P1600 film. Procedures for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were described previously.2 Mitotic HeLa cells were shaken from the flask and cytocentrifuged onto plastic coverslips. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 min, cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The coverslips were treated with NaBH4 (1 mg/ml) for 15 min and then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatin, and 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min to reduce the nonspecific background. Samples were incubated with antibody 14C10 (1:40) for 45 min at 30°C, followed by a thorough wash, and then incubated with 1.4 nm of gold-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Nanoprobes, Inc.) (1:25) at 30°C for 1 h. The samples were postfixed with 3% glutaraldehyde after washing and were then silver-enhanced for 3 min (Nanoprobes, Inc.). The samples were then embedded with Spurr (Polysciences Inc.) sectioned, and stained according to the standard electron microscopy procedure and observed with a Philips 410 electron microscope. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for proteins that potentially associate with mitosin (16Durfee T. Beecher K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Two sets of hybrid plasmids were constructed; one plasmid named pAS1-E/StuI-BglII contains the DNA sequence coding for the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor GAL4 (amino acid residues 1-147), fused in-frame with the sequence for the C-terminal region of mitosin containing centromere/kinetochore-targeting region, aa 2,487-3,113. A second plasmid, pSE1107L, contains the DNA sequence for GAL4 activation domain II (amino acid residues 768-881) fused to a cDNA library prepared from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral lymphocytes. Both plasmids (pAS1-E/StuI-BglII and pSE1107L) were used to transform the yeast strain Y153, which has been constructed to provide a dual selection system (His → His+ and the presence of β-galactosidase activity) to efficiently screen cDNA expression library for clones interacting with a protein of interest. After selection, transformants were first screened for His+ prototrophy and then β-galactosidase activity by using a filter lifting assay. Fifty His+ colonies turned out to be blue within 12 h. His+ blue colonies considered positive in the initial screen were rescreened for verification of binding. Colonies with the strongest qualitative binding were first analyzed through DNA sequencing. To test further whether the phenotype observed in the original screen was reproducible and dependent upon mitosin, library-derived plasmids were selectively recovered by virtue of the yeast LEU2 gene carried on those plasmids to complement a leuB6 mutation present in the E. coli strain JA226. Isolated plasmids were used to transform Y153 either alone or with the plasmid pAS1-E/StuI-BglII. The transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by using the filter lift method. The yeast two-hybrid system was also used to define the regions of the C terminus of mitosin responsible for dimerization. Three deletion constructs were created: 1) pAS1-E/StuI-MscI (aa 2,487-2,925, which contains three leucine heptad repeats); 2) pAS1-EΔZ/StuI-BglII, in which these three leucine heptad repeats (aa 2,487-2,901) were deleted; and 3) pAS-1-EΔNB/StuI-BglII, where the space between aa 2,666 and 2,756 was deleted. Yeast strain Y153 was cotransformed with one of the above plasmids and pSE1107-E/BglII, which contains the C terminus of mitosin (aa 2,490-3,113). Transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity, first qualitatively via the filter lift method and then quantitatively by chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) measurement(16Durfee T. Beecher K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Mitosin is a cell cycle-dependent nuclear protein.2 From the deduced primary structure, a series of basic amino acid clusters in the C terminus of mitosin similar to the bipartite nuclear targeting sequence in Xenopus proteins was found(15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). In order to analyze whether the nuclear targeting signal of mitosin is carried by these clusters, a series of epitope-tagged deletion mutants were constructed (summarized in Fig. 1), and their corresponding nuclear location in transiently transfected CV1 cells was monitored by immunofluorescence using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2). As with the positive control (a near full-length construct A) shown in Fig. 2, panels1-1', the N-terminal truncated mitosin (construct E) also localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2, panels4-4'), whereas the two C-terminal truncated proteins (constructs B and C) remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, panels2-2' and 3-3', respectively). These results are consistent with the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) found at the C-terminal region of mitosin. To further delineate the mitosin NLS, several additional deletion mutants were examined. In the mutant EΔL, the first basic KR (basic region I) important for a bipartite motif was deleted. As shown in Fig. 2, panels5-5', the nuclear localization remained unchanged. EΔC1, which contains basic regions I and II, was constructed to test if the putative bipartite motif KRLSSGQNKASFKRQRS (15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) can function as a minimal NLS for mitosin. When transfected into CV1 cells, the expressed EΔC1 protein was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 2, panels6-6'). To test if basic region III (KKSKK), which is 20 amino acid residues away from the bipartite motif, contributed to nuclear localization, EΔC2, containing basic regions I, II, and III was created, and the expressed protein was predominantly nuclear (Fig. 2, panels7-7'). Basic region III alone, however, was not sufficient for nuclear targeting since EΔRvB, in which basic regions I and II were removed, localized only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, panels8-8'). These data suggest that basic regions II and III work collectively as an NLS, not the commonly found bipartite sequence of regions I and II. To determine the fine distribution of mitosin at the centromere/kinetochore structure, a higher resolution image of this region was analyzed by mitosin-labeled centromeres using immunogold microscopy. Mitosin is found in a unique, heterogeneous distribution on the coronal surface of the outer kinetochore plate (Fig. 3). Although consideration for the preservation of mitosin antigenicity precludes optimal ultrastructure, the organization of gold label indicates that mitosin is not present at the kinetochore center, even though microtubules attach throughout the kinetochore. This result further demonstrates that mitosin is a kinetochore protein and is consistent with the previous observations derived from the immunostaining method.2 In order to identify the centromere/kinetochore targeting region of mitosin, a series of FLAG-tagged deletion mutants was constructed (Fig. 4). All these constructs synthesized their corresponding proteins after transfection into CV1 cells by immunoblotting analysis (data not shown). Their corresponding localizations were then examined by immunofluorescence as described previously.2 We first tested the specificity of both antibodies (anti-FLAG and anti-mitosin α10C) used for indirect immunofluorescence staining. In untransfected CV1 nuclei of mitotic cells (Fig. 5, panels1 and 2), α10C labeled endogenous mitosin at the centromere/kinetochore, whereas anti-FLAG antibody did not, indicating that labeling with anti-FLAG was due to the cellular production of FLAG fusion proteins. The antigenic epitope for α10C has been previously mapped to the C terminus of mitosin.2 In cells expressing the C-terminal truncated fusion protein C, the endogenous protein was shown to be associated with the centromere/kinetochore (Fig. 5, panels4 and 5); in contrast, the FLAG label was only in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal truncated mutant E localized to the centromere/kinetochore, suggesting the centromeric targeting domain of mitosin was located within the C terminus. Deletion of either the N terminus (EΔN; Fig. 5, panels7-8) or one inverted repeat (EΔR; data not shown), did not significantly affect centromere/kinetochore localization of the FLAG fusion proteins. Further deletion of the N terminus (EΔG) did not abolish centromeric targeting (data not shown). When the region including amino acid residues 2,488-2,902 was deleted from E to create EΔZ, the centromere/kinetochore targeting of the fusion protein was completely abolished (Fig. 6and (11Casiano C.A. Landberg G. Ochs R. Tan E.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1045-1056PubMed Google Scholar)); however, the location of endogenous mitosin on the centromere/kinetochore was not affected (Fig. 5and (11Casiano C.A. Landberg G. Ochs R. Tan E.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1045-1056PubMed Google Scholar)). Deletion of the space region between aa 2,666 and 2,756 creating a mutant EΔNB did not affect the centromere localization (Fig. 5). As summarized in Fig. 4, the region of mitosin important for centromere/kinetochore targeting is confined to a region of 414 amino acid residues (aa 2,487-2,901) containing three leucine heptad repeats located at amino acids 2,557-2,592, 2,797-2,818, and 2,866-2,887, respectively. The C terminus of mitosin is required for nuclear localization and centromere/kinetochore targeting. To determine whether this region is mechanistically required for association with other proteins that could influence its cellular targeting, interacting proteins were isolated by screening a λACT human lymphocyte cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid method(16Durfee T. Beecher K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Fifty clones were obtained from the initial screen (listed in Table 1). The eight clones with the highest qualitative binding activity were characterized by DNA sequencing. Three clones were found to be identical with the C terminus (amino acid residues 2,490-3,113) of mitosin. Also, four clones were identified as being related to immunoglobulin genes. The remaining clone contains a novel gene sequence. The results indicate that mitosin can interact with itself and other proteins through its C terminus. This observation is consistent with the idea that different fusion protein constructs of the mitosin C terminus can interact with themselves in in vitro binding assays (data not shown). Leucine heptad repeats are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions and are found three times in the mitosin C terminus(17Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether these leucine heptads play a role in homodimerization of mitosin or heterodimerization with the mitosin-associated candidate gene product (pSE1107-5), three deletion constructs were created: 1) pAS1-E/StuI-MscI (which contained all three leucine heptad repeats), 2) pAS1-EΔZ/StuI-BglII (in which the three leucine heptad repeats were deleted), and 3) pAS1-EΔNB/StuI-BglII (in which a space between the first and second leucine repeats is deleted). These constructs were then used to measure the contribution of the leucine heptads for dimerization of mitosin. As shown in Fig. 6, removal of the region containing the leucine heptad repeats abolishes the homodimerization and heterodimerization capacity of the C terminus. In order to understand the cell cycle dynamics of mitosin localization, we have used deletion mutagenesis and subsequent transient expression of epitope-tagged proteins to identify functional subdomains responsible for nuclear and centromere/kinetochore targeting. From the deduced amino acid sequence of mitosin, this method reveals a highly complex molecular structure that includes predominant α-helical domains, multiple leucine heptad repeats, a large inverted repeat, and a putative bipartite NLS.2 Our data show that the NLS of mitosin is composed of two interdependent basic clusters (aa 2,916-2,958; basic regions II and III) separated by an intervening 20 amino acids. The sequence is a variant of the bipartite nuclear targeting signal proposed by Dingwall(15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The interdependence of the two clusters in the mitosin NLS is demonstrated by the finding that deletion of either cluster abolishes nuclear targeting of mitosin. Immunoelectron microscopy performed upon detergent-extracted cells provides clear evidence that mitosin is differentially located on the coronal surface of the outer plate of kinetochores. The primary functions currently ascribed to the kinetochore are microtubule attachment and motor activity. The outer plate of the kinetochore is believed to provide binding sites for microtubules(3Brinkley B.R. Ouspenski I. Zinkowski R.P. Trends. Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 15-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A facultative kinetochore protein, CENP-E, is a putative motor protein that interacts with microtubules presuming either through its N-terminal kinasin domain (18Liao H. Li G. Yen T.J. Science. 1994; 265: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or the C-terminal domain (~100 residues), which is a basic (pI ~9) and proline-rich (~13%) region similar to those of τ and MAP2(19Lewis S.A. Wang D. Cowan N.J. Science. 1988; 242: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the extreme C terminus of mitosin is also basic (pI ~10) and proline-rich (~10%); however, the amino acid sequences of these structurally similar regions are not significantly homologous. Inasmuch as electron microscopic examination of the outer kinetochore surface reveals a homogeneous array of microtubules, an electron dense outer plate, and an amorphous corona, our finding of a discrete labeling pattern of mitosin in this structure suggest a possible role in guiding or stabilizing microtubules to the kinetochore. As mitosin does not contain known tubulin binding domains (such as kinesin family homology), demonstration of a mitosin-tubulin interaction, perhaps through its proline-rich and basic C terminus, will be required to support this hypothesis. The mechanism underlying the specific and novel distribution of mitosin to the coronal surface of the kinetochore outer plate is unknown. Mapping of deletion mutants of epitope-tagged mitosin suggested that the C-terminal 413 amino acids containing the three leucine heptad repeats is important for its centromere/kinetochore targeting. At present, the only other protein whose centromere targeting is well characterized is CENP-B, and it is defined as the first 28 amino acids of the N terminus(13Pluta A.F. Saitoh N. Goldberg I. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This region displays the “CENP-B box”-specific DNA binding activity, explaining (in part, if not entirely) how CENP-B may specifically target the interphase pre-kinetochore and the mature centromere. As might be expected, when amino acid sequence is compared with the inner centromere/kinetochore proteins CENP-B (20Cooke C.A. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or CENP-C(21Saitoh H. Tomkiel J.E. Cooke C.A. Ratrie H.R. Maurer M. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Cell. 1992; 170: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the essential outer kinetochore-targeting regions of mitosin show no sequence homology. It is noteworthy, however, that targeting of the epitope-tagged mitosin mutants is observed only when the constructs contain a functional NLS; cytoplasmic contructs that contain the C-terminal leucine heptad repeats are not sufficient for centromere/kinetochore localization such as in the case of EΔC1. That mitosin is exclusively nuclear during interphase may suggest that proper centromere/kinetochore targeting requires nucleus-dependent processing, or the targeting domain can only function during a specific temporal period during genesis of the mature kinetochore. It is probable that cellular proteins interacting with mitosin are involved in its ability to target kinetochore structures. Therefore, a C-terminal fragment of mitosin (2,488-3,113) was used to screen a λACT human lymphocyte cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method(16Durfee T. Beecher K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Three of the eight clones that survived the original screening were virtually identical to the mitosin C terminus itself (aa 2,490-3,113). This result strongly supports the idea that the C terminus can bind to itself. The functional significance of the self-association is unclear at present but does suggest that centromere/kinetochore targeting and homodimerization may possibly be coupled. Protein-protein interactions via leucine heptads (17Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) in the C terminus may regulate the signaling for kinetochore localization by conveying a conformational change within mitosin. Alternatively, homodimerization may create a new molecular surface that serves as the targeting signal, similar to dimerization domains between transcription factors creating DNA-binding surfaces(14Forrest D. Curran T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Identification of mitosin-associated proteins that also localize to the centromere/kinetochore and bind mitosin homodimers would support this possibility. Two hybrid screening also identified several other putative mitosin-binding proteins. One novel clone, pSE1107-5, was also shown to interact with the mitosin C terminus containing the three leucine heptad repeats that are also present in the region essential for centromere/kinetochore targeting. At present whether the protein encoded by pSE1107-5 is centromere/kinetochore-associated remains to be shown. However, its ability to interact with mitosin would be consistent with heterodimerization influencing centromere/kinetochore targeting. The specific cellular targeting properties of mitosin thus far characterized can be assigned to the C-terminal fourth of the protein. Based on its deduced primary amino acid sequence, a number of leucine heptads are also found in the N terminus;however, functional properties that accompany these structural characteristics remain to be determined. Further characterization of mitosin will be necessary to fully assign function to specific amino acid residues and should provide a mechanistic insight into biological role of mitosin."

https://openalex.org/W1572635906,"The ubiquitous human POU domain protein, Oct-1, and the related B-cell protein, Oct-2, regulate transcription from a variety of eukaryotic genes by binding to a common cis-acting octamer element, 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′. The binding of Oct-1 and Oct-2 to the functionally important lipoprotein lipase (LPL) promoter octamer site was stimulated by the general transcription factor, TFIIB. Comparative analysis of the LPL, histone H2B (H2B), and herpes simplex virus ICPO gene promoter octamer sites revealed that nucleotide sequences within and flanking the octamer sequence determined the degree of TFIIB-mediated stimulation of Oct-1 DNA binding. TFIIB was found to decrease the rate of dissociation of Oct-1 from the LPL octamer site, whereas it increased the rate of association, as well as decreased the rate of dissociation, of Oct-1 from the H2B octamer site. A monoclonal antibody against TFIIB immunoprecipitated a ternary complex containing TFIIB, Oct-1, and the LPL and H2B octamer binding sites. TFIIB did not alter the DNase I footprints generated by Oct-1 on the LPL and H2B promoters. However, Oct-1 prevented TATA-binding protein and TFIIB from footprinting the perfect TATA box sequence located 5′ of the LPL NF-Y binding site. In transfection experiments, transcription from reporters containing the LPL octamer, and either the SV40 or the yeast transcription factor GAL4-dependent enhancers, initiated at a precise position within the octamer sequence. Transcription from reporters containing the H2B octamer and the SV40 enhancer initiated at several positions within and flanking the octamer site, whereas transcription initiated at a precise position within the octamer from reporters with both the H2B octamer and the GAL4-dependent enhancer.

Accurate and efficient transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoters requires the combined action of basal transcription factors and transcription activators. Basal transcription factors, along with RNA polymerase II, form a preinitiation complex over the core promoter DNA region and this assembly process is stimulated by transcription activators (12Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; for review, see Zawel and Reinberg(1993)). Two types of cis-acting motifs, the TATA box located ~25-30 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site, and an initiator element (INR) 1The abbreviations used are: INRinitiator elementCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGSTglutathione S-transferaseLPLlipoprotein lipaseSV40simian virus 40TAFsTBP-associated factorsTBPTATA-binding proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminVLDLvery low density lipoprotein. located at the transcription initiation site, have been identified as the genetic elements that can independently specify the location of the preinitiation complex formation on a promoter (for review, see 6Breathnach R.

The process of functional preinitiation complex formation in vitro on TATA-containing promoters involves the initial binding of TFIID to the TATA box, and subsequent ordered assembly of TFIIB, TFIIF, RNA polymerase II, TFIIE, and TFIIH onto the TATA•TFIID complex (7Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Transcription initiation from INR-containing promoters requires specific interaction of INR binding proteins with the INR sequence, and subsequent assembly of basal transcription factors over the INR element (54Martinez E.

Among the basal transcription factors, TFIID and TFIIB have been studied extensively. TFIID is a multisubunit complex comprising the TATA-binding protein (TBP), and several tightly associated proteins commonly referred to as the TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Interestingly, in a reconstituted in vitro transcription system with purified components, TBP along with TFIIB and RNA polymerase II can initiate transcription in the absence of TAFs (57Parvin J.D.

However, an effective response to activators in such a system requires TAFs and TBP as well as distinct components of the transcription activators called coactivators (55Meisterernst M. Roy A.L.

TAFs associate with distinct activation domains of transcription activators, TFIIB, TBP, or among themselves in the TFIID complex (Chen et al., 1994; 21Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TBP can also interact directly with several transcription activators (77Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). TFIIB, which by itself cannot bind to double-stranded DNA, acts as a bridging factor between DNA-bound TBP, RNA polymerase II, and several different activators (25Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1991; 352: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar; 27Hisatake K. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nature. 1993; 363: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent reports have indicated that TFIIB, in association with RNA polymerase II, functions to select the transcription initiation site (46Li Y. Flanagan P.M. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1994; 263: 805-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, TFIIB has been shown to repress nonspecific transcription initiation (93Wampler S.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TFIIB is required for efficient interaction of TFIID with the INR, but not to the TATA box sequences in vitro (36Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TFIIB has also been shown to interact with transactivation domains of various transcription factors (14Colgan J. Wampler S.

The octamer sequence motif, 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′ (or its complement 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′), the GC box, and the CCAAT box sequence are the three most common elements found close to the TATA box/INR of cell type-specific and ubiquitously expressed genes. Several transcription factors are known to interact with the octamer and the CCAAT box. For example, the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1, and lymphoid-enriched transcription factor Oct-2, bind to the octamer sequence, whereas CTF/NF1, C/EBP, and NF-Y bind to the CCAAT box sequence (56Muller M.M.

Sp1 is the most common factor that interacts with the GC box (34Kadonaga J. Jones K. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Specific TAFs which interact with the activation domains of CTF/NF1 and Sp1 have also been identified (20Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oct-1 and Oct-2 belong to the POU family of transcription factors which bind to their target sequences through their bipartite POU DNA-binding domains (Sturm et al., 1988; Scheidereit et al., 1988; Muller et al., 1988). Both proteins contain distinct transcription activation domains, located N-terminal and C-terminal to the POU domain, that are responsible for promoter-specific activity (80Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 81Tanaka M. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6056-6067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 82Tanaka M. Lai J.S. Herr W.

Since Oct-1 is essential for the transcription of both mRNA-type as well as snRNA-type RNA polymerase II promoters, it is suggested that the promoter-specific activation domains of Oct-1 serve in conjunction with specific coactivators to activate gene expression (100Yang J.

Lipoprotein lipase is a hydrolytic enzyme which is synthesized in a number of animal tissues, but functions at the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium. LPL plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism by hydrolyzing triglycerides contained in chylomicron and VLDL particles and providing fatty acids to tissues for storage or combustion. The proximal 730-base pair LPL promoter region upstream of the transcription start site contains several potential binding sites for known transcription factors. They include a putative TATA box at position −27, three octamer sites at positions −580, −186, and −46, two CCAAT boxes at −65 and −506, sequences with partial homology to glucocorticoid response element at −644, a cyclic AMP responsive element at −306, and HNF-3/fork head family transcription factor binding sites at positions −702 and −468 (16Deeb S.S. Peng R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4131-4135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 17Enerback S. Ohlsson B.G. Samuelsson L. Bjursell G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18958-18963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these sites, only the octamer at −46, and the CCAAT box at −65 have been shown to specifically bind the known transcription factors Oct-1 and NF-Y, respectively (Currie and Eckel, 1992; Previato et al., 1991). An element that functions as a silencer of LPL transcription in Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa cells has also been identified recently (85Tanuma Y. Nakabayashi H. Esumi M. Endo H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, the interaction of basal transcription factors and transcription activators with the LPL promoter was investigated. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the octamer motif (position −46 to −39), and the NF-Y CCAAT box (position −65 to −61), but not the putative TATA box (position −27 to −22), are essential for promoter activity. The binding of Oct-1 and Oct-2 to the LPL octamer element was investigated using purified Escherichia coli-derived recombinant proteins. We observed that recombinant Oct-1 and Oct-2 bound to this element only weakly on their own and that binding was stimulated ~12-fold by TFIIB. Comparative analysis of TFIIB stimulation of Oct-1 binding to the LPL octamer versus the histone H2B promoter octamer and the herpes simplex virus ICPO octamer, suggested that the mechanism and the extent of stimulation depends upon nucleotide sequences both within and flanking the octamer. In a transfection assay, the LPL octamer element functioned as an INR element, raising the possibility that like other INR elements, TFIIB may recruit TFIID to the octamer site in vivo and Oct-1 may influence this process by recruiting TFIIB to the octamer site.

Biophys. 1992; 298: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was first cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI site of SK- (Stratagene), isolated subsequently as a BamHI-XhoI fragment and cloned into BamHI-XhoI sites of pBLCAT3 (50Luckow B. Schultz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 105: 5490Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Point mutations in pLPLCATm1 to pLPLCATm5 were created by a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure as described by 49Loh E.Y. Elliott J.F. Cwirla S. Lanier L.L. Davis M.M. Science. 1989; 243: 217-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar using pLPLCAT as a template. In pLPLCATm1, the wild-type sequence 5′-CATAAG-3′ at position −27 to −22 of the LPL promoter was changed to 5′-TATAAA-3′. pLPLCATm2 is similar to pLPLCATm1 except that the sequence, 5′-CATAAGCA-3′, was changed to 5′-GAGACCTG-3′. In pLPLCATm3, the octamer sequence, 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′, at position −46 to −39 was changed to 5′-TGTTCAGA-3′. In pLPLCATm4, the CCAAT box sequence, 5′-GCCAATAGGTGA-3′, at position −66 to −55 was changed to 5′-CTGCAGGAATTC-3′. In pLPLCATm5, the wild-type sequence, 5′-ATTTTATA-3′, at position −74 to −67 was changed to 5′-CAGGTCTC-3′. To generate plasmids containing the SV40 enhancer, the ~198-base pair EcoRI SV40 enhancer fragment derived from pOVEC-S (96Westin G. Gerster T. Muller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1987; 15: 6787-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI site of SK- in both orientations and compatible flanking restriction sites of SK- were used to clone the enhancer into pBLCAT3. For example, to generate the plasmid pS1, the SV40 enhancer was cloned into the BamHI-HindIII site of pBLCAT3, such that the orientation of the SV40 enhancer in relation to the CAT gene was the same as in the SV40 early gene promoter (87Tooze J. Tooze J. DNA Tumor Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981Google Scholar). In pS2, the SV40 enhancer had an orientation identical to the SV40 late gene promoter. The plasmid pS3 contains the SV40 enhancer downstream of the CAT gene-SV40 polyadenylation signal. The GAL4 binding site containing reporter, pG17, was created by two-step plasmid construction. First, a HindIII-EcoRI fragment from 17-mer thymidine kinase-CAT (94Webster N. Jin J.R. Green S. Hollis M. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 52: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the 17-mer GAL4 binding site, a GC box, and the CCAAT box from the thymidine kinase promoter, was cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI site of SK-. Subsequently, a GAL4-binding site containing fragment from SK- was isolated as a BamHI-HindIII fragment, and cloned into the BamHI-HindIII site of pBLCAT3. The synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCAGGTGATGAGGTTTATTTGCATATTTCC-3′ (complementary strand: 5′-GATCGGAAATATGCAAATAAACCTCATCACCT-3′), corresponding to the nucleotides −59 to −33 of the LPL promoter, was cloned into the BglII site of pBLCAT3, pS1, pS2, pS3, and pG17, which gave rise to plasmids pLO+, pLO+S1, pLO+S2, pLO+S3, and pLO+G17, respectively. In these plasmids, the orientation of the inserted oligonucleotide was such that the octamer sequence, 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′, was located in the coding strand, as in the LPL gene. Plasmids pLO-, pLO-S1, pLO-S2, and pLO-G17, are similar to pLO+, pLO+S1, pLO+S2, and pLO+G17, respectively, except that the orientation of the LPL octamer-containing oligonucleotides was reversed. The plasmid pLOm+S1 is similar to pLO+S1 except that the octamer sequence 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′ was changed to 5′-TGTTCAGA-3′. The synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCCAACTCTTCACCTTATTTGCATAAGCGA-3′ (complementary strand: 5′-GATCTCGCTTATGCAAATAAGGTGAAGAGTTG-3′), corresponding to nucleotides −63 to −36 of the H2B promoter (42LaBella F. Sive H.L. Roeder R.G. Heintz N. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 32-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was inserted into the BglII site of pBLCAT3, pS1, pS2, pS3, and pG17, which gave rise to plasmids pHO+, pHO+S1, pHO+S2, pHO+S3, and pHO+G17, respectively. In these plasmids the orientation of the inserted oligonucleotide was such that the octamer sequence 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′ was located in the coding strand, as in the H2B gene. Plasmids pHO-, pHO-S1, pHO-S2, and pHO-G17 are similar to pHO+, pHO+S1, pHO+S2, and pHO+G17, respectively, except that the octamer sequence 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′ was in the coding strand. The plasmid pET15bOct-1 was constructed by blunt-end ligation of the HindIII-BamHI fragment of pBSOct1+ (Strum et al., 1988) into the BamHI site of pET15b (Novagen). OctΔN contains the Oct-1 cDNA sequence from nucleotides 918 to 2525 (amino acids 268 to 743) and was created by two-step plasmid construction. First, the HincII-HindIII fragment of pBSOct1+ was cloned into SK-, Oct-1 sequences were isolated as HincII-BamHI fragment and cloned into the pET15b vector that had been linearized with XhoI, blunt ended by Klenow treatment, and digested with BamHI. OctΔC contains the Oct-1 cDNA sequence from nucleotides 1 to 1774 (amino acids 1-590). This plasmid was created by digesting pET15bOct-1 with NcoI and ligation of the NcoI fragment containing the Oct-1 sequence into the NcoI site of pET15b. pET15bOct-2 was created by cloning Oct-2 cDNA (43LeBowitz J.H. Kobayashi T. Staudt L. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the XhoI-BamHI sites of pET15b. Plasmid vectors expressing protein A:Oct-1 POU domain fusion proteins and GST-TFIIB were a kind gift from Dr. P. A. Sharp (MIT, Cambridge, MA), and Dr. Inder Verma (The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), respectively. To obtain Oct-1, OctΔN, OctΔC, and Oct-2 recombinant proteins, expression vectors were transformed into E. coli strain BL21. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactosidase. Three h after induction, the cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The flow-through fraction from DEAE-cellulose was applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Novagen). This column was washed extensively with buffer D containing 10 mM imidazole. The column-bound Oct protein was eluted by a 50 mM to 1 M gradient of imidazole in buffer D. Fractions containing higher DNA binding activity as measured by EMSAs, and very few contaminating proteins as identified in a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, were dialyzed in buffer D containing 100 mM KCl and applied to a heparin-agarose column. Oct proteins, bound to the column were eluted using a step KCl gradient of 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0 M. Oct-1 protein containing only the POU domain was prepared as described previously (40Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-TFIIB was prepared as described by Kerr et al.(1993), cleaved with thrombin (Novagen), and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. TBP was purchased from Promega. EMSAs were performed in a 10-μl reaction volume in the DNA binding buffer: 12 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.4, 100 mM KCl, 0.12 mM EDTA, 6 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 120 μg/ml BSA, and 2 μg of poly(dG-dC)•poly(dG-dC). Incubations were at 30°C for 40 min and the reactions were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide (60:1), 1 × TBE gels at room temperature. In competition-dissociation assays, cold competitor DNA was added after 40 min of incubation. LPL and H2B probes used in the assays are as described in Currie and Eckel(1992). ICPO oligonucleotide probe is as described by 76Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Nature. 1989; 341: 624-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. DNA binding reactions as described above were incubated with 0.2 μg of mouse anti-TFIIB antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, rabbit anti-mouse IgG (0.2 μg, Zymed, San Francisco, CA) was added and the incubation continued for 30 min on ice. Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl, bead volume) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to the reaction and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with gentle rocking. Protein A-Sepharose was pelleted at 4°C and washed five times with DNA binding buffer. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the pellet and the samples were electrophoresed over 10% acrylamide gels. DNase I footprinting was performed with a 3′ end-labeled LPL probe (nucleotides −110 to +18; Currie and Eckel(1992)) or H2B probe (−90 to −20; LaBella et al.(1988)). DNA-protein binding reactions were performed in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, in a reaction volume of 50 μl for 40 min and digested with 0.03 units of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.4% SDS in 150 mM NaCl and 25 mM EDTA, phenol-chloroform extracted, and analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel. 3T3-L1 cells were maintained and differentiated as described previously (Currie and Eckel, 1992). Undifferentiated cells were cotransfected with 20 μg of the indicated LPLCAT constructs and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by a calcium phosphate procedure (41Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Fourty-eight h after transfection, G418 (800 μg/ml) was added. Medium was changed every 4 days and G418-resistant colonies obtained after 20 days were pooled and replated across two plates. One plate was treated with differentiating agents, and harvested at day 7. Cell extracts were prepared, and heated to 65°C for 5 min; CAT assays were performed as described previously (Kumar et al., 1987). Cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate procedure. RNA was prepared by RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc) 48 h after transfection. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I before primer extension. Primer extension with the 5′ end-labeled primer 5′-CGATGCCATTGGGATATATC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 521 to 540 of pBLCAT3, Luckow and Schultz(1987)) was performed as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1992). RNase protection with the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was performed as described previously (3Ausubel F.M. Brunt R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Sridman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). To investigate the functional importance of the octamer, the CCAAT box, and the putative TATA box region, the human proximal LPL promoter fragment spanning nucleotides −480 to +115 was cloned into the enhancer- and promoter-less chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector pBLCAT3 (Luckow and Schultz, 1987). Several mutants were generated from this vector (Fig. 1A). In pLPLCATm1, the wild-type putative TATA box sequence, CATAAG, was changed to the canonical TATA box, TATAAA. In other mutants, the wild-type motifs were changed such that the corresponding transcription factor did not bind efficiently in an EMSA. The effect of various mutations on LPL promoter activity was determined by measuring the CAT enzyme activity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that had stably integrated CAT reporters. The CAT activity of these cells after their differentiation into adipocytes was also measured to determine the effect of mutations on the LPL promoter activity in mature adipocyte cultures (Fig. 1B). The wild-type LPL promoter displayed ~7-fold more activity than the parental vector, pBLCAT3 (Fig. 1B, compare pBLCAT3 with pLPLCAT). Mutating the putative TATA box sequence to TATAAA increased the activity 2-fold (compare pLPLCAT with pLPLCATm1). Surprisingly, mutating the putative TATA to GAGACC, which does not bind TBP in vitro, further increased CAT activity, suggesting that the CATAAG sequence may not function as a TATA box (compare pLPLCAT with pLPLCATm2). The inverse TATA-like sequence located at position −74 to −67 of the LPL promoter was also determined not to be essential for promoter activity, since mutation of this sequence (pLPLCATm5) did not reduce CAT activity. In contrast, mutating the octamer sequence (pLPLCATm3), or the CCAAT box (pLPLCATm4) completely abolished LPL promoter activity. These results suggest"
https://openalex.org/W1685820984,"The mechanisms mediating transepithelial ion transport in salivary ducts were characterized and localized by studying the regulation of [Na+]i, [K+]i, and pHi in isolated intralobular ducts and perfused main ducts of the submandibular salivary gland. A new procedure was developed for the rapid preparation of intralobular ducts. Measurements of pHi revealed the presence of Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchange activities in intralobular duct cells. We could not obtain evidence for a coupled K+/H+ exchange activity which was postulated to exist in the luminal membrane of duct cells. Rather, a Kout+-dependent pathway which mediates the transport of H+/HCO3− and Na+ was found. This pathway was absent from acinar cells of the same gland and was active in unstimulated duct cells incubated in 5 mM Kout+. Accordingly, inhibition of the Na+ pump with ouabain resulted in rapid and large Na+ influx in duct but not acinar cells. Perfusion experiments with the experimentally accessible main duct and measurements of pHi were used to provide the first direct localization of ion transporters in salivary ducts. The luminal and basolateral membranes of the duct express separate Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchangers. Na+/H+ exchange activity in both membranes was similar, whereas the luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity was higher than that in the basolateral membrane. The perfused main duct was also used to localize the newly discovered Kout+-dependent H+/HCO3− and Na+ transport pathway to the luminal membrane, which suggests that this pathway may play an important role in Na+ reabsorption and K+ and HCO3− secretion by the salivary ductal system.

Fluid and electrolyte secretion by the submandibular salivary gland occurs in two steps(1Thaysen J.H. Thorn N.A. Schwartz I.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1954; 178: 155-159Google Scholar, 2Thaysen J.H. Ussing H.H. Kruhoffer P. Thaysen J.H. Thorn N.A. The Alkali Metal Ions in Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1960: 424-463Google Scholar). First, a plasma like fluid is secreted by the acinar cells and cells in the acinar-intercalated duct region. Subsequently, the electrolyte composition of the primary fluid is modified by the ductal system. The ducts reabsorb Na+ and Cl−, secrete K+ and HCO3−, and reduce the osmolarity of the fluid, apparently without a significant change in the volume of the secreted fluid(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). The majority of the studies to reveal the mechanism of vectorial ion transport in duct cells was performed with the experimentally available perfused main duct(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). Ion substitution and the use of blockers led to a model in which luminal K+ secretion is mediated by a coupled, electroneutral K+/H+ exchanger in parallel with an epithelial type Na+/H+ exchanger(3Young J.A.

Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). Na+ absorption in the luminal membrane is mediated by the Na+/H+ exchanger and an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel(5Knauf H. Lubcke R. Pflügers Arch. 1975; 361: 55-59Google Scholar, 6Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 164-166Google Scholar). Na+ exit and K+ entry at the basolateral membrane are mediated by the Na+ pump. Salivary secretion is under autonomic control. Both cholinergic and α-adrenergic stimulation inhibit Na+ reabsorption and reduce the transepithelial potential (7Young J.A. Martin C.J. Asz M. Weber F.D.

In recent years techniques were developed to examine the mechanisms by which agonists modulate salivary electrolyte secretion on the cellular level. Patch clamp of intralobular duct cells was used to demonstrate the presence of an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (6Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 164-166Google Scholar) and a Cl− channel in the luminal membrane (15Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Google Scholar).

In the present study we identified the major mechanisms of Na+, K+ and H+/HCO3− transport in submandibular duct cells. For the purpose of these studies we simplified the technique of Dehaye and Turner (20Dehaye J.P. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C490-C496Google Scholar) for preparation of intralobular granular duct cells. We also used measurements of pHi in the perfused main duct to provide the first direct membrane localization of the transporters participating in regulation of pHi, [Na+]i, and transepithelial electrolyte transport. The subsequent manuscript (38Xu X. Zhao H. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19606-19612Google Scholar) describes the properties and regulation of this pathway during agonist stimulation. All fluorescent probes were from Molecular Probes. Dimethylamiloride (DMA) was from RBI, Natick, MA. Collagenase P was from Boehringer Mannheim. The standard perfusion solution A (NaCl, Hepes) contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). K+-free, Hepes-buffered solution B was prepared by replacing 5 mM K+ with 5 mMN-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG+). The composition of all other solutions was identical with that detailed in (21Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Google Scholar). In general Na+-free solutions were prepared by replacing Na+ with NMG+, and Cl−-free solutions were prepared by replacing Cl− with gluconate (Glu−). HCO3−-buffered solutions contained 2.5 mM Hepes, and 25 mM HCO3− replaced 25 mM Cl−. The solutions used in the present studies were labeled as follows: Na+-free, Hepes solution C; Cl−-free, Hepes solution D; NaCl, HCO3− solution E; Cl−-free, HCO3− solution F; Na+-free, HCO3− solution G. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mosM with the major salt. A new procedure was developed for the preparation of intralobular ducts from the rat submandibular salivary gland. The submandibular glands were removed from male rats (75-100 g) to an ice-cold solution A in which 10 mM Na+-pyrovate replaced 10 mM NaCl and which contained 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PSA). Each gland was cleaned by injection of 5-10 ml of PSA and removal of the capsule and finely minced. The minced tissue was transferred to 8 ml of PSA containing 2.5 mg of collagenase P, the flask was gassed with 100% O2, and capped. After 2 min of digestion at 37°C, the tissue was partially dispersed by pipetteting 5 times with a 5-ml plastic pipette tip, and the digestion continued for an additional 8 min. The digest was washed twice with PSA by a 10-s centrifugation at 100 × g, resuspended in about 6 ml of PSA and kept on ice until use. Fig. 1A shows the mixture of ducts and acini obtained by this procedure. The procedure used to prepare the main duct for perfusion was similar to that described before(7Young J.A. Martin C.J. Asz M. Weber F.D. Pflügers Arch. 1970; 319: 185-199Google Scholar), while the perfusion set up was similar to the one we used to perfuse the main pancreatic duct (21Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Google Scholar). Male rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized and tracheotomized. The submandibular glands were exposed and the connective tissue was cleared in the region of the gland hilum. The submandibular duct was opened close to the gland hilum, and a cannula was inserted and ligated. The duct was cut, transferred to a Petri dish containing PSA, and perfused luminally with a PSA containing 2 μM BCECF/AM. After a 10-15-min incubation at room temperature, the duct lumen was flushed with 0.2 ml of PSA, and the duct was transferred to a perfusion chamber. The open end of the duct was cut and pulled to allow attachment of the holding cannula as shown in Fig. 1B, right. Then the chamber was placed on a stage of an inverted microscope and the cannula connected to the lumen perfusion line. The lumen was perfused at a rate of 25 μl/min, and the bath was perfused in an anterograde direction at a rate of 10-12 ml/min. Intralobular ducts and the acini were loaded with BCECF by a 15-min incubation at room temperature in PSA containing 2 μM BCECF/AM. The cells were then washed once, resuspended in 5 ml of PSA, and kept on ice until use. Loading with SBFI was by a 30-min incubation at room temperature with 5 μM SBFI/AM. These cells were also washed once with PSA and kept on ice until use. The fluorescence was recorded either by photon counting or image acquisition and analysis using the systems described before(21Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Google Scholar, 22Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Google Scholar). For photon counting, the fluorescence was recorded from 6-12 cells. In the case of the main duct, the fluorescence was recorded from an area equivalent to 8-12 cells and as close as possible to the lumen perfusing cannula. BCECF fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 490 and 450 nm at a resolution of 2/s. The fluorescence ratios of 490/450 were calibrated intracellularly by perfusing the cells with solutions containing 145 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 5 μM nigericin with pH adjusted to 6.2-7.6, as described previously(21Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Google Scholar). In the case of image acquisition, images were recorded at a resolution of 4 s for each set of images, and the fluorescence of single cells or cell clusters was analyzed as desired(21Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Google Scholar). SBFI fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 370 nm. The image ratios of 340/370 were calibrated essentially as described before(23Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Google Scholar). To clamp Nain+, the cells were perfused with solutions containing several concentrations of NaCl (between 0 and 90 mM), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 μM gramicidin, and 2.5 μM monensin. The dye behaved similarly in duct and acinar cells, and similar changes in fluorescence ratio were obtained by clamping Nain+ at different concentrations. Therefore, the calibration curves from both cells were pooled. The apparent Kd for Na+ in the cells was about 48 ± 6.3 mM (n = 4). The calibration curve and the ratios were used to calculate [Na+]i. The only H+/HCO3− transport mechanism described before in submandibular duct is a Na+/H+ exchange(16Paulais M. Cragoe E.J. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar, 24Poronnik P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 307-312Google Scholar). Fig. 2, a and b, shows the presence of a Cl−/HCO3− exchange mechanism in duct and acinar cells of the submandibular gland. In the absence of HCO3−, removal of Clout− acidified the cells, whereas in the presence of HCO3−, removal of Clout− caused cytosolic alkalinization. Treatment of the ducts with DIDS inhibited the effect of Cl− removal and readdition on pHi. Similar results were obtained in the absence of Naout+ (not shown). Hence, a Na+-independent, DIDS-sensitive Cl−/HCO3− exchange similar to that found in acinar cells is present in submandibular intralobular duct cells. In an attempt to identify the proposed(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar, 4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar) K+/H+ exchange activity, we tested the effect of external K+ on H+ efflux from acid-loaded cells (Fig. 2c). Addition of 5 mM Kout+ to acidified cells caused a small increase in pHi. However, increasing Kout+ up to 140 mM had no further effect on pHi. Exposing these cells to 5 mM K+ and 140 mM Naout+ in the presence of 20 μM dimethylamiloride (DMA) increased pHi similar to that observed with K+ alone. Removal of DMA resulted in recovery of resting pHi due to Na+/H+ exchange. Hence, even in strongly acidified cells and in the presence of HCO3−, external K+ had minimal effect on pHi. Another protocol to test for K+/H+ exchange is shown in Fig. 3. Removal of external K+ caused cytosolic acidification at an initial rate of about 0.13 ± 0.02 pH unit/min (n = 12). Up to 20 μM amiloride, which is sufficient to block the luminal Na+ channel(6Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 164-166Google Scholar), had no effect on the rate or extent of the acidification. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger with 0.5 mM amiloride caused a further reduction of pHi by about 0.16 ± 0.03 pH unit (n = 4) (Fig. 3a). Inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger prior to removal of Kout+ showed that the maximal rate of acidification due to removal of Kout+ was 0.34 ± 0.02 pH unit/min (n = 5) with stabilization of pHi within 128 ± 5.7 s (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c shows that HCO3− somewhat reduced the rate and significantly blunted the extent of the acidification. However, a similar set point of pHi was attained under the various conditions. In Hepes-buffered medium, pHi stabilized at 6.98 ± 0.03 (n = 4), whereas in HCO3−-buffered medium, pHi stabilized at 6.93 ± 0.04 (n = 3). In the absence of amiloride or DMA, addition of Kout+ rapidly increased pHi back to resting levels (Fig. 3a). DMA (Fig. 3, b and c) reduced, but did not prevent, the rapid alkalinization observed on addition of Kout+. Hence, the initial rapid increase in pHi induced by Kout+ did not require functioning Na+/H+ exchanger. Fig. 4, a and b, illustrates the dependence of H+ influx and efflux on [Kout+]. Gradual reduction of Kout+ from 5 to 1 mM had a small effect on pHi (Fig. 4a). The same effect was observed if Kout+ was reduced in one step from 5 to 1 mM. Reducing Kout+ from 1 to 0 mM resulted in the typical acidification. Fig. 4b shows that in duct cells acidified by reducing Kout+ from 5 to 0 mM, the addition of 1 mM Kout+ was sufficient to rapidly restore normal pHi. In an attempt to determine the specificity of the extracellular K+ site, we found that substituting Li+ for K+ had no effect on the Kout+-dependent acidification (not shown). Fig. 4c shows that Cs+ at 5 mM largely prevented the acidification. On the other hand, when 5 mM Cs+ was added to acidified cells incubated in the absence of Kout+, resting pHi was recovered. The characteristics of H+ fluxes demonstrated in Fig. 2-4 are not compatible with a coupled K+/H+ exchange. Another possibility is transport of the ions through conductive pathways as was suggested for the striated duct(16Paulais M. Cragoe E.J. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar). However, K+ and H+ fluxes did not require anion transport since incubation of the cells in Cl−-free medium in the presence or absence of HCO3−, to deplete intracellular and extracellular Cl−, had no effect on H+ fluxes due to Kout+ removal or addition (not shown, but see Na+ fluxes in accompanying manuscript (38Xu X. Zhao H. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19606-19612Google Scholar)). The Kout+-dependent acidification was not affected by up to 10 mM triethylammonium (not shown), but was inhibited by Ba2+. Fig. 5a shows that incubating the cells with 2.5 mM Ba2+ increased steady-state pHi by 0.067 ± 0.015 (n = 3) unit and inhibited the acidification by about 84 ± 7% (n = 3). The inhibition by Ba2+ was reversible. A somewhat unexpected finding is illustrated in Fig. 5b. Inhibition of the pathway required for H+ fluxes by Ba2+ did not result in recovery of pHi due to Na+/H+ exchange. This did not occur until K+ was added to the incubation medium in the absence (not shown) or presence (Fig. 5b) of Ba2+. Hence, Ba2+ inhibits H+ efflux but not H+ influx induced by changes in Kout+. A clue to what might be limiting the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger to set pHi at about 7.1-7.2 in the absence of Kout+ (Fig. 3-5) was obtained by testing the effect of Naout+ on pHi. Fig. 6a shows that removal of Naout+ reduced pHito 6.86 ± 0.03 (n = 3). Removal of Kout+ in the absence of Naout+increased, rather than decreased, pHi to about 6.96 ± 0.04 (n = 3). On the other hand, removal of Naout+ after incubation in the absence of Kout+ resulted in a rapid and large reduction in pHi to about 6.34 ± 0.03 (n = 5) (Fig. 6b). The same behavior was observed in the presence of HCO3− (Fig. 6c). One explanation of the results in Fig. 6is that removal of Kout+ caused rapid and large increases in [Na+]i. This was directly confirmed by measuring [Na+]i with SBFI. Fig. 7a shows that reducing Kout+ from 5 to 0 mM caused a rapid increase in duct cells [Na+]i from 13.6 ± 0.4 (n = 59) to 45.3 ± 2.7 mM (n = 33). Increasing Kout+ from 0 to 5 mM resulted in a rapid Na+ efflux to restore resting [Na+]i within 183 ± 16 s at 37°C. HCO3− had minimal effect on the [Na+]i increase due to removal of Kout+. Fig. 7b shows that this behavior was unique to duct cells. To evaluate the Na+ permeability of resting duct cells and demonstrate that removal of Kout+ increased [Na+]i beyond that expected from Na+ pump inhibition, we tested the effect of ouabain on [Na+]i. Fig. 8, a-d, shows that ouabain inhibited the Na+ pump of duct cells at resting (before removal of Kout+) and at high [Na+]i with an apparent affinity of about 100 mM, typical of the α1 isoform found in rat tissue(25Lingrel J.B. Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 37-83Google Scholar). Further, 1 mM ouabain inhibited the pump even in the presence of 40 mM Kout+ (Fig. 8e). Yet, ouabain at 2 mM increased [Na+]i less and slower than removal of Kout+ (Fig. 8a). Thus, removal of Kout+ increased Na+ influx through a Kout+-dependent pathway. The combined experiments in Fig. 7and Fig. 8show that at 5 mM Kout+ duct cells have significant permeability to Na+ which is countered by the Na+ pump. Removal of Kout+ inhibits the Na+ pump but also increases Na+ permeability by 4.2-fold (4.56 ± 0.6 mM/min (n = 4) in the presence of ouabain and 19.2 ± 0.8 mM/min (n = 33) due to removal of Kout+). The accompanying manuscript describes the characterization and regulation of this duct cell specific ion transport pathway. In the initial phase of this study we attempted to microperfuse the intralobular ducts of the submandibular gland, similar to our previous studies with pancreatic ducts(21Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Google Scholar). Because of the large amount of connective tissue and the fragility of the granular duct, we were unable to microdissect and perfuse intact intralobular ducts. The only reliable technique was to perfuse the main duct (see Fig. 1). The problem in this case was that a significant amount of the dye was extracellular. In fact it was not possible to obtain sufficient signal/noise with SBFI or Na+-Green to measure [Na+]i. However, this problem was less acute with BCECF. Therefore, we used this dye to localize the transporters. Fig. 9shows the presence of a Na+/H+ exchange activity in the luminal side and provides the first demonstration of similar activity in the basolateral side of the duct. Fig. 8a shows that removal of Na+ from the lumen had a small effect on pHi. Removal of Na+ from the bath in the absence of luminal Na+ caused rapid acidification. Addition of Na+ to the lumen in the absence of Na+ in the bath rapidly increased pHi. However, addition of Na+ to the bath was required to restore resting pHi. The second part of Fig. 8a shows a reverse sequence of Na+ removal and addition. In this case, addition of Na+ to the bath in the absence of luminal Na+ partially restored pHi, and addition of Na+ to the lumen further increased pHi. Fig. 8b shows that DMA inhibited the Na+-dependent H+ efflux in both membranes. Removal of DMA was followed by recovery of normal pHi. Fig. 10provides evidence for separate luminal and basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchangers in submandibular ducts. Removal of Cl− from the bath in the presence of luminal Cl− caused a small, transient (in 5 out of 5 experiments) increase in pHi (Fig. 10a). Removal of Cl− from the lumen caused a rapid, large, and sustained increase in pHi. Addition of Cl− to the bath in the absence of luminal Cl− partially reduced pHi, and addition of Cl− to the lumen restored normal pHi. The reverse experiment is shown in Fig. 10b. In this case, removal of Cl− from the lumen in the presence of Cl− in the bath resulted in a large and sustained increase in pHi. Addition of Cl− to the lumen in the absence of Cl− in the bath was nearly sufficient to restore resting pHi. All effects of Cl− removal were largely inhibited by incubation with 0.5 mM DIDS. Fig. 11shows the localization of the Kout+-sensitive pathway in the luminal membrane. Removal of K+ from the luminal solution caused small acidification. Removal of K+ from the bath was required to obtain the maximal acidification (Fig. 10a) (n = 3). On the other hand, removal of K+ from the bath in the presence of luminal K+ had a small effect on pHi, and removal of K+ from the lumen caused significant acidification (Fig. 10b) (n = 3). Addition of K+ to the lumen in the absence of K+ in the bath had a small effect on pHi. Addition of K+ to the bath was required for the rapid H+ efflux (Fig. 10a). The simplest explanation for the need to remove bath K+ to observe the maximal acidification is the effect of bath K+ on the Na+ pump. In the perfused duct, large intracellular Na+ accumulation due to removal of luminal K+ was prevented because of Na+ efflux across the basolateral membrane by the Na+/K+ pump. This prevented partial inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchangers which removed some of the H+ entering the cytosol. That this is likely the case is shown by the experiments in the second part of Fig. 10, a and b. Fig. 10a shows that when K+ was removed from the lumen and then the bath to allow accumulation of intracellular Na+ as in Fig. 6b, removal of Na+ from the bath and then the lumen caused large and rapid cytosolic acidification. On the other hand, Fig. 10b shows that maintaining luminal K+ at 5 mM throughout the experiment reduced the acidification observed on removal of Na+ from both sides. Thus, removal of luminal K+ increased the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and the acidification. Unfortunately we were unable to confirm this finding by measuring [Na+]i with SBFI or Na+-Green due to small signal/noise. Ductal systems of various exocrine glands control the final electrolyte composition of the secreted fluid. In the gastrointestinal tract, the ducts alkalize the fluid by secreting HCO3− and/or absorbing H+. HCO3− concentration in the secreted fluid of some species can be as high as 140 mM(3Young J.A.

Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar, 26Case R.M. Argent B.A. Go V.L. The Exocrine Pancreas: Biology, Pathology and Diseases. Raven Press, New York1986: 213-242Google Scholar). The submandibular salivary gland has been extensively used as a model system to study electrolyte secretion by duct cells(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). Salivary duct cells reabsorb Na+ and Cl− and secrete K+ and HCO3−. The concentrations of Na+ and K+ in the salivary fluid varies depending on secretory rate but, in general, they change in a reciprocal manner(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). Cl− absorption parallels that and accounts for about 25% of Na+ absorption (4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 27Schneyer L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1968; 215: 664-670Google Scholar) and appears to be only partially coupled to HCO3− secretion(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). HCO3− and K+ secretion partially correlates, but usually K+ secretion significantly exceeds HCO3− secretion(5Knauf H. Lubcke R. Pflügers Arch. 1975; 361: 55-59Google Scholar, 7Young J.A. Martin C.J. Asz M. Weber F.D. Pflügers Arch. 1970; 319: 185-199Google Scholar, 8Martin C.J. Young J.A. Pflügers Arch. 1971; 327: 303-323Google Scholar, 11Schneyer L.H. Am. J.

Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 5Knauf H. Lubcke R. Pflügers Arch. 1975; 361: 55-59Google Scholar, 28Knauf H. Wais U. Lubeke R. Albiez G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 6: 43-50Google Scholar) or in the presence of luminal amiloride(16Paulais M. Cragoe E.J. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar), when secretion is slow but measurable, K+ and HCO3− secretion (or H+ absorption) become increasingly coupled(4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). Based on these findings and their elegant studies on the dependence of ion transport on the luminal concentrations of Na+ and K+, Knauf et al.(4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar) suggested that luminal K+ and HCO3− secretion are mediated largely by separate, but functionally coupled, Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchangers. With few modifications, the model proposed by Knauf et al.(4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar) becomes the accepted mechanism of ion transport by the salivary duct. Partial validation of the model was obtained with the findings of an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (6Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 164-166Google Scholar) and a Cl− conductance (15Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Google Scholar) in the luminal membrane of salivary duct cells. Measurement of pHi in the present studies confirmed the presence of a Na+/H+ exchange activity in intralobular duct cells(16Paulais M. Cragoe E.J. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar, 24Poronnik P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 307-312Google Scholar). Unlike a previous report using similar cells and techniques, we also found a Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in these cells (Fig. 2). The simplified cell preparation technique used for the present studies may have allowed the demonstration of this activity in intralobular ducts. As a control for these experiments, we measured pHi in ducts and acini in the same recording field since the acini were shown to have a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger(29Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19564-19569Google Scholar). In both cell types, removal of Cl− in the absence of HCO3− acidified, rather than alkalinized, the cytosol. These findings are similar to those in pancreatic acini (30Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Google Scholar) in which the exchanger transports HCO3− but not OH−. In the presence of HCO3−, removal of Clout− caused a DIDS-sensitive, Na+-independent alkalinization, all indicative of a Cl−/HCO3− exchange. The perfusion experiments with the main submandibular ducts provide the first direct localization and the first evidence for the presence of Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchange activities on both sides of the duct. Thus, the luminal and basolateral sides of the ducts displayed similar rates of Na+/H+ exchange. The rate and extent of pHi changes due to Cl− removal suggests that luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity is much higher than the basolateral activity. The influence of the ions in one side on the activity of the exchanger present in the opposite side indicates that the exchangers share common pools of intracellular Na+, Cl−, and H+/HCO3−. This would imply that the luminal and basolateral exchangers are present in the same cells or in cells coupled with respect to Na+, Cl−, and H+/HCO3−. This is particularly relevant since the submandibular duct contains at least two morphologically distinct cell types(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). In the present studies, we were unable to address this question directly since the thick layer of connective tissue of the main duct precluded identification of single cells (see Fig. 1B). However, pancreatic duct cells were shown to be electrically coupled through gap junctions(31Gray M.A. Plant S. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C591-C602Google Scholar), which are permeable to a variety of small charged molecules(32Bennett M.V.L. Barrio L.C. Bargiello T.A. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E. Saez J.C. Neuron. 1991; 6: 305-320Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the exchangers exist in the same or separate submandibular duct cells coupled by gap junction. The presence of more than one type of a similar transporter in selective membranes of the same epithelial cell has been extensively studied in the kidney(33Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Google Scholar, 34Clark J.D. Limbird L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C945-C953Google Scholar). It is believed that in these cases one of the transporters is involved in transepithelial electrolyte transport, whereas the other maintains the normal cytosolic concentration of the respective ion(34Clark J.D. Limbird L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C945-C953Google Scholar). It is likely that the basolateral Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchangers in the salivary duct regulate pHi. The luminal Na+/H+ exchanger probably mediates some of the nonelectrogenic Na+ reabsorption(3Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar, 4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). On the other hand, the luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchanger is likely to play only a minor role in Na+ absorption and K+ and HCO3− secretion since removal of luminal Cl− reduces Na+ reabsorption by only 25%(4Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 27Schneyer L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1968; 215: 664-670Google Scholar). The most significant finding of the present studies is a Kout+-dependent pathway permeable to Na+ and/or H+ (HCO3−) in submandibular duct, but not acinar cells. We believe that this can be a major pathway of K+ and HCO3− secretion in the luminal membrane of the duct. Our results do not support the existence of a coupled K+/H+ exchange or a K+/HCO3− cotransport mechanism in submandibular duct cells. The most compelling evidence is the inability of Kout+ to cause substantial H+ efflux from acid-loaded cells (Fig. 2). In separate experiments we used the protocol in Fig. 6b to first deplete the cells from K+ and load them with Na+ and then acidify the cells by incubation in Na+-free medium. Even in these acid-loaded and K+-depleted cells Kout+ was not effective in causing H+ efflux. In duct cells incubated in the absence of Naout+, removal of Kout+ alkalinized, rather than acidified, the cytosol (Fig. 6a). All previously reported K+/H+ exchange mechanisms had markedly different properties (35Adorante J.S. Cala P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 209-227Google Scholar, 36Bonanno J.A. Am. J.

Biol. 1992; 126: 245-256Google Scholar). Since Ba2+ and 5 mM Csout+ inhibited the Kout+-dependent H+/HCO3− and Na+(38Xu X. Zhao H. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19606-19612Google Scholar) fluxes, it is possible that the pathway is sensitive to the transepithelial potential and K+ and H+ (HCO3−) transport is mediated by conductive pathways. Obviously, additional studies are needed to identify the nature of this pathway(s) with certainty. However, irrespective of the exact mechanism, this transporter is likely to play a major role in ductal electrolyte secretion. At this point it is useful to indicate the similarities and inter-relationship between the Kout+-induced H+ and Na+ fluxes which are described in the accompanying manuscript(38Xu X. Zhao H. Diaz J.

The physiological significance of these observations is highlighted by our ability to localize this pathway to the luminal membrane of submandibular duct cells (Fig. 11). Thus, the luminal membrane of the submandibular duct has an ion transport pathway(s) which is sensitive to the extraluminal concentrations of K+ and mediates the concomitant transport of Na+ and H+ and/or HCO3− into the cells and K+ out of the cells. Such a pathway is ideal in mediating K+ and HCO3− efflux to the lumen and some of the Na+ reabsorption during salivary secretion.

T., McPhee, J. A., Elliott, S. M., Abramson, S. L., and Bridges, K. R.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2846-2852). We now demonstrate that ascorbate increases cytosolic aconitase activity. The iron-responsive element-binding protein (IRP-1) exists in three states: bound to mRNA without aconitase activity, free in the cytosol without aconitase activity, and free in the cytosol with aconitase activity. Ascorbate converts free IRP-1 to the enzymatically active form. Enhanced ferritin synthesis with subsequent iron stimulation is due to the altered equilibrium of the free IRP-1.

The cellular biology of iron is closely intertwined with that of ascorbate. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is a dietary requirement for primates, guinea pigs, and a few other species that fail to synthesize the compound (33Szent-Györgyi A. Biochem.

Additionally, most cells in culture are ascorbate-deficient since the vitamin generally is not added to culture media and is extremely labile in solution (24Moser U. Bendich A. Machlin L.J. Handbook of Vitamins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 195-232Google Scholar). We have shown previously that ascorbic acid retards lysosomal autophagy of cytosolic ferritin (3Bridges K.R. Hoffman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14273-14277Google Scholar; 2Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14773-14778Google Scholar; 18Hoffman K.E. Yanelli K. Bridges K.R. Am. J. Clin.

More recent work in our laboratory demonstrated that ascorbic acid greatly increases the ferritin content of cells subsequently stimulated with iron (35Toth I. Rogers J.T. McPhee J.A. Elliott S.M. Abramson S.L. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2846-2852Google Scholar). Base-line ferritin synthesis in ascorbate replete or deficient cells is identical. Ferritin message translation in response to iron loading was greater in cells grown in media containing physiological concentrations of ascorbate relative to those grown under standard culture conditions. Ascorbate's role as a facilitator of ferritin synthesis in cells is mediated through the 5′-untranslated region region of the ferritin message containing the iron-responsive element (IRE) 1The abbreviations used are: IREiron-responsive elementPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACferric ammonium citrate.

K562 human leukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and L-glutamine. Log phase growth was assured by maintaining a density of 2-5 × 105 cells/ml. A total of 5 × 106 to 107 K562 cells were treated with varying combinations of 10 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate, 150 mM ascorbic acid, 100 mM desferrioxamine, 500 μM uric acid, or glutathione as outlined for the individual experiments. They were washed twice with PBS buffer and incubated for 1 h in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with [35S]methionine at a concentration of 25 μCi/ml. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). Newly synthesized ferritin subunits were immunoprecipitated for 1 h with rabbit antibody to human ferritin (Boehringer Mannheim). The antigen-antibody complex was immobilized with protein A-Sepharose and washed extensively. The beads were boiled for 10 min in an SDS phosphate-urea electrophoresis buffer and separated at 80 V constant voltage for 16 h on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 M urea. After fixation, the gel was treated with autoradiography image enhancer, dried, and used to expose x-ray film for 2-4 days. The intensity of the H- and L-ferritin subunits was quantified with Abaton Scan equipment. Cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS buffer and counted. A total of 107 cells were lysed in 500 ml of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 3 mM NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, followed by 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge. Mitochondrial contamination of the supernatant was excluded by the absence of cytochrome c oxidase activity. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured according to the method of 32Smith L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1955; 2: 427-433Google Scholar (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The protein concentration of the cellular extracts was determined by Bio-Rad micro-assay according to the supplier's manual (Bio-Rad). Cytosolic aconitase activity was determined by measuring the decrease of cis-aconitate as assessed by spectrophotometric absorbance at 240 nm. Mitochondrial-free K562 lysates (50-100 μg) were incubated with 200 mMcis-aconitate in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.02% bovine serum albumin at room temperature in a final volume of 1 ml. Specific activity (mmol of substrate converted/mg of protein/min at room temperature) was calculated (6Emery-Goodman A. Hirling H. Scarpellino L. Henderson B. Kühn L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1457-1461Google Scholar). To assess the effect of in vitro addition of ascorbate, freshly prepared cell lysate containing cytosolic aconitase was pretreated for 10 min with a fresh solution of ascorbic acid or dehydroascorbic acid at final concentrations ranging between 1 pM and 500 mM, oxidized (GSSG) or reduced glutathione (GSH), or uric acid (stock solution in 100 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.2) at final concentrations ranging between 1 pM and 1 mM prior to enzyme assay. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, transferred and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with rabbit antibody raised against human IRP-1 (a generous gift of Dr. Lucas Kühn; 15Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Google Scholar) diluted 1:1000. We found, as reported previously, that the antibody recognized only IRP-1. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was diluted 1:1000 and reacted against the antibody to IRP-1. The position of the antigen-antibody complex was detected using the color enzymatic reaction according to the supplier's manual. IRE-protein interactions were assessed as described (21Liebold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar; 25Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Google Scholar). An excess amount of [32P]UTP-labeled RNA transcript (from pSPT-fer, a 28-nucleotide oligonucleotide encoding the human H-ferritin IRE; a generous gift of Dr. Kühn; see Müllner et al.(1989)) was incubated with 2 μg of cytoplasmic cell lysate (prepared with lysis buffer as detailed above) at room temperature for 20 min. RNase T1 (1 unit/ml) and heparin (5 mg/ml) were added sequentially for 10 min each. IRE-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel as detailed by Leibold and Munro. Aconitase activity and RNA-binding activity are mutually exclusive properties of IRP-1 (1Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 574-578Google Scholar). Cytosolic aconitase activity rose by 40% with a 2-h iron pulse, but returned to base-line levels by 16 h (Table 2, 1a-1c). Cycloheximide failed to block the increase in aconitase activity (data not shown), consistent with an activation of IRP-1 (34Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24466-24470Google Scholar). In contrast, chelation of iron by desferrioxamine lowered the cytosolic aconitase activity substantially (Table 2, 1d).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A 2-h incubation with ascorbate increased cytosolic aconitase activity by 2.5-fold (Table 2, 1 and 2a), again, not blocked by cycloheximide. Activity remained well above base-line levels even after a 16-h incubation (Table 2, 3a). When cells were incubated with ascorbate for 16 h and subsequently loaded with iron for 2 h, aconitase activity returned to the peak level (Table 2, 3b). The effect of ascorbate on cytosolic aconitase activity was less pronounced in cells preincubated with iron for 16 h (Table 2, 2a versus 2c). Dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of the vitamin, also modulated cytosolic aconitase activity (Table 2, rows 4 and 5), indicating that the oxidation state of the vitamin in the medium was not crucial to the potentiation of aconitase activity. To investigate the role of the internal oxidative environment on cytosolic aconitase activity (8Frei B. Stocker R. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9748-9752Google Scholar), we supplemented the medium with the powerful reducing agent uric acid (31Sevanian A. Davies K.J.A. Hochstein P. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1129S-1134SGoogle Scholar). Incubation with uric acid for 2 or 16 h did not modify aconitase activity (Table 2, 6a and 7a). Preincubation with uric acid blocked the increase in aconitase activity produced by 2 h iron loading (Table 2, compare 1b and 7b). In contrast, aconitase activity increased substantially in cells loaded with iron and then incubated with uric acid (Table 2, compare 1c and 6c). We further investigated the effect of antioxidant agents on cytosolic aconitase activity by incubating cells with oxidized (GSSG) or reduced (GSH) glutathione (23Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Google Scholar). Uptake of [14C]GSH by the cells was linear. Both GSH and GSSG increased cytosolic aconitase activity at 2 h, although less than ascorbic acid (Table 2, 8a and 10a). Loading cells with iron for 2 h after a 16-h incubation with GSH or GSSG raised aconitase activity only modestly (Table 2, 9b and 11b), which also differed from the marked increase with ascorbate (Table 2, 3b). GSH and GSSG mimicked ascorbate when added to cells for 2 h after a 16-h preincubation with iron (Table 2, 2c, 8c, and 10c). The experiments with uric acid and glutathione indicate that, while alterations in the internal cellular oxidative environment can modify aconitase activity, ascorbic acid has additional actions. Ferritin synthesis substantially exceeded control in cells incubated for 2 h in medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), while aconitase activity rose by 1.5-fold (Fig. 1, lane3). Ferritin synthesis in cells incubated with FAC for 16 h exceeded that of the 2-h incubation (Fig. 1, lane4). Aconitase activity, however, returned to base-line levels, suggesting that blockade of translation by IRP-1 is separable from cytosolic aconitase activity. Two hours of 150 μM ascorbate did not change ferritin synthesis but increased cytosolic aconitase activity by 2.5-fold. Cytosolic aconitase activity declined at 16 h of ascorbate incubation, but still exceeded control by 1.5-fold with no alteration in ferritin synthesis. Preincubation of cells with ascorbic acid for 16 h followed by FAC for 2 h raised the level of ferritin translation (Fig. 1, lanes3 and 8). The obverse experiment, addition of ascorbate to cells preincubated with iron, increased both ferritin synthesis and aconitase activity (Fig. 1, lane5). Ascorbate demonstrated clearly the independent modification of cytosolic aconitase activity and ferritin synthesis. Ferritin synthesis and aconitase activity were virtually unchanged in cells incubated with uric acid (Fig. 2, lanes6 and 7). Ferritin synthesis increased by about 2-fold and aconitase activity by about 1.5-fold in cells that were incubated sequentially with 10 μg/ml FAC for 16 h and with 500 μM uric acid for 2 h (Fig. 2, lanes4 and 5), changes that were less marked than with ascorbate (Fig. 1, lanes4 and 5). When the order of incubation was reversed, with uric acid followed by FAC, the increase in ferritin synthesis approximated that seen with ascorbic acid (Fig. 2, lanes7 and 8). In marked contrast to the ascorbate experiment in which aconitase activity rose by 2.5-fold, aconitase activity decreased in the cells treated with uric acid. Incubation with 500 μM GSSG changed neither ferritin synthesis nor cytosolic aconitase activity (Fig. 3, lanes7 and 8). Sequential treatment with iron and GSSG increased cytosolic aconitase activity by 50% without changing ferritin synthesis (Fig. 3, lanes4 and 5). GSH produced a different spectrum of changes, increasing ferritin synthesis but not aconitase activity (Fig. 3, lanes10 and 11). These data are the obverse of those obtained with ascorbate alone, which did not alter ferritin synthesis, but raised aconitase activity by severalfold. In aggregate, the data indicate that ferritin translation and cytosolic aconitase activity can be modified independently, suggesting a more complicated picture than one in which IRP-1 is either bound to message and enzymatically inactive or free in the cytosol with enzyme activity. The experiments with the antioxidants indicate that the effect of ascorbate involves more than its redox activity. Ascorbate does not operate by dissociating IRP-1 from the ferritin message; although it increases aconitase activity, ferritin synthesis (which reflects the IRP-1/mRNA interaction) is unchanged. To determine whether ascorbate increased the quantity of IRP-1 with a secondary rise in aconitase activity, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, separated electrophoretically, and used for immunoblotting with an antibody specific to IRP-1. As shown in Fig. 4, the cellular content of IRP-1 was uniform under each condition tested. Ascorbate, therefore, activates enzymatically dormant aconitase protein. Ascorbate added in vitro to cytosolic extracts from control cells did not alter aconitase activity, indicating that the vitamin does not directly modify the aconitase protein nor act as an allosteric regulator. The ascorbate effect on cytosolic aconitase activity requires cell metabolism, but not protein synthesis. Gel retardation experiments assessed the effect of ascorbic acid on the interaction of IRP-1 and the IRE. Cytosolic extracts from control cells and cells subjected to various treatments (see Fig. 5and legend) were incubated with a 32P-labeled IRE probe and then resolved electrophoretically, revealing the free IRE probe as well as the single band of the IRE•IRP-1 complex. The extract from cells treated with desferrioxamine or iron behaved as expected, binding more or less of the IRE probe, respectively. Aconitase activity increased by 50% in cells loaded with iron for 16 h and subsequently incubated with ascorbate for 2 h (Fig. 1, lanes4 and 5). Electrophoretic mobility assay of IRE•IRP-1 complex from comparably treated cells showed similar patterns in either circumstance, indicating that the increase in aconitase activity produced by ascorbate did not reflect a change in affinity between IRP-1 and the IRE (Fig. 5, lanes4 and 5). Cells incubated with iron for 2 h after a 16-h exposure to ascorbate produced a more prominent signal by electrophoretic mobility shift assay than did cells merely incubated with ascorbate for 16 h, implying a greater affinity of IRP-1 for the IRE (Fig. 5B, lanes7 and 8). However, aconitase activity increased substantially under these conditions (Fig. 1, lanes7 and 8). Since the quantity of IRP in the cells was constant (Fig. 4, lane8), these data are most consistent with ascorbate activation of latent cytosolic aconitase. Comparison of the electrophoretic mobility assay data and ferritin synthetic data further emphasizes the dissociation produced by ascorbate between IRE/IRP-1 affinity and translation of ferritin mRNA. The electrophoretic mobility patterns were virtually identical for cells treated with iron for 16 h and those where the treatment was followed by a 2-h incubation with ascorbate (Fig. 5, lanes4 and 5), while ferritin synthesis increased dramatically in the latter case (Fig. 1, lanes4 and 5). A similar dissociation between ferritin synthesis and IRE/IRP-1 affinity is seen with cells treated with ascorbate for 16 h and those where the treatment was followed by iron for 2 h (Fig. 5, lanes7 and 8versusFig. 1, lanes7 and 8). Fig. 5shows, if anything, a slight increase in the affinity between the IRE and IRP-1 in cells treated briefly with iron after ascorbate incubation, although this combination increased ferritin synthesis dramatically (Fig. 1). Ascorbic acid is crucial to numerous cellular reactions, ranging from hydroxylation of lysyl ϵ-amino groups in collagen to the conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine (20Levine M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 314: 892-902Google Scholar). Most cells in culture are ascorbate-deficient due to the lability of the vitamin in solution, disturbing a number of biochemical pathways, including lysosomal degradation of cytosolic ferritin (7Englard S. Seifter S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1986; 6: 365-406Google Scholar; 22Lipschitz D.A Bothwell T.H. Seftel H.C. Wapnick A.A. Charlton R.W. Br. J. Haematol. 1971; 20: 155-163Google Scholar). Our recent demonstration that ascorbate repletion greatly enhances ferritin synthesis in cells stimulated with iron indicated that a completely different arm of cellular metabolism is influenced by this vitamin (Toth et al., 1995). We now show that ascorbate induces cytosolic aconitase activity in K562 cells, which are known to be ascorbate-deficient (Bridges and Hoffman, 1986). IRP-1 has been shown previously to acquire aconitase activity when released from the IRE in the 5′-untranslated region of the ferritin message (12Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Google Scholar). Ascorbate, in contrast, activates aconitase without changing ferritin synthesis, meaning that the vitamin does not dissociate IRP-1 from the ferritin message. The most reasonable conclusion is that the vitamin activates a cytoplasmic pool of enzymatically dormant aconitase protein. Cells contain more than one IRP. The 90-kDa protein, designated IRP-1, is an aconitase when freed from the message (Constable et al., 1992; Müllner,et al., 1989; 11Goosen B. Caughman S.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4127-4133Google Scholar). A second IRE-binding protein, of 110 kDa, termed IRP-2, lacks aconitase activity (28Philpott C.C. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7321-7325Google Scholar; Henderson et al., 1993; 30Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Google Scholar). One explanation of our data is that ascorbate induces aconitase activity in IRP-2. The data in Fig. 1argue against this possibility, however. If ascorbate triggered aconitase activity in IRP-2, then the 2.5-fold increase in activity with a 2-h incubation with the vitamin would reflect activation of IRP-2. The low rate of ferritin is consistent with IRP-1 remaining attached to the message. When cells preincubated with iron for 16 h are pulsed with ascorbate for 2 h, ferritin synthesis increases and aconitase activity rises by only 1.5-fold. If ascorbate imparted aconitase activity to IRP-2, enzymatic activity again should have increased by at least 2.5-fold over base-line levels. Furthermore, the increase in ferritin synthesis indicates that IRP-1 has detached from ferritin mRNA, which should have increased cytosolic aconitase activity even further. We believe that the data are most consistent with ascorbate activation of latent IRP-1 in the cytosol (Fig. 6). Iron releases IRP-1 from the message. A second step, facilitated by ascorbate, converts this enzymatically inactive protein into an aconitase. Ascorbate stimulates aconitase activity in unbound IRP-1 but does not influence IRP-1 that is attached to the message. Eventually, the free IRP-1 reaches a new steady-state between active and inactive aconitase (Fig. 1, 16 h AA). When iron is added to these cells for 2 h, it releases IRP-1 into a smaller pool of free, inactive IRP-1. A larger quantity of IRP-1 is released before steady state is reached, so that both aconitase activity and ferritin synthesis increase (Fig. 1, 16 h AA + 2 h Fe). The three-state model presented in Fig. 6would allow independent regulation of the two activities of IRP-1, permitting greater flexibility in the regulation of the metabolic environment of the cell than does a model in which the IRP-1 either is bound to mRNA with no aconitase activity or free in the cytosol with aconitase activity. Further biochemical studies are required to determine the molecular steps by which ascorbate switches IRP-1 into the aconitase mode. The recent demonstration that cytosolic aconitase is inactivated by superoxide (9Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Google Scholar; 10Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 98-102Google Scholar) suggests that ascorbate could modulate the activity of this enzyme, at least in part, by buffering cytoplasmic superoxide. Nitric oxide has been posited to be a physiological regulator of cytosolic aconitase activity (36Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Google Scholar). The recent data indicating that superoxide and other free radicals, rather than nitric oxide, mediate cytosolic aconitase activity highlight the importance of identifying the physiologically relevant biochemical constituents in the cell (14Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Google Scholar). The cellular physiology of iron and the plethora of proteins that depend on it cannot be understood without this information. We are grateful to Drs. H. Franklin Bunn, Jack T. Rogers, and Gabor Lazar for their valuable input over the course of this study, as well as to Dr. L. C. Kühn for the generous gifts of antibody to IRP-1 and IRE probe. Suzanne M. Elliott and Jay A. McPhee provided expert technical assistance during the course of these experiments.

Unlike the wild type, Glu627-EGF receptor, transfected in NIH3T3 cells, gave rise to focal transformation and growth in agar even in the absence of EGF. Constitutive activity of mutant EGF receptor amounted to 20% of that of wild type receptor stimulated by EGF. In addition, the mutant receptor was more sensitive to EGF, reaching maximum transforming activity at 5 ng/ml EGF. NIH3T3 cells expressing Glu627-EGF receptor showed a transformed phenotype and were not arrested in G0 upon serum deprivation. The mutant receptor was constitutively autophosphorylated, and several other cellular proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine in absence of the ligand. Among these, the SHC adaptor protein was phosphorylated in absence of EGF, the other adaptor, GRB-2, was constitutively associated with the Glu627EGF receptor in vivo and in vitro, and mitogen-activated protein kinase was constitutively phosphorylated. In contrast, other EGF receptor substrates, like phospholipase Cγ, were not phosphorylated in absence of EGF. The mutant receptor showed a higher sensitivity to cleavage by calpain both in absence and presence of EGF, appeared as a 170- and 150-kDa doublet in cell extracts, and a specific calpain inhibitor blocked the appearance of the 150-kDa form. Since the calpain cleavage site is located in the receptor cytoplasmic tail, this finding suggests that the Glu627 mutation induces a slightly different conformation in the EGF receptor intracellular domain. In conclusion, our data show that a point mutation in the EGF receptor transmembrane domain was able to constitutively activate the receptor and to induce transformation via constitutive activation of the Ras pathway.

The mutant receptor showed a higher sensitivity to cleavage by calpain both in absence and presence of EGF, appeared as a 170- and 150-kDa doublet in cell extracts, and a specific calpain inhibitor blocked the appearance of the 150-kDa form. Since the calpain cleavage site is located in the receptor cytoplasmic tail, this finding suggests that the Glu627 mutation induces a slightly different conformation in the EGF receptor intracellular domain. In conclusion, our data show that a point mutation in the EGF receptor transmembrane domain was able to constitutively activate the receptor and to induce transformation via constitutive activation of the Ras pathway."

Additional host factors, which can be resolved into two fractions (Mu Replication Factor α and β; MRFα and MRFβ), are required to disassemble the MuA complex and initiate DNA synthesis. MRFα modifies the protein content of the STC, removing MuA from the DNA in the process. The MRFβ promotes initiation of Mu DNA synthesis on the STC altered by the MRFα. These host factors cannot promote initiation of Mu DNA synthesis if the STC is damaged by partial proteolysis. Moreover, the mutant protein MuA211 cannot be removed from the STC by MRFα, blocking initiation of DNA synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2003402994,"TEF-1 is a tissue-specific human transcription factor which binds to and activates transcription from the SV40 early promoter and the HPV-16 E6/E7 promoter and may be involved in regulation of muscle-specific and placenta-specific gene expression. To investigate the mechanism of its tissue-specific expression, we have isolated up to 3 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking DNA and characterized the promoter of the gene for TEF-1. Multiple transcription start sites centering on a motif similar to the initiator element (Inr) were identified. A minimal promoter, which contains no recognizable TATA element but contains an Inr, delimited at −137 base pairs had full transcriptional activity both in vivo in HeLa cells and in vitro in HeLa cell extracts. This promoter is also highly active in vitro in lymphoid cell extracts, but not in vivo in lymphoid cell lines, which do not express the endogenous TEF-1 gene. The minimal promoter, which is sufficient to direct tissue-specific expression of the TEF-1 gene in vivo, contains multiple sites which bind the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and ATF-1. Mutation of the Inr completely abolished transcription from the major start site while transcription from the minor sites was slightly augmented. Inactivation of the proximal Sp1 site abolished transcription from the principle start site and increased transcription from a 5′ minor start site. Insertion of a TATA box element did not qualitatively alter the pattern of start site usage which seemed to be dependent upon integrity of the upstream Sp1 site. These observations suggest a “cross-talk” between the Inr and a proximal element to fix transcription start sites, which is independent of spacing and the presence of a TATA element.

Transcriptional enhancers comprise multiple enhansons which bind transcriptional activator proteins. These factors ultimately determine the tissue-specific and developmental expression pattern of a given gene as well as its ability to be directly induced or repressed by various stimuli (reviewed in (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Google Scholar) and (2Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Google Scholar)). Mutational analysis of the SV40 enhancer has allowed the identification of multiple overlapping enhansons which function in a cell-specific manner(3Fromental C. Kanno M. Nomiyama H. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 943-953Google Scholar, 4Ondek B. Gloss L. Herr W. Nature. 1988; 333: 40-45Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, activity of the SV40 enhancer depends upon synergistic action of proteins bound to the TC-II, SPH-I+II, GT-I, and GT-IIC enhansons(3Fromental C. Kanno M. Nomiyama H. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 943-953Google Scholar, 5Nomiyama H. Fromental C. Xiao J.H. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7881-7885Google Scholar, 6Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A.

Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Google Scholar, 38Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Ferrandon D. Rosales R. Vigneron M. Macchi M. Ruffenach F. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3005-3013Google Scholar). A cDNA for TEF-1 has been isolated and its mRNA shown to be in HeLa and F9 EC cells, but not in lymphoid (BJA-B and MPC-11) cells where an alternate set of factors are responsible for the activity of the SV40 enhancer(7Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). Furthermore TEF-1 cannot function in lymphoid cells possibly due to the presence of a factor which inhibits its stimulatory activity(39Chaudhary S. Brou C. Valentin M.E. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5290-5299Google Scholar). transcriptional enhancer factor-1 base pair(s) initiator element untranslated region. TEF-1 is the prototypic member of a new family of transcription factors delineated by a homologous DNA-binding domain, the TEA/ATTS domain (8Burglin T.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 11-12Google Scholar) which is highly conserved through evolution. A homolog of TEF-1, Scalloped, has been identified in Drosophila. Inactivation of this gene leads to multiple defects in sensory cells and certain subsets of neuroblasts(9Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. Raghavan V. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Google Scholar). Genes for TEF-1, and TEF-1-related factors, have now been isolated from mouse (10Blatt C. DePamphilis M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 747-748Google Scholar, 11Shimizu N. Smith G. Izumo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4103-4110Google Scholar) and chick(12Stewart A.F.R. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression pattern of these genes gives no clue as to their function. TEF-1 has been shown to be involved in regulation of the chick cardiac tropomyosin gene (12Stewart A.F.R. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar) and it may also be involved in regulation of the hCS-B gene(41Jaquemin P. Oury C. Peers B. Morin A. Belayew A. Martial J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 93-103Google Scholar). Moreover, TEF-1 has been implicated as a possible zygotic transcription factor, present in embryonic cells at the earliest developmental stages(13Melin F. Miranda M. Montreau N. DePamphilis M.L. Blangy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4657-4666Google Scholar). Inactivation of the mouse TEF-1 gene results in fetal death due to defects in cardiac maturation(16Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Google Scholar). Nevertheless a coherent picture of the role of TEF-1 has not emerged. In order to understand how spacial expression of the TEF-1 gene is controlled, we have cloned and begun to characterize the TEF-1 gene promoter. Here we delineate sequences important for high level expression of the gene and the sites of interaction with transcription factors within a defined minimal promoter region. The minimal promoter regions necessary for high activity both in vivo, in transfected HeLa cells, and in vitro are 80 and 137 bp, respectively, immediately 5′ to the transcription start site. The TEF-1 promoter contains binding sites for the ubiquitous factors Sp1 and ATF1, and functions with high efficiency in both HeLa and lymphoid cells in vitro, but retains very little activity when introduced into lymphoid cells. The promoter region contains no recognizable TATA element and high level transcription is dependent upon an intact initiator element (Inr) (19Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Google Scholar) and upstream proximal Sp1 site. We demonstrate how transcriptional start site selection in this gene is controlled to a large extent by Sp1 and not influenced by the presence of a TATA element that was introduced between the Sp1 site and the Inr. A genomic DNA library derived from human lymphocyte DNA cloned into the vector λEMBL3 was screened with a 40-bp oligonucleotide representing the 5′ extremity of the TEF-1 cDNA 5′-UTR(7Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). One positively hybridizing clone with an insert of approximately 13 kilobase pairs was isolated and subjected to restriction analysis. The digest was hybridized to the TEF-1 5′-UTR oligo which revealed a 3-kilobase pair EcoRI/NotI fragment, which was inserted into EcoRI and NotI sites in pBluescribe II SK+ and SK-. This clone was sequenced by the chain termination technique (46Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All DNA manipulations and cloning steps were carried out essentially as according to Sambrook et al.(17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A HindIII site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at +89 bp relative to a putative Inr and the resulting 2-kilobase pair KpnI/HindIII fragment was excised and cloned into the promoterless expression vector pAL4 (18Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Google Scholar), containing the human β-globin gene truncated to −9, to give pTΔ-1874. Further deletions of this construct were made using a combination of restriction sites and the polymerase chain reaction. The constructs pTΔ-530, pTΔ-455, pTΔ-365, pTΔ-178, pTΔ-156, and pTΔ-137 were constructed by cutting pTΔ-1874 with XhoI, HgiAI, HaeII, PvuII, BglI, and RsrII, respectively, followed by blunt-ending using T4 polymerase and restriction with HindIII (Fig. 1). pTΔ-80 and pTΔ-30 were constructed using polymerase chain reaction with relevant 5′ primers annealing at −80 and −30, respectively, in the TEF-1 promoter and a 3′ primer spanning the HindIII site at +89 T89 (see Table 1). The resulting fragments were subcloned into pAL4 cut with HindIII and SmaI. The polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were sequenced after subcloning to verify absence of errors. All constructs were purified through 2 rounds of CsCl gradients and used for both in vivo and in vitro analysis.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The template for site-directed mutagenesis, the template pTΔ-530SK-, was constructed by inserting a XhoI/EcoRI fragment from pTΔ-1874 (see above) into pBluescribe II SK-. Mutagenesis of the TEF-1 promoter was performed on antisense single-stranded DNA template derived from pTΔ-530SK- using the technique of Kunkel et al.(21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 154: 382-387Google Scholar). The mutated inserts were sequenced then re-introduced as RsrII blunt-ended/HindIII fragments into pAL4 cut with SmaI and HindIII. Sequences of oligonucleotides used in mutagenesis are detailed in Table 1. Invitro transcriptions (25 μl) contained 100 μg of nuclear extract from HeLa or MPC-11 cells(6Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Google Scholar), 50 ng of TEF-1 promoter template, 25 ng of internal control plasmid TATA-pAL7(18Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Google Scholar), 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.4 mM of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP. Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 24°C, then 150 μl of Stop buffer (0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 5 μg of yeast RNA) was added. Reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform and RNA was precipitated in ethanol. Transcripts were quantified using S1 nuclease analysis as described below. Growth of cells (HeLa and MPC-11) and transfections were carried essentially as described(3Fromental C. Kanno M. Nomiyama H. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 943-953Google Scholar, 5Nomiyama H. Fromental C. Xiao J.H. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7881-7885Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells and the murine plasmacytoma line MPC-11 were grown in 9-cm dishes to 30% confluence then transfected with 5 μg of reporter template, 1 μg of internal control template pG1B(3Fromental C. Kanno M. Nomiyama H. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 943-953Google Scholar), and carrier DNA (pBSII-SK-) to 20 μg, using the calcium phosphate technique(45Kanno M. Fromental C. Staub A. Ruffenach F. Davidson I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4205-4214Google Scholar). RNA was prepared 40 h post-transfection, and quantified by S1 nuclease analysis as described in (18Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Google Scholar), except 150 units of S1 nuclease (Appligene) were used in digestion reactions. For S1 nuclease mapping, an end-labeled single-stranded DNA probe from +69 in the β-globin gene to −178 in the TEF-1 promoter was prepared as described in (18Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Single-stranded DNA template was prepared by helper phage-mediated rescue from the vector pTΔ-530SK-. 32P-Labeled oligo M6 (18Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Google Scholar) was annealed to this template and extended using T7 DNA polymerase. Double-stranded DNA was cut with PvuII and the single-stranded probe was separated on a strand-separating gel(17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For analysis of the Inr mutant promoter, a single-stranded DNA probe was generated from a template containing the Inr mutation (see Table 1). Primer extension analysis was also carried out on transcripts isolated from HeLa cells transfected with pTΔ-1874. 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized to 20,000 cpm of end-labeled oligo M6 for 2 h at 35°C then elongated with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42°C for 1 h. Incubation conditions, buffer composition, and enzyme concentrations were as described(17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All S1 nuclease-digested transcripts derived from transfections and invitro transcription reactions and products of primer extension analysis were analyzed on 8% sequencing gels alongside sequences generated from pTΔ-530SK- primed with oligo M6 as well as 32P-labeled pBR322/HpaII molecular weight markers. 30 μg of HeLa, BJA-B, or MPC-11 cell nuclear extract(6Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Google Scholar), in a final volume of 20 μl of in vitro transcription buffer was incubated with 20,000 cpm of an end-labeled fragment of the TEF-1 promoter (−137 to +89), excised from pTΔ-137 with HindIII and EcoRI, for 30 min at 24°C followed by digestion with DNase I (Boehringer) for 2 min. DNase I concentrations were determined empirically but were generally in the range 0.01-0.1 mg/ml. Incubations were terminated by addition of 150 μl of in vitro transcription stop buffer. Samples were phenol/chloroform extracted and DNA was ethanol precipitated and separated on a 8% sequencing gel alongside molecular weight and Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing markers(20Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays containing 5 μg of nuclear extract in 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI)•poly(dC) (Pharmacia) as well as cold competitor oligonucleotide or antisera where indicated, were incubated on ice for 10 min then equilibrated to room temperature. 15,000 cpm (approximately 10-15 fmol) of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was added and incubations were continued for a further 20 min. Samples were run on 6% acrylamide (29:1 cross-linking ratio) gels in 0.5 × TBE(17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), then dried and autoradiographed. Antisera to Sp1 and ATF factors were generous gifts from Dr. Stephen Jackson and Dr. Michael Green, respectively. Sequences of oligonucleotides used as probes and competitors are detailed in Table 1. We identified a sequence with 9 out of 11 identity with the Inr element previously identified by Smale et al.(19Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2E) 1874 bp downstream of the KpnI site identified in the TEF-1 5′-region. A HindIII site was introduced approximately 90 bp downstream of this element and the KpnI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into pAL4 to give pTΔ-1874. S1 nuclease and primer extension mapping of RNA isolated from HeLa cells transfected with pTΔ-1874 (Fig. 2, A and B) shows multiple transcription start sites centered around a putative Inr element (summarized in Fig. 2D). The 1-2 bp offset of start sites seen between S1 nuclease and primer extension analysis is artifactual due to the action of S1 nuclease. A genuine representation of start site positioning is given by the primer extension analysis, however, because the GC-rich 5′-UTR caused frequent pausing of the reverse transcriptase, quantization using reverse transcription was less reproducible. We therefore used S1 nuclease analysis for the rest of this study and the major start site seen using S1 nuclease mapping was designated +1. Mutation of the Inr (Fig. 2E and Table 1) abolished transcription from the site at +1 but transcription from the other sites was relatively unaffected, although some augmentation of transcription from the minor site at −11 was observed (Fig. 2, C and D). The sequence from −400 to +174 is highly GC-rich (76% GC). Strikingly there is no apparent TATA element near the major start site nor downstream of it. The proportion of GC nucleotides both 5′ and 3′ to the start site would also rule out the possibility of a cryptic TATA box such as that identified in the adenovirus IVa2 promoter(22Carcamo J. Maldonado E. Cortes P. Ah M.H. Ha I. Case Y. Flint J. Reinberg D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1611-1622Google Scholar). The sequences immediately 5′ to the start site up to −156 contain multiple putative consensus binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and ATF/CREB. The sequences immediately surrounding the TEF-1 Inr (−40 to +30) have been previously described(47Lescure A. Lutz Y. Eberhard D. Jacq X. Krol A. Grummt I. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1166-1175Google Scholar). The complete sequence and chromosomal location of the TEF-1 5′-flanking region will be published elsewhere. In order to define minimal sequences necessary to support high level transcription, the TEF-1 5′-flanking sequence was deleted from −1874 to −30 (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). These deleted constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, which express the TEF-1 gene, and MPC-11 cells which do not. When transfected into HeLa cells, TEF-1 promoter constructs bearing progressive deletions of 5′ DNA from −1874 to −137 had similar transcriptional activity, although the −365 and −455 deletions had an approximately 2-fold higher activity than other deletions (Fig. 3, A and E), indicating the possible presence of alternate positive and negative regulatory motifs. The −80 deletion still retained appreciable promoter activity (Fig. 3, A, lane 8, and E) when transcription levels were normalized against the β-globin internal control but deletion to −30 almost completely abolished transcriptional activity (Fig. 3A, lane 9). In vitro analysis of these constructs using HeLa cell nuclear extract, revealed marked differences in activity (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4) in comparison to that seen by in vivo analysis. These differences may be artifactual in nature because variation in relative levels of transcription was seen when the quantity of template DNA in the in vitro reaction was altered (results not shown). Also it should be noted that the mutant TEF-1 promoter deleted to −80 is almost inactive in vitro in comparison to its activity in vivo (compare Fig. 3E and Fig. 3, A, lane 8, with Fig. 3B, lane 8). To analyze activity of TEF-1 promoter deletion mutants in cells which do not express the endogenous gene, the deletion constructs were transfected into MPC-11 cells (Fig. 3C) and analyzed in vitro using MPC-11 cell nuclear extract (Fig. 3D). After normalization against levels of β-globin internal control transcripts, the level of activity of all constructs when transfected into MPC-11 cells ranged from between 3.3 and 18.4-fold less than corresponding levels in HeLa cells (Fig. 3, C and E), indicating that when introduced as a transgene, the promoter was able to direct cell specific expression, albeit at a lower level of selectivity than the endogenous gene. In contrast, all of these deletions up to −137 had high activity in vitro in MPC-11 cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 3D) and also in BJA-B cell extracts (results not shown). The above results define a minimal promoter element extending to −80 which functions in a tissue-specific manner in vivo, −137 but not in vitro. To further investigate this we wished to identify trans-acting factors which bind to the TEF-1 proximal promoter. DNase I footprinting of the proximal region of the TEF-1 promoter revealed 4 major protected motifs (see Fig. 4and Fig. 7for summary) between −37 and −55, −58 and −73, −83 and −100, and a footprint at −109, the 5′ end of which was undetermined because of its proximity to the labeled end of the probe possibly due to proteins which bind nonspecifically to the ends of DNA in such experiments. The protected sequences are summarized in Fig. 4B. DNase I-hypersensitive sites were found associated with footprint A at −36 and −33 and with footprint C at −82 and −81 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Both footprints A and C with their associated hypersensitive sites were abolished when double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor Awt (Table 1) spanning footprint A was included in the footprint reaction (Fig. 4A, lanes 3-5). Oligo Amut1, where A(49) was changed to G to create a canonical Sp1 site (23Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Google Scholar) was also an efficient competitor of protein binding to footprints A and C (Fig. 4A, lanes 8-10). In contrast, oligo Amut2, where the putative Sp1 binding site was replaced with a BamHI restriction site (see Table 1), failed to compete out footprints A and C (Fig. 4A, lanes 13-15).Figure 7:Sequence of the 5′-regulatory region of the TEF-1 promoter from −160 to +89. DNA-binding motifs are double underlined and the S1 nuclease-mapped major transcription start site, +1, is shown in bold underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Footprints B and D were not abolished by competition with any of the oligonucleotides described above. Regions B and D contain exact consensus sites for members of the cAMP-inducible CREB/ATF factor families (CREs) (24Ziff E.B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 69-72Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B and 7). Box D also contains a good consensus Sp1 binding site close to the putative CRE (Figs. 4B and 7), but no competition with any of the A oligos was seen. This may be due to the fact that this motif was too close to the end of the probe or that proteins binding elsewhere within region D prevented protein binding to the putative Sp1 recognition site. To identify proteins binding within protected regions of the TEF-1 promoter we employed the gel retardation assay in combination with antibodies against known transcription factors to “supershift” or abolish retarded bands. Incubation of labeled oligo A with HeLa, BJA-B, or MPC-11 nuclear extracts gave rise to 2 major retarded bands of identical mobility (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3). Identical retarded complexes were formed when oligo C, spanning footprint C (−77 to −106) was used as a probe (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6). Footprint A spans a motif known to bind Sp1 and related factors(23Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Google Scholar, 25Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar). An anti-Sp1 antibody inhibited the formation of DNA-protein complexes on oligo A after incubation with HeLa cell nuclear extract (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). This was also seen with complexes formed on oligo C (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). Additionally recombinant Sp1 formed a complex of identical mobility to those formed by proteins in HeLa nuclear extract with both oligos A and C (Fig. 5B, lane 5, and results not shown). We therefore conclude that Sp1 is one of the proteins which binds to motifs within regions A and C in the TEF-1 promoter. Interestingly, the sequence within region C, although GC-rich does not contain a site previously shown to be a binding motif for Sp1. The identity of the faster migrating minor complex formed by nuclear proteins with oligos A and C (see Fig. 5A) has not been identified. It may be a fragment generated by proteolytic degradation of the nuclear extracts, which would also explain why the minor band was abolished by the anti-Sp1 antibody. Alternatively the lower band seen in Fig. 5A may represent the Sp1-related protein Sp2 (25Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar). Gel retardation analysis of proteins binding within footprints B and D using oligonucleotides spanning these regions revealed binding of retarded complexes of identical mobility to oligos B (−56/−73) and D (−125/−127) (see Table 1). Both of these regions contain exact consensus sites for transcription factors belonging to the ATF/CREB family. Incubation of labeled oligo B with HeLa, BJA-B, or MPC-11 nuclear extracts gave rise to retarded bands of identical mobility (Fig. 5C, lanes 1-3). Identical retarded complexes were formed when oligo D was used as a probe (results not shown). Inclusion of anti-ATF1 resulted in supershifting of DNA protein complexes formed by both oligos B and D with HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 5D, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5), but not with anti-ATF2 (CRE-BP1) (Fig. 5D, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6). To determine the role of the proximal upstream element in determining the activity of the TEF-1 promoter, a point mutation creating a BamHI site was introduced by substituting residues between −45 and −54 (see Table 1and Fig. 6A) to generate pTΔ-138ΔSp1. Both in vivo and in vitro, this mutation abolished transcription from the major site at +1 but augmented transcription 2- and 3.6-fold, respectively, from a minor site at −11 (Fig. 6, B, and C, lanes1 and 2). The effect of introducing a TATA element into the proximal promoter of TEF-1 was examined. The TATA element and flanking sequences from the adenovirus major late promoter was inserted between the Inr and proximal upstream element to create pTΔ-138TATA (see Fig. 6A). This mutation also altered relative spacing between the Sp1 site, inserted TATA element, and Inr such that each was equidistant from the other by 30 bp and that the Sp1 site and Inr were 60 bp apart instead of 45 bp. In vitro, this mutation had the effect of dramatically increasing transcription from +1 and the downstream sites, but abolished transcription from the upstream sites (Fig. 6C, lane 3). In vivo transcription from +1 remained unchanged and transcription from all the minor sites was abolished (Fig. 6B, lane 3). When the proximal Sp1 site was deleted from pTΔ-138TATA, a shift in transcription start sites similar to that seen with the upstream mutation alone was observed. In vivo, the TATA insertion had only a marginal effect on the pattern and level of transcription when compared to that seen with the upstream element mutation alone (Fig. 6B, lane 4). In vitro, increased transcription associated with the TATA box insertion was seen, but transcription was initiated only at the −11 site (Fig. 6C, lane 4). Taken together these results suggest that the proximal Sp1 site is dominant over a TATA element in determining the transcription start site, even when a high affinity TATA sequence is used. Furthermore, these observations indicate that a TATA element may be redundant for maintaining high levels of transcription from a promoter which can function without one. We have isolated 3 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking DNA of the human TEF-1 gene and have delineated cis-acting sequences necessary for high level transcription of this gene. The minimal promoter consists of 80 bp of 5′-flanking DNA in vivo although 137 bp is required in vitro. This region contains multiple recognition motifs for the transcription factors Sp1 and ATF1. The upstream Sp1 site between −83 and −100 is atypical of any so far identified. The TEF-1 promoter resembles that of many housekee"

Induction of IL-2 gene expression in human lymphoid cell populations, elicited upon mitogenic stimulation, yields a transient wave of mRNA(3Efrat S. Pilo S. Kaempfer R.

Levels of IL-2 mRNA rise an order of magnitude upon depletion of CD8 cells or after low doses of γ-irradiation(5Ketzinel M. Efrat S. Sayar D. Gerez L. Tal C. Deutsch E. Arad G. Kaempfer R. Scand. J.

Concomitant with the induction of IL-2 gene expression, mitogenic stimulation induces a transient activation of cells, including the CD8 subset, possessing the ability to effectively inhibit the expression of these genes(5Ketzinel M. Efrat S. Sayar D. Gerez L. Tal C. Deutsch E. Arad G. Kaempfer R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 33: 593-605Google Scholar, 8Arad G. Ketzinel M. Tal C. Nussinovich R. Deutsch E. Schlesinger M. Gerez L. Kaempfer R. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 160: 240-247Google Scholar). Induction of IL-2 mRNA largely precedes the appearance of inhibitory cell activity, allowing expression to occur before a dominant state of suppression is established(5Ketzinel M. Efrat S. Sayar D. Gerez L. Tal C. Deutsch E. Arad G. Kaempfer R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 33: 593-605Google Scholar). In addition to being sensitive to suppression by CD8 cells, expression of IL-2 mRNA can be superinduced extensively by inhibitors of translation such as cycloheximide (CHX) (4Efrat S. Kaempfer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2601-2605Google Scholar, 9Efrat S. Zelig S. Yagen B. Kaempfer R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 842-848Google Scholar) without any increase in the rate of primary transcription(10Kronke M. Leonard J. Depper J.M. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1593-1598Google Scholar, 11Shaw J. Meerovitch K. Elliott J.F. Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 409-419Google Scholar). These results show that during induction, the strength of the mRNA signal is greatly reduced by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Together with cell-mediated suppression, this control mechanism causes the IL-2 gene to be expressed to only a small proportion of its full potential, thereby rendering expression particularly sensitive to regulation by external signals. Stability of IL-2 mRNA is sensitive to the nature of the inducer, increasing upon exposure of cells to CD28 monoclonal antibodies(12Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Google Scholar). AUUUA motifs in the 3′-untranslated region of a number of cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNA species contribute to their instability(13Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar, 14Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Google Scholar); inhibition of translation led to stabilization of these mRNAs. Such sequences are also found in IL-2 mRNA. Bovine IL-2 mRNA was stable in extract from fibroblasts yet unstable in extract from bovine lymphocytes where stability could be increased by pretreatment of cells with CHX(15Reeves R. Elton T.S. Nissen M.S. Lehn D. Johnson K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6531-6535Google Scholar). Stability of IL-2 mRNA thus may be controlled in a cell-specific manner. Destabilization of c-fos, c-myc, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA requires translation of their open reading frames(16Wisdom R. Lee W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 232-243Google Scholar, 17Koeller D.M. Horowitz J.A. Casey J.L. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7778-7782Google Scholar, 18Aharon T. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1971-1980Google Scholar). CD28, moreover, caused stabilization of IL-2, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA but not of c-fos and c-myc mRNA despite the presence of AUUUA motifs in each (12Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Google Scholar). These results show that sequences other than the AUUUA motif are involved in regulating mRNA stability(19Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Google Scholar). Here, we have analyzed the nature of the CHX-sensitive mechanism that inhibits IL-2 gene expression in human lymphoid cell populations. This inhibition, we show, is based primarily on a block in post-transcriptional processing of nuclear precursor transcripts that develops shortly after the onset of induction. Long before transcription of the IL-2 gene begins to decline, further generation of new IL-2 mRNA molecules is thus prevented. The induced mRNA is unstable and in the absence of further formation, its decay generates a transient wave of mRNA. In the presence of CHX, little, if any, stabilization of IL-2 mRNA is observed. Instead, processing of IL-2 precursor transcripts is greatly facilitated, resulting in extensive superinduction of cytoplasmic mRNA. Human tonsil primary cells were prepared as described(4Efrat S. Kaempfer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2601-2605Google Scholar). PBMC were separated from buffy coat from healthy donors on Ficoll Paque (Pharmacia) and washed three times with 50 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were resuspended at a density of 4 × 106/ml and preincubated overnight at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids, 100 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 × 10-5M 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 40 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5 μg/ml nystatin. Induction was with 4% PHA (PHA-P, Difco); where indicated, CHX (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, emetine (Sigma) was added to 10 μg/ml, actinomycin D (Merck) was added to 10 μg/ml, or cyclosporin A (Sandoz) was added to 1 μg/ml. Cell viability was followed by trypan blue exclusion. A 588-base pair XbaI-MscI fragment of IL-2 genomic DNA (20Holbrook N.J. Smith K.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Comeau C.M. Wiskocil R.L. Crabtree G.R.

Plasmid DNA was digested with XbaI and transcribed using [α-32P]UTP to generate labeled antisense RNA transcript SC1. A 415-nt β-actin probe was transcribed from cDNA inserted into pBS under the T3 promoter. A 650-base pair fragment of IL-2 cDNA excised from plasmid p-316 (21Taniguchi T. Matsui H. Fujita T. Takaoka C. Kashima W. Yoshimoto R. Hamuro J. Nature. 1983; 302: 305-310Google Scholar) was labeled by nick translation to generate cDNA probe. Extraction of total RNA, agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and hybridization analysis were done as described(22Lebendiker M.A. Tal C. Sayar D. Pilo S. Eilon A. Banai Y. Kaempfer R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 585-589Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl method (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar) or by guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol extraction(24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). To prepare nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions, nuclei and cytoplasm were separated (25Weil D. Brosset S. Dautry F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5865-5875Google Scholar) before RNA extraction by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl method. RNase protection analysis (26Lowe W.L. Roberts C.T. Lasky S.R. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8946-8950Google Scholar) was performed using genomic riboprobe SC1. Aliquots of 5 μg of extracted RNA were hybridized at 42°C with 106 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA probe in 30 μl of 80% formamide, 40 mM Pipes, pH 6.7, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.4 M NaCl. After 18 h, 300 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, and 300 mM NaCl containing 1.4 μg/ml of RNase A and 0.07 μg/ml of RNase T1 were added, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 30°C. The mixture was then brought to 0.075% SDS and digested for 15 min at 37°C with 20 μg of proteinase K. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of Escherichia coli MRE600 tRNA. Protected RNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 8 M urea/5% polyacrylamide gels. Size markers were generated by MspI or HinfI digestion of pGEM-3 DNA and filling in with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP, respectively. Nuclei from 2.8 × 108 PBMC were isolated from cells washed with RPMI 1640 medium by preincubating for 10 min on ice in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM EDTA) before cell disruption by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in hypotonic buffer, layered over hypotonic buffer/25% glycerol, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended into 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer/25% glycerol, counted, and diluted to a final concentration of 2 × 108/ml. Elongation of nascent RNA was for 30 min at 30°C in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM spermidine, 35 units of RNasin, and 1 mM each of CTP, ATP, GTP) in the presence of 160 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. After treatment with DNase I (0.02 units/ml) for 15 min at 30°C and proteinase K (0.3 mg/ml) for 30 min at 42°C, labeled RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The RNA was applied to a nitrocellulose filter that was dried and then incubated for 30 min at 30°C in a solution of 5 units/ml of DNase I in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2. After the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.03% and the addition of EDTA to 0.5 mM, incubation of the RNA filter was continued for 10 min at 65°C. RNA was extracted in 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, made 0.1 M in NaCl, and precipitated with ethanol. Aliquots of 106 cpm of labeled RNA were hybridized to cDNAs dot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters. Addition of CHX to a culture of human tonsil cells 4 h after the onset of induction by PHA led to extensive superinduction of IL-2 mRNA, by at least 30-fold (Fig. 1A). Kinetics of a similar superinduction experiment are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The effect of CHX was to increase the amplitude of the induced wave of IL-2 mRNA. Even in the presence of CHX, however, the level of IL-2 mRNA declined promptly after reaching its maximum. The rate of decline during superinduction was similar to that seen during normal induction (Fig. 1C). In Fig. 2A, induction of IL-2 mRNA was followed by RNase protection analysis using a 608-nt antisense RNA probe in which 117 nt are complementary to a portion of exon 3 and are thus protected by mature mRNA (cf. Fig. 9D). Induction of a culture of PBMC yielded a wave of IL-2 mRNA sequences that reached its maximum by 6-8 h, considerably earlier than in tonsil cells (Fig. 1), and then declined promptly (Fig. 2, A and C). Addition of CHX at 4 h yielded a pronounced superinduction of mRNA. Unlike for tonsil cells, however, CHX-mediated superinduction in PBMC was sustained; high levels of mRNA persisted up to 24 h (Fig. 2, A and C). A similar result was obtained when the translation inhibitor, emetine, was used (Fig. 2, B and D). When CHX (4Efrat S. Kaempfer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2601-2605Google Scholar) or emetine (Fig. 2B) was added at the start of induction together with PHA, expression of IL-2 mRNA was prevented.Figure 9:Accumulation of IL-2 precursor transcripts during induction. PBMC were induced with PHA. Total RNA, extracted at times shown, was subjected to RNase protection analysis using IL-2 probe SC1 (D) to measure precursor transcripts (pre-mRNA) (▴) and mRNA (○) (A-C). Autoradiogram (A) was quantitated by microdensitometry (B). In C, the amount of IL-2 precursor transcripts and mRNA, corrected for content of U residues, is plotted as the percentage of total IL-2 RNA present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The primary transcription rate of the IL-2 gene in the cell population that showed a strong superinduction response to CHX in Fig. 2A was studied by nuclear run-on analysis (Fig. 3). In agreement with earlier reports(10Kronke M. Leonard J. Depper J.M. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1593-1598Google Scholar, 11Shaw J. Meerovitch K. Elliott J.F. Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 409-419Google Scholar), there was no perceptible change in the rate of transcription in the presence of CHX. Transcription of β-actin and rRNA genes, though induced by PHA, also did not respond to CHX. In the cell culture that did not receive CHX, moreover, the rate of transcription increased after the onset of induction and then was sustained up to at least 24 h, even though by this time expression of IL-2 mRNA had returned to basal levels (Fig. 2A). Indeed, while transcription occurred at a high rate at 8 h (Fig. 3), IL-2 mRNA declined strongly by 9 h (Fig. 2A). These results show that transcription continues well beyond the time when the mRNA wave has reached its maximum, yet does not result in further accumulation of mRNA. Thus, a post-transcriptional mechanism prevents expression of IL-2 mRNA late in induction. This control is sensitive to CHX. Indeed, the addition of CHX throughout induction, from 4 h onwards, elicited a prompt and significant superinduction of IL-2 mRNA at essentially the same rate both during the transient wave of mRNA and well after it had subsided (Fig. 4, B and D). Superinduction lasted for up to 55 h (Fig. 4, A and C). This prolonged responsiveness to CHX is explained by the sustained transcription of the IL-2 gene shown in Fig. 3. In the experiment of Fig. 5A, CHX-mediated superinduction of IL-2 mRNA (117-nt band) was especially pronounced at 24 h. This superinduction was prevented when actinomycin D was added simultaneously with CHX (Fig. 5, A and C). Addition of CHX after the wave of IL-2 mRNA had subsided (at 24 h) elicited extensive expression of IL-2 mRNA (Fig. 5, B and D; cf. Fig. 4); this rise in mRNA was blocked likewise by actinomycin D. Cyclosporin A, a transcription inhibitor specific for IL-2 and certain other cytokine genes, strongly reduced the superinduction response to CHX but did not block it completely (Fig. 6). Thus, superinduction of IL-2 mRNA by CHX depends on synthesis of new RNA molecules.Figure 6:Inhibition of superinduction of IL-2 mRNA by cyclosporin A. PBMC were induced with PHA (○). CHX was added at 4 h (•, ▪). Cyclosporin A (CsA) (100 ng/ml) was added at 0 h (×) or 4 h (▪) as shown. Cell viability remained constant. Total RNA, extracted at times shown, was subjected to RNase protection analysis using probe SC1. Autoradiogram (A) was quantitated by microdensitometry (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results of Fig. 5and Fig. 6show that superinduction elicited by CHX requires continuing transcription. Late in induction, vigorous transcription of the IL-2 gene takes place (Fig. 3) but does not yield mRNA (Fig. 2A). Because the rate of transcription is unaffected by CHX (Fig. 3), the dependence of superinduction on transcription could suggest that CHX acts to stabilize newly synthesized mRNA molecules, as shown for c-fos, c-myc, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA(13Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar, 27Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Google Scholar, 28Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Google Scholar). However, the observation in Fig. 1C that in tonsil cells, superinduction of IL-2 mRNA by CHX is followed by a prompt decline of the mRNA wave suggests that stabilization of mRNA cannot be the sole basis of superinduction. As seen in Fig. 5C, the rate of decay of IL-2 mRNA in the presence of actinomycin D was not affected perceptibly by CHX. To examine this point further, we studied the effect of actinomycin D on the decay of IL-2 mRNA during normal induction (Fig. 7). Addition of actinomycin D together with PHA prevented the appearance of the mRNA wave. Addition at a later time (just before the mRNA wave declined) did not elicit significantly more rapid decay than in the untreated control (Fig. 7B). This result shows that IL-2 mRNA is unstable during induction and that the decline of the mRNA wave reflects mRNA decay. It lends independent support to the conclusion from Fig. 2A and 3 that few, if any, new mRNA molecules are generated once the wave has reached its maximum. Addition of actinomycin D also induced a decline in IL-2 mRNA in a cell population that was first superinduced with CHX and that expressed high levels of mRNA (Fig. 8). Together with the data from Fig. 1and 5C, these results indicate that stabilization of IL-2 mRNA by CHX, if it occurs, is insufficient to explain the extent of superinduction. In Fig. 9, induction of both IL-2 mRNA and precursor transcripts was followed by RNase protection analysis using the 608-nt antisense RNA probe shown in Fig. 9D, complementary to 117 nt from exon 3 and 471 nt from intron 3. Precursor transcripts containing intron 3 protect a 588-nt labeled RNA fragment, whereas spliced RNA (mRNA) protects a 117-nt band (Fig. 9A). Induction of PBMC yielded a wave of IL-2 mRNA that reached its maximum at 6 h and then declined rapidly, returning to almost basal levels by 10 h (Fig. 9A). Precursor transcripts reached their maximum earlier (by 3 h), as would be expected for a precursor-product relationship; their level declined between 3 and 6 h concomitant with a rise in mRNA (Fig. 9, A and B). In contrast to the highly transient expression of mRNA, however, the expression of precursor transcripts was more sustained, continuing well beyond the time when the mRNA level had declined completely. Indeed, even though their level declined gradually, precursor transcripts strongly predominated over mRNA from 10 h onwards (Fig. 9C). Expression of precursor transcripts persisted up to 25 h, in good agreement with the conclusions from Fig. 3-6 that active transcription was still ongoing 24 h after induction yet did not result in accumulation of mRNA. These results suggest that processing of precursor transcripts occurs during the early phases of induction but then becomes inhibited. In Fig. 10A, changes in levels of precursor transcripts and of mRNA were measured concurrently during exposure to CHX. In the absence of CHX, the induced wave of mRNA subsided after 8 h. Although in this experiment precursor transcripts were not detected during the mRNA wave, they had become prominent by 24 h, at which time little, if any, mRNA remained. Addition of CHX at 4 h led to a prompt and extensive superinduction of mRNA lasting at least 24 h. This increase in mRNA was accompanied first by an increase in precursor transcripts observed at 8 h and then by their decline. By 24 h, precursor transcripts were clearly present in the control, yet they were no longer observed in superinduced cells. Thus, superinduction of mRNA by CHX is accompanied by a disappearance of precursor transcripts. This point is reinforced by analysis of the data on precursor transcripts shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5A, precursors (588-nt band) are seen early (before the peak of mRNA), as in Fig. 9A, and again late (at 24 h) after expression of mRNA has ceased, as in Fig. 10A. Addition of CHX at 4 h (Fig. 5A, 3 lanes on the right) led to enhanced processing of precursors into mRNA. In Fig. 5B, precursors were prominent at 24 h, whereas mRNA had declined by that time, consistent with the data of Fig. 5A, 9A, and 10A. In the experiment of Fig. 5B, precursors declined strongly between 24 and 28 h, showing that when they are not processed into mRNA, precursors are degraded. In the presence of CHX, however, precursor transcripts, most of them newly synthesized, were converted efficiently into spliced mRNA. Thus, although in Fig. 5B CHX was added late (at 24 h), the same course of events is observed as when CHX was added at 4 h: an enhanced flow of precursor transcripts into mRNA. In Fig. 10B, the induction and the fate of precursor transcripts were studied in the nuclear compartment. Concomitant with the superinduction of cytoplasmic mRNA in the presence of CHX (Fig. 10C), there was a pronounced decline in nuclear precursor transcripts (588-nt band) at 9 h (Fig. 10B), as would be expected if processing were enhanced. Indeed, superinduction of mRNA in the cytoplasm was accompanied by a complete disappearance of precursor transcripts from the nucleus, indicating that post-transcriptional processing of precursor transcripts into mRNA was greatly facilitated. During induction in the absence of CHX, abundant amounts of shorter RNA fragments accumulated in nuclei between 4 and 9 h (Fig. 10B). Consistent with the data in Fig. 5B and 9A, this result shows that when they are not processed into mature mRNA, precursor transcripts are degraded in the nucleus. In the presence of CHX, these fragments were altogether absent (Fig. 10B). This result indicates that during superinduction, the amount of precursor transcripts that was converted into mRNA actually exceeded the sum total of protected 588-nt RNA and shorter fragments remaining in the untreated control by 9 h. Such extensive processing of precursor transcripts upon the addition of CHX is also reflected by the extent of concomitant superinduction of cytoplasmic mRNA (Fig. 10C). In the control induced for 9 h, nuclear RNA was composed mainly of precursor transcripts and degradation products, but in the presence of CHX, the predominant species was mature mRNA (117-nt band in Fig. 10B). This shift into mRNA within the nucleus is consistent with the conclusion that enhanced processing of precursor transcripts had occurred during superinduction. Induction of human IL-2 gene expression results in the appearance of a transient wave of mRNA. Our results show that few, if any, new mRNA molecules are generated once the wave has reached its maximum. Yet transcription continues unabated well beyond this point but fails to yield more IL-2 mRNA. Instead, IL-2 precursor transcripts accumulate. During induction, precursor transcripts are expressed to low levels, well below those of mature mRNA. Late in induction, however, after the wave of mRNA has subsided, precursor transcripts constitute the majority of expressed IL-2 RNA molecules (Fig. 9C). The decline of the wave reflects the subsequent decay of unstable IL-2 mRNA. The accumulation of precursor transcripts is surprising. These molecules should either be processed into mRNA or be degraded. Premature termination of transcription cannot account for the accumulation, because the probe used in this study covers a 3′-proximal portion of the IL-2 gene (exon 3-intron 3). Instead, our results demonstrate that processing of functional IL-2 precursor transcripts becomes inhibited in the course of induction and that this inhibition constitutes a major element of control. Expression of IL-2 mRNA can be superinduced extensively in the presence of the inhibitors of translation(4Efrat S. Kaempfer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2601-2605Google Scholar, 9Efrat S. Zelig S. Yagen B. Kaempfer R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 842-848Google Scholar), as shown here for CHX and emetine. Superinduction results in an increase in the amplitude and duration of the mRNA wave. In principle, this superinduction could result from increased transcription, from stabilization of precursor transcripts and/or mRNA, or from enhanced processing of precursor transcripts. The superinduction of IL-2 mRNA is completely dependent upon de novo transcription (Fig. 5, 6, and 8), yet the rate of transcription does not change perceptibly when CHX is present (Fig. 3). Addition of CHX late in induction, after the wave of IL-2 mRNA has returned to basal levels, also results in a strong increase in mRNA; this process equally requires synthesis of new RNA molecules (Fig. 5). On the other hand, significant stabilization of IL-2 mRNA was not detected (Fig. 1, 5-8). Even if it occurs, stabilization of mRNA by CHX is too limited to account for the observed extent of superinduction. These observations indicate that the rate of synthesis of new IL-2 RNA molecules is not changed in the presence of CHX but that the formation of IL-2 mRNA is greatly enhanced. Indeed, we show here that superinduction of IL-2 mRNA by CHX results from enhanced processing of precursor transcripts. Concomitant with a strong increase in mature mRNA, addition of CHX causes a disappearance of precursors (Fig. 5and 10). Although precursor transcripts are stable enough to accumulate during normal induction (Fig. 5A and 9A), it cannot be argued that they are degraded more rapidly in conditions of superinduction, because levels of mature IL-2 mRNA increase extensively when CHX is present. Indeed, given that AUUUA motifs found in the 3′-untranslated region of IL-2 mRNA are also present in IL-2 precursor transcripts, greater not lesser stability might be expected in the presence of CHX. The decline in precursor transcripts observed in the presence of CHX thus must be based on more efficient processing into mRNA. The same response, enhanced processing, is observed whether CHX is added early or late during induction. Apparently, the flow of newly synthesized precursor transcripts into mature IL-2 mRNA becomes inhibited in the course of induction by a mechanism involving a labile protein. This post-transcriptional block is relieved when translation is inhibited. The level of precursor transcripts in the cell is determined by a dynamic balance between synthesis, processing, and degradation. Because of this transient nature, the pool size of precursor transcripts remains limited. Yet when a block in processing develops, a significant increase in precursor transcripts can be observed (Fig. 5, A and B, and 10, A and B). Accumulation of precursor transcripts is, however, not sustained owing to the instability of these molecules (Fig. 5B). When they are not processed into mature mRNA, precursor transcripts are degraded (Fig. 5B and 9A) in the nucleus (Fig. 10B). During superinduction, a transient rise in precursor transcripts precedes their disappearance (Fig. 10A), suggesting that the stability of these RNA molecules may be increased in conditions that permit their processing. The demonstration that excision of intron 3 from IL-2 precursor transcripts is highly regulated does not necessarily imply that excision of introns 1 and 2 is controlled in parallel. This question will require further study. Clearly, regulation of the excision of intron 3 is sufficient to effectively control the conversion of precursor transcripts into IL-2 mRNA. Despite the fact that PHA induces transcription of the β-actin gene (Fig. 3), levels of β-actin mRNA did not change perceptibly during induction or superinduction (Fig. 2and Fig. 10). In PHA-induced PBMC, the steady state level of β-actin mRNA greatly exceeds that of IL-2 mRNA, yet the increase in transcription of the β-actin gene during induction remains below that for the IL-2 gene. The additional β-actin gene transcription induced by PHA may be too low to affect the pool size of stable β-actin mRNA. Our results permit analysis of the question why mitogenic induction results in the appearance of a transient wave of IL-2 mRNA, a phenomenon generally observed for cytokine genes. Transcriptional shutoff of the IL-2 gene cannot be the explanation of transient expression, since transcription is sustained at a high rate during and well beyond the time when the wave is subsiding (Fig. 2and Fig. 3). The possibility that IL-2 mRNA becomes unstable during induction near the time when the mRNA wave has reached its maximum, with the rate of decay exceeding the rate of mRNA formation, can be rejected on the basis of our results showing that in the presence of CHX, no significant stabilization of IL-2 mRNA can be detected. This is seen especially well in tonsil cells (Fig. 1), where the wave of mRNA develops more slowly than in PBMC, apparently reaching its maximum only a short time before transcription of the IL-2 gene ceases. This leaves explanations based on destabilization of precursor transcripts or inhibition of post-transcriptional processing. The results of Fig. 5, 9, and 10 demonstrate the accumulation of precursor transcripts at and beyond the time when the wave of mRNA is declining. These results do not support destabilization of precursor transcripts. Instead, precursor transcripts disappear in the presence of CHX, when mRNA levels increase greatly (Fig. 5and Fig. 10), showing that processing is facilitated. Our results demonstrate that a block in processing develops in the course of normal induction, resulting in the accumulation of precursor transcripts that are subsequently degraded (Fig. 5B, 9, and 10B). Due to its intrinsic instability, the existing pool of IL-2 mRNA decays and a wave of mRNA is generated. Once transcription has been induced, the primary mechanism regulating IL-2 gene expression thus is at the level of precursor RNA processing. There are few good examples of this type of regulation. Facilitation of post-transcriptional processing was suggested to be the basis for increased expression of thymidine kinase mRNA at the onset of DNA synthesis during the cell cycle. Quiescent cells, accordingly, would lack a factor required for processing of precursor transcripts that becomes available at the G1/S boundary(29Gudas J.M. Knight G.B. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4705-4709Google Scholar). Suppression of class I major histocompatibility gene expression after adenovirus 12 transformation is apparently caused by an inhibition of processing of the mRNA in the nucleus; as in the case of the IL-2 gene studied here, no changes in transcription rate or stability of mRNA were detected(30Vaessen R.T.M.J. Houweling A. van der Eb A.J. Science. 1987; 235: 1486-1488Google Scholar). Processing of precursor transcripts was shown to regulate retinoic acid-induced expression of the IL-1β gene(31Jarrous N. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23141-23149Google Scholar). Most IL-1β gene transcription fails to yield mature mRNA. When translation is blocked, e.g. by CHX, processing of unstable IL-1β precursor transcripts into mature mRNA is greatly facilitated, resulting in a superinduction of IL-1β mRNA by 2 orders of magnitude. Pre-mRNA processing thus is a limiting step in retinoic acid-induced IL-1β gene expression(31Jarrous N. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23141-23149Google Scholar). Studies of processing of precursor transcripts have largely been done in in vitro systems. As shown here, however, for the IL-2 gene and elsewhere for the IL-1β gene(31Jarrous N. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23141-23149Google Scholar), nuclear processing of precursor transcripts is a dominant element of post-transcriptional control in intact cells. Our observations support the concept that pre-mRNA processing may constitute, more widely than hitherto thought, an essential step for regulation of cytokine gene expression. Only after mature mRNA has been generated can the control of its stability begin to serve as a secondary target for post-transcriptional regulation."

Nuclear run-on assay showed that the transcriptional activity of GST-π was decreased in BSO-resistant cells, and transient transfection of GST-π promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that the sequences between −130 and −80 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region were at least partially responsible for the decreased expression of the GST-π gene. By contrast, γ-GCS mRNA levels were 3-to 5-fold higher in resistant cell lines than in KB cells, and the γ-GCS gene was found to be amplified in the BSO-resistant cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W1492872882,"Herpesvirus infection of arterial smooth muscle cells has been shown to cause cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation. However, the effects of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection on cholesterol binding and internalization, intracellular metabolism, and efflux have not been evaluated. In addition, the effects of viral infection on signal transduction pathways that impact upon cholesterol metabolism have not been studied. We show in studies reported herein that HSV-1 infection of arterial smooth muscle cells enhances low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding and uptake which parallels an increase in LDL receptor steady state mRNA levels and transcription of the LDL receptor gene. HSV-1 also increases CE synthesis and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity but concomitantly reduces CE hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux. Interestingly, this viral infection was associated with a time-dependent decrease in protein kinase A activity and an increase in viral-induced protein kinase (VPK) activity commensurate with the accumulation of esterified cholesterol. The relationship between increased VPK activity and alterations in CE accumulation in virally infected cells was explored using an HSV-1 VPK- mutant in which the portion of the HSV-1 genome encoding VPK had been deleted. Cholesteryl ester accumulation was significantly increased (>50-fold) in HSV-1-infected cells compared to uninfected cells. However, the HSV-1 VPK- mutant had no significant effect on CE accumulation. The relationship between VPK activity and these alterations in cholesterol metabolism was further supported by the observation that staurosporine and calphostin C (protein kinase inhibitors) reduced protein kinase activity in HSV-1-infected cells.

INTRODUCTIONHerpesvirus infection of arterial smooth muscle cells can lead to marked accumulation of cholesterol (1Hajjar D.P. Pomerantz K.B. Falcone D.J. Weksler B.B. Grant A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1317-1321Google Scholar) due, in part, to decreased cholesteryl ester (CE) 1The abbreviations used are: CEcholesteryl esterHSV-1herpes simplex virus type-1m.o.i.multiplicity of infectionACEHacid (lysosomal) cholesteryl ester hydrolaseNCEHneutral (cytoplasmic) cholesteryl ester hydrolaseACATacyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferaseHMG-CoA reductase3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseVPKvirus-induced protein kinasePKCprotein kinase CPKAprotein kinase AGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseLDLlow density lipoproteinLPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumHDLhigh density lipoproteinFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered saline. hydrolysis(2Hajjar D.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 1195-1211Google Scholar). HSV-1 infection has also been linked to decreased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, a second messenger known to activate cellular CE hydrolases(3Etingin O.R. Hajjar D.P. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 299-305Google Scholar). To date, this second messenger system is the only system known to significantly alter cellular cholesterol metabolism following herpesviral infection. However, HSV-1 infection alters other signal transduction pathways that could potentially affect cellular metabolism of cholesterol. For example, viral activation of tyrosine phosphorylation has been related to viral cytopathologic effects(4Cohen D.I. Tani Y. Tian H. Boone E. Samelson L.E. Lane H.C. Science. 1992; 256: 542-545Google Scholar), and, HSV-1 infection can also increase phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels (5Langeland N. Haarr L. Holmsen H. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 707-712Google Scholar) and inositol phospholipid turnover(6Garcin D. Masse T. Madjar J.J. Jacquemont B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 279-286Google Scholar). Whether these signal transduction pathways, or others, are linked to altered lipid metabolism in the infected cell remains to be defined.Cholesterol homeostasis in mammalian cells is maintained by the activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis(7Goldstein J. Brown M. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Google Scholar), and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which provides an exogenous source of cholesterol. Sterol-mediated repression of transcription of the genes encoding these proteins inhibits expression of the HMG-CoA reductase and of the LDL receptor genes under conditions in which cholesterol is sufficient for normal cellular maintenance(8Brown M. Goldstein J. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar, 9Sudhof T.C. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Google Scholar, 10Dawson P. Hofmann S. van der Westhuyzen D.

This prevents excessive accumulation of cholesterol and CE.The involvement of specific signal transduction pathways and second messengers have been implicated recently in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in non-virally infected cellular systems. Activators of protein kinase C (e.g. phorbol ester)- and protein kinase A (e.g. cyclic AMP)-dependent pathways modulate the activities of HMG-CoA reductase (7Goldstein J. Brown M.

Atherosclerosis. 1983; 46: 13-20Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated that the activities of acidic and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolases (ACEH and NCEH) are also cyclic AMP-dependent(16Hajjar D.P. Pomerantz K.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2933-2941Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded cells is also enhanced by activation of protein kinase C and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (17Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Google Scholar, 18Hokland B.M. Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25343-25349Google Scholar). In virally infected cells, the link among protein kinase activation, the activation of specific signal transduction systems, and the control of cholesterol trafficking also has not been defined.HSV-1 DNA encodes, in part, viral structural proteins, envelope glycoproteins, and viral DNA polymerases. It also encodes several proteins that are functionally related to cellular enzymes including a viral protein serine/threonine kinase (VPK)(19Purves F.C. Katan M. Stevely W.S. Leader D.P. J. Gen.

VPK has distinct substrate specificity but may share some substrates with protein kinases A and C as determined by their ability to phosphorylate synthetic oligopeptides. The cellular substrates for VPK are unknown, but several viral proteins have been identified as substrates(23Purves F.C. Spector D. Roizman B. J.

In this report, we provide experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that a viral kinase (VPK) alters cellular protein kinase-dependent pathways, which regulate the control of cellular cholesterol trafficking and cellular CE accumulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMedium 199, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, fetal calf serum (FCS), and anti-PKC monoclonal antibody 1.9 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

The HSV-1(F) protein kinase deletion mutant (VPK-, strain R7041) and the repaired HSV-1(F) mutant (VPK+, strain R7050) were generous gifts of Dr. Bernard Roizman (University of Chicago). Strain R7041 contains a deletion in the viral US3 gene and exhibits no VPK activity. The infectivity and production of viral glycoproteins by this strain remains intact. Strain R7050 was constructed from R7041 by inserting a US3 gene. The properties of these strains have been characterized extensively(25Purves F.C. Longnecker R.M. Leader D.P. Roizman B. J.

All viruses were propagated in, and plaque assays performed with, Vero cells.Cell CultureSmooth muscle cells were propagated from explants of rat thoracic aorta in Medium 199 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone™) as described elsewhere(1Hajjar D.P. Pomerantz K.B. Falcone D.J. Weksler B.B. Grant A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1317-1321Google Scholar).Virus Infection of CellsSmooth muscle cells monolayers at 90% confluence were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then placed overnight in medium containing 0.05% FCS. Cells were infected with HSV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1-1.0 and harvested at various time points following virus infection. For the experiments that were done to study the effects of viral infection for times longer than 3 h, cells were washed twice at room temperature with PBS and then refed medium with 0.05% or 10% FCS depending on the experimental protocol.Isolation and Labeling of LDLHuman LDL (d = 1.019-1.063 g/ml) was prepared as described(26Hajjar D.P.

Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5894-5898Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described(30Davis L. Dibner M. Battery J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). The cDNAs for the LDL receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase were purchased from ATCC. RNA from Northern blots was quantified using a densitometer and normalized by comparison to mRNA of a constitutive gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).LDL Receptor Promoter in Luciferase Reporter Gene ConstructPlasmid LDLRP-Luc was constructed by ligating the human LDL receptor promoter (5′ sequences extending 1563 base pairs from the A (+) of the translation initiation codon ATG; the human LDL receptor promoter, a gift from Dr. D. Russell, University of Texas) into plasmid Luc containing the luciferase gene (31de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar) and as described previously (32Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Google Scholar).Calcium Phosphate TransfectionCells were sub-passaged the day before transfection and replaced with fresh medium. The transfection method has been described elsewhere(33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar).Luciferase AssayLuciferase activities were measured according to the method developed by de Wet et al.(31de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar), or by using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega Corp., WI). The control plasmid (Luc) was supplemented to correct for nonspecific variations in the transfection assay. Luciferase activities were normalized to protein content.Measurement of Cholesterol and Cholesteryl Ester MassSmooth muscle cells were grown to near-confluence and infected with HSV-1 (m.o.i. = 0.1-1.0) or without virus (mock) for 24 h. The methods for lipid extraction, cholesterol and CE mass quantitation by gas-liquid chromatography were performed as described previously(1Hajjar D.P. Pomerantz K.B. Falcone D.J. Weksler B.B.

Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 961-969Google Scholar). (b) Neutral (cytoplasmic) CE hydrolase (NCEH) activity was assayed at pH 7.0(35Hajjar D.P. Weksler B. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1176-1185Google Scholar). (c) Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in homogenates was measured as described previously(36Hajjar D.P. Weksler B.B. Falcone D.J. Hefton J.H. Tack-Goldman K. Minick C.R. J. Clin.

A. 1974; 71: 788-792Google Scholar).Esterification of [3H]Oleic Acid into Cellular Cholesteryl EsterSmooth muscle cells were exposed to a [3H]oleic acid-albumin mixture (final concentration of 100 μM oleate, 20 μM albumin) in the absence of FCS and with LDL (25 μg/ml/well) for 24 h at 37°C for studying esterification as described elsewhere(38Pomerantz K. Hajjar D.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1892-1899Google Scholar). Cell lipids were extracted, and radioactivity in CE was assessed after separation by TLC as described(39Hajjar D.P. Wight T. Smith S. Am. J. Pathol. 1980; 100: 683-705Google Scholar).Assay of Virus-induced Protein Kinase (VPK) ActivityConfluent smooth muscle cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS (without Ca2+, Mg2+), harvested, and pelleted at 325 × g, 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mM NaCl, 5 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The assay for virus-induced protein kinase activity was performed as described elsewhere(19Purves F.C. Katan M. Stevely W.S. Leader D.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1049-1057Google Scholar, 22Purves F.C. Spector D. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4295-4303Google Scholar, 25Purves F.C. Longnecker R.M. Leader D.P. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2896-2901Google Scholar). Anti-PKC monoclonal antibody or control antibody (mouse IgM κ) were added to the cell lysates, then incubated with protein A beads at 4°C for 2 h, and the supernatants were assayed for VPK activity. Lysates from PMA-stimulated cells served as a positive control for the anti-PKC monoclonal antibody.Assay of Protein Kinase A and C Activities from Smooth Muscle CellsTo assay PKA activity in the cell, we followed methods described elsewhere (40Sugden P.H. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 423-437Google Scholar, 41Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Google Scholar) or used the Life Technologies protein kinase A enzyme assay system. Protein kinase C activity in the cell was assayed by a method described elsewhere(42Leng L. Yu F. Dong L. Busquets X. Osada S. Richon V.M. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5554-5558Google Scholar).Protein AssayProtein content in the tested samples was determined by the method of Lowry (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) or the Bio-Rad protein assay.Statistical AnalysisStatistical differences between the experimental groups were examined by analysis of variance, and statistical significance was determined at a p level < 0.05. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E.RESULTSSince no published study to date has addressed the effects of herpesviral infection on cholesterol delivery with its subsequent metabolic fate, we first evaluated the effects of HSV-1 on the binding and uptake of LDL-derived cholesterol and the influence of viral infection on expression of the LDL receptor. The specific binding of 125I-LDL (at 4°C) to arterial smooth muscle cells increased 3-9 h post-infection by HSV-1, and decreased to basal levels by 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, studies conducted at 37°C demonstrated that HSV-1 enhanced internalization (Fig. 1B) but decreased degradation of LDL (Fig. 1C).To test the hypothesis that HSV-1 infection increased LDL receptor activity by altering the rate of expression of its mRNA, we first examined the influence of HSV-1 on the steady state levels of LDL receptor mRNA. HSV-1 infection enhanced LDL receptor mRNA (normalized to mRNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene) 5-fold after 60 min when compared to control cells (Fig. 2A). Viral-induced degradation of GAPDH mRNA was not observed during the time course of this experiment. Second, since actinomycin D inhibited the HSV-1 induction of the LDL receptor gene (data not shown), we tested the hypothesis that increased mRNA of LDL receptor following HSV-1 infection was due to increased transcriptional activity of the LDL receptor gene. Using a construct composed of the luciferase gene driven by the LDL receptor gene promoter(32Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Google Scholar), we observed that by 2 h, HSV-1 infection or PMA stimulation (as a positive control) significantly induced luciferase activity by 5- and 4-fold, respectively, as compared to control cells (Fig. 2B). Luciferase activity in virally infected cells increased 12-fold relative to uninfected cells by 12 h post-infection.Figure 2:A, HSV-1 infection induces LDL receptor mRNA. Smooth muscle cells were grown in lipoprotein-deficient medium for 24 h prior to infection. Total RNA was isolated from control (uninfected) and HSV-1-infected (m.o.i. = 1.0) smooth muscle cells at the indicated time points (10, 30, 60, and 120 min of HSV-1 infection). Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled LDL receptor cDNA. Histograms represent densitometric scanning of the LDL receptor mRNA band normalized to mRNA of GAPDH and are expressed as a percentage of control. Insets are the respective autoradiograms with LDL receptor and GAPDH bands labeled and indicated with an arrow. B, HSV-1 infection induces LDL receptor gene promoter activity. Smooth muscle cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with LDLRP-Luc, a plasmid luciferase construct consisting of the promoter region from human LDL receptor gene in plasmid Luc containing the luciferase gene. Cells were infected with HSV-1 (m.o.i. = 1.0) or stimulated with PMA (100 nM) as a positive control. The luciferase activities of transfected cells were measured at the indicated times. Data derived from the HSV-1 group and PMA-treated group that are significantly (p < 0.05) different from the control group are indicated by (∗). Data are expressed as the mean of quadruplicate wells ± S.E. and are representative of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since increased de novo cholesterol biosynthesis can also contribute to the increased mass of cholesterol in HSV-1-infected cells, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 infection altered the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. HSV-1 modestly increased HMG-CoA reductase activity relative to uninfected cells (Fig. 3A). This was reflected in a significant increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in infected cells when compared to control cells (Fig. 3B). As expected, HMG-CoA reductase activity and its mRNA level are markedly reduced in both infected and control cells in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid (Fig. 3, A and B). However, in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid, there was a significant increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity and its mRNA level in HSV-1-infected cells relative to uninfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 3:A, effects of HSV-1 Infection on activity of HMG-CoA reductase in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells were grown to 95% confluence in Medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to HSV-1 infection (m.o.i. = 0.5), half of the flasks were replaced with serum-free medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS, 5 mg/ml) plus 25-hydroxycholesterol (5 μg/ml) and mevalonic acid (20 mM), and incubated 6 h at 37°C. After 6 h, the cells were washed, harvested, homogenized, and assayed for HMG-CoA reductase activity as described in Experimental Procedures. The data are expressed as nmol/h/mg protein. Data derived from the HSV-1-infected group are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the uninfected group in both the presence and absence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid. Sample1 (Control), control cells grown in Medium 199 containing LPDS (5 mg/ml); sample2 (HSV), HSV-1-infected cells grown in Medium 199 containing LPDS (5 mg/ml); sample3 (Control/CHOL+MEV), control cells grown in Medium 199 containing LPDS plus 25-hydroxycholesterol (CHOL) and mevalonic acid (MEV); sample4 (HSV/CHOL+MEV), HSV-1-infected cells grown in Medium 199 containing LPDS plus 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid. Data represent the mean of quadruplicate wells ± S.E. This figure is representative of two such experiments. B, Northern blot analysis of mRNA of HMG-CoA reductase in HSV-1-infected smooth muscle cells in the presence or absence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid. Smooth muscle cells were grown to 95% confluence in Medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to HSV-1 infection (m.o.i. = 0.5), the medium was replaced with Medium 199 containing LPDS (5 mg/ml) or Medium 199 containing LPDS (5 mg/ml) plus 25-hydroxycholesterol (5 μg/ml) and mevalonic acid (20 mM). Total RNA was isolated following incubation at 37°C for 6 h. Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs of HMG-CoA reductase and GAPDH. The position of the 4.7-kilobase mRNA of HMG-CoA reductase is marked. Histograms represent densitometric scanning of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA normalized to mRNA of GAPDH.

Both ACEH and NCEH activities were significantly decreased (by 45% and 50%, respectively) in HSV-1-infected cells relative to control cells at 24 h post-HSV-1 infection (Fig. 4). These data are consistent with the decrease in LDL degradation observed in HSV-1-infected cells (Fig. 1C) and provide another mechanism by which HSV-1 promotes cellular CE accumulation.Figure 4:Effects of HSV-1 infection on the cholesteryl ester hydrolytic (ACEH and NCEH) and synthetic (ACAT) enzyme activities in smooth muscle cells. Confluent smooth muscle cells were infected with HSV-1 (m.o.i. = 0.5). After a 24-h incubation, medium was removed. Cells were scraped from the flasks after two washes with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and homogenized, and samples were assayed for ACEH, NCEH, and ACAT as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ACEH, NCEH, and ACAT activities are expressed as nmol/h/mg protein. ACEH and NCEH activity in HSV-1-infected groups are significantly different (p < 0.05) from control groups. ACAT activity is not significantly different (p > 0.05) between HSV-1-infected and control groups. Data represent the mean of quadruplicate wells ± S.E. This figure is representative of two such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also determined if HSV-1 infection altered the rate of CE synthesis as measured by the incorporation of isotopic fatty acid into nascent CE. At the initiation of the experiments, [3H]oleic acid-albumin mixture in the absence of FCS was added to infected and uninfected cells. CE synthesis was increased in HSV-1-infected cells relative to uninfected cells (Fig. 5). However, HSV-1 infection did not alter intrinsic ACAT activity (Fig. 4). These data support the concept that HSV-1 infection increases cholesterol esterification by increasing substrate (cholesterol) availability.Figure 5:Esterification of [3H]oleic acid into cellular CE pool in HSV-1-infected and uninfected smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells were grown to 95% confluence, and half the groups were infected with HSV-1 (m.o.i. = 0.5). Esterification of free cholesterol with [3H]oleic acid into cellular CE was assessed in cells incubated with a [3H]oleic acid-albumin mixture (final concentration of 100 μM oleate, 20 μM albumin) and LDL (25 μg/ml/well). Cell lipids were extracted, and radioactivity in cellular CE was measured after separation by thin layer chromatography. Data derived from the HSV-1-infected group (after 6 h post-infection) are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the uninfected group. Data represent the mean of quadruplicate wells ± S.E. This figure is representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, since inhibition of efflux could contribute to cholesterol and CE retention within the virally infected cell (as it does in uninfected cells), we evaluated the effect of HSV-1 on cholesterol efflux in the presence of HDL as a plasma cholesterol acceptor particle. During a 30-h experimental period, HSV-1 infection significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Efflux of cholesterol from cellular CE in HSV-1-infected and uninfected smooth muscle cells exposed to HDL.

https://openalex.org/W2025986180,"During differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in vitro, expression of α1(VI) collagen mRNA was transiently stimulated severalfold. Promoter assays on cells transfected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) chimeric constructs have identified a region of the α1(VI) collagen promoter that increases CAT activity about 8-fold during differentiation. The region, which overlaps with transcription initiation sites, was shown to contain three protected segments (A, B, and C) in DNase I footprinting assays. The contact points between nuclear factors and the protected segments were determined by methylation interference assay and included the sequence GGGAGGG (GA box) in all segments. Experiments in which CAT constructs were cotransfected with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the GA box suggested that this motif was necessary for induction. Transfections with deletion constructs of the natural promoter and with minipromoters made of three copies of A, B, or C showed that the elements have inducing activity and that elements C and, to a lower extent, B are stimulatory for basal transcription, whereas the contribution of A in this process is limited. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from C2C12 cells indicated that the three GA box-containing elements bound several transcription factors, including Sp1. Comparison of the properties of the bands shifted under different experimental conditions (presence of 10 mM EDTA, heating of the nuclear extracts, addition of different concentrations of competitor oligonucleotides) established that A, B, and C probes form nine, eight and five main retarded complexes, respectively, and indicated that nuclear factors binding to C and B are subsets of proteins binding to A. UV cross-linking assays identified several peptides (seven with probe A, six with B, and five with C) in the range of 150-32 kDa. Comparison of the gel retardation pattern obtained with nuclear extracts from proliferating and differentiating cells revealed a particular increased intensity of two retarded bands. The data establish that multiple GA boxes mediate induction of the α1(VI) collagen promoter during myoblast differentiation and suggest the attractive hypothesis that the effect may be related to variations of expression of transcription factors binding to these motifs.

INTRODUCTIONCollagens constitute a complex family of extracellular proteins that are major determinants of the mechanical properties of tissues (30van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Google Scholar). The expression of each collagen type is specifically controlled in different tissues and is differentially activated by various stimuli. Although several conditions influencing expression of different collagen types have been described, the molecular mechanisms involved have only rarely been determined, the most notable example concerning the stimulation of collagen I chains by transforming growth factor-β (22Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Google Scholar; 21Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13625-13631Google Scholar; 13Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Google Scholar).Type VI collagen is composed of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains, α1, α2, and α3, all of which contain several domains related to the von Willebrand type A repeats (for a recent review on this collagen type, see 6Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Doliana R. Matrix. 1993; 13: 297-306Google Scholar). The protein has adhesive properties, and several observations suggest that it plays an essential role in regulating the structural organization of the extracellular matrix through specific interactions with a number of other components. Collagen VI is particularly abundant in the pericellular space where it forms microfibrillar aggregates. Expression of the protein during development is both stage- and tissue-specific. 1D. Marvulli, P. Braghetta, S. Piccolo, C. Fabbro, P. Bonaldo, D. Volpin, and G. M. Bressan, manuscript in preparation. Several studies have featured a distinct program of type VI collagen regulation. As in other collagens, the synthesis of all three chains in fibroblasts is inhibited by viral transformation, but treatment of the cells with phorbol esters does not change mRNA levels for collagen VI, although it causes a 3-5-fold reduction for collagen I and III (25Schreier T. Friis R.R. Winterhalter K.H. Trüeb B. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 381-386Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia, on the contrary, has been found to increase expression of the three collagen VI chains (19Muona P. Jaakkola S. Zhang R.-Z. Pan T.-C. Pelliniemi L. Risteli L. Chu M.-L. Uitto J. Peltonen J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1586-1597Google Scholar). The effect of transforming growth factor-β and γ-interferon is restricted to the α3 chain, the former stimulating and the latter inhibiting its expression (10Heckmann M. Aumailley M. Hatamochi A. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. Krieg T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 719-726Google Scholar; 11Heckmann M. Aumailley M. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 79-82Google Scholar). A unique feature of the regulation of collagen VI expression is the considerable induction of protein and mRNA levels observed during differentiation of mesodermal cells like adipocytes (7Dani C. Doglio A. Amri E.-Z. Bardon S. Fort P. Bertrand B. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10119-10125Google Scholar), chondrocytes (20Quarto R. Dozin B. Bonaldo P. Cancedda R. Colombatti A. Development. 1993; 117: 245-251Google Scholar), and myoblasts (12Ibrahimi A. Bertrand B. Bardon S. Amri E.-Z. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 141-147Google Scholar) and by confluence in fibroblasts (9Hatamochi A. Aumailley M. Mauch C. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. Krieg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3494-3499Google Scholar).The promoter region of the three genes coding for type VI collagen chains has been recently cloned from several species (16Koller E. Hayman A.R. Trueb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 485-491Google Scholar; 15Koller E. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 769-774Google Scholar; Bonaldo et al., 1993; 23Saitta B. Chu M.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 675-682Google Scholar). The characterization of the chicken α1(VI) collagen promoter has revealed the presence of two Sp1 and one AP1 binding sites close to the transcription start sites, which are necessary for full promoter activity (32Willimann T.E. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 332-338Google Scholar). Additional stimulatory elements are certainly contained in more 5′-end sequences (Koller and Trueb, 1992; Bonaldo et al., 1993); these elements, however, have not been characterized yet. The availability of the promoter region of different α-chains allows the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation possibly involved in the different conditions affecting type VI collagen expression. In this work, we have studied the transcriptional regulation of the α1(VI) collagen promoter during differentiation of a myoblasts cell line in vitro and have begun to define the molecular details of its activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Cultures and TransfectionsC2C12 myoblasts (33Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (proliferation medium) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. When required, cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum and 0.5 μg/ml bovine insulin (differentiation medium). For transfection, cells were plated at a density of 100-200 × 103/Petri dish (10-cm diameter). The following day, DNA-Ca2+ phosphate precipitates (31Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Google Scholar) were added directly to the culture medium, and cells incubated for 16 h. The medium was then removed, the layer was treated for 2 min with 15% glycerol in 25 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, 0.75 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.05, and, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, fresh proliferation medium was added and incubation continued for 24 h. At this stage, one-half of the plates were scraped and processed (proliferating cells), whereas in the other half the medium was changed to differentiation medium, incubation was prolonged for two additional days, and cells were harvested (differentiating cells). Extracts were prepared by resuspending the collected cells in 0.1 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and repeated freeze-thawing. CAT 2The abbreviation used is:CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. and luciferase assays were performed as described (26Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Google Scholar; 4Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122Google Scholar). The amount of DNA used for transfection of each Petri dish was 10 μg of CAT-promoter plasmid and 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus luciferase (8De Wet J.R. Wood K.W. De Luca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar) as internal standard for differences in transfection efficiencies.RNA AnalysisTotal RNA was purified from 10-cm Petri dishes with RNAfast reagent (Molecular Systems) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer and analyzed by Northern hybridization using standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes used were clone SMP1, encoding the amino-terminal end of the α1(VI) mRNA (Bonaldo et al., 1993), a rat cDNA clone for cardiac troponin T kindly provided by Dr. S. Schiaffino (University of Padova, Italy), and a cDNA clone for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (29Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Google Scholar).Plasmid ConstructionsPlasmid p1341CAT was constructed by ligating a 1382-base pair fragment spanning positions −1341 to +41 of the murine α1(VI) promoter (Bonaldo et al., 1993) into the promoterless vector pBL6CAT (3Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Google Scholar). The two plasmids p215CAT and p82CAT were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification from plasmid p1341CAT and cloning into pBL6CAT. p215Δ(−72, −1)CAT was obtained by ligation of two polymerase chain reaction fragments into HindIII- and PstI-cut pBL6CAT. One fragment, which extended from −215 to −73, contained a HindIII site at the 5′-end, whereas the other fragment (+1 to +41) contained a PstI site at the 3′-end. Deletions of p82CAT from the 5′- and 3′-ends were developed by Bal31 digestion following established protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). All plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and sequenced to verify their correct orientation and sequence identity. Artificial promoter constructs containing repetitions of elements A, B, and C identified in Fig. 5were derived by ligating synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides, including the indicated sequences and appropriate sticky ends, and cloning the ligation products upstream of the promoter segment of p8CAT. Clones carrying three copies of the elements were selected and confirmed by sequencing.DNA Binding AssaysNuclear extracts were prepared as described (27Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 11 × 103/cm2 and either harvested the following day (proliferating cells extract) or collected after 1 day in differentiation medium (differentiating cells extract).DNase I FootprintingAppropriate DNA fragments were labeled at one end with [32P]dNTPs and Klenow enzyme and gel purified as described (1Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). 20 × 103 cpm probe were incubated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol with or without nuclear extract (usually 80 μg) in a total volume of 30 μl for 45 min at 4°C. 2 μl of 125 mM MgCl2, 25 mM CaCl2 were then added, and the samples were maintained at room temperature for 1 min. DNase I (Sigma) was added (100-20 ng/reaction in samples containing the nuclear extract and 5-0.4 ng/reaction in samples without nuclear extract), samples were incubated for 1 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 0.2 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 25 mM EDTA and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the samples were resuspended in loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), denatured at 95°C for 3 min, and resolved in a 8 or 10% sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80°C with intensifying screen.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaySynthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Sambrook et al., 1989). 2-5 μg of nuclear extract were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 30 μl of binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM ZnSO4, 5% glycerol) containing 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). Competitor oligonucleotides and the probe (20-30,000 cpm) were added, and incubation was prolonged for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Samples were electrophoresed in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (20:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide) in 40 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine for 3 h at 150 V. The gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray films. In supershift experiments, the samples also contained 0.3-4 μg of either affinity-purified anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or the same amount of preimmune IgG.Methylation Interference AssayThe procedure followed was exactly that detailed by Ausubel et al.(1993).UV Cross-linking100,000 cpm of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide were incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extract in 30 μl under the same conditions used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Samples were then exposed to UV light (250 nm) for 50 min in a Stratalinker apparatus (Stratagene), 30 μl of 2 × final sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) were added, and the molecules were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. DNA-protein complexes were revealed by exposure to x-ray film.Southwestern Blotting20 μg of C2C12 nuclear extract were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and electroblotted into nitrocellulose filters. The proteins bound to the filter were renatured, and filters were processed as described (14Jackson S.P. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 189-242Google Scholar).RESULTSα1(VI) Collagen mRNA Expression in Differentiating MyoblastsC2C12 myoblasts can be induced to differentiate when cultured at high density in medium deprived of fetal calf serum (Yaffe and Saxel, 1977). The appearance of differentiation markers in our cultures was very rapid, as demonstrated by the increase of the mRNA for cardiac troponin T (Fig. 1), a gene that is transiently expressed also at early stages of skeletal muscle differentiation (28Toyota N. Shimada Y. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 497-504Google Scholar). Myotubes could be noted at day 2 after stimulation of differentiation and constituted the main part of the culture at day 4 (data not shown). During differentiation, the mRNA encoding the α1(VI) chain increased very rapidly in the first day, peaking at about 24 h, and then declined in the following days to a level that remained constant for at least 1 week (Fig. 1). The maximal increase of mRNA relative to the level detected at the time of stimulation of differentiation (time 0 in Fig. 1) was usually 5-15-fold, depending on the state of confluence of the cells. Very similar results have been described for the α2(VI) collagen chain during differentiation of the same cells (Ibrahimi et al., 1993).Figure 1:Expression of α1(VI) collagen mRNA by differentiating myoblasts. A series of Petri dishes containing C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 150,000/dish (10 cm) in proliferation medium. Cells from groups of dishes were harvested for total RNA purification with the following schedule: 1 day after plating, which corresponds to the day before switching to differentiation medium (−1d); the day of application of differentiating conditions (time 0); at various times (hours or days) after induction of differentiation. 15 μg of RNA were run on a 1% agarose gel and analyzed by the Northern blotting procedure using cardiac troponin T, α1(VI), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probes. The histogram is a quantitative evaluation of α1(VI) mRNA levels and was obtained by densitometry of specific bands and normalization to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of the Promoter Region Activated during DifferentiationThe increased production of mRNA in differentiating myoblasts could be the effect of either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. To investigate the contribution of transcriptional mechanism(s), the promoter region of the mouse α1(VI) collagen gene was isolated (Bonaldo et al., 1993), and several CAT chimeric constructs were derived. The plasmids were transiently transfected into C2C12 cells, and their promoter activity was measured in parallel in exponentially growing cells and in cells switched to differentiating medium (see “Materials and Methods”). Initial experiments were performed with two plasmids containing fragments extending from +41 to −1341 and from +41 to −215 base pairs from the most upstream transcription initiation site. The results indicated that CAT expression in proliferating myoblasts was about double for the longer construct and that differentiation stimulated promoter activity about 15- and 8-fold for the long and the short construct, respectively (data not shown). We therefore concentrated our study on the region −215 to +41, from which several 5′- and 3′-deletions were obtained and tested for promoter activity (Fig. 2). The data showed that the region extending from −83 to −215, although required for high levels of expression in proliferating cells, was not important for induction (compare CAT activities of p215CAT and p82CAT). On the contrary, the sequence from −1 to −82 produced low basal expression but was essential for induction (compare the results obtained with plasmid p215CAT with that of p82CAT and p215Δ(−72,-1)CAT). Stepwise removal of 5′-sequences from the region −82 to +41 gradually lowered basal CAT activity and induction properties of the constructs, indicating the presence of multiple regulatory tracts. Reduction of the 5′-end to −42 base pairs caused a drop of induction to 5-fold, and an additional cut to −8 brought to the complete loss of stimulation. The results indicated that the region −24 to −9 contributed most to induction and that the stretch −82 to −25 had low induction activity but remarkably increased basal expression. This interpretation was confirmed by assays with 3′-deletions of the promoter region, in which fragments extending from −16 to −82 and from −55 to −82 gave an identical low level of induction (Fig. 2). Induction was specific for the α1(VI) promoter constructs, since CAT activity expressed by the SV40 early promoter (pA10CAT2) and the tropoelastin promoter (pTE911CAT) did not change during myoblast differentiation (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Expression of α1(VI) promoter CAT constructs in C2C12 myoblasts. Promoter fragments extended from the indicated base at the 5′-end to base +41 at the 3′-end from the most upstream transcription initiation site (2Bonaldo P. Piccolo S. Marvulli D. Volpin D. Marigo V. Bressan G.M. Matrix. 1993; 13: 223-233Google Scholar). Deletions are indicated by Δ followed by parentheses comprising the position of the bases delimiting the deleted fragment. pBL6CAT is the vector into which the DNA fragments were cloned. Plasmid pA10CAT2 contains the SV40 early promoter without the enhancer (17Laimins L.A. Gruss P. Pozzatti R. Khoury G. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 183-189Google Scholar). pTE911CAT is a plasmid enclosing a portion of the human tropoelastin promoter (18Marigo V. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 31-36Google Scholar). The data were derived from several experiments in which four Petri dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids. After incubation for 1 day in proliferation medium, cells were harvested from two dishes, and CAT activity was measured (leftpanel). Differentiation medium was added to the other two dishes, and cells were grown for 30-36 h. After this time, CAT activity was tested, and induction was determined (rightpanel) as the ratio of CAT activity obtained from differentiating and proliferating cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structural Analysis of the Inducible RegionDNase I footprinting with a DNA fragment extending from +41 to −82 identified two protected sequences in the upper strand: one from −75 to −59 and the second, which was very long, from bases −45 to +4. Three footprints were detected in the lower strand and comprised bases +8 to −19, −28 to −45, and −60 to −70 (Fig. 3). The interaction of the DNA fragment with transcription factors was also analyzed by methylation interference assay (Fig. 4), and the results are summarized, together with the DNase I footprinting data, in Fig. 5. The contact points (indicated by dots in Fig. 5) were concentrated in three regions and were Gs in the sequence GGGGAGGG or GGGAGGG, thus identifying the binding string as a GA box.Figure 3:DNase I footprinting analysis of the region extending from −82 to +41 nucleotides from the transcription start site. The end-labeled fragments were reacted with 80 μg of nuclear extract prepared from differentiating C2C12 cells. The areas protected from DNase I digestion are marked by brackets. Positions of protected segments were determined by comparison with a G + A sequencing reaction (G/A) and are indicated relative to the most upstream transcription start site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4:Determination of contact sites of nuclear factors within the −82 to +41 region by methylation interference assay.

Induction of CAT expression during myoblast differentiation was completely inhibited by the three oligonucleotides A, B, and C, which contain the wild type sequence, whereas it was not affected by C∗, in which the GA box of C was mutated (Fig. 6). On the contrary, none of these oligonucleotides had any major effect on the CAT activity of proliferating cells. These data suggest that the GA box motif is necessary for induction of the α1(VI) collagen promoter during myogenesis. To evaluate the inductive potency of the individual A, B, and C elements (Fig. 5), artificial promoters were created in which trimers of each element were fused upstream of the region −8 to +41, which contains the transcription initiation sites (Bonaldo et al., 1993). Induction was observed for all three elements, with A having the highest and C the lowest activity (Fig. 7). Three copies of A in the antisense orientation were also stimulatory (plasmid pAsCAT in Fig. 7). On the contrary, mutation of the GA box abolished induction (plasmid pB∗sCAT in Fig. 7). The experiments described in Fig. 7gave also important information on the function of the three promoter elements in basal transcription. In proliferating myoblasts, three copies of C produced a very high level of CAT expression, which was 30-40 times that of the A trimer and 5-10 times that of the B trimer and of the natural promoter.Figure 6:The GA box motif is necessary for induction of the α1(VI) collagen promoter during myogenesis. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with the construct p215CAT (defined in Fig. 2) in the absence or presence of the double-stranded oligonucleotides A, B, C (defined in Fig. 5), and C∗, in which the GA box of C was mutated (GGGGAGGG to GGACATGG). The molar ratio of the oligonucleotides to the p215CAT construct was 800-fold. Dishes of proliferating and differentiating cells were processed for CAT activity, and induction was determined as described in the legend of Fig. 2. CAT activity is expressed as cpm butyryl-[14C]chloramphenicol formed/h/106 light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7:Functional properties of artificial promoters carrying multiple copies of the individual GA box-containing elements. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with the indicated constructs, and CAT activity from proliferating and differentiating cells and induction was determined as described in the legend of Fig. 2. Constructs (pAsCAT, pBsCAT, pCsCAT, and pB∗sCAT) contain three copies of element A, B, C, and mutated B, respectively, in the sense orientation fused with the region +8 to −41 of the natural α1(VI) collagen promoter. In B∗, the GA box (GGGGAGGG) was mutated to GGACATGG. pAsCAT differs from pAsCAT for the antisense orientation of the A trimer. p215CAT is defined in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of the Nuclear Factors Binding to GA BoxNuclear factors binding to GA boxes were examined by mobility shift assays. Incubation of double-stranded oligonucleotides A, B, or C (defined in Fig. 5) with nuclear extracts from C2C12 cells produced several retarded bands (Fig. 8, lanes2, 7, and 12). When the GA box of B or C was mutated (GGGGAGGG to GGACATGG), the bands disappeared or were dramatically decreased (data not shown), indicating that all the factors binding to B and C required at least part of the GA box sequence. No mutation of the A oligonucleotide was attempted, since it is entirely formed by repeated GGGAGGG motifs, and changes of the GA box would have altered the entire sequence.

Two established cell lines, which express α-globin differentially, were therefore compared for differences in binding of NFI at the α-globin promoter in vivo. HeLa cells, in which α-globin is repressed, show a high density promoter occupation with several proteins associated with structurally distorted DNA. Cell line K562, which is inducible for α-globin, surprisingly was found to be heterogeneous consisting mainly of cells (∼95%) unable to express α-globin. However, the promoter of the nonexpressing K562 cells was clearly different from that of HeLa cells, being occupied only at basal transcriptional elements. Therefore, the α-globin gene in these K562 cells may not be truly repressed, but in an intermediate state between repression and active transcription. The NFI site of the α-globin promoter appeared occupied in HeLa but free of proteins in K562 cells. All cells of both cell lines produce NFI, but the composition and DNA binding affinity of NFI species differ significantly between the two cell lines. Therefore, distinct forms of NFI may repress α-globin transcription in HeLa cells. However, NFI is apparently not involved in establishing the latent transcriptional state of the majority of K562 cells.

However, NFI is apparently not involved in establishing the latent transcriptional state of the majority of K562 cells. Expression of α-globin is regulated in vivo by the interplay of the locus control region at −40 kilobases and diverse promoter elements(1Higgs D.R. Wood W.G. Jarman A.P. Sharpe J.A. Lida J. Pretorius I.-M. Ayyub H. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1588-1601Google Scholar, 2Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J.A. Gourdon G. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Google Scholar). Activation of a particular gene in the α-globin cluster is supposed to be achieved by interaction of factors binding to the locus control region and factors binding to promoter and enhancer elements, thereby keeping the chromatin free of histones(3Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Google Scholar). However, this histone-free state which also correlates with DNase I hypersensitivity (4Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Google Scholar) bestows upon the globin genes only transcriptional competence. Additional events or factors that bind at the regulatory elements are required for a particular gene to be actively transcribed. In the erythroid lineage, the major specific transcription factor for globin gene expression is GATA-1(5Evans T. Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5976-5980Google Scholar, 6Martin D.I.K. Tsai S.-F. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 435-438Google Scholar, 7Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1089-1100Google Scholar). However, the promoter of the human α-globin gene contains no GATA-1 site but instead basal transcription elements, a possible SP1/α-IRP site(8Kim C.G. Swendman S.L. Barnhart K.M. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 12: 5966-5985Google Scholar), and a binding site for nuclear factor I (NFI; (9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4632-4639Google Scholar). However, NFI is a ubiquitous factor, and it is not known whether it can influence transcription in a tissue-specific manner. NFI may be involved in transcription as a ubiquitous factor with specificity provided through association with other, cell-specific factors. Precedents for this mode include, for example, the association of the ubiquitous Jun and Fos with the lymphoid-specific NF-ATp factor(23Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Google Scholar). Alternatively, NFI may act as a cell-specific transcriptional regulator in spite of its ubiquitous expression. The latter view is supported by the observation of the presence of different forms of NFI in different cell types (24Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.-U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Google Scholar, 25Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Google Scholar, 26Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Google Scholar). These forms can arise by expression of different NFI genes (24Apt D. Chong T. Liu Y. Bernard H.-U. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4455-4463Google Scholar, 27Gil G. Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19009-19019Google Scholar), by differential splicing(28Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Google Scholar), by diverse covalent post-translational modifications(29Yang B.-S. Gilbert J.D. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3093-3102Google Scholar, 30Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Google Scholar), or by heterodimerization (31Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Google Scholar). In this context it is of interest whether NFI could contribute tissue specificity in α-globin gene expression. NFI has been, in fact, implicated in the multistep process of transcriptional activation of the human α-globin gene by in vitro(32Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Google Scholar) and in vivo transient assays with reporter plasmids(28Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Google Scholar, 33Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Google Scholar). These assays revealed a weak but clear stimulation of α-globin transcription following binding of NFI to the promoter sequence. Originally it was thought that stimulation occurs by binding to the general positive cis-acting CCAAT genetic element of this promoter(34Mellon P. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Google Scholar). It was this assumption which led to the definition of NFI as “CTF” (=CCAAT-box transcription factor) implying a role for NFI as a general transcription factor(32Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated that specific and fairly strong binding of NFI actually occurs at an adjacent previously unrecognized NFI site within the α-globin promoter(9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo analysis with reporter plasmids suffers from copy number effects and does not account for the influence of chromatin which is known to play an important role in gene transcription via the presence of specific histones, nucleosomes, and higher order structures, such as the 30-nm-diameter chromatin filament, locus boundary elements, and the nuclear matrix or scaffold(3Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Google Scholar). Chromatin structure is particularly important for NFI binding and function; for example, Lee and Archer (35Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that NFI can bind and activate the murine mammary tumor virus promoter from transiently transfected, “naked” plasmid templates, whereas the chromatin version of the same sequence in the same cell is refractory to NFI action. For these reasons, we wondered whether occupation of the NFI site of the α-globin promoter in the chromosomal context could be correlated with a particular transcriptional state of the α-globin gene. This would clarify a possible importance of this site in vivo and provide clues for an implication of NFI in α-globin gene expression and regulation in situ. To start approaching this question, we compared the in vivo footprints of an inducible (K562) and a noninducible (HeLa) cell line. Our present results suggest that the transcriptional state of K562 cells does not correlate with NFI binding to the α-globin promoter in vivo. Our data are also compatible with the hypothesis that NFI species found in HeLa cells could act as repressors of α-globin transcription. K562 cells were purchased from ATCC (CCL 243); HeLa cells were a laboratory stock. Logarithmically growing K562 or HeLa cells suspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were harvested by centrifugation (1000 rpm, at 4°C), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was isolated according to a standard protocol(36Civelli O. Birnberg N. Herbert E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6783-6787Google Scholar, 37Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Hemin induction of K562 cells was done with a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for the times indicated in Fig. 1A. Slot blots were performed on a Schleicher & Schuell apparatus (SRC 07210 Minifold II). 30 μg of total RNA in 100 μl of TE were added to 300 μl of 6.15 M formaldehyde, 10 × SSC, denatured for 15 min at 65°C, and transferred on a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was baked at 80°C for 2 h. Specific probes for the α-globin mRNA were oligonucleotides C and E of the first primer set also used in the ligation-mediated PCR. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase specific probes were oligonucleotides 5′-CCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC-3′ and 5′-CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCC-3′. They were radioactively labeled at the 5′ ends as described(9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar). The sarcosyl technique was used for hybridization(38Overbeek P.A. Merlino G.T. Peters N.K. Cohn V.H. Moore G.P. Kleinsmith L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 656: 195-205Google Scholar). Purification of baculovirus-expressed NFI (amino acids 1-257) from infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells is described in (9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar). HeLa and K562 whole nuclear extracts were prepared as described (39Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Google Scholar) with the exception that 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to all solutions. Protein concentration was determined by a standard method (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) and was between 2.5 and 4 μg/μl. Whole cell extracts from uninfected Sf9 cells were kindly provided by M. Stanglmaier. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by G. Arnold (Laboratory for Molecular Biology-Genzentrum, Martinsried). Oligonucleotide “α-G wt” contains the NFI site in the context of the α-globin promoter(9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide L1/2 with a higher affinity NFI site has been described in (41Meisterernst M. Gander I. Rogge L. Winnacker E.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4419-4435Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide “α-G mut.” in which the NFI site has been inactivated is the same as oligonucleotide “k” in (9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar). Purification and radioactive labeling of the oligonucleotides and the conditions for protein-DNA incubation are described(9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar). The amount of the labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide α-G wt was usually 5 fmol, whole nuclear extracts were 2-4 μl; cold competitors were added before the binding reaction in 100-fold molar excess. In supershift experiments, the binding reaction was on ice, then 1 μl of nonimmune or anti-NFI-antiserum (described in (42Krause A. Heterologous NFI Expression and Production of NFI-specific Antibodies. Ph.D. thesis, Institute for Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. 1993; Google Scholar)) was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 30:0.8) and autoradiography were as in (43Zorbas H. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Winnacker E.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 19: 7735-7748Google Scholar). Conditions for base-specific modification in vitro and piperidine cleavage were as described(44Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar). For in vivo footprinting with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), K562 or HeLa cells were grown as described above. α-Globin induction of the K562 cells was with 50 μg/ml hemin for 24 h. Treatment with α-amanitin was at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1 h. The cells were washed with an isotonic phosphate buffer and incubated at 3 × 107 cells per ml in RPMI containing 0.2% DMS (Merck). The reaction was at room temperature for 2 min and was stopped by adding to the cells 40 volumes of cold phosphate buffer with 2%β-mercaptoethanol and subsequently by removing the medium by centrifugation. Cells remain viable after this treatment as controlled by trypan blue exclusion. The DNA was extracted by a standard protocol and cleaved at modified residues with piperidine. To visualize the DNA sequence, the ligation-mediated PCR method was used essentially as described(45Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Google Scholar). For the extension step with the radioactive primer E, four PCR cycles were performed. The primer set used for analyzing the sense-strand was: primer C, 5′-CAGGAGACAGCACCATGGTGGGTTC-3′; primer D, 5′-GGTGGGTTCTCTCTGAGTCTGTGGG-3′; and primer E, 5′-AGTCTGTGGGGACCAGAAGAGTGCC-3′. The in vivo footprinting experiments were repeated several times; the results are reproducible in the sense that the patterns are exactly the same whenever the same in vivo methylated DNA batch was analyzed and similar, but never contradictory, in the variation of band intensities, when a different DNA batch or a different set of primers was used. Intracellular expression levels of α-globin and NFI were determined by the use of specific antibodies and flow cytometry (FACS) as described previously(46Förster R. Emrich T. Voss C. Lipp M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1496-1503Google Scholar). Briefly, K562 cells and HeLa cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde (10 min, 4°C), and permeabilized for 4 min at room temperature with 0.0025% digitonin (Sigma) in order to allow intracellular antibody binding. Cells were adjusted to 2 × 106 per ml in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 4% fetal calf serum, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% NaN3) and were incubated for 20 min at 12°C with a rabbit anti-α-globin immune serum (Sigma; final dilution: 1:3000) or with protein A-purified rabbit anti-NFI polyclonal antibodies (100 μg/ml)(42Krause A. Heterologous NFI Expression and Production of NFI-specific Antibodies. Ph.D. thesis, Institute for Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. 1993; Google Scholar). After 2 washes in staining buffer, cells were incubated with F(ab')2 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and IgM antibodies (1:160, Dianova, Hamburg, FRG). Cells were washed twice, counterstained with propidium iodine (5 μg/ml in 4 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.0) and analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, FRG). In order to define a system for the study of α-globin expression, we used K562 cells, a commonly used erythroleukemic cell line, for the investigation of expression of the globin genes (cf. for example, (47Lumelsky N.L. Forget B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3528-3536Google Scholar)). K562 cells can be stimulated to actively transcribe the α-globin gene after hemin induction for different periods of time (Fig. 1A). There is a clear difference in the amount of α-globin mRNA in K562 cells compared to the non-α-globin expressing HeLa control cells (at least 12.5-fold more α-globin mRNA at 72 h). However, in the K562 cell population, α-globin mRNA already displays a high uninduced level (0 h) and is induced by a comparatively very low factor of only about 2.5-fold after 72 h. We wondered whether this reflects a uniformly low level of induction of all or most of the K562 cells, or rather a heterogeneous composition of this cell line, with some cells expressing high levels of α-globin and others expressing low levels or no α-globin. We therefore determined α-globin expression in K562 cells by FACS analysis using specific anti-α-globin antibodies; we indeed detected different subpopulations (Fig. 1B). In the uninduced state, the great majority of cells essentially does not express α-globin, whereas a few cells show comparatively high expression; the latter may be the reason for α-globin mRNA being already detectable before induction (see Fig. 1A). After hemin stimulation, the fraction of cells expressing α-globin increases, but does not exceed ∼5% of the overall population. This means that a small number of cells are actually responsible for virtually all of the α-globin expression in this cell line. As expected, no HeLa cell expresses α-globin detectably (Fig. 1B), which parallels the RNA analysis (see above). Accepting that protein levels directly mirror ongoing α-globin mRNA synthesis, these results mean that most of the K562 cells do not actively transcribe the α-globin gene, i.e. their state of α-globin expression is equivalent to that of HeLa cells. Since HeLa cells could not be induced to express α-globin (data not shown), the condition, in which promoter elements of the α-globin gene in these cells are, may reflect the dormant, or fully repressed state. On the other hand, the few K562 cells, which are transcribing α-globin and can even be stimulated (e.g. by hemin; this work), define the active state of the α-globin gene. We wondered whether the α-globin promoter, in the great majority of K562 cells which are silent, is also in a repressed state as in HeLa cells. To compare the promoter structure of α-globin in the two cell lines, we performed in vivo dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting analysis. Typical results are shown in Fig. 2, A and B; all data are summarized in Fig. 3. 2The displayed in vivo DMS protection results with K562 cells were obtained after 24 h of hemin induction. However, equivalent results were obtained with uninduced cells (data not shown). This is not surprising, since the footprints of the K562 genomic DNA are representative for the bulk of the cells (about 95%) which do not express α-globin in either case. To properly interpret the results, we consider band intensities to be altered in vivo only when they are flanked by any two guanosines, the intensity of which is not altered compared to the in vitro signals.Figure 3:Summary of the in vivo footprinting data of the α-globin promoter in K562 and HeLa cells. Symbols are as in Fig. 2. For comparison, a summary of NFI footprints is also displayed, which was obtained by methylation interference analysis of this region in vitro(9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The in vivo footprinting patterns obtained with both cell lines is clearly different from that of the protein-free DNA methylated in vitro. This indicates that, in vivo, several proteins occupy the α-globin promoter in both cell lines (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4 or 5 versus lanes 2 and 3). However, the in vivo footprinting pattern is distinct for each cell line (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 4 or 5): HeLa cells generally display a high density occupation of the promoter with proteins, revealed by the DMS-protected guanosines (denoted by lines with open dots in Fig. 2, lane 1, and in Fig. 3), whereas K562 cells show only a minimal occupation of the promoter (Fig. 2, lane 4 or 5, and Fig. 3). Additionally, the promoter in HeLa cells shows a particular region of about 25 nucleotides with many DMS-hypersensitive purine residues (denoted by arrows in Fig. 2, lane 1, and in Fig. 3). Also, two neighboring cytosine residues at two sites (within the α-IRP site and 3′ of it; compare Fig. 3) become methylated to some extent in this region, presumably at the N-3 positions which can occur only after strong distortion of the double strand state of the DNA (cf., for example, “Discussion” in (48Clark L. Matthews J.R. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1335-1344Google Scholar), and references therein). For these reasons, we suggest that the DMS hypersensitivity unequivocally indicates a dramatic alteration of the secondary structure at this region of the DNA in HeLa cells. In contrast, unusual reactivity of the DNA bases was not observed in K562 cells. Interestingly, protein binding in K562 cells seems to happen exclusively next to basal transcription elements, such as CCAAT-box, ATA-box and cap-site, as opposed to HeLa cells, in which at least the last two sites appear essentially protein-free (Fig. 2, lane 4 or 5 versus lane 1; see summary in Fig. 3). In summary, despite the equivalence in the expression pattern, the in vivo footprinting data indicate that K562 cells possess an α-globin promoter structure clearly different from HeLa cells. In the latter, the promoter is packed tightly with proteins and the DNA structure is pronouncedly distorted. In contrast, in K562 cells, the promoter shows an “open” chromatin configuration with proteins bound only at distinct sequence elements. Therefore, we suggest that the α-globin gene in the analyzed K562 cells may not be truly repressed, as in HeLa cells, but in an intermediate state between repression and active transcription. The performed in vivo footprint analysis provides the opportunity to examine protein interactions at the NFI site of the α-globin promoter in the chromosomal context of the two cell lines (cf. introduction). In vivo footprints with K562 cells revealed no stable protein occupation of the NFI site (Fig. 2, lane 5), in spite of the fact that the DNA region does not seem to be particularly inaccessible due to tight protein packaging (cf. instead the corresponding region in HeLa cells; previous section). Since clear protection footprints are obtained only if a sufficiently high portion of the DNA site in question is stably occupied, one reason for the lack of NFI footprints in K562 cells could be a low rate or a merely transient protein binding to its site. α-Amanitin has been used to visualize binding of RNA polymerase II in vivo by trapping the enzyme at the promoter(49Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Google Scholar). In an attempt to enhance a hypothetical insufficient factor binding at the α-globin promoter by the same rationale, we therefore performed in vivo footprints after treatment of induced K562 cells with α-amanitin. Again, no occupation of the NFI site was detectable (data not shown). Thus, by the methods used, the NFI site within the α-globin promoter does not become bound in K562 cells. In contrast, binding of the NFI site is clearly evident in HeLa cells, where the first two guanosines of the first half of the NFI site are consistently found to be protected from in vivo methylation (underlined in GGG(N6)GCCAG; see Fig. 2, lane 1, and summary in Fig. 3). However, this protection pattern deviates from DMS footprints of NFI made in vitro ((9Zorbas H. Rein T. Krause A. Hoffmann K. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8478-8484Google Scholar) and (14De Vries E. van Driel W. van den Heuvel S.J.L. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Google Scholar); see “Discussion”). 3T. Rein, R. Förster, A. Krause, E.-L. Winnacker, and H. Zorbas, unpublished results. Therefore, it is not possible to diagnose unambiguously whether protection of the NFI site of the α-globin promoter in HeLa cells is due to NFI binding. Nevertheless, it is clear that the NFI site present at the α-globin promoter is utilized differentially in each cell line, and this may point toward a distinct, hitherto unrecognized genetic function of this site in the chromosomal context. All conclusions in the last two sections are based on the analysis of the sense strand. In spite of the application of various experimental conditions for the PCR (use of formamide, deoxynucleotide analogues, dimethyl sulfoxide, different temperatures, and concentrations of compounds), we never obtained interpretable signals from the antisense strand. This is most probably due to the even higher GC content of the DNA upstream of the NFI site, which we believe is responsible for the attenuation of the signals beyond the displayed region also of the sense strand (not shown). Ambiguous annealing of the PCR primers to this region may impede the analysis of the antisense strand. Binding of several eukaryotic proteins to DNA is known to depend on the methylation state of cytosines. Most proteins are inhibited from binding when cytosines are methylated (at so called CpG or HTF islands, (50Bird A. Cell. 1992; 70: 5-8Google Scholar)), but some require methylated cytosines in order to bind(51Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Google Scholar, 52Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Google Scholar). Therefore, the distinct footprinting pattern of the α-globin promoter could be, at least in part, due to cell line specific methylation of this region of the genomic DNA. In particular, differential CpG methylation might have been a cause for lack of binding of NFI to the NFI site in K562 cells. The HTF islands of the α1- and α2-globin gene loci have been investigated in several cell types and tissues(53Antequera F. Macleod D. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 509-517Google Scholar, 54Antequera F. Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 62: 503-514Google Scholar, 55Bird A.P. Taggert M.H. Nicholls R.D. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 999-1004Google Scholar). In fact, they have been shown to be unmethylated in K562 cells(55Bird A.P. Taggert M.H. Nicholls R.D. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 999-1004Google Scholar), whereas the same loci appear heavily methylated in HeLa cells(53Antequera F. Macleod D. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 509-517Google Scholar, 54Antequera F. Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 62: 503-514Google Scholar). However, in HeLa cells also, unmethylated sites are apparent at the promoter region, just in front of the α-globin genes(53Antequera F. Mac"

Chem. 270, 19599-19605), we described a Kout+-dependent H+/HCO3− and Na+ influx pathway in the luminal membrane of salivary duct cells. In the present studies, we further characterized this pathway to show that the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx was not mediated by the luminal amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel, the Na+/H+ exchangers, or any electroneutral or conductive Cl−-dependent transport pathway. Thus, K+ efflux probably maintained electroneutrality during Na+ influx induced by removal of Kout+. Accordingly, Na+ influx was largely inhibited by 2.5 mM external Ba2+. The K+ site of the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx showed the selectivity sequence Cs+ > K+ > NH4+ > Li+ which is different from that of several known K+ channels. More importantly, Na+ influx is 50% inhibited at about 20 mM Kout+, and significant Na+ influx occurred even at 80 mM Kout+. This is a critical property for the pathway to play a role in Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion by the duct. The large Na+ influx in resting duct cells is matched by high activity of the ductal Na+ pump which is about 8-fold faster than that of acinar cells. Stimulation of submandibular ducts with various agonists increased [Na+]i in an agonist-specific manner. The parasympathetic agonist epinephrine was more effective than isoproterenol and the sympathetic agonist carbachol. The use of various inhibitors of Na+ and K+ transporters suggests that different pathways mediate Na+ influx in stimulated acinar and duct cells of the gland. In duct cells, Na+ influx was inhibited only by extracellular Cs+ and Ba2+.

Cl− absorption is coupled in part to HCO3− secretion and in part to Na+ absorption(2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 3Schneyer L.H. Am. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar) ion transporters. We confirmed the existence of luminal Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchangers and demonstrated the presence of similar transporters in the basolateral membrane of duct cells. However, we could not obtain evidence for a coupled K+/H+ exchanger, similar to that described in other epithelial cells(9Adorante J.S. Cala P.M. J. Gen.

Instead, we identified a luminal, duct-specific, Kout+-sensitive ion transport pathway(s) which transports H+/HCO3− and Na+. We postulate that the Kout+-sensitive pathway(s) mediates most of the K+ secretion and some of the Na+ reabsorption by salivary ducts. To perform these tasks, the pathway should be regulated by ductal secretagogues and allow the transport of H+/HCO3− and Na+ in the presence of high Kout+. Thus, the concentration of K+ in the primary saliva produced by acinar cells is about 5 mM whereas that measured in the secondary saliva is about 70-80 mM(3Schneyer L.H. Am. J.

In the present studies we show that Na+ transport initiated by changes in Kout+ is not mediated by any of the previously described Na+ transporters of duct cells and that the pathway can mediate Na+ influx in the presence of 40-60 mM Kout+. Stimulation of duct cells with various ductal secretagogues increases [Na+]i, which may be mediated by the Kout+-dependent pathway. All materials and experimental procedures were the same as in the preceding manuscript(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar). In the present studies we used SBFI or Na+-Green to estimate [Na+]i. It was necessary to use Na+-Green to evaluate the effect of amiloride on ductal Na+ transport because amiloride and all analogues tested have strong fluorescence when excited at the 340-380 nm range. A disadvantage of using Na+-Green is that this dye has no isosbestic point and in many experiments a large fraction of the dye behaved as if it were extracellular. This reduces the signal/noise ratio, prevents proper calibration, and precludes testing the effect of various Naout+ concentrations on Na+ transport. Na+-Green was loaded by incubating the cells with 2.5 μM Na+-Green/AM for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed once, resuspended in about 5 ml of PSA, and kept on ice until plating on coverslips. Na+-Green fluorescence was measured by photon counting at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm. The emitted light was passed through a dichroic mirror and filter set DM510 from Nikon and directed to a photomultiplier tube. The operational, storage, and data analysis programs were from PTI. Several amiloride-sensitive Na+ transporters were reported in duct cells(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar, 16Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 164-166Google Scholar, 17Paulais M. Cragoe E.R. Turner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar). Fig. 1a shows that they make minimal contributions to the Kout+-induced Na+ influx, since 0.5 mM amiloride, which is sufficient to inhibit the luminal Na+ channel and the Na+/H+ exchanger, had no effect on Na+ influx. Fig. 1b shows that DMA (and amiloride) had no apparent effect on the rate of Na+ efflux induced by addition of Kout+. These cells have a luminal Cl− channel (18Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Google Scholar) which may affect electrogenic cation transport. The ubiquitous Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (19Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Google Scholar) can potentially mediate some of the Na+ influx. Fig. 2a shows that removal of Clout− slightly reduced the rate of Na+ influx (32 ± 8%, n = 4). However, this may be secondary to the acidification of the cytosol caused by Cl− removal (see Fig. 2in the preceding manuscript(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar)). Indeed, in the presence of HCO3−, Na+ influx was not affected by Cl− removal (within 8 ± 11% of control) (Fig. 2c). Inhibition of the cotransporter with bumetanide had no apparent effect on the rates of Na+ influx or efflux induced by changes in Kout+ (Fig. 2b). We therefore conclude that Cl− fluxes are not required for Na+ influx and/or K+ efflux induced by removal of Kout+. To test the possible involvement of ion channels in Na+ influx, we measured the effect of known inhibitors of K+ and nonselective cation channels on Na+ influx and the ionic selectivity of the Kout+ site. Fig. 3a shows that 10 mM tetraethylammonium had no effect on Na+ fluxes. Similarly, Na+ influx was not inhibited by tetrabutylammonium, quinine, quinidine, and apamin (not shown). On the other hand, 2.5 mM Ba2+ reduced the steady-state [Na+]i of resting duct cells by about 4.6 ± 0.6 mM (n = 5) (Fig. 3b). Ba2+ also inhibited the Na+ influx induced by Kout+ removal in a reversible manner. Fig. 3c shows that addition of Ba2+ to cells incubated in K+-free medium caused only a small reduction in [Na+]i. However, when K+ was added to the medium, the cells rapidly reduced [Na+]i, in the presence (Fig. 2c) or absence (not shown) of Ba2+. The effects of Ba2+ on Na+ influx and efflux are identical with those on H+ fluxes shown in the preceding manuscript (8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar). The ionic selectivity of the Kout+ site is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows that Li+ up to 10 mM could not substitute Kout+ either in preventing Na+ influx or in activating the Na+ pump-mediated Na+ efflux from Na+-loaded cells. NH4+ at 5 mM partially substituted Kout+ in inhibiting Na+ influx but was a poor substitute for the Na+ pump (Fig. 4b). Higher concentrations of NH4+ were not tested because of its effect on pHi. Fig. 4c shows that Cs+ substituted well for Kout+ in inhibiting Na+ influx and as a substrate for the Na+ pump. Interestingly, unlike Kout+, the second removal of Cs+ from the medium failed to cause rapid and large Na+ influx. This is probably because Cs+ cannot be transported by the Kout+-dependent pathway to mediate Csin+- Naout+ exchange. Fig. 4d shows the apparent affinity for Cs+ in inhibiting Na+ influx. In this experiment, Na+ influx was inhibited by Cs+ and the Na+ pump was inhibited by ouabain. Stepwise reduction in Csout+ caused a stepwise increase in [Na+]i. Cs+ inhibited the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx pathway with an apparent IC50 of about 2.5 mM. Fig. 5shows the Kout+ dependence of Na+ influx. In the absence of ouabain, reducing Kout+ from 5 to 2 mM had a small effect on [Na+]i (Fig. 5a). Further reduction in Kout+ to 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 mM resulted in a stepwise increase and stabilization of [Na+]i at different levels. A subsequent stepwise increase in Kout+ caused a proportional reduction in [Na+]i. Notably, [Na+]i stabilized at different levels at the same Kout+ concentration during Na+ influx and efflux. This was observed in all experiments tested (n = 7). This probably reflects the effect of [Na+]i on the apparent affinity of the pump for Kout+(20Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar). The behavior of Na+ influx in Fig. 5a shows the marked impact and activity of the Na+ pump in intralobular ducts. Fig. 5b shows how the contribution of the Kout+-sensitive pathway and the Na+ pump to Na+ influx were separated. Fig. 5b1 shows that increasing Kout+ from 5 to 60 mM reduced [Na+]i by about 6.7 ± 1.2 mM (n = 3). This was due to inhibition of Na+ influx and not stimulation of the Na+ pump, since pump activity was maximal at 5 mM Kout+. Fig. 5b2 provides a control experiment showing that the reduced Na+ influx at 60 mM Kout+ was not due to the reduction in Naout+. Hence, at 90 mM Naout+ and 5 mM Kout+, ouabain caused substantial Na+ influx. The conditions of Fig. 5b were used to determine the dependence of Na+ influx on Kout+, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5c. Na+ influx was inhibited by 60 mM Kout+, and the Na+ pump was inhibited by 1 mM ouabain. Remarkably, reducing Kout+ from 60 to 40 mM was sufficient to cause Na+ influx, and the influx was almost maximal at 5 mM Kout+. Fig. 5d displays the summary of 4 similar experiments and shows that the dependence of Na+ influx on Kout+ followed simple saturation kinetics with an apparent affinity for Kout+ of about 18.2 ± 3.4 mM (n = 4). Furthermore, extrapolation of the results to higher Kout+ indicates that the pathway will allow some Na+ influx even at 80 mM Kout+. This property is a key feature of the luminal Kout+-dependent pathway with respect to its physiological role. The use of an image acquisition system allowed us to simultaneously measure [Na+]i of acini and ducts present in the same recording field and, when informative, compare regulation of [Na+]i in the two cell types. [Na+]i of resting submandibular acinar cells was about 8.9 ± 0.78 mM (n = 43) which is in the same range reported in sublingual (21Zhang G.H. Cragoe E.J. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C54-C62Google Scholar) and parotid acinar cells(22Robertson M. Foskett K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C146-C156Google Scholar). In the same experiments, [Na+]i of resting duct cells was somewhat higher and averaged 14.4 ± 1.03 mM (n = 43). Fig. 6a shows that stimulation of duct cells with Epi caused a rapid (27.8 ± 1.6 mM/min) and sustained increase in [Na+]i by about 7.4 ± 0.4 mM (n = 21). Carbachol stimulation increased [Na+]i of duct cells at a rate of 12.5 ± 0.8 mM/min to an average of 4.7 ± 0.3 mM (n = 11) above resting (Fig. 6b). In the same experiments, carbachol rapidly and strongly increased [Na+]i of acinar cells by 62 ± 4.7 mM (not shown). Isoproterenol had the smallest effect on [Na+]i. Isoproterenol stimulation increased ductal [Na+]i (Fig. 6c) at a rate of 5.6 ± 0.4 mM/min, which stabilized at 2.8 ± 0.55 mM (n = 6) above control. In an attempt to evaluate the contribution of the different Na+ influx pathways to the agonist-dependent [Na+]i increase, we tested the effect of several transport inhibitors on Na+ influx. Results with the submandibular acinar cells are presented as a positive control and to contrast the behaviors of the two cell types. Carbachol was the most active agonist in acinar cells, and, therefore, results obtained with this agonist are shown in Fig. 7, a-d. Inhibition of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter with bumetanide reduced the rate of Na+ influx into carbachol-stimulated acinar cells by about 24 ± 9% (n = 4), but had a minimal effect on the extent of [Na+]i increase. Removal of bumetanide slightly increased [Na+]i (Fig. 7b). Ba2+ reduced the rate of Na+ influx by 46 ± 11% (n = 3) (Fig. 7c). However, most of the effect of Ba2+ is probably indirect since Ba2+ is likely to interfere with the initial KCl efflux and cell shrinkage, which is critical for activation of Na+ influx in stimulated acinar cells(22Robertson M. Foskett K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C146-C156Google Scholar). DMA inhibited Na+ influx rate by about 72 ± 17% (n = 4) (Fig. 7a). Since Epi is the most active agonist in granular intralobular ducts, the results obtained with this agonist are shown in Fig. 7, e-h. Fig. 7f shows that bumetanide had no apparent effect on the Epi-stimulated [Na+]i increase (n = 6). Notably, 25 μM DMA had no apparent effect on the agonist-mediated [Na+]i increase in the presence or absence of Kout+ (Fig. 7g), excluding both the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel and the Na+/H+ exchangers as major contributors to this Na+ influx. Fig. 7h shows that 2.5 mM Ba2+ nearly abolished the Epi-stimulated [Na+]iincrease and the large Na+ influx observed after removal of Kout+. Additional evidence that different pathways mediate the major portion of the Na+ influx in duct and acinar cells is presented in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a shows that replacing Kout+ with 5 mM Cs+ inhibited the Epi-evoked [Na+]i increase in duct cells. Removal of Cs+ from the incubation medium resulted in a rapid increase in [Na+]i. Replacing Kout+ with 5 mM Cs+ had a minimal effect on the carbachol-induced [Na+]i increase in acinar cells (not shown). Fig. 8, b and c, shows that increasing Kout+ from 5 to 40 mM reduced [Na+]i in Epi-stimulated ducts by 4.7 ± 0.6 mM (n = 3), whereas it increased acinar [Na+]i by 6.2 ± 0.8 mM (n = 3). The lack of effect of DMA and the inhibition by Cs+ and Ba2+ of the agonist-dependent [Na+]i increase in duct cells suggests that the Kout+-dependent pathway may mediate a significant part of Na+ influx in stimulated duct cells. To further test this possibility, we measured the effect of agonist stimulation on Na+ influx evoked by removal of Kout+. Fig. 9a shows that Epi stimulation increased the rate of Na+ influx due to Kout+ removal by 1.84 ± 0.06-fold, and [Na+]i stabilized at about 67 ± 5.1 mM (n = 8). In addition, Epi stimulation of cells incubated in the absence of Kout+ further increased [Na+]i by about 9.6 ± 1.7 mM (Fig. 9b). To evaluate the effect of cell stimulation on Na+ influx independent of Na+ pump activity, we measured the effect of ouabain on Na+ influx in stimulated cells. Fig. 10a shows that stimulation of cells incubated with ouabain increased the rate of Na+ influx from 9.8 ± 0.6 to 34.7 ± 4.2 mM/min, and [Na+]i stabilized at about 58 ± 4 mM (n = 3), which was about 10-12 mM lower than that caused by removal of Kout+. Removal of Kout+ increased [Na+]i in duct cells treated with ouabain and Epi (Fig. 10b) by about 13 mM. The reciprocal protocol is shown in Fig. 10b. Addition of ouabain to Epi-stimulated cells caused [Na+]i to increase at a rate of 28.4 ± 2.6 mM/min, which was about 2.9-fold faster than in unstimulated cells (Fig. 10a). The major function of the salivary ductal system is the modification of electrolyte composition of the primary saliva(1Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar). This is achieved by HCO3− and K+ secretion and Na+ reabsorption, processes that are coupled to each other(1Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar, 2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). It has been difficult to fully explain the coupling of these activities under various physiological and experimental conditions(2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). The most commonly accepted model assumes that luminal Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchangers are responsible for the cotransport of these ions in duct cells(1Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar, 2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). The model, however, does not account well for HCO3− secretion and does not explain several properties of ductal electrolyte transport. For example it was shown that 10 μM amiloride, which blocks the luminal Na+ channel (16Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 164-166Google Scholar) but is not sufficient to inhibit the epithelial type Na+/H+ exchanger(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar, 17Paulais M. Cragoe E.R. Turner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar), largely blocked Na+ reabsorption(5Knauf H. Wais U. Lubcke R. Albiez G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 6: 43-50Google Scholar, 23Knauf H. Lubcke R. Pflügers Arch. 1975; 361: 55-59Google Scholar, 24Knauf H. Pflügers Arch. 1972; 333: 82-94Google Scholar, 25Bijman J. Cook D.I. van Os C.H. Pflügers Arch. 1983; 398: 96-102Google Scholar). It is not clear why Na+ concentration of the luminal solution has to be reduced well below that needed for Na+ reabsorption (2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 5Knauf H. Wais U. Lubcke R. Albiez G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 6: 43-50Google Scholar) in order to stimulate HCO3− secretion(2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 15Martin C.J. Young J.A. Pflügers Arch. 1971; 327: 303-323Google Scholar). In addition, a K+/H+ exchange activity cannot be demonstrated in mildly (8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar, 17Paulais M. Cragoe E.R. Turner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar) or strongly acidified duct cells(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar). Hence, alternative mechanisms have to be invoked for HCO3− and K+ fluxes at the luminal membrane. In the preceding manuscript(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar), we reported the presence of a luminal, Kout+-dependent pathway which allows the transport of H+/HCO3− and Na+(8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar). In the present studies, we show that this pathway is different from any amiloride-sensitive Na+ pathway present in duct cells. Neither low nor high concentrations of amiloride inhibited Na+ influx induced by removal of Kout+. Low concentrations of amiloride (up to 20 μM) had no effect on [Na+]i. Amiloride reduced resting [Na+]i only at high concentrations. This indicates that the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx is not mediated by the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel and that this channel has minimal contribution to Na+ influx in resting duct cells. Another critical implication of the experiments with amiloride is that a coupling between K+/H+ and Na+/H+ exchangers cannot possibly mediate Na+ influx and K+ efflux from duct cells. Coupling between the exchangers requires that when Na+ influx is initiated by removal of Kout+, H+ influx induced by Kout+/Hout+ exchange is matched by Naout+/Hin+ exchange to maintain relatively stable pHi and mediate large Na+ influx. In this case, a high concentration of amiloride was expected to completely inhibit Na+ influx. In fact, as judged from measurements with Na+-Green, amiloride reduced Na+ influx by only about 13%. This corresponds to about 5.7 mM Na+ influx based on measurements of [Na+]i with SBFI. This value agrees reasonably well with measurement of pHi shown in the preceding manuscript (8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar) in which amiloride increased the Kout+-dependent acidification by about 0.16 pH unit. Measurement of H+ buffer capacity of duct cells using established procedures(26Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Google Scholar, 27Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12813-12819Google Scholar) showed it to be about 35 mM/pH unit at a pHi of 7.1. This translates to the transport of 5.4 mM H+, and, therefore Na+, by the Na+/H+ exchanger. Hence, Na+/H+ exchange mediates a small fraction of Na+ influx in duct cells and thus coupled Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange cannot account for K+ and HCO3− secretion and Na+ reabsorption by the duct. Other pathways that do not contribute to, or are essential for, the Na+ influx induced by removal of Kout+ are the Cl−-dependent pathways. These include Na+-K+-2Cl− and NaCl cotransport and the luminal and basolateral Cl− channels present in duct cells from various species(1Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E. Walsh J. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 773-815Google Scholar, 18Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Google Scholar, 28Augustus J. Bijman J. van Os C.H. Slegers J.F.G. Nature. 1977; 268: 657-658Google Scholar). An important implication of this conclusion is that another ion must be transported together with Na+ to maintain electroneutrality. This ion must be K+. Therefore, although we did not measure K+ transport directly, K+ efflux must occur and account for the bulk of Na+ influx induced by removal of Kout+. A potential transporter that can mediate the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx is the nonselective cation channel found in many epithelial cells, including pancreatic and salivary acinar cells(29Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Google Scholar). We could not obtain evidence for the involvement of this channel in Na+ influx into resting or stimulated submandibular duct cells. Although the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx was completely inhibited by Ba2+, it was not sensitive to other channel blockers such as tetraethylammonium, quinidine, or apamin. Furthermore, the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx was active at resting levels of [Ca2+]i in duct cells, whereas no such activity was found in submandibular acinar cells present in the same recording field. Finally, replacing Kout+ with Cs+ inhibited Na+ influx even when the Na+ pump was inhibited, indicated that Cs+ directly inhibited the Kout+-dependent pathway. Cs+ should not inhibit Na+ influx by the nonselective channel, as replacing Kout+ with Cs+ in the absence of Cs+ influx should have hyperpolarized the cells and augmented Na+ influx mediated by a nonselective channel. Although these observations do not completely exclude that the Kout+-dependent Na+ influx is mediated by the nonselective cation channel, they suggest that such is unlikely. An important property of the Kout+-dependent pathway is that it allows Na+ influx in the presence of very high luminal K+ (60-80 mM). Of course, the high concentration of K+ in saliva(3Schneyer L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1968; 215: 664-670Google Scholar, 7Young J.A. Fromter E. Schogel E. Hamann K.F. Pflügers Arch. 1967; 295: 157-172Google Scholar, 12Mangos J.A. Braun G. Hamann K.F.

Pflügers Arch. 1970; 319: 185-199Google Scholar, 15Martin C.J. Young J.A. Pflügers Arch. 1971; 327: 303-323Google Scholar) dictates that if the pathway is to play a role in salivary electrolyte transport it must allow Na+ influx at high luminal K+. Nevertheless finding such a property was important in establishing a physiological role for this transporter. Since the Kout+-sensitive pathway dominates Na+ influx in submandibular duct cells, it is possible that the main function of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel is to regulate the potential across the luminal membrane and thus control fluxes through the Kout+-dependent pathway. In this case, the activity of both transporters is required for electrolyte transport by the duct. The major role of the luminal Na+/H+ exchanger may be to prevent accumulations of H+ next to the apical membrane during HCO3− secretion and thus facilitate Cl− reabsorption by the luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchanger. Indeed, 100 μM amiloride inhibits the ductal Na+/H+ exchanger by less than 50% (17Paulais M. Cragoe E.R. Turner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1594-C1602Google Scholar), whereas 10 μM amiloride inhibits Na+ absorption by more than 90%(5Knauf H. Wais U. Lubcke R. Albiez G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 6: 43-50Google Scholar, 23Knauf H. Lubcke R. Pflügers Arch. 1975; 361: 55-59Google Scholar, 25Bijman J. Cook D.I. van Os C.H. Pflügers Arch. 1983; 398: 96-102Google Scholar). If a major role of the luminal Na+/H+ exchanger was Na+ reabsorption, then 10 μM amiloride should have reduced the reabsorption by about 10-15%. It is clear that the Kout+-dependent pathway is active in resting cells when luminal K+ is 5 mM. This is concluded from the unmasking of significant Na+ influx by ouabain. The effect of ouabain on [Na+]i also indicates a tight coupling between Na+ influx by the luminal Kout+-dependent pathway and the basolateral Na+ pump. This finding was also demonstrated in the main perfused duct when the luminal and basolateral transporters and solutions are separated (Fig. 10, (8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar)). Therefore, unlike most cells, in salivary duct cells the major Na+ influx mechanism that fuels the Na+ pump is the Kout+-dependent pathway and not the Na+/H+ exchanger. The physiological consequence of this coupling is the maintenance of low [Na+]i during Na+ reabsorption. Low [Na+]i prevents inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchangers, which probably function to remove the excess cytosolic H+ accumulating during HCO3− secretion. Another interesting finding of the present studies was the properties of the agonist-dependent [Na+]iincrease in submandibular duct cells. Bumetanide and amiloride had no effect on the agonist-dependent [Na+]i increase. On the other hand, this activity was blocked by Cs+ and Ba2+, and agonist stimulation increased the rate of Kout+-dependent Na+ influx by 2-3-fold. This would suggest that most Na+ influx in stimulated submandibular duct cells is mediated by the Kout+-dependent pathway. Hence, independent of its identity, it is quite remarkable that the Kout+-dependent pathway dominates Na+ influx in resting and stimulated submandibular duct cells, whereas the amiloride-sensitive pathways make minor contributions to Na+ influx. It is therefore possible that the Kout+-dependent transporter is the major Na+ influx pathway responsible for Na+ reabsorption. If it can also mediate K+ efflux during Na+ influx, it might also be responsible for the secretion of K+ into the duct lumen. The findings presented in the preceding (8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar) and present manuscripts explain several features of electrolyte transport by duct cells which could not be explained by previous models. The Kout+-dependent pathway provides a suitable mechanism for ductal secretion of HCO3− and for the coupling between HCO3− and K+ secretion. Our results also explain why the secretion of K+ and HCO3− is augmented and becomes increasingly coupled in the absence of luminal Na+(2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J.

Invest. 1976; 6: 43-50Google Scholar, 6Schneyer L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 217: 1324-1329Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the Kout+-dependent pathway is expected to mostly extrude HCO3− rather than absorb Na+. In the absence of luminal Cl−, Na+ reabsorption is reduced by 25%, and Na+ influx becomes equal to K+ efflux(2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar, 3Schneyer L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1968; 215: 664-670Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Na+ reabsorption can occur through the Kout+-sensitive pathway in exchange for intracellular K+. HCO3− secretion by the rat submandibular duct is low compared to the active transport of Na+ and K+(1Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Johnson L. Christensen J. Jackson M. Jacobson E.

In the presence of 5 mM luminal K+, removal of luminal Na+ increases HCO3− secretion about 3-fold(2Knauf H. Lubcke R. Krentz W. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F132-F139Google Scholar). The lack of luminal K+/H+ exchange (8Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Google Scholar) requires alternative pathways that allow the K+ and HCO3− uptake under these conditions. The Kout+-dependent pathway(s) has the required properties to mediate such fluxes. Finally, our results explain why agonist stimulation reduces the transepithelial potential difference of the ducts(14Young J.A. Martin C.A. Asz M. Weber F.D. Pflügers Arch. 1970; 319: 185-199Google Scholar, 15Martin C.J. Young J.A. Pflügers Arch. 1971; 327: 303-323Google Scholar). The agonists activate the luminal Kout+-dependent, Na+- and K+-permeable pathways and increase [Na+]i and probably reduce [K+]i. Both of these effects reduce the transepithelial potential difference. The maintained high [Na+]i in stimulated cells (Fig. 6) is expected to reduce the rate of Na+ influx at the luminal membrane and at least partially inhibit the Na+/H+ exchangers(30Wall S. Kraut J. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F331-F339Google Scholar, 31Green J. Yamaguchi D.T. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5012-5015Google Scholar). As a consequence, agonist stimulation is expected to reduce the rate of Na+ reabsorption. This was indeed found in many studies using the perfused main duct(1Young J.A. Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W.

Few molecules that have undergone only partial reversal are detected. This suggests that the assembly or activation of RuvAB on the branched substrate is rate-limiting, while any migration of RuvAB on the DNA to effect unwinding of the hybrid DNA (and reformation of substrate DNA) is very fast. The results are discussed in the context of the role of RuvA and RuvB proteins in recombinational DNA repair.

We suggest that one function of the RuvAB proteins is to act as an antirecombinase, to eliminate intragenomic crossovers between homologous segments of the bacterial chromosome that might otherwise lead to deleterious inversions or deletions. The order of genes in the chromosomes of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli has been evolutionarily conserved during the millions of years since these groups diverged (33Ochman H. Wilson A.C. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1649-1654Google Scholar). This is despite the fact that powerful recombination systems exist in these cells, along with repeated genomic sequences (e.g. the seven rRNA operons) that might facilitate genomic deletions or inversions via intramolecular recombination. Evidence has appeared supporting the existence of mechanisms to prevent deleterious intragenomic recombination events in bacteria (41Segall A. Mahan M.J. Roth J.R. Science. 1988; 241: 1314-1318Google Scholar). A central component of the bacterial recombination system is the RecA protein (37Roca A.I. Cox M.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Google Scholar; 49West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Google Scholar; 5Clark A.J. Sandler S.J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 125-142Google Scholar; 7Cox M.M.

Egelman E.H. Experientia. 1994; 50: 192-203Google Scholar). RecA promotes a DNA strand exchange reaction in vitro that is believed to mimic key aspects of RecA function in vivo (Fig. 1A). This reaction occurs in at least 4 distinct phases. The first phase, which is facilitated by the E. coli SSB 1The abbreviations used are: SSBsingle-stranded DNA binding proteinssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAAMT4′-amino-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralenbpbase pair(s)kbpkilobase pairs. protein, is the formation of a RecA protein filament on the ssDNA. The second phase is the alignment of a homologous linear duplex DNA with the ssDNA in the nucleoprotein filament, a process that might involve the formation of a triple-stranded DNA pairing intermediate (35Rao B.J. Dutreix M. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2984-2988Google Scholar; 43Stasiak A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3267-3276Google Scholar; 4Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. Cell. 1993; 73: 217-223Google Scholar). In the third phase, the complementary strand of the duplex DNA is transferred to the ssDNA to form a short (1-2 kbp) region of hybrid dsDNA in a process that does not require ATP hydrolysis (26Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar; 36Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar; 38Rosselli W. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 335-352Google Scholar). This nascent hybrid DNA is extended in the fourth phase, a facilitated unidirectional branch migration (5′ to 3′ relative to the ssDNA) that is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (15Jain S.K. Cox M.M.

The RuvA and RuvB proteins of E. coli are also important in DNA repair and homologous genetic recombination in vivo (19Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Google Scholar; 21Lloyd R.G.

Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 337-344Google Scholar), functioning largely in the processing of branched recombination intermediates (31Müller B. West S.C. Experientia. 1994; 50: 216-222Google Scholar; 52West S.C. Tsaneva I.R. Hiom K. Benson F.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 525-531Google Scholar). The RuvA and RuvB proteins are able to promote bidirectional branch migration of strand exchange intermediates (47Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 1171-1180Google Scholar). Complexes of the RuvA and RuvB proteins exhibit a 5′ to 3′ helicase activity which may be integral to the mechanism by which these proteins promote branch migration (48Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Google Scholar). The RuvA protein binds to Holliday junctions and is believed to be a molecular matchmaker (40Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Google Scholar) for the RuvB protein (30Müller B. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17179-17184Google Scholar). The RuvB protein exhibits significant ATPase activity in the presence of RuvA and DNA and is believed to be the motor of the RuvAB protein complex (50West S.C. Cell. 1994; 76: 9-15Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies have shown that the RuvB protein forms a double hexameric ring structure which encircles dsDNA (45Stasiak A. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Benson C.J. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7618-7622Google Scholar). More recent results indicate that the active functional unit of RuvB is a hexameric structure (29Mitchell A.H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 208-215Google Scholar). An elementary picture of RuvAB action is that RuvA binds to a Holliday junction, RuvB binds to create a RuvAB complex, and then branch migration mediated by the RuvA and RuvB proteins occurs. Ultimately, the Holliday junction may be cleaved by the RuvC resolvase in a reaction facilitated by RuvA and/or B (11Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 221-228Google Scholar; West, 1994). The function of the RuvA and B proteins partially overlaps that of the RecG protein (Lloyd, 1991; Luisi-Deluca et al., 1989). When added to a RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reaction with homologous DNA substrates, RuvA and B presumably promote branch migration predominantly in the same direction as RecA protein does, enhancing the formation of completed products of DNA strand exchange (53Whitby M.C. Ryder L. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 341-350Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of RecG protein to a similar RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction leads to its reversal. A model for the productive application of this seemingly antirecombinogenic activity of RecG protein in postreplication repair and recombination has been proposed by Lloyd and colleagues (Whitby et al., 1993). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the ruvA or ruvB genes exhibit only modest effects on recombination unless they are in either a recBC sbc or a recG genetic background (Lloyd, 1991; Luisi-Deluca et al., 1989). However, the same mutations in a wild type background produce dramatic increases in the sensitivity of bacterial cells to DNA damaging agents (42Sharples G.J. Benson F.E. Illing G.T. Lloyd R.G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 219-226Google Scholar). These studies directly implicate the RuvA and RuvB proteins in the process of recombinational DNA repair. Recombinational DNA repair is complicated by a requirement for the bypass of structural barriers in the DNA. RecA protein alone promotes efficient bypass of lesions, mismatches, and short insertions of heterologous DNA sequence (up to 50-100 bp) during strand exchange (Cox, 1994). Addition of the RuvA and RuvB proteins greatly enhances the heterology bypass capability of RecA, permitting the bypass of medial heterologous inserts up to 1000 bp in length (13Iype L.E. Wood E.A. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24967-24978Google Scholar). In RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange involving duplex DNA substrates with heterologous sequences on the distal 3In a normal RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction, hybrid DNA is formed progressively in the 5′ to 3′ direction relative to the single-stranded DNA on which the RecA filament forms. The ends of the linear duplex DNA substrate are often defined as proximal and distal, referring to the ends where a productive strand exchange is generally initiated and terminated, respectively. (3′ relative to the ssDNA substrate) end, hybrid DNA is formed up to the heterology/homology junction (Jain et al., 1994; Iype et al., 1994). We investigated the fate of blocked RecA-mediated strand exchange reactions (where barrier bypass was precluded) when RuvA and B were added (Fig. 1B). We have found that the strand exchange reaction is efficiently reversed, much as all strand exchange reactions are reported to be in the presence of RecG protein. The results suggest a role for RuvA and B as an antirecombinase system, capable of reversing blocked recombination events that are potentially deleterious to the bacterial genome. E. coli RecA protein was purified and stored as described previously (8Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Google Scholar). The RecA protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 0.58 A280 mg-1 ml (9Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Google Scholar). E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) was purified as described (23Lohman T.M. Green J.M. Beyer R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 21-25Google Scholar) with the minor modification that a DEAE-Sepharose column was added to ensure removal of single-strand exonucleases. The concentration of SSB protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 1.5 A280 mg-1 ml (24Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Google Scholar). E. coli RuvA protein and RuvB proteins were purified as described (Iype et al., 1994; 46Tsaneva I.R. Illing G. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 1-10Google Scholar). The concentrations of RuvA and RuvB proteins were determined by the method of 3Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard (Bio-Rad assay kit). For assays, the RuvA and/or RuvB proteins were diluted as needed into a RuvAB dilution buffer containing 20 mM Tris chloride buffer (75% cation), 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mM NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The final pH of this dilution buffer after addition of all components was 7.9. Restriction endonucleases, calf intestinal phosphatase, β-agarose, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Tris buffer was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Proteinase K, creatine phosphokinase, phosphocreatine, ATP, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Amino-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT) was purchased from Calbiochem. Duplex and ssDNA substrates were derived from bacteriophage M13 mp8 (7229 bp; 28Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Google Scholar). Bacteriophage M13 mp8.375 (7594 bp) is bacteriophage M13 mp8 with a 375-bp fragment (EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pBR322) replacing the 10-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment of bacteriophage M13 mp8 (2Bedale W.A. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6499-6510Google Scholar). Supercoiled circular duplex DNA and circular single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13 mp8 and M13 mp8.375 were prepared using methods described previously (10Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar; 27Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Google Scholar; 32Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Google Scholar). The concentration of dsDNA and ssDNA stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 50 and 36 μg ml-1A260-1, respectively as conversion factors. DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of total nucleotides. Complete digestion of FI M13 mp8.375 with BamHI restriction enzyme resulted in full-length linear duplex (FIII) DNA substrates that contain heterology located at the 3′ end of the duplex DNA, relative to the viral (+) strand. After digestion, residual protein was removed by 1:1 extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. Further digestion of the full-length duplex DNA with MscI or AlwNI restriction enzymes resulted in 1526- or 4414-bp linear duplex (FIII) DNA substrates, respectively. They each include 375 bp heterology at the distal end of the duplex DNA, and either 1151 or 4039 bp of sequences homologous to M13 mp8. These fragments are referred to in the text as the 1.5- and 4.4-kbp substrates. Both linear duplex DNA fragments were isolated from preparative low melting agarose gel using β-agarose according to the manufacturer's directions. Phosphatasing of linear duplex DNA with calf intestinal phosphatase and 5′-32P-end labeling of linear duplex DNA with T4 polynucleotide kinase were performed as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37°C in a standard reaction buffer containing 25 mM Tris acetate (80% cation), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and an ATP regenerating system (12.5 units ml-1 creatine phosphokinase, 15 mM phosphocreatine). The final pH after addition of all reaction components was 7.45. Duplex DNA and ssDNA, both at 21 μM, were preincubated at 37°C with 7 μM RecA protein for 10 min before ATP (6 mM) and SSB (2 μM) were added to initiate the reaction. RuvA and RuvB proteins were mixed and left on ice for at least 30 min and then added to reactions as appropriate. Unless otherwise noted, the addition of RuvA and RuvB occurred 60 min after the addition of ATP and SSB. The final concentrations of RuvA protein and RuvB protein were 0.3 and 1 μM, respectively, unless noted otherwise in the text. If RecA protein converts all of the linear duplex substrate to the expected branched DNA intermediate, these RuvAB concentrations represent a 50-fold excess of RuvB hexamers relative to available DNA branch points. In one series of reactions, the 1.5-kbp linear duplex DNA substrate was utilized. The strand exchange reaction conditions described above were followed for these reactions with one exception. The duplex DNA final concentration in these reactions was 4.4 μM while the ssDNA final concentration was 21 μM. The reduced duplex DNA concentration maintained a 2-fold excess of circular ssDNA molecules to linear duplex DNA molecules. Aliquots (15 μl) of strand exchange reactions described above were removed at each time point, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of gel loading SDS buffer (30% glycerol, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 30 mM EDTA, 4% SDS). Samples were electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose gel. In the experiments presented in Fig. 6and Fig. 7, strand exchange reactions were performed essentially as described with the important addition of a DNA cross-linking step prior to RuvAB addition. At 60 min after the addition of ATP and SSB, the reaction mixture was mixed with AMT (0.5 or 1.0 μg ml-1, final concentration, as indicated), incubated at 25°C for 3 min, and irradiated with long-wave UV light for 4 min at 25°C. The reaction was then transferred to 37°C and incubated in the dark during subsequent steps of the reaction. The RuvAB proteins were added and samples of the strand exchange reaction were removed at appropriate time points and electrophoresed as described above. Samples of the strand exchange reaction were also prepared for electron microscopy as described below.Figure 7:Kinetics of RuvAB-mediated reversal of DNA strand exchange. Reactions were carried out under standard reaction conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange proceeded for 60 min, with the 7.6 (○) or 1.5 (•) kbp linear duplex DNA substrates. Reversal reactions were initiated by addition of RuvA and RuvB proteins, and data is plotted from that time point. In control reactions (open and closed triangles for reactions with the 7.6- and 1.5-kbp linear duplex, respectively), RuvAB dilution buffer was added in place of the RuvA and RuvB proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The AMT concentration used in these experiments was determined empirically, with the intention of introducing about one cross-link per DNA molecule. A titration was carried out in which reversal reactions were done after cross-linking with various concentrations of AMT. The concentration chosen was the one that resulted in about a 50% reduction in the amount of intermediate converted back to substrate. As noted under “Results,” the cross-linking density in the experiments was somewhat greater than one cross-link per DNA molecule. Samples for electron microscopy were obtained by spreading the entire strand exchange reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures were cross-linked with AMT prior to examination by electron microscopy to prevent spontaneous branch migration, if such could occur, during sample preparation. For these reactions, aliquots (15 μl) of the strand exchange reaction were mixed with AMT (30 μg ml-1, final concentration), incubated at 25°C for 3 min, and irradiated with long-wave UV light for 4 min at 25°C (14Jain S.K. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4215-4222Google Scholar). Cross-linked DNA samples were incubated with proteinase K (1 mg ml-1 final) and SDS (0.9% final) for 60 min at 37°C. The samples were dialyzed into 20 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA overnight at 25°C on Millipore type VM (0.05 μm) filters and were then spread as described previously (12Inman R.B. Schnös M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 93-98Google Scholar). Photography and measurements of the DNA molecules were performed as described previously (18Littlewood R.K. Inman R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1691-1706Google Scholar). The length of DNA exchanged in intermediates from strand exchange reactions was estimated for a representative sample of intermediates. Because of the large number of samples, obtaining accurate measurements of significant numbers of intermediates in all of the samples was impractical. The ratio of the exchanged DNA region (length of the ds segment within the circle) to the unexchanged DNA region (length of ds tail) was visually judged (Jain et al., 1994). This ratio is converted to the length of DNA exchanged by using the total number of base pairs in the linear duplex DNA. For convenience, the linear duplex DNA was divided into 8 segments which each represent 1000 bp (the first segment at the proximal end is only 500 bp). The estimates of DNA exchanged were then sorted by 1000-bp segments. Data was plotted as a percentage of total intermediates per 1000 bp of DNA exchanged (see Fig. 3and Fig. 5). For the data presented in Fig. 5, the grids from this reaction were assigned an undescriptive identification code (by L. E. I.) and provided in a random sequence (to R. B. I.) without further identification. The length of DNA exchanged in the intermediates was then estimated (by R. B. I.).Figure 5:Effect of AMT cross-links on RuvAB-mediated reversal of DNA strand exchange. Reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with the substrates used in Fig. 2and Fig. 3. The symbols are as in Fig. 2. The first and second marker lanes (M) contain linear duplex substrate (cleaved M13 mp8.375), and supercoiled M13 mp8, respectively. A minor band of nicked circular M13 mp8 is also present in the second marker lane, migrating at the position labeled P. In each reaction, the first three time points are, from left to right, 0, 60, and 67 min after initiation of a RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange. RuvA (to 0.3 μM) and RuvB (to 1 μM) proteins were then added. The last four lanes show the reaction at 5, 10, 20, and 60 min after addition of RuvAB. In reaction A, no AMT was added. In reaction B, 1 μg ml-1 AMT was added at 60 min after the RecA reaction was initiated, but the samples were not irradiated to generate cross-links. Reaction C is the same as B, but the reaction was irradiated to generate cross-links after the 60-min time point, immediately prior to the addition of RuvA and B. In reaction C, the 67-min time point is the first sample containing cross-links.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Strand exchange reactions with the 1.5-kbp linear duplex substrate were performed as described above except that radiolabeled linear duplex (FIII) substrate was utilized. After samples were electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels, the gels were dried and the bands were visualized by autoradiography and by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For each time point the quantity of radiolabeled DNA in the substrate (S) and intermediate (I) bands were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). In order to correct for any variability in sample loading onto the agarose gel, a ratio of the I and S bands was determined. The zero time point for the RuvAB reaction was the time point 60 min after the initiation of the RecA reaction. At this zero time point the sample contained a small amount of unreacted linear duplex DNA substrate which was designated So. The fraction of reaction intermediate remaining was calculated as I/[I + (S-So)]. Data was plotted as I/[I + (S-So)] versus time after RuvAB addition. Assays with the 7.5-kbp linear duplex substrate were quantified differently. The DNA was not radiolabeled. Samples were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed over a ultraviolet transilluminator. The intensities of DNA bands were quantified by scanning the photographic negatives using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and analyzing the scanned image with ImageQuant software. A strand exchange reaction between circular ssDNA and linear duplex DNA containing a 375-bp heterologous DNA insertion at the distal end is shown in Fig. 2. The expected product of this reaction, if it went to completion, is a nicked circular duplex with a 375-nucleotide single-stranded tail. This DNA species, designated P, is not generated to any appreciable extent in the reaction with RecA and SSB alone. However, a prominent DNA band indicative of branched strand exchange intermediates is present (Fig. 2, reaction A, species designated I). When the RuvA and RuvB proteins were added immediately after the initiation of RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange with these substrates, there was a very slight increase in the amount of P observed in the gel (Fig. 2, reaction B). The more significant effect was the reduction in the amount of I coupled with an increase in substrates when compared with the reaction without Ruv proteins. This result contrasts with the negligible effect of RuvA and B on RecA-mediated strand exchange reactions with completely homologous DNA substrates (Iype et al., 1994). The RuvA and RuvB proteins promoted this reduction in intermediates and increase in substrates even when added quite late in the reaction. A strand exchange reaction was initiated with RecA and SSB and allowed to progress for 60 min (Fig. 2, reaction C). At this point, there is a prominent DNA band corresponding to I. Continued incubation of the intermediates generated from the RecA reaction over an additional 60-min period showed that the intermediates were stable and did not dissociate to form either substrates or the nicked circular product with a ssDNA tail (data not shown). After the 60-min RecA reaction, RuvA and RuvB proteins were added and time points were taken over a 25-min incubation period. The quantity of the intermediate diminished and the quantity of substrate increased substantially after RuvA and RuvB protein addition. This result indicates that the RuvA and RuvB proteins are converting intermediates to substrates and thereby reversing RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange. Intermediates from RecA protein-mediated strand exchange reactions with duplex substrates containing different distal heterologous DNA insertions (198 bp or 1037 bp) were also converted to substrates by the RuvAB proteins (data not shown). At relatively high concentrations, the RuvB protein promotes branch migration on deproteinized strand exchange intermediates independently of RuvA (Tsaneva et al., 1992b). However, addition of RuvB protein concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 μM RuvB protein (in a RecA-mediated strand exchange reaction with 21 μM DNA substrates) did not reverse strand exchange, indicating that the requirement for RuvA protein cannot be circumvented under the conditions of the present experiments (data not shown). Strong RuvAB-mediated reversal of DNA strand exchange occurs only when the 375-bp heterologous insert is located on the distal end of the linear duplex DNA substrate. When the insert was 673 bp to over 6000 bp from the distal end, the major reaction upon RuvAB addition was insertion bypass (Iype et al., 1994). When the insertion was 169 bp from the distal end, bypass was reduced but reversal did not substantially increase (data not shown). We do not know if larger heterologous insertions would alter this result. A complementary analysis of the strand exchange reaction described above was carried out by electron microscopy. A strand exchange reaction was initiated with RecA and SSB and allowed to progress for 60 min. RuvA and RuvB proteins were then added to the reaction and time points were taken over a 20-min incubation period. Molecules typical of those observed are shown in Fig. 3, panels A-F. The prominent intermediate species is shown in panels A and B. These intermediates characteristically have a short double-stranded tail and a long single-stranded tail with lengths consistent with a strand exchange reaction that has proceeded up to the distal heterologous sequences as shown schematically in Fig. 1B. These intermediates represented 60% of the duplex DNA-containing species 60 min after the RecA reaction had begun. Panels C-F show species generated by processing the intermediates shown in panels A and B. Panels C and D show duplex circles with a short ssDNA tail, a species created when the 375-bp heterologous sequence (the duplex DNA tail in panels A and B) was unwound. Panels E and F illustrate the l"

The fatty acids myristate and palmitate are linked through an amide bond to N-terminal glycine and SH of cysteine via a thioester bond, respectively. In order to elucidate whether or how fatty acid acylation would modulate peptide structure, especially in hydrophobic environment, we have carried out circular dichroism studies on synthetic peptides both hydrophobic and hydrophilic in nature, corresponding to fatty acylation sites and their fatty acyl derivatives. The hydrophilic peptides were ~12 residues in length as studies on proteins modified by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that a peptide segment of ~12 residues is sufficient to direct acylation as well as membrane association, especially when the fatty acid is myristic acid. The peptide corresponding to a transmembrane segment composed of 31 residues as well as its palmitoyl derivative was found to adopt α-helical structure. Acylation appeared to favor increased partitioning into micelles even in the case of a hydrophobic peptide. The hydrophilic peptides and their myristoyl or palmitoyl derivatives showed very little ordered structure in micelles. Our results suggest that the myristoyl and the palmitoyl moieties do not have the ability to “force” a hydrophilic peptide segment into a hydrophobic micellar environment. Thus, the mere presence of a fatty acid moiety may not be sufficient for membrane binding and recycling as is assumed especially in proteins in which no hydrophobic segment is present.
