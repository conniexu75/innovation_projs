https://openalex.org/W2023013551,"The hypothesis that the herbicide glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) acts on plants and microorganisms by inhibiting synthesis of 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate, a precursor to aromatic amino acids, was tested. Salmonella typhimurium was treated with ethyl methanesulfonate, and mutants mapping at the aroA locus, which encodes 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthetase, were isolated by selection for glyphosate resistance. One of the mutants results in the synthesis of a 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthetase that is resistant to inhibition by glyphosate. The mutant aroA gene and the corresponding wild-type allele were cloned. The mutation confers high resistance to glyphosate when introduced in Escherichia coli in the presence or absence of the wild-type aroA allele."
https://openalex.org/W1976472313,"Trends, long-term directional tendencies in evolution, are traditionally interpreted as selected for and adaptive. Alternatively, trends may be unselected effects of characters and processes within species: the effect hypothesis. Thus adaptations of organisms, varying among species, were selected for immediate fitness, but they may also incidentally determine different speciation and extinction rates and trends."
https://openalex.org/W2095177765,"The intracellular pH (pH(i))of encysted gastrula-stage embryos of the brine shrip, Artemia, as previously shown by in vivo phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, increases by more than 1 unit during arousal from cryptobiotic dormancy and decreases by the same amount during reinduction of dormancy. These changes in pH(i) are now shown to be a fundamental regulator of the transitions between dormancy and metabolism: acidification of activated embryo pH(i) by more than 1 unit with carbon dioxide induced a state comparable to natural dormancy, while alkalinization of dormant embryo pH(i) with the weak base ammonia terminated natural dormancy. This demonstration of pH(i)-mediated regulation of cryptobiotic dormancy extends the known scope for pH(i) as a regulator of development to include multicellular stages of the metazoan life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2014178100,"Larvae of the black swallowtail butterfly, Papilio polyxenes Stoll, forage successfully on plants that contain high levels of photosensitizing psoralens. These insects rapidly detoxify psoralens, particularly in the midgut tissue prior to absorption, with the result that appreciable levels of unmetabolized phototoxin do not enter the body circulation where deleterious light-induced interactions with dermal or subdermal tissues would occur."

https://openalex.org/W2021588601,"Partial skeletons of four species of extinct carnivores have been found in their dens excavated in the floodplain of an early Miocene ephemeral braided stream at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska. Bear dogs (Carnivora: Amphicyonidae) were the principal occupants; their den dimensions and body size are similar to those of living wolves and hyenas. Discovery of this predator community extends the record of denning behavior of large mammalian carnivores to the early Miocene, 20 million years ago."

https://openalex.org/W1977418508,"The mean inclinations of three sections of 120,000-year-old fine-grained sediments from northern California range from 62 degrees to 66 degrees . These inclinations are significantly steeper than the inclination of the geocentric axial dipole at this site. Because these sediments have probably recorded an actual episode of steep inclination lasting several thousand years, they provide new insights into the significance of mean inclinations shallower than the geocentric axial dipole. Such inclinations are characteristic of fine-grained sediments younger than 35,000 years. The results raise questions about the time-averaged geomagnetic field and about the determination of plate motions from paleomagnetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2012376806,"Particle orbits can be bundled in two different ways to produce narrow, Uranus-type ringlets. The usual assumption is that they are packed in a parallel manner in a structure that is essentially only two-dimensional, but it is then difficult to explain the large numbers of particles per unit area of the ring plane that are inferred from the observations. The alternative of a bundle of entwined orbits produces a three-dimensional structure of potentially large projected areal density. A start has been made in identifying possible mechanisms for stabilizing these structures, but much remains to be done, particularly for the less-studied model of entwined orbits. The two models might be discriminated observationally by differences in the motion of the line of intersection of the orbital and equatorial planes, and by the predicted radial reversal (entwined) or nonreversal (parallel) of features in occultation signatures taken at certain longitudes."
