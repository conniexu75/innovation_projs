https://openalex.org/W2033410839,"T lymphocyte receptors CD28 and CTLA-4 bind costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells and regulate T cell activation. While distinct functional roles have been ascribed to each of these molecules, little is known about how they interact. To better characterize these interactions, we have used surface plasmon resonance to perform equilibrium and kinetic binding analyses of extracellular fragments of CD28/CTLA-4/CD80/CD86. We show that CTLA-4 and CD28 binding are both characterized by rapid kinetic on-rates and rapid dissociation rates. Native disulfide-linked homodimers of CD28 and CTLA-4 bound with two kinetically distinct binding sites, one of high avidity and slow dissociation and one of low avidity and more rapid dissociation. Monomeric CTLA-4 bound only with low affinity and rapid dissociation. Therefore, covalent dimerization of CTLA-4 is required for its high avidity binding. Oligomerization of CD80/CD86 is also required for high avidity CTLA-4 binding since CTLA-4 bound with low avidity to monomeric CD86. This contrasts with the ability of CD80/CD86 on antigen-presenting cells to bind CTLA4Ig with high avidity and predicts their organization as oligomers or clusters that permit multivalent binding. Thus, covalent receptor dimerization and ligand oligomerization are two key features of the CD28/CTLA-4/CD80/CD86 receptor system that control ligand binding and may regulate signal transduction by controlling the duration of receptor occupancy.

Despite the structural similarities and common binding partners of CD28/CTLA-4 receptors and CD80/CD86 ligands, different functional properties have been attributed to each of these molecules. Engagement of CD28 by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or B7 ligands greatly enhances T cell activation (3Schwartz R.H.

Additional evidence that CTLA-4 negatively regulates the immune system comes from studies of CTLA-4-deficient mice, which have a severe lethal lymphoproliferative phenotype (18Tivol E.A. Borriello F.

Thus, CD28 and CTLA-4 apparently have different functions during an immune response (17Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CD80 and CD86 have also been reported to have different functions, with CD86 preferentially stimulating the production of interleukin-4, but not interleukin-2 (20Freeman G. Boussiotis V.A.

The different biological properties of CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors and CD80 and CD86 ligands may emanate from differing binding properties or from different patterns of expression. Relatively little is known about how these molecules interact. Studies using recombinant soluble immunoglobulin fusion proteins have shown that CTLA-4 binds with higher avidity to CD80 and CD86 than does CD28 (9Linsley P.S. Brady W. Grosmaire L. Aruffo A. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 10Linsley P.S. Brady W. Urnes M. Grosmaire L.S. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1047-1054PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residues responsible for the increased binding activity of recombinant CTLA4Ig were localized to the CDR1 and extended CDR3-like regions of the Ig variable-like domain (8Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CD80 and CD86 had similar equilibrium properties for binding to CTLA-4 and CD28, although different kinetic properties were noted for binding of these ligands to CTLA-4 (11Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J. Ledbetter J.A. Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, many fundamental properties of CD28/CTLA-4/CD80/CD86 interactions remain unknown. For instance, it is not known how the subunit structures of CD28 and CTLA-4 affect their binding properties. While these molecules have two binding sites per homodimer (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Shaw S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15417-15424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), previous studies have shown only single equilibrium constants for CD80/CD86 binding to CD28 and CTLA-4 (9Linsley P.S.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1047-1054PubMed Google Scholar). It is also unclear how previous binding determinations were affected by multivalent Ig fusion proteins. Moreover, very little information is available on the binding properties of CD28, as studies on this molecule have been hampered by its weak avidity. It was therefore of interest to better characterize the binding interactions of CD28/CTLA-4/CD80/CD86. In this study, we have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the precise equilibrium and kinetics of binding of defined fragments of CD28/CTLA-4 and CD80/CD86. SPR provides a sensitive means to measure, in real time, binding interactions between biological molecules without problems associated with other techniques (22Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Binding of soluble proteins to immobilized ligands is measured by the accumulation of mass on the surface of a sensor chip. SPR can be used to directly measure equilibrium binding constants and also to estimate kinetic association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants, which can then be used to calculate equilibrium binding constants. The results of our analysis demonstrate previously unknown roles for CD28/CTLA-4 dimerization and CD80/CD86 oligomerization in regulating binding interactions between these molecules. Chimeric mAb L6 was obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Seattle, WA). Anti-CTLA-4 mAbs 10A8 and 11D4; anti-CD28 mAb 9.3; and Ig fusion constructs CTLA4Ig, CD28Ig, CD80Ig, and CD86Ig have also been described (11Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J.

Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). For preparation of recombinant forms of the extracellular domains of CD28 and CTLA-4, Ig fusion proteins were prepared that contained a synthetic thrombin cleavage site between the extracellular domains and the Fc regions. Polymerase chain reaction products encoding the extracellular domains of CD28 and CTLA4Ig (9Linsley P.S. Brady W. Grosmaire L. Aruffo A. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp.

Douthwright J. McDonald V. Aruffo A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 188: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resulting thrombin cleavage site-containing fusion constructs were designated CTLA4tIg and CD28tIg, respectively. Ig fusion proteins were produced by transiently transfected COS cells or stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein A-Sepharose (Repligen, Cambridge, MA) (9Linsley P.S. Brady W. Grosmaire L. Aruffo A. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant Ig fusion proteins had properties indistinguishable from those of CD28Ig and CTLA4Ig (9Linsley P.S. Brady W. Grosmaire L. Aruffo A. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp.

Med. 1991; 174: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). For preparation of the dimeric extracellular domains of these proteins, the fusion proteins were digested with purified bovine thrombin (Armour Pharmaceutical Corp., Kankakee, IL) at a final concentration of 5 units/mg of protein at 37°C for 40-60 min. The cleaved extracellular domains were purified from other digestion products (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W.

The predicted amino acid sequence of CTLA-4tp contains residues 1-127 (numbered as in 8Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) of CTLA-4 fused to a thrombin-cleaved linker peptide (-PDSDpgggggrlv-, where lower-case letters denote linker sequences). CD28tp contains residues 1-134 of CD28 fused to a thrombin-cleaved linker (-PSKPdpgggggrlv-). Concentrations of CTLA-4tp and CD28tp were estimated using extinction coefficients of 2.2 and 1.7 ml/mg, respectively; these were experimentally determined by measuring the A280 of solutions whose protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Molecular weights were calculated using monomeric molecular weights. CTLA-4tp and CD28tp preparations were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography to ensure their homogeneity; all preparations used in this paper contained <2% of high molecular weight aggregate(s). Some preparations of CTLA-4tp contained excessive amounts of high molecular weight aggregate(s), so these were subjected to further purification by size fractionation of the main dimeric species by gel permeation chromatography. CTLA-4tp and the previously described thrombin fragment, CTLA-4t (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W. Malacko A.R.

Preparation of CTLA4XC120S (a monomeric form of CTLA-4 with a cysteine to serine mutation in the position of the interchain disulfide of CTLA-4) and CD86t (a monomeric form of the extracellular domain of CD86) was described previously (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Shaw S.-Y. J. Biol.

In most experiments, protein fragments were analyzed on a TSK-GEL G3000 SWXL column (Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% NaN3 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. In some experiments, protein fragments were analyzed on a Waters SW 991 column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.01% NaN3 at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Equivalent results were obtained with both columns. SDS-PAGE was performed on Tris/glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and images of wet gels were obtained by digital scanning. All experiments were run on BIAcore™ or BIAcore 2000 biosensors (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala) at 25°C. Ligands were immobilized on research-grade CM5 sensor chips (Pharmacia) using standard N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimid/N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling (22Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 25Khilko S.N. Corr M. Boyd L.F. Lees A. Inman J.K. Margulies D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15425-15434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were diluted in 10 mM sodium formate buffer, pH 4.0, and incubated with activated sensor chips for times varied to optimize the degree of derivatization needed for particular experiments. After coupling, excess N-hydroxysuccinimide groups were inactivated with ethanolamine HCl (22Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 25Khilko S.N. Corr M. Boyd L.F. Lees A. Inman J.K. Margulies D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15425-15434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control chips were either derivatized with chimeric mAb L6 or mock-derivatized by activating and then inactivating with ethanolamine without the addition of protein. Identical results were obtained with both types of control chips. After binding of CTLA-4 or CD28, CD80Ig- and CD86Ig-coated chips were regenerated with a 60-s pulse of 50 mM sodium citrate and 500 mM NaCl, pH 4.0 or 5.0, respectively. Control experiments showed that CD80Ig- and CD86Ig-derivatized surfaces were able to withstand >30 rounds of regeneration without losing binding capacity. Before use, all sensor surfaces were subjected to several rounds of analyte binding, followed by regeneration to ensure a stable level of derivatization. Mobile phase buffer for immobilization was phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% P20 surfactant (Pharmacia). For binding assays, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to the mobile phase buffer. Sensorgram base lines were normalized to zero response units (RU) prior to analysis. Samples were run over mock-derivatized flow cells to determine background RU values due to bulk refractive index differences between solutions. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from plots of Req versus C, where Req is the steady-state response minus the response on a mock-derivatized chip, and C is the molar concentration of analyte. Binding curves were analyzed using commercial nonlinear curve-fitting software (Prism, GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). Experimental data were first fit to a model for a single ligand binding to a single receptor (one-site model, i.e. a simple Langmuir system, A + B ⇆ AB), and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd = [A]·[B]/[AB]) were calculated from the equation R = Rmax·C/(Kd+ C). Subsequently, data were fit to the simplest two-site model of ligand binding (i.e. to a receptor having two non-interacting independent binding sites), as described by the equation R = Rmax1·C/(Kd1+ C) + Rmax2·C/(Kd2+ C). The goodness-of-fits of these two models were analyzed visually by comparison with the experimental data and statistically by an F test of the sums-of-squares. The simpler one-site model was chosen as the best fit unless the two-site model fit significantly better (p < 0.1). Association and dissociation analyses were performed using BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Pharmacia). Association rate constants (kon) were calculated in two ways, assuming both homogeneous single-site interactions and parallel two-site interactions. For single-site interactions, kon values were calculated according to the equation Rt = Req(1 − exp−ks(t−to)), where Rt is the response at a given time, t; Req is the steady-state response; to is the time at the start of the injection; and ks = dR/dt = kon·C + koff, where C is the concentration of analyte, calculated in terms of monomeric binding sites. For two-site interactions, kon values were calculated according to the equation Rt = Req1(1 − exp−ks1(t−to)) + Req2(1 − exp−ks2(t−to)). For each model, the values of kon were determined from the calculated slopes (to ∼70% maximal association) of plots of ks versus C. Dissociation data were analyzed according to one-site (AB = A + B) or two-site (AiBj = Ai + Bj) models, and rate constants (koff) were calculated from best fit curves. The one-binding site model was used except when the residuals were greater than machine background (2-10 RU, according to machine), in which case the two-binding site model was employed. Half-times of receptor occupancy were calculated using the relationship t1/2 = 0.693/koff. Accurate measurement of CD28/CTLA-4/CD80/CD86 interactions required preparation of fragments of these molecules with defined valencies. In a previous study (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Shaw S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15417-15424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we described the preparation and characterization of dimeric and monomeric forms of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and a monomeric form of CD86 (CD86t). Preparation of these fragments was accomplished by thrombin cleavage of (presumed) dimeric CTLA4Ig and CD86Ig at a nonclassical cleavage site in the Fc hinge region of these molecules (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Shaw S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15417-15424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). While these fragments were useful, they were difficult to produce in sufficient yield because of inefficient thrombin cleavage. To improve the yield of these extracellular fragments, we re-engineered the CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig fusion proteins such that a synthetic thrombin recognition site was introduced between the extracellular domains of CTLA-4 or CD28 and the Fc domain (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting CTLA4tIg and CD28tIg fusion proteins had binding properties indistinguishable from those of our original fusion proteins, but could be more efficiently cleaved by thrombin. 2J. L. Greene, G. M. Leytze, J. Emswiler, R. Peach, J. Bajorath, W. Cosand, and P. S. Linsley, unpublished data. From these new fusion proteins, we prepared fragments of the extracellular domains of CTLA-4 and CD28, termed CTLA-4tp and CD28tp, as described under “Materials and Methods.” CTLA-4tp and CD28tp retained binding activities essentially equivalent to those of the corresponding Ig fusion proteins as indicated by monitoring binding activities during purification. These proteins also retained the ability to bind anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CD28 mAbs (data not shown), indicating that they had native conformations. These fragments were characterized by SDS-PAGE and gel permeation chromatography in the experiments shown in Fig. 1. Under nonreducing conditions, CTLA-4tp migrated at Mr = 55,000-60,000 when analyzed by either technique; upon reduction, it migrated at Mr = 25,000-35,000. CTLA-4tp therefore was a disulfide-linked dimer. CD28tp migrated at Mr∼ 65,000 and 45,000 by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively. In contrast, during gel permeation chromatography, CD28tp eluted at Mr∼ 180,000 and 65,000 under nonreducing and reducing conditions. The elution volume of CD28tp during gel permeation chromatography was therefore greater than would be predicted by SDS-PAGE. This difference may be due to the predicted extensive glycosylation of CD28tp, or it may indicate that CD28tp in solution existed as a tetramer. At present, we cannot distinguish between these possibilities, but to simplify subsequent calculations, we have assumed that CD28tp was dimeric. Neither CTLA-4tp nor CD28tp preparations used for binding measurements had significant amounts of aggregated material present. Monomeric CD86 (CD86t) and monomeric CTLA-4 (CTLA4XC120S, prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residue that mediates the intrachain disulfide bond) were prepared as described (13Linsley P.S. Nadler S.G. Bajorath J. Peach R. Leung H.T. Rogers J. Bradshaw J. Stebbins M. Leytze G. Brady W. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Shaw S.-Y. J. Biol.

We initially used SPR to measure equilibrium binding of CTLA4Ig, CD28Ig, CD80Ig, and CD86Ig fusion proteins using the methods of van der Merwe et al. (26van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W.

This procedure was devised for determining the equilibrium binding properties of lymphocyte surface receptors with low binding avidity and rapid kinetic off-rates. CD80Ig and CD86Ig were coupled to sensor chips, and solutions of CTLA4Ig and/or CD28Ig were added in the mobile phase. The levels of derivatization of the chips were adjusted to ensure that steady-state (equilibrium) binding was achieved at low concentrations of analyte. Similar results were obtained at different levels of chip derivatization. Equilibrium binding of CTLA4Ig at a given concentration was determined by comparing the steady-state RU on CD80Ig- or CD86Ig-coated chips with the value obtained on control chimeric mAb L6 or mock-derivatized chips. From this comparison, levels of specific binding were determined at different concentrations. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) could then be determined from binding isotherms by curve fitting. Similar results were obtained whether we measured binding of CTLA4Ig to immobilized CD80Ig or CD86Ig or binding of CD80Ig or CD86Ig to immobilized CTLA4Ig (data not shown). Thus, the equilibrium constants obtained were not greatly influenced by which protein was immobilized, indicating that protein immobilization to the sensor chip did not significantly affect binding activity (data not shown; also see results presented in Table I., Table II., below). For most subsequent experiments, we chose to measure binding of CTLA-4 and CD28 fragments with defined valency to immobilized CD80Ig and/or CD86Ig.Table I.Summary of equilibrium constantsImmobilized proteinAnalytepObservedCalculatedKd1Kd2Kd1Kd1Kd2Kd1nMnM%nMnM%CD80IgCTLA4XC120S0.786211 ± 34NAaNA, not applicable (i.e. a one-binding site model fit the data adequately).NA208NANACD80IgCTLA-4tp<0.000011 ± 1150 ± 9178 ± 2410086 ± 3CD80IgCD28tp0.0912500 ± 210041,000 ± 19,00015 ± 12490090,00031 ± 8CD86IgCTLA4XC120S1.02200 ± 970NANA2000NANACD86IgCTLA-4tp<0.0014 ± 3510 ± 23058 ± 1047062 ± 11CD86IgCD28tp<0.0012300 ± 150037,000 ± 13,00023 ± 6560034,00038 ± 4a NA, not applicable (i.e. a one-binding site model fit the data adequately).

We have obtained the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of polypeptide constituents found on purified vesicles and in this report investigate the 24- and 25-kDa species. The 24-kDa protein is identical to Emp24p, a type I transmembrane protein that is required for transport of a subset of secretory proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex (Schimmöller, F., Singer-Krüger, B., Schröder, S., Krüger, U., Barlowe, C., and Riezman, H.

Erv25p shares overall sequence identity with Emp24p, but the two proteins are not functionally interchangeable. Antibodies directed against Erv25p reveal that Emp24p and Erv25p depend on each other for stability and form a protein complex that can be isolated after chemical cross-linking. Yeast strains lacking Erv25p (erv25Δ) are viable and display the same selective defect in transport of secretory proteins from the ER to Golgi complex as an emp24Δ strain. A cell-free assay that measures vesicle formation from ER membranes demonstrates that Erv25p and Emp24p are incorporated equally into ER-derived vesicles when COPII-coated budding is reconstituted. Vesicle formation from an erv25Δ strain, an emp24Δ strain and a double erv25Δ emp24Δ strain proceed at wild-type levels; however, incorporation of the Erv25p or the Emp24p protein into COPII-coated vesicles requires expression of both subunits.

https://openalex.org/W1996404678,"In this study, we have used immunocytochemical and fractionation approaches to provide a description of the localization of the mammalian Cdc42 protein (designated Cdc42Hs) in vivo. A specific anti-peptide antibody was generated against the C-terminal region of Cdc42Hs. Using affinity-purified preparations of this antibody in indirect immunofluorescence experiments, Cdc42Hs was found to be localized to the Golgi apparatus. Similar to the well-characterized non-clathrin coat proteins ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and β-COP, the perinuclear clustering of Cdc42Hs is rapidly dispersed upon exposure of the cells to the drug brefeldin A, suggesting that it too may play a role in the processes of intracellular lipid and protein transport. Employing cell lines possessing inducible forms of ARF, we demonstrate here a tight coupling of the nucleotide-bound state of ARF and the subcellular localization of Cdc42Hs. Specifically, the expression of wild-type ARF had no effect on the brefeldin A sensitivity of Cdc42Hs while, as is the case for ARF and β-COP, expression of a GTPase-deficient form of ARF (ARF(Q71L)) renders these Golgi-localized proteins resistant to brefeldin A treatment (36Teal S.B.

These results suggest that Cdc42Hs may play a role in cell morphogenesis by acting on targets in the Golgi that direct polarized growth at the plasma membrane. The Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins plays critical regulatory roles in a variety of cellular functions including growth control, intracellular traffic, and cytoskeletal organization (for a review, see Hall, 1994). A general role in cell morphogenesis for the Rho subfamily proteins has recently been demonstrated by results obtained with microinjection of mutant or modified Rho and Rac proteins (Kozma et al., 1995; 28Ridley A. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar; 29Ridley A. Paterson H. Johnston C. Diekmann D. Hall A.

Cdc42Hs belongs to the Rho subfamily of low molecular weight GTPases and is the mammalian homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-division-cycle protein Cdc42Sc, previously shown to function in the process of polarized growth in yeast (16Johnson D. Pringle J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The human and yeast proteins are 80% identical, whereas the most closely related proteins in the mammalian Ras superfamily, Rac 1,2 and RhoA, share roughly 70 and 50% homologies with the Cdc42Hs sequence, respectively (33Shinjo K. Koland J. Hart M. Narasimhan V. Johnson D. Evans T. Cerione R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Several regulatory activities specific for Cdc42Hs or related Rho family members have been identified in vitro. These include the dbl oncogene product, which accelerates GDP-GTP exchange (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S. Cerione R. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the Cdc42Hs-GAP (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S. Cerione R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of putative targets have recently been identified and characterized including the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) (35Symons M. Derry J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemabieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), the p21-activated serine/threonine kinases (PAKs) (22Manser E. Leung T.

Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). All of these suggest an important function for Cdc42Hs in processes critical for normal cell growth and differentiation. However, little is known regarding the specific biochemical mechanisms by which Cdc42Hs is regulated or how its various effector activities are manifested in vivo. The high degree of sequence conservation between the yeast and human Cdc42 proteins results in full complementation of CDC42-deficient yeast strains by the human cdc42 gene (33Shinjo K. Koland J. Hart M. Narasimhan V. Johnson D. Evans T. Cerione R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the underlying function of the yeast and mammalian Cdc42 proteins might be similarly conserved along with the regulatory proteins that modulate their nucleotide-bound state. This view has been supported by the finding that the dbl oncogene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor with in vitro specificity for the Cdc42Hs protein (15Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilla D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas deletion analysis in S. cerevisiae has demonstrated that the CDC24 gene product, which contains a region with sequence similarity to Dbl, interacts with the Cdc42Sc protein (Ziman and Johnson, 1994). The region of similarity between Cdc24 and Dbl consists of ∼250 amino acids and has been shown to be necessary for both the transformation and nucleotide exchange activity of oncogenic Dbl (15Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilla D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, 40Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar have demonstrated that the recombinant Cdc24 protein can act as a potent exchange factor for either the mammalian or yeast Cdc42 in vitro. Consistent with its proposed role in cell polarity in yeast, Cdc42Sc has been shown to localize to the site of bud emergence at the plasma membrane (Ziman et al., 1993). Recent progress in purifying and characterizing regulatory and target proteins for Cdc42Hs has prompted similar interest in its subcellular location with the expectation that this knowledge will provide clues to its in vivo function. The evidence reported in this study indicates that a significant fraction of the Cdc42Hs in mammalian cells is localized to the Golgi apparatus. This membrane-bound Cdc42Hs pool in resting cells is immediately shifted from the perinuclear Golgi complex to the cytosol in BFA 1The abbreviations used are: BFAbrefeldin AARFADP-ribosylation factorTBSTris-buffered saline. -treated cells. This responsiveness of the Golgi- localized Cdc42Hs to brief BFA treatment is similar to that of proteins that have been demonstrated to be components essential for intracellular trafficking. In this regard, the observed properties of cellular Cdc42Hs, both in distribution and responsiveness to BFA and the GTP-binding protein ARF, are remarkable in their biochemical similarities to the non-clathrin coated vesicle component β-COP. Taken together with microinjection studies implicating Cdc42Hs in cell filopodia genesis (Kozma et al., 1995; 25Nobes C. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar), the results presented here, which describe a close coupling of Cdc42Hs to the ARF GTPase cycle, suggest a role for mammalian Cdc42 in the processes leading to the formation and targeted delivery of Golgi-derived vesicles in cells. brefeldin A ADP-ribosylation factor Tris-buffered saline. BFA was purchased from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI) and stored as a 5 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol at −20°C. An antibody for Cdc42Hs was raised in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 22 amino acids of Cdc42Hs, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (33Shinjo K. Koland J. Hart M. Narasimhan V. Johnson D. Evans T. Cerione R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of the Cdc42Hs antibodies was achieved using peptide conjugated to Sepharose 4B CNBr-activated beads. This antibody was found to be highly specific for Cdc42Hs and did not react with its closest homologs (Rac1, Rac2, or RhoA; data not shown). Monoclonal anti-β-COP M3A5 (2Allan V. Kreis T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2229-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was a gift of T. Kreis (University of Geneva, Switzerland) and was used at a 1:50 dilution for immunolocalization and at a 1:1000 dilution for immunoblotting. The monoclonal antibody 10E6 (37Wood S. Park J. Brown W. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which recognizes a resident Golgi protein, was a gift of W. Brown (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and was used at a 1:100 dilution in PBS (120 mM NaCl and 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) for immunolocalization. Mouse monoclonal antibody specific for mannosidase II was obtained from Babco (Richmond, CA) and used at a 1:100 dilution for immunoblotting. Bodipy® and rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR) and used at a 1:200 dilution in PBS. Immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence as per manufacturer's instructions after sequential incubations of primary antibody and a secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate purchased from Amersham diluted 1:5000 in TBS-Tween (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma)). NR6 fibroblasts (a gift of O. Segatto) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). PtK1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Selection and cloning of stable normal rat kidney cell lines possessing inducible forms of human wild-type and mutant ARF1 have been described in detail elsewhere (38Zhang C. Rosenwald A. Willingham M. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Expression of ARF proteins was initiated by the addition of 1000 units/ml of α/β rat interferon to culture medium for indicated times. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were typically cultured on glass coverslips (22-×-22 mm; Corning) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% calf serum for 2-4 days. Where indicated, BFA treatment was performed by adding a 1:1000 volume of a 5-mg/ml BFA stock in EtOH. After BFA treatment, the cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS before fixation for 8 min at room temperature in PBS, 3.7% formaldehyde. After one room-temperature PBS wash for 2 min, the cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After rinsing cells with PBS, the primary antibodies were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washes with PBS (three washes, 10 min each), fluorescently labeled antibodies were incubated with the samples for 1 h at room temperature. After a final series of rinses with PBS, glass coverslips were mounted in anti-fade medium (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and sealed with paraffin. Samples were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope equipped with barrier filters to decrease crossover in two color fluorescence experiments. Fluorescence micrographs were recorded on Eastman Kodak T-MAX 400 film. Rabbit livers of approximately 100 g were obtained from freshly slain Flemish giants belonging to a colony maintained by Cornell University animal services. After thorough mincing of the tissue in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose and 100 mM Tris, pH 7.4), the cells were disrupted using a Yamasaki-type L-21 tissue homogenizer. The resulting suspension was either used for the isolation of intact nuclei as described by 8Blobel G. Potter V. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar or subjected to a more extensive fractionation protocol to separate different soluble and particulate components. In this procedure, the homogenate was first spun at 1000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman-type JA-21 centrifuge at 4°C (JA-10 rotor, 2500 rpm) to clear the sample of nuclei, unbroken cells, and cellular debris. The supernatant (designated as lysate) was transferred to fresh prechilled canisters and spun at 10,000 × g (JA-10 rotor, 12,500 rpm) for 10 min. The supernatant (“10k S”) was again removed from the resulting pellet (“10k P”), transferred to fresh centrifuge tubes, and spun for 90 min at 100,000 × g, resulting in a pellet of total cellular microsomes (“100k P”) and cytosol (“100k S”). This total microsomal pellet from the 100,000 × g spin was further fractionated by gentle disruption in ice-cold homogenization buffer supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin with 6-10 strokes of a type B Thomas homogenizer and made 1.22 M in sucrose by the addition of 2.0 M sucrose and 100 mM Tris, pH 7.4. This mixture was loaded onto the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient with interfaces at 1.22/1.15 M, 1.15/0.86 M, and 0.86/0.25 M sucrose and spun overnight in a Beckman ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g (Type SW28 rotor, 27,000 rpm). The fraction defined as GH was recovered from the 1.15/0.86 interface, whereas the GL fraction was recovered from the 0.86/0.25 interface. Fractions were assayed for total protein concentration using the Cu+/bicinchoninic acid method with bovine serum albumin serving as the standard. The subcellular distribution of Cdc42 was determined by performing a total cellular fractionation and immunoblotting equivalent amounts of protein from each of the fractions of homogenized rabbit liver. As shown in Fig. 1, 40 μg of each fraction revealed a significant amount of Cdc42Hs in the crude “GH” Golgi fraction collected from the 1.22/1.15 M sucrose interface (see “Materials and Methods”). Identification of the membranes in this fraction being significantly enriched in the Golgi apparatus was confirmed by probing the upper half of the transfer membrane with the monoclonal antibody 53FC3, which recognizes a resident enzyme of the Golgi complex, mannosidase II (9Burke B. Griffiths G. Reggio H. Louvard D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar; 6Baron M. Garoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19928-19931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations were also examined by scanning electron microscopy and found to be substantially enriched with the highly fenestrated membrane structures characteristic of the Golgi (data not shown). In all cell types examined, the anti C-terminal Cdc42Hs antibody revealed a prominent perinuclear staining pattern, as illustrated for untreated NR-6 cells in Fig. 2A. The perinuclear distribution observed with the anti-Cdc42 antibody overlapped to a significant extent in all cells with markers for the Golgi complex, including the 110-kDa subunit of the coatomer complex, β-COP (Fig. 2C; 30Robinson M. Kreis T. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Components of the coatomer complex, including the ARF GTPase, have been shown to be essential for the proper formation of transport vesicles in the Golgi cisternae (for a recent review, see 31Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Coatomer proteins are redistributed to the cytosol of treated cells within minutes after treatment with BFA, which results in a cessation of vesicle formation at the Golgi membrane, halting the constitutive secretory process. BFA has been shown to affect transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex by blocking the process of vesicle coating at the cytoplasmic face of donor membranes (27Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R. Rothman J. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The short term (<1 min) consequence of BFA treatment, namely, the redistribution of select transport proteins from the Golgi to the cytosol, is attributed to the inhibition by BFA of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the ARF GTP-binding protein that functions in isolated Golgi membranes. Fig. 2, B and D, show that BFA treatment caused a rapid change in the cellular localization of both Cdc42 and β-COP in that neither protein showed its characteristic perinuclear distribution after a 1-min treatment. Some nuclear staining by both the anti-Cdc42 and anti-β-COP antibodies was observed in cells that had been treated with BFA, although we failed to detect either protein by immunoblotting highly purified nuclei isolated from BFA-treated NR6 cells (data not shown). Under conditions that resulted in this rapid redistribution of Cdc42 and β-COP, the structure of the Golgi complex remained intact as shown in E and F, in which the pattern of immunofluorescence was obtained with a monoclonal antibody directed against a protein marker of the cis and medial cisternae of the Golgi complex (37Wood S.

The finding that Cdc42Hs is localized to the Golgi complex in mammalian cells led us to further characterize the effect of BFA treatment on its cellular distribution. Fig. 3, A and B, again illustrate the extensive overlap between Cdc42Hs (Fig. 3A) and the coat protein β-COP (Fig. 3B), as visualized using the anti-Cdc42Hs antibody and a monoclonal antibody that recognizes this coatomer subunit (2Allan V. Kreis T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2229-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with BFA causes a redistribution of both proteins (Fig. 3, C and D) with kinetics that are essentially identical, and, significantly, the addition of fresh culture medium to cells exposed to BFA for 1 min resulted in the rebinding of Cdc42Hs to Golgi membranes (t1/2∼30 min; data not shown). This reestablishment of Golgi membrane binding by Cdc42Hs in cells washed free of BFA was concomitant with the rebinding observed for β-COP. Likewise, conditions that block the effects of BFA treatment on the redistribution of β-COP similarly affected Cdc42Hs. For example, pretreatment of cells with AlF4− has previously been shown to render cells insensitive to the effects of BFA on coatomer binding (13Donaldson J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When cells normally responsive to BFA were preincubated with AlF4− before the addition of BFA, Cdc42Hs as well as β-COP remained bound to Golgi membranes (Fig. 3, E and F). This AlF4−-induced block of BFA effects has been interpreted as evidence for a heterotrimeric G protein α subunit acting upstream of coat proteins and contributing to the regulation of their membrane binding (19Ktistakis N. Linder M. Roth M. Nature. 1992; 356: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additional support for the view that Cdc42Hs may be regulated by the same cellular factors that determine the distribution of coatomer proteins is provided by the finding that in cell lines such as PtK1 that are resistant to the action of BFA on coatomer proteins, the subcellular location of Cdc42Hs is also unaffected by BFA treatment. Fig. 4 compares the effect of BFA on the distribution of Cdc42Hs (A and B) and β-COP (C and D) in PtK1 cells. The ineffectiveness of BFA in certain cell lines seems to be due to the absence of a factor in the membrane fraction that can be reconstituted in heterokaryons (18Ktistakis N. Roth M. Bloom G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this membrane component represents the BFA target that can block normal ARF guanine nucleotide exchange activity, but this proposed BFA-sensitive factor seems to determine the BFA effects on Cdc42Hs as well. Given the similarities observed for Cdc42 and proteins previously linked to the GTPase cycle of ARF, we wanted to examine whether Cdc42Hs and ARF participate in a common biochemical pathway at the Golgi membrane. Previously, several laboratories have shown that transfection of mutant forms of ARF possessing distinct functional properties (e.g. GTPase-deficient) result in dramatic changes in the distribution of coatomer proteins and their sensitivity to BFA (38Zhang C. Rosenwald A. Willingham M. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; 12Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 36Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the expression of mutant forms of ARF resulted in changes of CDC42 localization or an altered sensitivity to BFA treatment, cell lines possessing inducible forms of ARF3 (38Zhang C. Rosenwald A. Willingham M. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were used in Cdc42 immunolocalization experiments. The expression of a GTPase-deficient form of ARF3 that possesses a mutation at codon 71 (designated ARF(Q71L)) blocks the action of BFA on the localization of β-COP in normal rat kidney cells. This observation further supports ARF as a critical component of the coatomer-binding cycle because the induction of the ARF(Q71L) mutant resulted in a loss of constitutive secretory activity in these cells (38Zhang C. Rosenwald A. Willingham M. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 demonstrates that the presence of the GTPase-deficient form of ARF3 also blocks the action of BFA on the Golgi population of Cdc42Hs. In A, control normal rat kidney cells, after the induction of the wild-type form of ARF3, were stained for the presence of Cdc42Hs using the anti-C-terminal antibody. As is the case for the NR6 cells, Cdc42Hs is localized to the Golgi membranes of normal rat kidney cells (Fig. 5A) and is rapidly redistributed upon exposure to 5 μg/ml BFA (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the expression of the ARF3(Q71L) mutant made Cdc42Hs insensitive to the addition of BFA (Fig. 5D). The distribution of Cdc42Hs after the induction of ARF(Q71L) but before the addition of BFA is shown in Fig. 5C. The failure of BFA to redistribute the Golgi-bound Cdc42Hs was absolutely dependent on the addition of interferon, which was necessary to induce the expression of the ARF3(Q71L) mutant. The expression of a second ARF3 mutant, in which an isoleucine was substituted for an asparagine at position 126 (ARF(N126I)), was found to cause a significant redistribution of the Golgi-bound population of Cdc42Hs. Fig. 6A shows that when normal rat kidney cells transfected with an inducible form of ARF(N126I) were stained for the presence of Cdc42Hs, the typical perinuclear localization of Cdc42 revealed by staining with the C-terminal antibody was observed. Remarkably, however, after a 9-h induction period, the perinuclear localization of Cdc42Hs was no longer detected. Given that the ARF(N126I) mutant binds both GDP and GTP poorly and is defective for guanine nucleotide exchange, these results are consistent with the idea that disruption of the normal nucleotide exchange activity of ARF prevents the association of Cdc42Hs with Golgi membranes (see below). Several recent observations suggest that Cdc42 plays a key role in signaling cascades that affect cell morphogenesis. The demonstration that Swiss-3T3 fibroblasts microinjected with Cdc42Hs can induce the outgrowth of plasma membrane filopodia (17Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar; 25Nobes C. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar) is consistent in a broad topological sense with the earlier observations in S. cerevisiae that assigned Cdc42Sc a critical role in the establishment of cell polarity (1Adams A. Johnson D. Longnecker R. Sloat B. Pringle J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Our present results, which indicate that the Golgi membranes are the predominant location for Cdc42 in mammalian cells, suggest that the regulation of filopodia formation by Cdc42Hs may be coupled to a transport activity. The role of the Golgi apparatus in orchestrating the biochemical events that control the formation of transport vesicles and the incorporation of biomolecules that determine vesicle targeting has been well established, and several proteins have been identified that play critical roles in Golgi-mediated transport, including the coatomer subunits, e.g. β-COP (32Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R. Rothman J. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein ARF. The high molecular weight coatomer complex cycles between a soluble form when ARF is in the inactive or GDP-bound state and a membrane-attached form when ARF is active or GTP-bound. Agents that block the delivery of vesicles to the plasma membrane such as GTPγS and BFA have been used to disrupt the normal cycling of this complex, thereby demonstrating the critical importance of coatomer membranes to cytosol translocation in the proper maintenance of the constitutive secretory machinery. Our indirect immunofluorescence experiments show a similar (Golgi) localization for Cdc42Hs and the non-clathrin coated vesicle (coatomer) protein β-COP and that the localization of both proteins is similarly affected by BFA and different mutants of ARF. The mechanism by which expression of the ARF(Q126I) mutant results in the constitutive redistribution of Cdc42Hs is most likely a consequence of the nucleotide-bound state of the ARF protein. In vitro binding assays with ARF(Q126I) indicate that this mutant binds guanine nucleotides very weakly, 2C. Zhang, unpublished observations. indicating that in vivo, this ARF mutant is largely nucleotide-free. Thus, the nucleotide-free form of ARF most likely acts as a dominant negative suppressor of normal ARF function by binding to and blocking the action of the ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor present in the Golgi membranes, as is the case for related mutants of other Ras-like GTP-binding proteins (15Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilla D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the induction of the ARF(Q126I) mutant has the same affect as BFA treatment (i.e. eliminating the perinuclear distribution of Cdc42Hs) suggests that ARF acts upstream or in coordination with Cdc42Hs in the Golgi membrane. One possible biochemical connection between these two GTPases has been recently suggested from data characterizing a synergistic effect of ARF and Cdc42Hs toward phospholipase D activity (34Singer W. Brown H. Bokoch G. Sternweis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that they both may bind to distinct activation sites on a common target enzyme. Significantly, the phospholipase D activity in this study was Golgi-localized and, consistent with a role for Cdc42Hs and ARF in its activation, was blocked by treatment of the Golgi membranes with BFA (20Ktistakis N.T. Brown H. Sternweis P. Roth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings coupled with the observation that BFA treatment blocks the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced formation of filopodia and retards the wound-healing response (7Bershadsky A. Futerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5686-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) make it tempting to speculate that Cdc42Hs contributes to the mechanism by which new lipid and protein are delivered to a chosen point on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, thus giving rise to filopodia extension. If indeed Cdc42Hs participates directly in a transport process, the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle may dictate its subcellular location. Current studies are focusing on the identification of epitope-tagged mutated forms of Cdc42Hs in transfected cell lines to examine the effect of nucleotide-depleted or GTPase-defective forms of the protein on their subcellular localization. Preliminary results suggest that GTPase-defective forms of Cdc42Hs in transfected cell lines are growth inhibitory, consistent with a cyclical role for Cdc42Hs in proper cell growth and maintenance. Another important challenge for the future will be to better understand how the actions of Cdc42Hs in the Golgi are coupled to its interactions with non-Golgi target proteins. One such target is the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), which has been suggested to function as an effector for Cdc42Hs in actin polymerization (35Symons M. Derry J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemabieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). A second group of targets is the family of p21-activated kinases (i.e. the PAKs) (Manser et al., 1995; 23Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar; 3Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the stimulation of PAK activity by Cdc42Hs initiates a protein kinase cascade that culiminates in the activation of two nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinases, the c-Jun kinase (JNK1) and p38 (11Coso O.A.

Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Even more recently, it has been suggested that Cdc42Hs may participate in cell cycle check-point control through its ability to stimulate the 70-kDa S6 kinase (10Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, a picture seems to be emerging in which Cdc42 directly influences a variety of cellular activities that bear on the cytoskeleton and various nuclear/cell-cycle events. It is difficult to imagine that these different activities would occur randomly; rather, it seems more likely that they would need to be coordinated. Perhaps such coordination is mediated at the Golgi membranes, where Cdc42Hs may initate actin-based trafficking events that are critical and/or coupled to normal cell cycle progression. Through the use of epitope-tagged mutants of Cdc42Hs, we hope to be able to identify additional participants in each of the effector activities for Cdc42Hs and thus begin to obtain a clearer picture of its overall biological function as well as better understand how its different effector activities are coordinated."

A third site in the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter at −250 also contributes to basal promoter activity, but a cognate transcription factor has not yet been characterized (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both α1(I) and α2(I) collagen promoters in the mouse are negatively regulated by a transcriptional repressor termed IF1 that binds to two adjacent sites between −90 and −170 in the α1(I) promoter and between −165 and −155 in the α2(I) promoter (9Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel factor of unknown function has been shown to interact with the region between −419 and −399 in the mouse α2(I) promoter (11Hatamochi A. de Crombrugghe B. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). transforming growth factor β base pair(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum dimethyl sulfate ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction TGF-β response element. Initial studies of the human α2(I) promoter have indicated that the −376 to −108-bp promoter segment is sufficient to direct a high level of transcription in human fibroblasts (12Boast S. Su M-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcriptional regulation of this promoter in human fibroblasts differs in some respects from transcriptional regulation of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter. For example, it has been demonstrated that CTF/NF1 does not bind to the human α2(I) collagen promoter (13Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β stimulation of human α2(I) collagen promoter is mediated by a multiprotein complex that interacts with two distinct promoter segments (−330 to −286 and −271 to −255) termed TbRE (13Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the proteins in this complex has been identified as Sp1 (13Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, TbRE also mediates inhibitory effects of tumor necrosis factor-α on transcriptional regulation of the human α2(I) collagen promoter (14Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 mediates basal activity of the human α2(I) collagen promoter by binding to three responsive elements located between bp −303 and −271 (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have also suggested the involvement of AP1 family members in mediating TGF-β effects in the mouse and human α2(I) collagen promoters (16Chang E. Goldberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4473-4477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Chung K-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The human α2(I) collagen promoter region downstream from the Sp1 and TbRE binding sites has not been characterized. However, previous studies have indicated that a human α2(I) collagen promoter segment with a deleted or mutated Sp1-responsive element still maintained low levels of promoter activity suggesting the presence of additional regulatory sites in the downstream promoter region (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, several response elements were mapped in the corresponding region of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to characterize this region in the human α2(I) collagen promoter. In this study we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the −234 to −34-bp segment of the human α2(I) collagen promoter. Using in vitro and in vivo footprinting analyses we demonstrate that this promoter region contains three protein-DNA binding sites. Functional analyses of these sites suggest complex interactions of the repressor(s) and activator(s) in regulating constitutive transcriptional levels of the human α2(I) promoter. Human fibroblasts were obtained from foreskins of healthy newborns, following institutional approval and informed consent. Primary explant cultures were established in 25-cm2 culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mML-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml amphotericin. Fibroblast cultures independently isolated from different individuals were maintained as monolayers at 37°C in 90% air, 10% CO2 and studied between the third and sixth subpassages. IMR-90 (ATCC) fibroblasts were used in parallel with human foreskin fibroblasts. Both fibroblast types produced similar results in all assays. Human fibroblasts were grown to 90% confluence in 100-mm dishes in DMEM with 10% FCS. Monolayers were washed and cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique (17Chung K-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of various promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs. pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. After incubation overnight, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% FCS. Incubation was then continued for 48 h. Cells were harvested in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, and fractured by freeze-thawing. Extracts were normalized for protein contents as measured by Bio-Rad reagents and incubated with butyryl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol for 90 min at 37°C, an assay condition predetermined to be within the linear range of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity for these samples. Butyrated chloramphenicol was extracted using organic solvent (2:1 mixture of tetramethylpentadecane and xylene) and quantitated by scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (18Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells from five 150-mm dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of cold buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4°C, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). The cells were allowed to swell on the ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s. The tube was centrifuged for 3 min and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of cold buffer C (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.7 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4°C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −80°C until use. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad reagent. Radioactive probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction (202-mer wild type and mutated) using [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled primers. For DNase I footprinting, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min on ice in 50 μl of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 12,000 cpm of labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and nuclear extract containing 120 μg of protein. After subsequent addition of 5 μl of 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2 and incubation for 1 min at room temperature, 0.02 (for conditions without nuclear extract) to 3 units of DNase I (purchased from Boehringer Mannheim) were added. Digestion with DNase I was continued for 1 min at room temperature and terminated by adding 140 μl of 192 mM sodium acetate, 32 mM EDTA, 0.14% SDS, and 64 μg/ml yeast RNA. After phenol/chloroform extraction and subsequent precipitation with ethanol, the digested probe was dissolved in 3 μl of 95% formamide containing 10 mM EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, and 0.3% xylene cyanol and was electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide/urea gel along with Maxam-Gilbert G+A sequencing reactions as size markers. For DNA mobility shift assay, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min in 12-20 μl of binding buffer containing 10,000 cpm of labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and nuclear extracts containing 3-5 μg of protein. In some assays double-stranded competitors were added. Oligonucleotides used as competitors were purchased from Operon Technologies. Separation of free radiolabeled DNA from DNA-protein complexes was carried out on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.5 × Tris borate electrophoresis buffer at 200 V at 4°C. Autoradiography was performed by overnight exposure to Kodak X-OMAT XAR2 film with intensifying screens at −80°C. Human fibroblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM, 10% FCS. The medium was then replaced with DMEM, 10% FCS containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and incubated for 2 min. Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 s each with gentle shaking at 37°C. Cells were lysed on the plates using 1.5 ml of lysing buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 μg/ml proteinase K, 0.2% SDS) and, after scraping, incubated for 4 h at 37°C. DNA was extracted twice with phenol, twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), once with a mixture of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and once with ether. DNA was precipitated once each with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). DNA for in vitro DMS treatment (naked) was prepared identically, with omission of DMS treatment. For the in vitro DMS treatment 25 μl of 1% DMS was added to 175 μl of DNA (100 μg), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 min, followed by the addition of 50 μl of ice-cold DMS stop buffer (1.5 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1 Mβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml of yeast tRNA). Stop buffer was also added to 200 μl of DNA from in vivo DMS treatment, and both DNA samples were precipitated with the addition of 750 μl of ethanol in a dry ice bath for 30 min, and the pellets were washed with 75% ethanol after centrifugation in the microcentrifuge. The pellets were dissolved in 200 μl of 1 M piperidine and incubated at 90°C for 30 min. Piperidine was removed by lyophilization, and DNA samples were resuspended in TE buffer, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol, and washed with 75% ethanol. The DNA was dissolved in TE buffer, and the concentration was adjusted to 0.4 μg/μl. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) was then used to detect DNA-protein interaction according to Mueller and Wold (19Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purified using denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Two oligonucleotides for staggered linker have been described (19Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to detect DNA-protein interactions on the coding strand of the human collagen α2(I) promoter: primer 1, GACTCCTTGTGTCGCAGAGC; primer 2, ACCTCCAACTTAGCCGAAACCT; primer 3, ACCTCCAACTTAGCCGAAACCTCCTGC. LMPCR hybridization temperatures for the primers were: primer 1, 59°C; primer 2, 58°C, primer 3, 60°C. To detect DNA-protein interactions on the noncoding strand the oligonucleotides were: primer 4, CATGTCGGGGCTGCAGAGCACTCC; primer 5, TGCAGAGCACTCCGACGTGT; primer 6, TGCAGAGCACTCCGACGTGTCCCA. LMPCR hybridization temperatures were 60°C for primer 4, 63°C for primer 5, and 66°C for primer 6. We have previously analyzed the −353 to −234 region of the human α2(I) collagen promoter and have demonstrated the presence of three binding sites for a transcription factor related to Sp1 in this promoter region (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To characterize DNA-protein interactions in the promoter region downstream from the Sp1 binding sites, we performed a DNase I protection assay using a promoter fragment from bp −235 to −34 and the nuclear extract from human fibroblasts. Three protected DNA segments were observed, which included two strongly protected regions located between bp −173 and −155 (footprint I), bp −133 and −119 (footprint II), and a broad weakly protected region between bp −101 and −72 (footprint III) (Fig. 1). We next asked whether the protein-DNA interactions identified by in vitro assays also occur in intact cells. We used in vivo footprinting to analyze protein binding to the bp −234 to −34 region of the α2(I) collagen promoter in human fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 2A differences were observed in the protein-DNA binding patterns between naked DNA treated with DMS in vitro (lane 1) and chromosomal DNA treated with DMS in vivo (lane 2) on the mRNA coding strand in the promoter region between bp −179 and −148 and bp −133 and −119. It appears that in vivo footprints correlate with the footprints I and II obtained in the DNase I protection assay (Fig. 1). A second set of primers was used to visualize binding to the noncoding strand (Fig. 2B). Protection and hypersensitivity sites were observed between bp −81 and −74 that correlate with the footprint III in Fig. 1. Thus, the three footprints identified by DNase I protection assays colocalized with in vivo footprints. The footprint III contains an inverted CCAAT motif between bp −84 and −80 that has been previously shown to bind the heterotrimeric transcription factor CBF in the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences corresponding to footprints I and II have not been rigorously analyzed in either mouse or human α2(I) collagen promoters. To test binding to the CCAAT motif in the human α2(I) collagen promoter, we employed a mobility shift assay using a 202-bp DNA fragment (from −235 to −34) and human fibroblast nuclear extracts. Two strong protein-DNA complexes (denoted 2 and 3 in Fig. 3, lane 2)) and two relatively weak complexes (denoted 1 and 4, Fig. 3, lane 2) were observed. Formation of one of the complexes (denoted 3) was abolished by the addition of excess cold 21-mer containing the CCAAT motif (CAGCCCTCCCATTGGTGGAGG) (lane 4) but not by the 21-mer containing a single substitution mutation within the CCAAT motif (CAGCCCTCCCTTTGGTGGAGG) (lane 5). Such mutation has been previously shown to abolish binding of CBF to the mouse collagen promoter (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the smallest complex did not form when a 202-mer containing the same substitution mutation in the CCAAT motif was used as a probe (lane 6). These data indicate that a factor from human fibroblasts, probably a human homolog of murine CBF, binds specifically to the CCAAT motif in the human α2(I) collagen promoter. Previous studies in the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter have demonstrated that the CCAAT motif at position −80 contributes significantly to the constitutive activity of this promoter (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of substitution mutation in the CCAAT motif (CCAAA) on the activity of the human promoter. The substitution mutation introduced into the −353 bp α2(I) collagen promoter fragment linked to the CAT reporter gene resulted in a 90% reduction of the basal promoter activity when compared with the wild type promoter (set arbitrarily at 100%) (Fig. 4). Thus, similar to the mouse promoter, the CCAAT motif in the human promoter is the binding site for an activator, most likely a human homolog of CBF.Fig. 4Functional analysis of the cis-regulatory elements in the human collagen α2(I) promoter. Substitution mutations were introduced into the plasmids containing the −353 to +58 α2(I) collagen promoter fragment cloned upstream from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. These plasmids were used in transient transfection assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” The diagram on the left indicates the mutated nucleotides shown in bold. Promoter activity of each mutated construct relative to the wild type −353 promoter construct, which was arbitrarily set at 100%, is shown at right. The means ± S.E. for separate experiments are shown. The number of experiments used to calculate the mean is shown in parentheses. Asterisks indicate statistically significant results relative to the wild type promoter (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize binding of the nuclear factors to the promoter region corresponding to footprint II, we performed DNA mobility shift assay using the promoter fragment from −135 to −116 and nuclear extracts from foreskin fibroblasts. Three specific protein-DNA complexes were observed (Fig. 5B, lane 2). To further characterize DNA sequences involved in formation of these DNA-protein complexes, a series of oligonucleotides containing substitution mutations (see Fig. 5A) were used as competitors in the DNA mobility shift assay. M3 and M4 oligonucleotides, containing substitution mutations in the TCCTCC motif located in the middle of the protected region, failed to inhibit formation of the DNA-protein complexes, while formation of all three complexes was abolished by an excess of M1 and M6 oligonucleotides and reduced by an excess of M2 and M5 oligonucleotides. These results indicate that the TCCTCC motif located between bp −123 and −128 mediates binding of the nuclear proteins to this promoter region; and the flanking regions may be important for forming stable DNA-protein complexes. To analyze the contribution of the TCCTCC motif to the basal collagen promoter activity, we introduced substitution mutations into TCC motifs using a −353 promoter construct. TCC motifs were mutated separately in the same fashion as oligonucleotides M3 and M4 used in the gel shift assay (Fig. 5). The promoter constructs carrying substitution mutations were analyzed by transient transfection assays (Fig. 4). Mutations in either TCC motif, when compared with the wild type promoter, resulted in significant reduction of the basal promoter activity, although mutation of the proximal site had a reproducible stronger effect (10.9 ± 2.9%) than mutation of the distal site (17.8 ± 2.8%). To test binding to the promoter region corresponding to footprint I, we performed a mobility shift assay using the promoter fragment from bp −176 to bp −153 and nuclear extract from newborn foreskin fibroblasts. Three specific protein-DNA complexes were observed (Fig. 6B, lane 2). To further characterize DNA sequences involved in formation of these DNA-protein complexes, a series of oligonucleotides containing substitution mutations (see Fig. 6A) were used as competitors in the DNA mobility shift assay. M4 and M5 oligonucleotides, containing substitution mutations in the “TCCCCC” motif located between −164 and −159 in the promoter region, failed to inhibit formation of the DNA-protein complexes, while formation of both complexes was abolished by an excess of M1, M2, and M6 oligonucleotides and reduced by an excess of M3 oligonucleotide. These results indicate that the pyrimidine-rich sequence CCTTCCCCC within footprint I mediates binding of the nuclear proteins to this promoter region. To analyze the contribution of this pyrimidine-rich motif to the basal promoter activity, we introduced substitution mutations into the TCCCCC motif using a −353 promoter construct. Proximal and distal triplets were mutated separately in the same fashion as oligonucleotides M5 and M4 used in the gel shift assay (Fig. 6A). The promoter constructs carrying substitution mutations were analyzed together with the wild type promoter by transient transfection assays. Mutations in either triplet, when compared with the wild type promoter, resulted in a significant increase in the basal promoter activity (Fig. 4). Mutation in the −164 to −162 (M4) site increased promoter activity to 580 ± 140%, and mutation in the −161 to −159 (M5) site increased promoter activity to 624 ± 183%. Based on this analysis we concluded that the pyrimidine-rich motif within footprint I is a binding site for the transcriptional repressor(s). Previous analyses of the human α2(I) collagen promoter have demonstrated a strong positive cis-regulatory element located between −319 and −267 (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This element, composed of three GC-rich motifs, has been characterized as a binding site for transcription factor Sp1. Thus, three positive and one negative cis-acting regulatory elements are present within the 350-bp fragment of the human α2(I) promoter. The three positive cis-acting elements at −300, −125, and −80 appear to contribute equally to promoter activity, as substitution mutation in each of these elements decreased promoter activity about 10-fold (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). To test the nature of the interactions between the Sp1 response element and the two proximal positive response elements at −125 and −80, we generated double mutants in which two elements were simultaneously altered (Fig. 7). The activities of these mutants were compared by transient transfection assays in human foreskin fibroblasts. Double mutations in Sp1 and CBF sites or Sp1 and “TCC” sites further diminished promoter activity about 2-fold to 5.6 ± 2.1 and 4.5 ± 1.9%, respectively (Fig. 7). We then asked whether mutation in the repressor binding site is capable of reversing the inhibitory effects of mutations in the activators' sites. To test this, we constructed three double mutants in which substitution mutation in the −161 to −159 position (Fig. 6A, M5) was introduced simultaneously with substitution mutations in the Sp1, CBF, or “TCC” sites. As shown in Fig. 7, double mutants containing either Sp1 or “TCC” mutations exhibited low promoter activity similar to the basal activity of the corresponding single mutant. Interestingly, activity of the double mutant of the repressor and CBF binding sites exhibited about 4-fold higher basal activity than the single mutant in the CBF site (9.3 ± 3 versus 36 ± 7.1, p < 0.01). These data suggest that activation of the human α2(I) promoter via the CCAAT cis-regulatory element and repression via the TCCCCC element are independent of each other. On the other hand, activation either via Sp1 binding sites or the TCCTCC motif may involve interaction between the activator and repressor elements. Previous studies of the human α2(I) collagen promoter have demonstrated that the 350-bp upstream promotor segment directs high constitutive promoter activity (12Boast S. Su M-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The −303 to −255 region has been shown to contain the binding site for the transcription factor Sp1 and also the TGF-β response element (13Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study we have identified three additional regions of the human α2(I) collagen promoter that bind nuclear factors by using in vitro and in vivo footprinting assays (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). These regions include sequences from −173 to −155 (footprint I), −133 to −119 (footprint II), and −101 to −72 (footprint III) (Fig. 8). Footprint II contains a novel cis-regulatory element that is not present in the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter. Functional analysis of this response element indicates that the sequence TCCTCC (between −128 and −123) contributes significantly to the basal promoter activity (Fig. 4). The nature of the binding proteins is presently unknown. A similar responsive element has been found in the osteonectin promoter, and a cognate factor termed “GGA factor” has been demonstrated by UV cross-linking to be a single 40-kDa protein (20Ibaraki K. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Binding to the TCCTCC motif in the human α2(I) collagen promoter appears to be more complex as indicated by the three DNA-protein complexes in the gel shift assay (Fig. 5). Purification of the transcription factors from human nuclear extracts that bind to the TCCTCC motif will facilitate further analysis of this novel responsive element. Footprint III contains an inverted CCAAT motif, which was previously shown to bind CBF, an activator of the murine α2(I) and α1(I) collagen promoters (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated specific binding to the CCAAT motif in the human α2(I) promoter (Fig. 3). Functional analysis of the CCAAT motif in human fibroblasts indicates that a transcriptional activator, possibly a human homolog of CBF, binds to this sequence (Fig. 4). Analysis of footprint I reveals that a pyrimidine-rich motif located between −164 and −159 is a binding site for a transcriptional repressor (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The homologous regions in murine α1(I) and α2(I) collagen promoters also have been shown to bind a transcriptional repressor termed IF1 (10Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Karsenty G. Ravazzolo R. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24842-24848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the CCAAT motif and the pyrimidine-rich element between −164 and −159 are functionally conserved between human and mouse promoters. On the other hand, the Sp1 binding sites at −300 (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the TCCTCC motif within footprint II appear to be specific for the human α2(I) collagen promoter. Interestingly, we have not observed any protection in either in vitro or in vivo footprinting analyses in the −250-bp region in the human α2(I) collagen promoter (data not shown). The corresponding region has been shown to mediate activation of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter (6Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could be the locus of additional differences between the regulatory mechanisms of the human and mouse collagen genes. Functional analysis of the four response elements identified in the 350-bp region of the human α2(I) collagen promoter reveals a complex interaction between the positive and negative regulatory elements. Mutation in the Sp1 binding sites decreases promoter activity by a factor of 10 (15Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutations in the CCAAT and TCCTCC motifs result in a similar reduction of promoter activity (Fig. 4), indicating that these three response elements contribute equivalently to the constitutive promoter activity. This is further demonstrated by double mutants in either Sp1 and CCAAT sites or Sp1 and TCCTCC sites, which reduce the promoter activity by an additional factor of 2 (Fig. 7), suggesting that proteins recognizing these sites have an additive effect in activating transcription. It is possible that combined actions of the three independent positive cis-regulatory elements are necessary to provide high levels of expression of the collagen type I gene in fibroblasts. Previous studies demonstrated that activation of transcription by Sp1 involves direct interaction with one of the subunits of the transcription factor TFIID, the 110-kDa polypeptide TAFII 110 (22Hoey T. Wienzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A similar interaction was recently reported for CBF (5Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Future studies are needed to elucidate possible interactions of CBF, Sp1, and other activators of collagen transcription with the basal transcription machinery and with each other in the regulation of the human α2(I) collagen promoter. Stimulation of transcription by CBF, Sp1, and other activators is counteracted by the action of the transcriptional repressor. Mutations in the TCCCCC motif located between −164 and −159 in the collagen promoter increase constitutive transcription levels by 5-6-fold. While the nature and mechanism of action of this repressor are presently unknown, our data suggest that it may work by interfering with the activity of the factors bound to the −300 and −125 sites. Interestingly, CBF seems to work independently of this repressor. These results indicate that under different physiological conditions, different combinations of available factors may dictate the expression levels of the α2(I) collagen gene. For example, the CBF-like factor may provide a pathway for bypassing the repressor activity or for finetuning the expression level. In conclusion, this report presents a detailed analysis of the cis-regulatory elements of the human α2(I) collagen promoter. Characterization of the nuclear proteins interacting with these sequences is currently under way, but much work remains to be done to fully understand the basal and cytokine-stimulated transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the collagen type I gene in human fibroblasts. The in vivo footprinting assay provides an important tool to confirm in vitro observations in living cells. We thank Tien Hsu and Edwin Smith for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2020268823,"A binding protein for the globular head domains of complement component C1q, designated gC1qR, recently described to be present on vascular and blood cells (Ghebrehiwet, B., Lim, B.-L., Peerschke, E. I. B., Willis, A. C., and Reid, K. B. M. (1994) J. Exp. Med. 179, 1809-1821 was expressed in recombinant form in bacteria to investigate its functional and structural properties. The recombinant gC1qR was found to be functional because tetramerization of the 24.3-kDa polypeptide occurred as described for the native protein, and the binding of the ligand C1q by recombinant gC1qR was indistinguishable from binding shown by gC1qR isolated from Raji cells. Recombinant gC1qR immobilized to microspheres was used to search for additional binding proteins unrelated to C1q. Surprisingly, it was found that vitronectin or complexes containing vitronectin were retained from plasma or serum, and subsequent analysis revealed the specific binding of the ternary vitronectin-thrombin-antithrombin complex to gC1qR. Because the thrombin-antithrombin complex was unable to interact with gC1qR, direct binding with vitronectin was investigated in a purified system. The heparin binding multimeric form of vitronectin but not the plasma form of vitronectin was found to bind specifically to gC1qR isolated from Raji cell membrane as well as to recombinant gC1qR. This interaction was saturable (KD∼20 nM) and inhibitable by glycosaminoglycans such as heparin but not by chondroitin sulfate. C1q and vitronectin did not compete with each other for binding to gC1qR, and both ligands seem to interact with different parts of the gC1qR because a truncated version of recombinant gC1qR lacking the N-terminal 22-amino acid portion hardly interacted with vitronectin but bound C1q as well as the intact gC1qR. These findings establish gC1qR as a novel vitronectin-binding protein that may participate in the clearance of vitronectin-containing complexes or opsonized particles or cooperate with vitronectin in the inhibition of complement-mediated cytolysis. A binding protein for the globular head domains of complement component C1q, designated gC1qR, recently described to be present on vascular and blood cells (Ghebrehiwet, B., Lim, B.-L., Peerschke, E.

These findings establish gC1qR as a novel vitronectin-binding protein that may participate in the clearance of vitronectin-containing complexes or opsonized particles or cooperate with vitronectin in the inhibition of complement-mediated cytolysis. Various receptor systems are present on vascular cells and circulating blood cells that are not only responsible for early recognition processes in humoral defense mechanisms, such as complement or blood coagulation, but also serve to eliminate “spent” molecules of these cascade systems. In particular, various types of complement receptors that belong to different classes of super gene families (1Schreiber R.D. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1984; 7: 221-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have been characterized that serve to concentrate the initiation, regulation, and control of complement activation to cell surfaces of invading particles (2Walport M.J. Lachmann P.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Deitch E.A. Mancini M.C. Arch. Surg. 1993; 128: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In particular, two types of cell surface proteins that bind to the complement subcomponent C1q have been described, and they are distinguished by their ligand recognition specificity. One type (cC1q receptor) binds to the collagenous portion of C1q (4Erdei A. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 493-499PubMed Google Scholar, 5Reid K.B.M. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1989; 84: 8-19Google Scholar), whereas the other type of C1q-binding protein (gC1qR) 1The abbreviations used are: gC1qRglobular C1q-binding proteinBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTBSTris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. interacts with the globular heads of C1q (6Ghebrehiwet B.

Reid K.B.M. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The gC1qR was initially purified from a Raji cell membrane fraction, and use was made of partial protein sequence data to clone the corresponding cDNA from a B-cell cDNA library. The cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 282 residues, as judged by the position of the first methionine, whereas the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein, isolated from Raji cells, began with residue 74 (Leu) of the prepro-protein. By using a polyclonal antibody against gC1qR, it has been shown to be present on the surface as well as in the cytosolic fraction of human neutrophils (7Eggleton P. Ghebrehiwet B. Sastry K.N.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). globular C1q-binding protein bovine serum albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. To expand our knowledge about the structural and functional properties of this C1q-binding protein, bacterial expression of recombinant forms of gC1qR was performed, and these forms were used for ligand binding assays. In addition to the expected ligand C1q, it was found that vitronectin-containing complexes, particularly present in serum, were bound by gC1qR, and the binding characteristics were established in a purified system. Together with heparin binding forms of vitronectin, gC1qR may be part of a novel mechanism that may serve as a direct inhibitor of the terminal phase of the complement cascade, but it could also act as a scavenger or opsonizing complex in the clearance/phagocytosis phase. Thus, the identification of the vitronectin-gC1qR relationship provides a novel link between the initial events and the terminal phase of the complement cascade in immune defense.

C1q was isolated from human serum according to Reid (8Reid K.B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 16-25Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Human vitronectin was isolated from plasma as described (9Preissner K.T. Wassmuth R. Müller-Berghaus G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and converted into the multimeric form by incubation for 1 h at 37°C in 6 M urea followed by dialysis (10Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ternary vitronectin-thrombin-antithrombin complex was isolated from human serum according to de Boer et al. (11de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell membranes were first prepared from a mixture of biotin surface-labeled (1 × 108) cells and unlabeled (5 × 108) Raji cells by the method described earlier (6Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The membranes were then solubilized by suspension in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8.0, containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of enzyme inhibitors (5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 1 μM pepstatin, and 10 μM chemostatin) for 1 h at 4°C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (1 h, 45,000 × g, 4°C), and the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was first precleared on a BSA affinity column followed by affinity purification using immobilized monoclonal antibody 74.5.2 (6Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). After washing, the bound gC1qR was eluted with 0.1 M glycine HCl, pH 2.5, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 50 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Fractions were analyzed by ELISA for the presence of biotinylated proteins using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and the presence of gC1qR using monoclonal antibody 60.11 (7Eggleton P. Ghebrehiwet B. Sastry K.N. Coburn J.P. Zaner K.S. Reid K.B.M. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The gC1qR-containing fractions were then pooled and concentrated. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a major band at the expected 33-kDa position, and Western blot analysis confirmed that this band was cellular gC1qR. The strategy for constructing the expression plasmids and the different steps for expressing recombinant gC1qR were carried out as described previously (6Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNAs of the full-length gC1qR and the deletion mutant were subcloned downstream to the glutathione S-transferase gene in the expression plasmid (pGex-2T; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The proteins were expressed as fusion products with the glutathione S-transferase part at the N terminus and the gC1qR portion at the C terminus. After purifying the fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose, cleavage of the fusion products was carried out by thrombin. The released gC1qR proteins were purified by a Mono-Q ion-exchange column (fast protein liquid chromatography system; Pharmacia). Two forms were obtained for further in vitro experimentation: full-length (74-282) gC1qR and deletion mutant (96-282) gC1qRΔN lacking residues 74-95. The recombinant full-length gC1qR, the deletion mutant gC1qRΔN, and the molecular size markers were dialyzed into the gel filtration running buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5) and then loaded onto a Superose-12 column that was connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The molecular size markers employed were bovine IgG (160 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.3 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). The affinity column was prepared using the Immunolink immobilization kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 ml of recombinant gC1qR solution (10 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and after the addition of 0.2 ml of cyanoborohydride (64 mg/ml), coupling was carried out for 2 h at 22°C. To block unreacted sites, 4 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.2 ml of reducing agent were reacted with the resin for 30 min. After washing with buffer containing 1 M NaCl, immobilized gC1qR was kept in 20 mM Tris and 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (TBS/Tween) for further use. Frozen human plasma was thawed at room temperature and divided into two equal parts. One part was diluted 1:2 into ice-cold equilibration buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, and 0.05% (w/v) NaN3). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to remove particulates, 100 ml of supernatant was loaded onto a 20-ml preclear column and then onto the recombinant gC1qR-agarose column, prepared as above. After extensive washing with the equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl. The column was regenerated with buffer containing 2 M NaCl. Serum was prepared after the addition of 30 mM CaCl2 to the second plasma part, which coagulated for 2 h at 22°C. The clot was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the serum was diluted 1:2 into the equilibration buffer. After additional centrifugation, 100 ml of supernatant was loaded onto the preclear column and then onto the recombinant gC1qR-agarose column. All washing and elution steps were done accordingly at 4°C. The identity of the eluted proteins was determined by N-terminal protein sequencing and Western blotting. Microtiter plates were coated with C1q, gC1qR, and human vitronectin, respectively (0-10 μg/ml) in 50 μl of coating buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate and 35 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) for 16 h at 4°C. After washing with TBS/Tween, wells were blocked with 200 μl of TBS containing 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h. The test materials (biotinylated recombinant gC1qR and gC1qRΔN, C1q, and human vitronectin or ternary complex, respectively) were diluted in TBS/Tween buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 and reacted with the wells for 2 h at 22°C followed by washing and the addition of primary antibodies or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and subsequently by reaction with alkaline phosphatase- or peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilutions, 1:1,000-1:5,000) for 1 h at 22°C. Thereafter, substrate (1 mg/ml) in developing solution was applied, and the absorbance at 414 nm was followed in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). Furthermore, heparin and chondroitin sulfate (10 μg/ml) as well as C1q (5 μg/ml) were included as competitors in binding experiments of multimeric vitronectin to immobilized gC1qR, performed under the same conditions as described. Similarly, the interaction of Raji cell membrane extract as well as gC1qR isolated from Raji cells with immobilized vitronectin was analyzed by ELISA using microtiter plate wells (MaxiSorb, Nunc, Denmark) coated with 50 μl/well of a 10 μg/ml solution of purified multimeric vitronectin or BSA, respectively, for 2 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. After blocking unreacted sites with 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS, 50-μl portions of either solubilized Raji membrane proteins, isolated gC1qR thereof, or recombinant gC1qR were incubated with the wells, and bound proteins were probed with monoclonal antibodies 60.11 and 74.5.2 (5 μg/ml in TBS) followed by reaction with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in TBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. The reaction was visualized by incubation (15-60 min) with 50 μl of a 1 mg/ml substrate solution freshly dissolved in 10% diethanolamine, pH 9.5, containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.02% NaN3, and the absorbance was measured at 414 nm using a Dynatech MR 700 ELISA plate reader. All experiments were done in duplicate or triplicate and repeated several times. For denaturing electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, samples were boiled for 3 min in nonreducing and reducing sample buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the buffer system of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After the transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose using the buffer system of Towbin et al. (13Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), the sheets were blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA followed by incubation with respective primary and secondary antibodies as mentioned above. The different stages of expression and purification of the recombinant gC1qR protein, including the binding of the glutathione S-transferase fusion product to glutathione-Sepharose, digestion of thrombin and elution, and separation on Mono-Q followed by salt gradient elution, were followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The nature of the different protein pools at each step is documented in Fig. 1. By N-terminal protein sequencing, the protein bands in lanes 7 and 8 were shown to be glutathione S-transferase and the recombinant gC1qR, respectively. On these denatured gels the recombinant protein (24.3 kDa) exhibited a lower mobility than its fusion partner, glutathione S-transferase (26 kDa). The yield of the purified protein was approximately 10 mg/liter culture medium. The amino acid sequences of the polypeptides derived from the cDNA and of the recombinant protein are given elsewhere (6Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The native protein isolated from Raji cell membrane starts with residue 74 of the putative translated sequence, whereas the recombinant protein contains 5 additional amino acid residues (Gly-Ser-Pro-Met-Ala) at the N terminus that are derived from the vector sequence. Upon gel filtration, the recombinant gC1qR as well as the gC1qRΔN (obtained under identical conditions) were discernible as single peaks at a position of apparent molecular mass of 97.2 and 88 kDa, respectively, indicating the formation of tetramers under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 2). The tetrameric structure of gC1qR was also found after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and cross-linking studies followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown).Fig. 2Gel filtration of recombinant gC1qR. Marker proteins as indicated and recombinant gC1qR as well as the deletion mutant gC1qRΔN were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose-12 column, and the position of marker proteins (cytochrome c, soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), ovalbumin, and bovine IgG) are indicated in the semi-logarithmic plot. Both forms of recombinant gC1qR elute as tetramers with physiological ionic strength buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) At physiological ionic strength, the recombinant full-length protein binds to immobilized C1q, even at the low coating concentration of 10 ng/well (Fig. 3). Binding of gC1qR and ligand was mostly mediated by ionic interactions because 250 mM NaCl reduced specific binding to 50% of control, and 90% inhibition was observed in the presence of 600 mM NaCl. At these salt concentrations, the immobilized C1q was not removed from the microtiter plate. These findings indicate that the functional features of the recombinant gC1qR correlate with the known properties of the Raji cell membrane-derived protein. To identify possible ligands for gC1qR in the circulation, serum and plasma, respectively, were passed over a gC1qR affinity column, and after extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by high salt solution and subsequently identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Different proteins, both in plasma and serum, bound to the column and were eluted with 0.5 M NaCl, indicating that ligands other than C1q also interacted with gC1qR. The yield of proteins (from 50 ml of serum or plasma) was 4.54 or 5.0 mg, respectively. Following N-terminal protein sequencing, major bands were tentatively identified as antithrombin, antithrombin-thrombin complex, and vitronectin (Table I; Fig. 4). The initial yields obtained on protein sequencing were in the range of 10-20 pM of N-terminal amino acid for each band in which a positive identification of the protein was made. The repetitive yield at each step in the sequencing was 94%, and therefore, sequences of up to 15 residues were obtained without any ambiguity. To verify this finding, Western blot analysis of plasma- and serum-derived bound fractions was performed using specific antibodies against the candidate proteins as well as against control components such as plasminogen or fibrinogen. Interestingly, thrombin-antithrombin-positive bands could only be detected in serum-derived fractions but not in the bound material derived from plasma, whereas vitronectin-positive material was recognized in both cases (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Indeed, both vitronectin typical bands in reduced samples were discernible after Western blot analysis. Although plasminogen and fibrinogen are present in plasma at concentrations comparable to or much higher than vitronectin, no positive reactivity on Western blots for these proteins was observed (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), indicating that vitronectin complexes or vitronectin alone may specifically bind to gC1qRTable I.Analysis of serum proteins that were retained on the gC1qR affinity column (labeling of protein bands according to Fig. 4)BandMolecular massProtein sequencingWestern blottingkDaa93.7Thrombin and antithrombinThrombin and antithrombinb74NDaND, not determined.Vitronectinc66.8ND aND, not determined.Vitronectind60.5VitronectinVitronectine58.2AntithrombinAntithrombinf41ND aND, not determined.Thrombing33.4ND aND, not determined.Thrombinh74ND aND, not determined.Vitronectini66.8ND aND, not determined.Vitronectina ND, not determined.

The following samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing (A) and nonreducing (B) conditions, followed by Western blotting with antibodies against prothrombin, antithrombin, and fibrinogen as indicated: serum-bound fraction (lanes 2, 7, and 12); unfractionated human serum (lanes 3, 8, and 13); plasma-bound fraction (lanes 4, 9, and 14); and unfractionated human plasma (lanes 5, 10, and 15). Molecular weight markers (in thousands) in lanes 1, 6, and 11 are indicated along the margins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Different vitronectin forms were tested for specific direct binding to gC1qR, immobilized to microtiter wells. Although plasma vitronectin exhibited hardly any interaction, the multimeric form as well as vitronectin-thrombin-antithrombin complex specifically bound to gC1qR in a saturable manner (KD∼20 nM) (Fig. 6A). Binding was completely inhibited in the presence of heparin but not chondroitin sulfate (data not shown), whereas the classical ligand C1q did not appreciably interfere with the binding of vitronectin to gC1qR (Fig. 6B). In the reverse situation, multimeric vitronectin did not interfere with binding of C1q to gC1qR (data not shown). This finding strongly argues in favor of different binding sites for C1q and multimeric vitronectin on the gC1qR molecule. To address this issue experimentally, the full-length recombinant form of gC1qR and a mutant lacking 22 amino acids from the N terminus were modified by biotinylation and compared for binding to immobilized multimeric vitronectin and C1q. Although the intact gC1qR exhibited specific binding to vitronectin, the deletion mutant hardly interacted with the adhesion protein (Fig. 6C), and these characteristics were independent of the presence of C1q. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of gC1qR is involved in the interaction. Only a moderate difference in the binding of C1q to the truncated form of gC1qR compared to the wild-type was noted. Finally, Raji cell membrane extract as well as gC1qR isolated thereof were tested for direct binding to immobilized multimeric vitronectin. In both cases appreciable specific binding of the receptor was noted, comparable in its extent to the binding of recombinant gC1qR to vitronectin performed in parallel (Fig. 7). These findings unequivocally define gC1qR as a novel binding protein for multimeric forms of vitronectin. Two cellular proteins have been shown to bind to the complement component C1q, and they are not only distinguishable by their respective molecular masses and structural characteristics but also by their ligand binding properties. The cC1q receptor recognizes multiple ligands by low-affinity interactions with their collagen-type regions; these ligands include C1q, mannan-binding protein, and conglutinin or surfactant protein A (14Malhotra R. Laursen S.B. Willis A.C. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because all these ligands can cross-compete with similar affinity for binding to the cC1q receptor (15Malhotra R. Thiel S. Reid K.B.M. Sim R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), it was renamed the “collectin” receptor and apparently serves important roles in intrinsic immunity through opsonization of pathogens and complement activation (16Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Apart from this widely expressed cell surface protein, a second C1q-binding protein, designated gC1qR, has recently been described that is expressed on circulating blood cells (7Eggleton P. Ghebrehiwet B. Sastry K.N. Coburn J.P. Zaner K.S. Reid K.B.M. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), endothelial cells, and other tissues 2B. Lim, B. Ghebrehiwet, and K. B. M. Reid, unpublished observations. and differs from the former one by high affinity recognition and its specificity for the globular heads of C1q (6Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). gC1qR is also found in soluble form in the circulation (at approximately 4 μg/ml), yet its functional role remains obscure. We were interested in searching for possible additional ligands of gC1qR, and the availability of recombinant forms allowed us to use an affinity approach. Surprisingly, we were able to unequivocally identify vitronectin and vitronectin-containing complexes as additional specific ligands, and this contention was proven by direct binding experiments in a purified system. The recombinant forms of gC1qR expressed in Escherichia coli were functional because the expressed material (including gC1qRΔN) exhibited tetramerization and was indistinguishable from the Raji cell-derived gC1qR in high affinity binding to C1q as well as effective complement inhibition (6Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cC1q receptor, immobilized gC1qR predominantly bound vitronectin-containing material from serum, but hardly any serum C1q was retained on the affinity column, suggesting that gC1qR preferentially recognizes specific forms of the adhesion protein. Analysis of bound fractions revealed that particularly heparin binding forms of vitronectin bound to gC1qR, whereas plasma vitronectin was hardly retained. This indicates that acidic regions of gC1qR may exhibit affinity for complementary basic regions such as the heparin-binding site that is only exposed in “unfolded” forms of vitronectin (17Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These forms include multimeric vitronectin (also derived from platelets; 10Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the ternary vitronectin-thrombin-antithrombin complex, the latter being the ultimate reaction product of thrombin in blood coagulation, which is significantly elevated in the circulation of patients suffering from septicemia (18de Boer H.C. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1279-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, no binding of the thrombin-antithrombin complex to gC1qR was observed, whereas thrombin as well as prothrombin presented appreciable binding. 3B. Ghebrehiwet, B. L. Lim, F. Festy, E. L. B. Peerschke, and K. B. M. Reid, submitted for publication. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the vessel wall can interact with multimeric forms of vitronectin (19Lane D.A. Flynn A.M. Pejler G. Lindahl U. Choay J. Preissner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16343-16348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and luminal heparinoids of endothelial cells have been proposed to mediate binding and uptake of the ternary complex (11de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the present findings, gC1qR expressed on vascular cells seems to share certain properties with these proteoglycans and may very well be another candidate for specific binding and clearance of heparin binding forms of vitronectin. In vitro experiments utilizing purified components substantiated critical features of the vitronectin-gC1qR interaction that support the aforementioned interpretation: only heparin-binding multimeric vitronectin or the isolated ternary complex bound to recombinant as well as Raji cell membrane-derived gC1qR in a specific manner, whereas plasma vitronectin hardly exhibited binding, reminiscent of the previous findings using the affinity approach. Moreover, heparin but not chondroitin sulfate totally blocked this interaction, indicating the involvement of the heparin-binding site of vitronectin. It was also found that C1q did not compete for binding of multimeric forms of vitronectin to gC1qR, indicating that different domains of the C1q-binding protein are able to recognize both ligands in an independent manner. This contention was corroborated by utilizing mutant forms of recombinant gC1qR, one of which lacked the N-terminal portion. This deletion mutant hardly interacted with vitronectin but was only moderately less effective compared with wild-type gC1qR in recognizing C1q. These findings strongly suggest that at least major parts of the binding site for vitronectin lie in an acidic stretch of the N-terminal region of gC1qR. Additional experimentation using domain-specific monoclonal antibodies or snythetic peptides is needed to unequivocally define these complementary binding sites. Due to the oligomeric nature of both components, it remains to be established whether their interaction is accomplished by multivalent species. As a possible consequence, multimeric vitronectin in soluble form or associated with extracellular matrix may thereby concentrate and induce clustering of gC1qR molecules, and the results in Fig. 7 as well as preliminary experiments with intact Raji cells suggest a possible role of gC1qR in adhesion to immobilized vitronectin. The issue whether gC1qR is constitutively present as cell surface receptor is still controversial (20van den Berg R.H. Faber-Krol M.C. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 21Google Scholar); however, cellular activation may result in increased surface expression of gC1qR when cells are allowed to become adherent. 4K. B. M. Reid and B. Ghebrehiwet, unpublished observations. Including gC1qR as a novel vitronectin-binding protein, at least four different types of cellular binding proteins for the adhesion factor have been described; integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 expressed on endothelial and other cells have been implicated in cell adhesion and migration on vitronectin substrata (17Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) or in the endocytosis of denatured vitronectin, respectively (22Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11492-11495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans on endothelial cells are able to mediate cell adhesion and spreading on immobilized vitronectin (18de Boer H.C. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1279-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly mediate uptake, whereas recent data indicate that glycolipid-anchored urokinase receptor serves as an additional high affinity receptor for soluble multimeric forms of vitronectin (23Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kanse S.M. Kost C. Wilhelm O.G. Andreasen P.A. Preissner K.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Because heparin-competable binding of vitronectin to proteoglycans and αvβ5 has been described (11de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Vogel B.E. Lee S.-J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), possible interference with the gC1qR interaction may be expected as well. Together, the functional properties of vitronectin as an indirect opsonin (26Preissner K.T. de Groot P.G. Sim E. Kerr M.A. The Natural Immune System: Humoral Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 281Google Scholar, 27Parker C.J. Frame R.N. Elstad M.R. Blood. 1988; 71: 86-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a participating component in apoptosis (28Savill J. Dransfield I. Hogg N. Haslett C. Nature. 1990; 343: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), and a major complement inhibitor are likely to be expressed in concert with gC1qR. The distribution pattern of vitronectin and its novel binding protein in the vascular system may very well indicate a functional linkage of gC1qR-bearing cells and vitronectin-rich extracellular matrix. Both components can thereby act in a cooperative fashion in processes of wound healing and immune defense. The skillful technical assistance of C. Kost, F. K. Fung, and T.

Chem. 1963; 238: 622-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of type III, IV, and VI collagens were performed by dissolving the native collagens at 2 mg/ml in 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 6 M guanidine, 10 mM EDTA, and 5 mg/ml 2,3-dithiothreitol, followed by a 2-h incubation at 37°C under nitrogen. Reduced collagens were carboxymethylated for 30 min at room temperature after addition of 13.4 mg of iodoacetamide dissolved in 100 μl of 0.5 M NaOH. Excess iodoacetamide was quenched with β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 1%. Samples were dialyzed against 0.5 M acetic acid and finally lyophilized. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides were produced by solubilizing 2 mg of single collagen chains in 1 ml of 70% formic acid at room temperature, flushing the tube 10 min with nitrogen, and adding 2 mg of CNBr, followed by a 4-h incubation at 37°C and by lyophilization (51Matsudaira P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Polystyrene microtiter wells were coated with native triple-helical collagens and collagen chains (at 2-4 μg/100 μl/well for binding studies and at 50 ng/200 μl/well for inhibition experiments) by incubation in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, for 2 h at 37°C, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaureate), overnight at 4°C. Coating efficiencies were calculated by addition of 5-10 ng/well of collagens that were radiolabeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method (43Schuppan D. Rühlmann T. Hahn E.G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Schuppan D. Besser M. Schwarting R. Hahn E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 241-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Schuppan D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8823-8832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) together with the respective unlabeled proteins. The resulting coating efficiencies were almost linear in the range from 50 ng to 4 μg/well and as follows for 2 μg of collagen/well: collagen type I (30%), II (21%), III (34%), IV (42%), V (43%), VI (40%), α1(I) (25%), α2(I) (37%), IIIra (reduced and alkylated, 48%), IVra (41%), and VIra (32%). All three PDGF isoforms were radiolabeled with 125I by using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (DuPont NEN). Labeled PDGF was separated from free iodine over a Sepharose G25 column (PD-10, Pharmacia LK) in PBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20. Incorporated radioactivity was 15,000-20,000 cpm/ng for PDGF AA, 25,000-30,000 cpm/ng for PDGF BB, and 10,000-12,000 cpm/ng for PDGF AB. Protein-bound radioactivity, as determined after precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 200 μg/200 μl bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4°C, was 90-98% for all three PDGF isoforms. Labeling by the chloramine-T method (IODOBEADS, Pierce) yielded an approximately 3-fold higher incorporation for PDGF AA and AB and, as expected, no significant incorporation for PDGF BB (due to the lack of tyrosine residues). Preparations were checked for purity by 20% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Radiolabeled recombinant PDGF BB (10 ng/ml) stimulated proliferation of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts 5-fold and of human foreskin fibroblasts 2-3-fold, confirming that iodination did not destroy its bioactivity (data not shown). Labeled PDGF was stored in aliquots at −20°C and could be used in binding assays for up to 4 weeks. For solid phase binding assays, labeled PDGF AA, BB, and AB at 1-2 ng/100 μl of binding buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) was added to the collagen-coated and detergent-blocked wells. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the unbound activity was removed by suction, followed by three washes with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and counting of the bound radioactivity in a γ-counter (MultiPrias, Canberra-Packard, Dreieich, Germany). For ligand blot experiments, 10 μg of CNBr-cleaved peptides from single collagen chains α1(I), α2(I), and α1(III) and type IV and VI collagens were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked with PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 overnight at 4°C, washed three times in binding buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with approximately 100 ng of 125I-labeled PDGF AA, BB, or AB diluted in 20 ml of binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with binding buffer before air drying and autoradiography. For solution binding studies, 1, 2, 10, and 20 μg of collagen (type I or VI) or BSA in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, allowing the collagens to form fibrils, followed by addition of 80,000 cpm (3-4 ng) radiolabeled PDGF BB in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and an additional 2-h incubation at room temperature. Finally the suspensions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the radioactivities of the pellets and supernatants subjected to γ-counting. These experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate. For inhibition experiments, microtiter wells were coated with 50 ng/200 μl of the various collagens. Since rapid fibril formation in neutral buffers occurred with solubilized native type I, III, V, and VI collagens as inhibitors, reproducible data could only be obtained with denatured collagen chains, which were isolated as described above. To minimize renaturation and fibril formation, which may also occur to a low extent with denatured collagen chains, probes were heated up to 100°C for 2-3 min immediately before use in experiments. Sequential dilutions of these collagen preparations in 300 μl of binding buffer were preincubated with 50 μl (1-2 ng) of labeled PDGF in detergent-blocked polypropylene tubes for 2 h at room temperature. Then 150 μl of these solutions were added to the collagen-coated wells in duplicate and incubated for an additional 2 h, followed by γ-counting of bound 125I-PDGF. Uncoated, detergent-blocked wells served as background controls. For saturation binding experiments, increasing amounts of unlabeled PDGF were mixed with a constant amount of labeled PDGF (1-2 ng, 20,000-60,000 cpm) in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated in microwells that were coated with 200-400 ng of native collagens or collagen chains for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes and counting of bound 125I-PDGF as described above. The background at high PDGF concentrations was reduced by rinsing collagen-coated and uncoated (control) wells three times with PBS (without detergent) and blocking residual unspecific binding sites with 0.5% (w/v) BSA in PBS overnight at 4°C. In order to exclude different binding affinities of radiolabeled versus unlabeled PDGF, binding experiments were also performed using the radiolabeled PDGF isoforms up to a concentration of 50 ng (approximately 750,000-1,500,000 cpm)/well. The resultant binding curves were superimposable on those obtained with 1 ng of radiolabeled PDGF and increasing amounts of unlabeled growth factor (curves not shown). In order to determine the biological activity of collagen-bound PDGF, cell culture experiments were performed with mouse 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 92.1) and human foreskin fibroblasts (passage 4-8). Polystyrene microtiter wells were coated with native triple-helical collagens or the respective collagen chains (both at 1 μg/100 μl of PBS/well) as described above, washed three times with PBS, incubated with 20 ng of PDGF BB/100 μl of PBS for 2 h at room temperature and washed again with PBS. Confluent cells were trypsinized, washed, and seeded at a density of 104 cells/100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 0.1% fetal calf serum/well. After culture for 20 h, proliferation was assessed by addition of 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine (DuPont NEN)/well for an additional 4 h. After freezing and thawing, cellular DNA was collected from the microtiter plates and immobilized onto glass fiber membranes using a cell harvester (Bibby-Dunn). [3H]Thymidine incorporated into DNA was measured by β-scintillation counting (LS 1701, Beckman) and cell numbers determined by spectrophotometric quantitation of the activity of hexosaminidase (52Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) or by counting cell numbers in each well from photographs taken from the center of the wells and representing 70% of the surface area. Cryostat sections (5 μm) of human cirrhotic livers (cirrhosis due to alcohol (n = 4) or chronic viral hepatitis (n = 3)) were fixed in acetone for 5 min at 4°C, and air-dried. Sections were preincubated with 60 ng of PDGF BB in 50 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 or in buffer alone. After three washes with PBS, PDGF was immunlocalized using either mono- or polyclonal antibodies, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (alkaline phosphatase-coupled) and the APAAP complex. The incubation and washing steps were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (DAKO). Incubations with normal rabbit or mouse IgG instead of the PDGF antibodies served as control. Binding data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Dissociation constants and the number of binding sites obtained by saturation experiments were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard (53Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17712) Google Scholar). When a constant amount (1-2 ng) of 125I-PDGF AA, BB and AB was added to native triple-helical and single-chain type I, II, III, IV, V, and VI collagens immobilized on polystyrene microtiter wells, a high specific binding (expressed as percent of added protein-bound radioactivity) was observed (Fig. 1, A-C). The relative percentage of growth factor that bound to a particular collagen was similar for all PDGF isoforms, with AA showing a slightly lower binding than BB and AB. 33-44% of added PDGF BB and AB and 29-36% of PDGF AA bound to type I, III, IV, and VI collagens and their respective chains under these conditions, whereas type II and V collagens (Fig. 1) were less efficient ligands. Unspecific binding to detergent-blocked microtiter wells ranged from 5 to 7% of added 125I-PDGF (Fig. 1). In order to visualize and to prove the identity of the collagen-bound growth factor, approximately 50 ng of radiolabeled PDGF AA, BB, and AB were incubated with type I, III, and VI collagens (coated at 2 μg/well) as described above. When bound radioactivity was eluted by hot reducing SDS gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, only bands attributable to the pure PDGF isoforms were identified (data not shown). In addition, binding of PDGF to all single collagen chains could be demonstrated by carrying out ligand blotting with radiolabeled PDGF isoforms on collagens, collagen chains, and their cyanogen bromide peptides that had been transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE. It was remarkable that although the collagen chains bound PDGF similarly well, only a subpopulation of the smaller collagen fragments was identified by ligand blotting, with protein staining demonstrating a comparable transfer of all fragments to nitrocellulose (Fig. 2). Furthermore, all cyanogen bromide peptides detected of chains α1(I), α2(I), and α1(III) except α1(I) CB 8 are derived from the carboxyl-terminal half of the chains. In order to study if PDGF could bind to collagens that had formed fibrils in vitro, radiolabeled PDGF was added to reconstituted fibrils of type I collagen. With increasing concentrations of type I collagen, up to 40% of added 125I-PDGF BB specifically coprecipitated with collagen I fibrils, whereas background absorption in the presence of increasing amounts of BSA remained constant (Fig. 3). Binding of PDGF AA and BB to native type I, II, III, IV, V, and VI collagens immobilized at 50 ng/200 μl/well could be inhibited efficiently by the respective denatured collagen chains. Furthermore, PDGF binding to a particular collagen type was blocked by the chains of type I, III, IV, and VI collagens (Fig. 4, A-D). Thus, the binding of PDGF AA and BB to immobilized native type I, III, IV, and VI collagens could always be inhibited, although to a varying degree, when different combinations of soluble collagen chains and collagenous substrates were used. As an example, soluble denatured type VI collagen at 10 μg/150 μl blocked binding of PDGF to immobilized type VI collagen by nearly 100% (Fig. 4D), whereas the soluble α2 chain of type I collagen reduced binding by only 78% (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained when the reduced and alkylated chains of type III and IV collagens were used as inhibitors (data not shown). Taken together, the experiments that were performed in a cross-inhibition design suggest: 1) consensus binding sites for PDGF isoforms on type I, III, IV, V, and VI collagens, and 2) these binding sites appear to depend largely on collagen primary structure, since single-chain collagens served as effective inhibitors of the binding of PDGF to native collagens. Binding of 125I-PDGF (approximately 1 ng/well) to collagens in the presence of increasing amounts of the unlabeled factor resulted in saturation curves such as that shown in Fig. 5 for type I collagen and the α1(I) chain. When background binding was subtracted, saturation for type I collagen immobilized at 200 ng/well (with a coating efficiency of 30%) was reached between 80 and 100 ng of added PDGF AA or BB (in a total volume of 100 μl), equivalent to 2.8-3.5 × 10−8 mol/liter and 3.6-4 × 10−8 mol/liter, respectively. Binding sites on the α1(I) chain coated at 400 ng/well (with a coating efficiency of 25%) were saturated at approximately 100 ng of PDGF AA, equivalent to 3.5 × 10−8 mol/liter (Fig. 5C). Plotting according to the method of Scatchard (Fig. 5, insets) indicated single binding sites for PDGF AA and BB on type I collagen with dissociation constants (KD) of 1.3 and 2.8 × 10−8M, respectively, and of 0.7 × 10−8M for PDGF AA on α1(I). Similar results were obtained for type III, IV, and VI collagens (data not shown). Table I summarizes the results obtained with the PDGF isoforms AA and BB on various native and single-chain collagens. The maximum amount of PDGF bound to type I collagen was estimated to be 7.0 × 10−13 mol (20 ng) for PDGF AA and 8.4 × 10−13 mol (21 ng) for PDGF BB (Fig. 5, A and B), and that of PDGF AA bound to α1(I) 1.5 × 10−13 mol (4.2 ng) (Fig. 5C). Since these numbers were obtained with approximately 60 ng of immobilized type I collagen and 100 ng of α1(I), equivalent to 2.0 × 10−13 mol of type I collagen and 1.0 × 10−12 mol of α1(I), respectively, roughly 3.5 or 4.2 mol of PDGF AA or BB bound to 1 mol of type I collagen in the assay system used, whereas binding to the α1(I) chain resulted in much lower molar ratios around 0.2. For the binding of PDGF AA and BB to native and single-chain type III, IV, and VI collagens and α2(I), similar molar ratios were obtained (Table I). Collagen-bound PDGF BB stimulated proliferation of mouse 3T3 cells by 2-3-fold when compared to cells grown on a collagen matrix alone. Fig. 6 (A and B) shows the results for PDGF BB that was immobilized on type I collagen or on the α(I) chain prior to seeding. Proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and cell numbers were determined by using the hexosaminidase method and direct cell counting. DNA synthesis was also stimulated (to a lower extent) in human foreskin fibroblasts (Fig. 6A), whereas the cell numbers of human fibroblasts plus or minus PDGF BB were the same after only 24 h of incubation (data not shown). Immunostaining (APAAP) of cryostat sections from cirrhotic livers with mono- and polyclonal antibodies to PDGF resulted in low signals that were preferentially found in sinusoidal and blood vessel walls (data not shown). However, when sections were preincubated with PDGF BB, bound growth factor was exclusively localized in the fibrous extracellular matrix of the fibrotic septa, the periportal extracellular matrix, and to a lower extent in the extracellular matrix of the perisinusoidal space (Fig. 7, A and B), whereas no staining was observed on sections that were preincubated with PDGF, followed by nonimmune primary IgG (Fig. 7, C and D). Our study demonstrates that PDGF binds to immobilized type I, II, III, IV, V, and VI collagens as well as to fibrils of type I collagens reconstituted in vitro. PDGF isoforms AA, BB, and AB interacted preferentially with type I, III, IV, and VI collagens, an interaction that was saturable and could be inhibited by soluble denatured collagen chains. In addition, cross-inhibition experiments with soluble collagen chains suggested consensus binding sites on the collagens investigated. Saturation binding studies yielded dissociation constants around 10−8M for all PDGF isoforms that compare well with a variety of other medium affinity protein-protein interactions (54Salonen E.-M. Vaheri A. Pöllänen J. Stephens R. Andreasen P. Mayer M. Dano K. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6339-6343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The collagens and the collagen chains that were used for the binding assays had been purified by ion exchange and/or molecular exclusion chromatography and were of high purity, a precondition necessary to exclude binding to other, potential contaminants. In particular, traces of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, which are known to interact with several growth factors including the long form of PDGF AA (56Raines E.W. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), could be ruled out since all collagen preparations had been preadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose under conditions that retain these acidic molecules when collagens are eluted. The long form of PDGF AA comprises 125 amino acids and contains an exon 6-encoded basic sequence, which interacts with heparin and heparan sulfate. A similar sequence is found in the COOH-terminal pro-sequence of the PDGF B-chain but not in the short form of the A-chain (56Raines E.W. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For our experiments we used the long form of recombinant PDGF AA and the recombinant “mature” PDGF BB lacking the homologous exon 6 pro-sequence. Therefore, the similar binding pattern of PDGF AA and BB to collagens underlines again that traces of contaminating heparan sulfate do not appear to be involved in the interaction. Furthermore, a 200-fold excess (w/w) of soluble heparin did not alter binding of PDGF AA and BB to the collagens (data not shown). Similarly, purity of the radiolabeled PDGF isoforms was evidenced by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A disadvantage of solid-phase assays is the potential masking or distortion of interactive domains on the collagens due to their interaction with the polystyrene, which may lead to an underestimation of binding sites. For example, the calculation of the stoichiometry of the interaction of PDGF BB with type I collagen yields 1 mol of the native triple-helical collagen binding around 3-4 mol of PDGF, whereas 1 mol of single α1(I) chain binds only around 0.2 mol of PDGF (Fig. 5). Assuming that some interactive domains might be masked, our calculated number of binding sites should be considered as a minimum. Therefore, the finding of more binding sites per chain of triple-helical collagen might be either explained by the lower degree of distortion and epitope masking after coating to polystyrene when native are compared to denatured collagens or by a more favorable spatial arrangement of the binding epitope(s) on the collagen triple helix. Binding of the PDGF isoforms to collagens was also demonstrated by the ligand blot technique and by precipitation of PDGF by collagen fibrils reconstituted in vitro, supporting the results of the polystyrene microtiter assay. Cross-inhibition experiments showed that different soluble collagen chains were able to inhibit the binding of the PDGF isoforms to coats of a given triple-helical or denatured collagen. This leads us to conclude that the collagenous binding sites for PDGF may be variations of a consensus domain. Again, the effective inhibition of the PDGF interaction with triple-helical collagens by single chains of (denatured) collagens suggests the involvement of collagen primary structure. The high degree of inhibition reached by single collagen chains may be explained by the exposure of the variable, potentially interactive amino acids of the collagens on the surface of the triple helix, while the repetitive, and possibly non-interactive, glycine residues are hidden in the triple-helical core. Since radiolabeled PDGF bound only to a subpopulation of CNBr peptides of different collagen chains after transfer to nitrocellulose, there appears to be only a limited number of collagen primary structures that interact with PDGF. Accordingly, we observed that only between one and three out of 40-50 peptide fractions derived from HPLC chromatographs of V8 and tryptic digests of single collagen chains (with an average of 15-25 amino acid residues/peptide) were inhibitors of the PDGF-collagen interaction. 2R. Somasundaram and D. Schuppan, unpublished data. Consequently, the PDGF-binding domain(s) may be a suitable target for competitive inhibitors of the PDGF interactions with the collagenous extracellular matrix. We can show further that the biological activity, determined as stimulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation, was maintained when PDGF BB was bound to collagens. In addition, the collagenous interstitial extracellular matrix of cirrhotic liver efficiently and specifically sequestered PDGF BB. Taken together, these findings point to a role of the PDGF-collagen interaction in vivo, e.g. during pathogenesis of organ fibrosis when large amounts of collagen are deposited in the extracellular matrix. However, we cannot exclude binding of PDGF to additional constituents that are associated with the fibrous extracellular matrix in the immunlabeling experiments. The finding that very little immunoreactive PDGF is detected in most normal and fibrotic tissues could be due to a rapid uptake and internalization of deposited PDGF by the high affinity PDGF receptors that display affinity constants 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the PDGF-collagen interactions. Collagens might thus only serve as a short term store that prevents rapid diffusion into the interstitial fluid or the blood stream. “Stored” PDGF may hereby perpetuate mesenchymal cell proliferation and subsequent matrix accumulation, even in the absence of significant inflammation, as observed in cases of advanced glomerulosclerosis and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (11Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 57Floege J. Burns M.W. Alpers C.E. Yoshimura A. Pritzl P. Gordon K. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 297-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Thus, previous reports of PDGF AA interacting with heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycan (40Pollock R.A. Richardson W.D. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Kelly J.L. Sanchez A. Brown G.S. Chesterman C.N. Sleigh M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and of PDGF BB and AB binding to the glycoprotein SPARC (38Raines E.W. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Ross R. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), extracellular matrix components that are expressed during tissue remodeling and in active fibrotic lesions, are complemented by our finding of an interaction of all PDGF isoforms with collagens as the predominant constituents in advanced fibrotic tissues. In conclusion, the preferential and short-lived binding of PDGF to interstitial collagens may be an important regulatory mechanism in the physiology and pathophysiology of wound healing and organ fibrosis. Since the binding of PDGF seems to be mediated and effectively inhibited by collagenous consensus sequences, further work is aimed at the use of specific inhibitory peptides for a lesion-targeted approach to modulate these conditions.

The secreted protein exhibiting HSact conversion activity was isolated by subjecting large volumes of conditioned suspension culture medium to heparin-AF Toyopearl affinity chromatography, Mono Q-FPLC, TSK SW3000-HPLC, and 3′,5′-ADP-agarose affinity chromatography. The final product was purified ∼700,000-fold relative to cellular material with a 5% overall recovery of HSact conversion activity. The isolated protein migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of Mr = 46,000 and co-migrated on nondenaturing acidic pH gel electrophoresis with HSact conversion activity. The purified component was identified as heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase because it transferred sulfate from [35S]PAPS to the 3-O-position of D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine 6-O-sulfate of HSact precursor and HSinact precursor to produce nearly equivalent amounts of labeled HSact and HSinact. The exhaustive modification of wild-type LTA cell [35S]HS with either microsomal HSact conversion activity or purified enzyme increased HSact content from 9 to ∼36%, which indicates that microsomal HSact conversion activity predominantly reflects the level of a 3-O-sulfotransferase that converts HSact precursor into HSact.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts of A3 cells showed that stimulation with ATRA and TNF-α for more than 16 h resulted in enhanced NF-κB binding compared to that induced by TNF-α alone. The simultaneous treatment with ATRA and TNF-α also resulted in changes in the composition of NF-κB complexes bound to the IL-8 NF-κB site, preventing the formation of two TNF-α-inducible binding activities.

INTRODUCTIONDNA helicases catalyze unwinding of duplex DNA to single-stranded DNA, a process energetically coupled to NTP hydrolysis. Helicases are an important class of proteins required in almost all the processes of DNA and RNA metabolism. Recently, a large number of putative helicases have been identified mainly from amino acid sequence homologies. Known helicases have homologous amino acid sequences, confined to small regions in the protein, that are used as signature motifs for identifying helicases (1Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 2Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Since a high resolution structure of a helicase is not known at the present time, the roles of these conserved motifs remain largely unclear.We are studying the mechanism of bacteriophage T7 DNA helicase, which is involved in DNA replication. Bacteriophage T7 is a model system used to study the detailed mechanisms of DNA replication because of its simplicity. A minimum of two proteins, T7 DNA polymerase and T7 DNA primase/helicase, have been shown to reconstitute duplex DNA replication in vitro. T7 gene 4 encodes the two primase/helicase proteins, 4A and 4B (3Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 303-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The full-length 63-kDa 4A protein has both helicase and primase activities, whereas the shorter 56-kDa 4B protein that begins at a second initiation codon has only helicase activity (4Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13066-13073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The helicase activity unwinds double-stranded DNA during leading strand DNA replication, and the primase catalyzes synthesis of tetraribonucleotides that serve as primers for lagging strand DNA replication (4Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).T7 DNA helicase belongs to the general class of hexameric helicases. Its low resolution structure, studied in detail using electron microscopy and image averaging, shows that both 4A′ and 4B proteins form ring-shaped hexamers, and the ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAbpbase pair(s)bovine serum albumin DEAEdiethylaminoethyldTMP-PCPβ,γ-methylene deoxythymidine triphosphateDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s). binds through the central hole of the ring (6Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This mode of DNA binding results in protection of about 25 bases of ssDNA from nuclease digestion (7Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and likely confers high processivity to DNA unwinding. The helicase forms hexamers only in the presence of nucleotide ligands such as dTDP, dTTP, ATP, and dTMP-PCP (8Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DNA binds tightly only to the hexameric species and requires the presence of dTTP or dTMP-PCP (7Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The various activities of the helicase protein such as NTP binding/hydrolysis, protein oligomerization, and DNA binding are linked (9Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that amino acids responsible for these activities also may be close in space or perhaps lie in the same motif.Regions of T7 gene 4 protein show sequence homology to several bacterial and bacteriophage primase/helicase and primase-related helicases that belong to the DnaB family of helicases. Comparison of amino acid sequences in this family of helicases has led to the identification of five conserved motifs denoted 1A, 1a, 2B, 3, and 4 (2Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Conserved motif 1A is the well known GXXGXGKT/S sequence found in numerous nucleotide-binding proteins and shown in many ATPases to be involved in binding the diphosphate or the triphosphate moiety of nucleotides (10Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). Motif 2B is most likely the conserved motif B sequence involved in binding nucleotide via Mg2+ confirmed from this study. The remaining three motifs, 1a, 3, 4 have unknown functions.Site-directed mutagenesis has been used in the past to probe the function of several of the conserved motifs. Mutations have been made in the 1A motif, GXGKS sequence. Replacement of lysine 318 in this motif with an alanine (11Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and replacement of glycine 317 with valine and lysine 318 with methionine (12Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) result in reduction of the dTTP hydrolysis activity and elimination of the helicase activity. Subsequent mutagenesis efforts focused on motif 4. H475A and D485G mutant proteins display reduced oligomerization ability particularly in the absence of nucleotide (13Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These mutants also have reduced dTTPase (lower kcat/Km), ssDNA binding, and duplex DNA unwinding activities; thus, the precise role of this motif was not clear.In the accompanying paper (14Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), random mutagenesis and genetic selection were used to obtain lethal mutants in the cloned T7 primase/helicase gene (gene 4A′). The 76 mutants selected were distributed throughout much of the protein, and most of them provided sufficient primase function for T7 growth but were defective in helicase function. Many of the mutants in the C-terminal half of the protein lie in or close to conserved helicase motifs, and the mutants should be useful for understanding the function of these motifs. In this paper, we present the biochemical characterization of nine of the mutant proteins.DISCUSSIONTo unwind duplex DNA, a helicase requires a number of subactivities, including NTP binding, NTP hydrolysis, oligomerization, DNA binding, and coordination among these various subactivities. A defect in any of these functions can lead to a defect in the unwinding activity. We have used random mutagenesis and genetic selection to obtain helicase-defective mutants of T7 primase/helicase with the goal of identifying amino acids or regions of the protein participating in these various activities. A detailed biochemical analysis of these mutants has allowed us to understand the basis for the helicase defect at the level of these various subactivities.Random mutagenesis created a number of single amino acid mutations distributed throughout the protein that produced defects in the helicase function required in vivo (14Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All of the mutants provided sufficient primase function, except those that produced shortened proteins. The biochemical properties of the nine mutant proteins analyzed in this paper are consistent with their in vivo properties; all were able to synthesize RNA primers but had severe defect in helicase activity.Relationship between Primase and Helicase ActivitiesIn bacteriophage T7, both the helicase and primase activities can be provided by the same protein (4A), and from amino acid sequence homology to primases and helicases, it appears that the N-terminal half of the protein contains all the primase motifs and the C-terminal domain the helicase motifs. The two activities are coupled to a certain extent because amino acid changes in the N-terminal domain affected the helicase activity and vice versa. The mutants in the C-terminal domain, R487C, G488D, and S496F, that had lower affinity for ssDNA showed a measurable reduction in primase activity. This suggests that motif 4, likely involved in DNA binding necessary for the helicase function, may also be important for efficient RNA primer synthesis. The zinc-binding motif (N-terminal 63 amino acids) that recognizes the primase site may not be the only DNA interacting site necessary for primase activity. Previous work (6Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) has shown that ssDNA binds through the central hole of the hexamer as shown in Fig. 8. The 3′-end of the DNA binds on the side of the hexamer containing the larger domain, which we have identified using limited proteolysis as the C-terminal domain or the helicase domain. 3M. K. Levin, M. T. Washington, P. Ahnert, and S. S. Patel, manuscript in preparation. It has been noted that a 5-base tail on the 3′ side of the primase recognition site is not sufficient for primer synthesis, and a 10-base tail on the 3′ side of the primase recognition site is required (24Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the 10-base tail on the 3′ side is bound by the DNA-binding site inside the hole of the hexamer when the zinc-binding domain binds to the primase recognition sequence (Fig. 8). This mode of DNA binding explains the lower primase activity of the mutants, since R487C, G488D, and S496F have impaired DNA binding ability. This may also partly explain the activation of DnaG primase by the DnaB helicase in E. coli and the activation of gp61 primase by the gp41 helicase in bacteriophage T4.Functional Classification of the MutantsWe have chosen nine representative mutants from both the N terminus and from the various conserved motifs of the C terminus domain for biochemical studies. Based on their defects with respect to the various subactivities, the nine 4A′ mutants have been classified into three groups (see Table III). A previously characterized mutant, K318A, is also included for discussion. Group A mutants are defective in intrinsic dTTPase activity. These mutants are confined to the C-terminal domain and lie in the various conserved helicase motifs. Group B mutants are defective in DNA binding but competent in intrinsic dTTPase activity. These mutants are also confined to the C-terminal domain. Group C mutants are defective in coupling dTTPase and helicase activity. These mutants have normal subactivities, and the mutants are not confined to the C-terminal domain but are found throughout the protein. We have not identified any mutants defective in oligomerization. Perhaps protein-protein interactions that stabilize the hexamer occur over a large surface area; hence, multiple mutations would be required to affect oligomerization to a significant level.Table III.Summary of the biochemical properties of the 4A′ mutantsMutantGroupPrimase activityPrimase processHelicase activityRNA-primed DNA synthesisdTTPase §sDNAdTTPase + ssDNAHexamer formationaAll mutants are capable of hexamer formation in the absence of ssDNA ligands.

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Triphosphate BindingThe group A mutants defective in dTTP binding/hydrolysis are found in four different helicase motifs. Mutants K318A, E348K, D424N, and S496F lie within motifs 1A, 1a, 2B, and 4, respectively. Motifs 1A and 2B are the well known Walker A and B sequences that have been shown in a number of proteins to be involved in NTP binding. Amino acids in region 1A form a P-loop that interacts with the β-γ-phosphate of NTP and Mg2+ in proteins such as Ef-Tu, F1-ATPase, and RecA (25Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 27Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Asp-424 in motif 2B is found to interact with the NTP via the Mg2+ that binds to the β-γ-phosphate of NTP (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 27Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In addition to these regions, our mutagenesis results show that part of motif 1a and motif 4 also participates in dTTP binding/hydrolysis, as mutants E348K in motif 1a and S496F in motif 4 are severely defective in their intrinsic dTTPase activity.All group A mutants bind DNA, except S496F (motif 4), which showed no DNA binding either in the presence of dTTP or dTMPPCP. The mutant S496F is different from the other mutants in that it shows a defect both in dTTPase and DNA binding. This is interesting because other mutants in motif 4 are also defective in DNA binding. Thus the amino acids in motif 4 may play a role both in DNA binding and dTTP binding/hydrolysis.DNA BindingThe group B mutants show a defect in DNA binding. Thus far, we have identified only two group B mutants, and both lie in motif 4. Mutants R487C and G488D were competent in binding and hydrolyzing dTTP, forming hexamers (as assayed by native gel), but these mutants bound DNA weakly. Results from three different assays are consistent with a DNA binding defect in these mutants. First, these mutants did not bind DNA by native gel assay. Second, weaker DNA binding was observed by a nitrocellulose-DEAE DNA binding assay. Third, although these mutants have intrinsic dTTPase activity, they did not show DNA-stimulated dTTPase activity. Since the DNA binding regions of helicases are not known, we cannot rule out the possibility that these amino acids in motif 4 may be indirectly involved in interactions with the DNA. In indirect interactions, these amino acids would play a role in the conformational changes necessary for DNA binding that ultimately lead to translocation and strand separation.We have shown that in T7 helicase, DNA binding is modulated by dTTP binding and hydrolysis (7Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 4A′ protein binds DNA with a high affinity in the presence of dTMPPCP, the analogue of dTTP. But the affinity of 4A′ for the DNA is much lower in the presence of dTDP, the product of dTTP hydrolysis. Since the state of the nucleotide bound, triphosphate or diphosphate, affects the affinity for DNA, there is probably a switch region that allows communication between the nucleotide-binding site and the DNA-binding site, similar to the switches observed in GTPases such as EF-Tu (25Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We postulate that motif 4 involved in both dTTP binding/hydrolysis and DNA binding may be part of that switch region.A previous report hypothesized that motif 4 is important for hexamer formation based on characterization of three site-directed mutants, H475A, D485G, and R487A (13Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is known that nucleotide binding, hexamer formation, and DNA binding are all linked processes. Therefore, the idea that this domain is involved in hexamer formation may be an oversimplification of the function of the residues in this motif. In addition, the role of this motif in hexamer formation is not consistent with the characterization of random mutants reported in this paper. We have shown that the R487C and G488D mutants were not defective in oligomerization. In fact R487C formed hexamers in the absence of DNA that are more stable than the wild-type 4A′. Note that the site-directed mutant R487A was reported also to have no defect in oligomerization but clearly a defect in DNA binding. It was suggested that these defects were due to improper orientation of the subunit within the hexamer (13Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, since this is the most severely affected mutant of the three site-directed ones, we prefer the explanation that the Arg-487 and Gly-488 residues play a role in DNA binding. The effect of mutating residues in this region on hexamer formation may be an indirect one because of the coupling between DNA binding and hexamer formation.Energy TransductionGroup C mutants did not show a severe defect in any of the subactivities. These mutants hydrolyzed dTTP and bound DNA and formed stable hexamers. However, none had the ability to unwind the small fork DNA. We have classified these mutants as having a defect in coupling the subactivities to helicase function. It is not uncommon in helicases that point mutations result in a defect in coupling nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA unwinding. Mutations affecting coupling have been reported recently for E. coli transcription termination factor rho (28Pereira S. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30401-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and RNA helicase eukaryotic initiation factor-4A (29Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic initiation factor-4A, the mutants defective in coupling ATPase to helicase activity are found among the A motif, B motif, and a C-terminal region (region III) conserved among DEAD box RNA helicases.The group C mutants are either intrinsically defective in DNA unwinding or have a defect in coupling the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to DNA unwinding. Because of their large number and their distribution throughout the protein in both domains, it is more likely that these mutants are defective in energy transduction brought about by a defect in conformational changes of the protein. Uncoupling of activities can occur through a variety of mechanisms. The dTTPase activity may be uncoupled from translocation activity necessary for DNA unwinding. In such a case, the proteins will hydrolyze dTTP but fail to move along the DNA, since hydrolysis fails to cause the necessary conformational changes. Alternatively, these mutants may be severely defective in processive translocation. This would lead to frequent dissociation of the protein which would impair both translocation and DNA unwinding. The two types of defects described above may be caused by improper coordination of dTTP binding and/or DNA binding within the same subunit of the hexamer, or improper coordination among the various subunits. Interestingly, all group C mutants have a characteristic ∼10-fold increase in the intrinsic dTTPase activity relative to wild-type 4A′. The increased dTTPase activity is either the consequence of or the cause for the uncoupling of activities. More detailed experiments will be required to determine the exact reason for the uncoupling and the increased dTTPase activity of this group of mutants.One peculiar property of the group C mutants is that they possessed helicase activity in the presence of the DNA polymerase, although somewhat reduced compared with the wild-type. This was surprising as these mutants were completely defective in the fork unwinding assay. Since T7 DNA polymerase can partially restore the helicase activity of these mutants suggests that the polymerase can somehow overcome the defect resulting from the mutations. Since T7 primase/helicase protein forms a specific complex with T7 DNA polymerase (30Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kolodner R. Masamune Y. LeClerc J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 566-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it must be the formation of this complex that allows restoration of some activity of the group C mutants. The mechanism by which DNA polymerase partially restores the helicase activity of these mutants is unknown. Restoration of the helicase activity of group C mutants by the polymerase is consistent with our proposal that these mutants may be defective in energy transduction, because it is easier to imagine the DNA polymerase partially restoring the ability of the helicase mutant that is defective in either translocation or processivity rather than the activity of the mutant defective in intrinsic DNA unwinding activity.The strand displacement ability of the group C mutants in the presence of the polymerase is not entirely consistent with the in vivo complementation results presented in the companion paper (14Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mutants are likely complexed with the T7 polymerase in vivo, but they still fail to provide enough helicase activity to complement the T7 helicase/primase deletion phage. There could be a difference in the in vitro and the in vivo assay conditions, especially in 4A′ concentration which was 1 μM in the in vitro assay. It is likely that under in vivo conditions, T7 DNA polymerase is unable to sufficiently restore the defect of these mutants to support T7 growth, or the mutants may be unable to function in other processes during phage growth, for example initiation of bidirectional DNA replication where helicase activity has been shown to be important in vitro (32Fuller C.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3185-3196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Possible Structure of the NTP-binding SiteNo high resolution structure of a helicase is known at the present time. An attempt has been made here to predict the location of the above mutants with respect to the NTP-binding site by secondary structure predictions of 4A′ and alignment with the known structure of RecA (33Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and F1-ATPase (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Interestingly, F1-ATPase shows a great deal of sequence homology to E. coli rho protein which is a hexameric protein that has RNA/DNA unwinding activity (34Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 816-837Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both F1-ATPase and RecA proteins are structurally related to the 4A′ protein. The F1-ATPase is a ring-shaped hexamer with six nucleotide-binding sites, and it interacts with the γ subunit of the ATPase within the central cavity of the ring, in an analogous manner to the mode of ssDNA binding to 4A′. The RecA protein forms helical filaments around ssDNA which binds in the interior cavity of the protein helix. In addition, the loops of RecA protein that interact with the DNA correspond to the loops of the F1-ATPase that contact the γ subunit (35Gardner V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol.

A consensus secondary structure was derived from five methods (38Geourjon C. Deleage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 39Gibrat J.F. Garnier J. Robson B. J.

Despite little sequence homology between the F1-ATPase and the RecA protein, both structures are very similar in their secondary structures and tertiary folds (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 33Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The secondary structural prediction of 4A′ also corresponded well to that of F1-ATPase and RecA, particularly around the Walker A and Walker B nucleotide binding motifs.Only the C-terminal hal"

We show that in post-hypoxic endothelial cells, the simple re-addition of oxygen induces a profound reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The total filamentous actin pool increases by 41% and translocation of actin filaments to the submembranous network is observed. Concurrent with the actin polymerization, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell substrates is detected on Western blots. Overexpression of superoxide dismutase using replication incompetent adenovirus inhibits the actin and tyrosine phosphorylation responses to reoxygenation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases with the isoflavone genistein also suppressed the actin polymerization response to reoxygenation, but unlike superoxide dismutase, genistein also induced the collapse of the superstructure of endothelial cells upon reoxygenation. These experiments support the concept that reoxygenation following a period of hypoxia can induce the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells. Such a response requires the intact coupling of superoxide producing pathway(s) with tyrosine kinase pathway(s).

Angiogenesis can either rescue ischemic tissues by re-establishing an appropriate blood supply, or neovascularize proliferating tissues such as developing organs and neoplastic lesions (1Folkman J.

Substantial progress has been made in the characterization of growth factors that promote or antagonize the angiogenic response (1Folkman J. N. Engl. J.

However, little is known about the molecular control of the cellular machinery (the actin cytoskeleton) that mediates the translocation of endothelial cells to ischemic areas, a process that is necessary, although not sufficient, for angiogenesis to take place. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, like most growth factor receptors, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (8de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 9Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar), whose signaling cascade is mediated by the clustering of effector molecules through the binding of SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues. We found out recently that, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, the activity of growth factor receptors is also coupled to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesAECaortic endothelial cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineSODsuperoxide dismutasem.o.i.multiplicity of infectionad-SODadenovirus SOD. such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (11Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of rat vascular smooth muscle cells with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) leads to H2O2 production. Catalase or ROS chelators block the tyrosine kinase and mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor (11Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Moreover, while ROS have been recognized in the past as mediators of intercellular interactions, we and others have recently identified ROS as major intracellular signal transduction messengers used by several small GTP-binding proteins of the p21ras family (12Knaus U.G.

Since small GTP-binding proteins like p21ras, RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 represent key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (14Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

We show that superoxide production resulting from hypoxia followed by reoxygenation induces changes in the actin cytoskeleton and tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cells. Although the changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton that we observed following hypoxia and reoxygenation remain to be linked to the migration of endothelial cells, it is tempting to speculate that these changes act in synergy with growth factor receptor activation to trigger endothelial cell migration as a necessary step for the angiogenic process. reactive oxygen species aortic endothelial cells phosphate-buffered saline superoxide dismutase multiplicity of infection adenovirus SOD.

For microscopy, cells were studied under a Zeiss microscope and representative fields were photographed using Kodak 400 ASA film. -AEC were grown in plastic flasks in EGM plus supplements: 2% fetal calf serum, bovine brain extract (12 mg liter−1), hydrocortisone (1 mg liter−1), penicillin (100 units ml−1), and streptomycin (0.1 mg ml−1) (complete growth medium) for human cells, or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus penicillin and streptomycin for bovine cells, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37° C. For hypoxia and reoxygenation, 50-90% confluent human AEC in PBS (without substrates, but with calcium and magnesium) were exposed to hypoxia in a Modular Incubator Chamber (Billups-Rotenberg), by flushing the chamber with nitrogen (99.9%) using a pressure of 2 p.s.i., for 15 min at room temperature. Next, the tubing for the chamber was clamped and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37° C in nitrogen with appropriate humidification (2 ml of water on the bottom of the chamber). In these conditions, we generated a progressive drop in pO2; upon measuring the pO2 with a Clark-style probe (Model DO-166; Lazar Research Laboratory Inc., Los Angeles, CA) installed in the chamber and placed within the fluid contained in the culture dish inside the chamber, the starting pO2 was 150 torr and dropped to a pO2 of 10 ± 5 torr (the target pO2) at the end of the 4-h hypoxia (18Zweier J.L.

Bovine AEC were plated at 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate and allowed to grow to confluence in their appropriate complete growth medium. Once 90% confluent, the cells were serum starved (1% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 48 h, then washed twice with PBS using a needle for gentle aspiration. In PBS, cells were exposed to hypoxic conditions as above. Cells were extracted at various time points following reoxygenation in 100 μl of lysis buffer (15 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 145 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaVO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM 4,2-aminoethylbenzene sulfonylfluoride, 20 μg/ml protease inhibitors: chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin) supplemented with saturating concentration of rhodamine phalloidin (0.6 μM) (17Heldman A.W.

The extracts were normalized, then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g (Beckman TL100) in polycarbonate tubes at 4° C. The pellets were carefully rinsed (but not disrupted) with lysis buffer. Then, 200 μl of methanol was added to each pellet to resolubilize the rhodamine phalloidin. The samples were vortexed for 30 s and incubated overnight prior to being transferred to individual wells of a 96-well Costar plate for quantitation of rhodamine fluorescence in a CytoFluor 2300 (Millipore). Standard curves providing rhodamine phalloidin fluorescence as a function of actin concentration were also obtained to validate the assay. Serial dilution of rabbit muscle actin were polymerized by addition of 2 mM MgCl2. After 60 min, samples were diluted (1 to 10) in lysis buffer supplemented with rhodamine phalloidin (0.6 μM), ultracentrifuged, and processed for rhodamine measurements as described for the cell extracts. Blanks corresponded to duplicate samples, but lysed in the presence of excess unlabeled phalloidin (100 μM, Sigma) and provided an estimate of the background fluorescence that was subtracted from actual data. The fluorometer settings were excitation at 530 and emission at 590 nm. A replication incompetent adenovirus (ad-SOD) carrying the cDNA for human CuZn-SOD was constructed as reported to overexpress superoxide dismutase in endothelial cells (22McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Another virus, dl312 (a generous gift from T. Shenk) (23Jonos N. Shenk T. Cell. 1979; 17: 683-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), carrying a similar genomic backbone (Ad.5 serotype, E1-deleted) but without the SOD-cDNA was used as a control. AEC were grown to confluence in Corning 96-well plates (0.5 × 105 cells/well) in complete medium. Serial dilution of ad-SOD were added in triplicate to 24 of the 96 wells, with multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) ranging from 80 to 1. The same serial dilution (m.o.i.) of the dl312 virus were tested in another 24 wells. After 4 days of infection, the wells were washed once in PBS and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and fluorescently labeled with an anti-SOD monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:50). Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was measured in CytoFluor 2300 with an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530. SOD activity in cellular extracts was measured by the inhibition of reduction of cytochrome c (24McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h of hypoxia, resulting in a progressive reduction of pO2 to 10 ± 5 torr, AEC displayed an actin superstructure that was essentially similar to that of control, non-hypoxic cells (Fig. 1). However, after 5 min of re-exposure to normoxic conditions, rapid assembly of actin filaments was observed in previously hypoxic AEC (Fig. 2). Filamentous actin content increased by an average of 41% (±12.2%, S.E., p = 0.036) over base-line level (Fig. 2). Concurrently with the polymerization reaction, redistribution of actin filaments took place, with disappearance of cell spanning actin stress fibers, thickening of the cortical actin network and extension of membrane ruffles (Fig. 1). As we have shown that reoxygenated AEC produce ROS and in particular superoxide (18Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next studied the role of superoxide in the actin response of post-hypoxic AEC.Fig. 2Actin polymerization in reoxygenated AEC. a, filamentous actin was measured in extracts from control, hypoxic (240 min, ∼10 torr), and reoxygenated cells (5 and 45 min) (solid circles). While the concentration of filamentous actin was not affected by 240 min of hypoxia, reoxygenation resulted in rapid (5 min) polymerization of actin filaments. After 45 min in normoxic conditions, the concentration of filamentous actin was no longer significantly different from base-line levels. The data were normalized to the filamentous actin content of the cells at base-line level (100%). Each data point corresponds to the mean of six experiments (± S.E.). The actin filament content was significantly increased at 5 min of reoxygenation (* indicates p = 0.036). Exposure of the cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (200 μM), led to complete suppression of the polymerization response (open circles). b, standard curve for filamentous actin. Rabbit muscle actin was polymerized, labeled with rhodamine phalloidin and processed as for the cellular extracts. On this representative data set, the relationship between F-actin and rhodamine fluorescence is linear. The x axis corresponds to actin concentration prior to dilution in lysis buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Confluent plates of AEC were infected for 24 h either with ad-SOD dismutase at an m.o.i. of 40, or with the control dl312 at the same m.o.i. Three days after infection, overexpression of CuZn-SOD was confirmed by detecting the protein in permeabilized infected AEC, using a immunofluorescence assay and by measuring enzymatic activity (Fig. 3). While in control cells infected with dl312 we detected background level of CuZn-SOD, the concentration of enzyme in AEC infected with the ad-SOD increased as a function of the m.o.i. (Fig. 3, a and b). Dismutase activity was low in control cells (dl312), but was markedly increased in extracts of ad-SOD-infected cells (4.5-fold at m.o.i. 80), proportionally to the virus over cell ratio and the SOD concentration (Fig. 3). Next, 3 days after infection of AEC with ad-SOD or dl312 (m.o.i. of 40), cells were exposed to hypoxia (240 min) and 5 min of reoxygenation, lysed, and F-actin in the extract was measured using the rhodamine phalloidin assay. While in cells infected with dl312, there was a significant increase in F-actin (25 ± 7.2%, mean ± S.E.) over base-line level, in AEC overexpressing superoxide dismutase there was no increase in F-actin content, and even a small drop in F-actin was detected (Fig. 3c). Qualitative analysis by fluorescence microscopy of reoxygenated AEC overexpressing SOD fixed at 5 min demonstrated the absence of actin filament redistribution in these cells (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Inhibition of actin response to reoxygenation in AEC treated with genistein or SOD. AEC were exposed to hypoxia (240 min, ∼10 torr), then to normoxic conditions for (a) 45 min for cells pretreated for 1 h with genistein (200 μM); or (b) 5 min for cells infected with the ad-SOD at an m.o.i. of 40. Note that in contrast with what was observed in control AEC (Fig. 1), reoxygenation of endothelial cells pretreated with genistein led to progressive collapse of the actin cytoskeleton, with absence of stress fibers and clustering of filaments into small patches. In AEC overexpressing SOD, there was no redistribution of actin filaments to the periphery associated with reoxygenation, and the actin stress fibers were present throughout hypoxia and reoxygenation. The micrographs are representative of ≥100 cells per condition. The bar is 12 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because of the known coupling between ROS production and tyrosine kinase pathways, we studied tyrosine phosphorylation in reoxygenated AEC by Western blot analysis and densitometry, and observed that there was a small but significant (p = 0.035) increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates in reoxygenated AEC compared to base-line, normoxic cells (Fig. 5). Particularly, extracts corresponding to the first few seconds of reoxygenation contained more tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates than base-line samples (2.28-fold increase). The tyrosine phosphorylation increase required superoxide production in the reoxygenated AEC. Overexpression of SOD using ad-SOD infection resulted in the inhibition of both base-line and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation in AEC could be also obtained with genistein (data not shown), an isoflavone compound which has a well established inhibitory effect on tyrosine kinases (21Furman M.I. Grigoryev D. Bray P.F. Dise K.R. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of genistein to suppress the actin response to the respiratory burst. The presence of genistein led to complete inhibition of the actin polymerization response to reoxygenation in endothelial cells (Fig. 2). However, in contrast with SOD overexpression which also suppressed the actin polymerization but had no significant effect on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton 45 min after reoxygenation (data not shown), marked alteration of the actin cytoskeleton was seen with genistein following reoxygenation (Fig. 4). We observed formation of patches of actin filaments and inhibition of ruffle formation. Upon analyzing the response of genistein-treated AEC to reoxygenation by video microscopy, we observed the collapse of the endothelial cell superstructure (data not shown), instead of the rapid recovery of a normal structure in the absence of genistein (Fig. 1). Our data support the hypothesis that following a period of hypoxia, AEC re-exposed to oxygen undergo structural changes which, perhaps, play an important role in priming endothelial cells for angiogenesis. We have shown that superoxide generation is a prerequisite for actin polymerization in hypoxic and reoxygenated AEC. At least two mechanisms could be responsible for the actin response to superoxide production. (i) Superoxide could affect endothelial cell signaling pathways (Fig. 5) which subsequently may regulate the actin cytoskeleton (11Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). (ii) Superoxide (or derived ROS) may directly affect the actin cytoskeleton (26Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), by changing the redox state of actin regulatory proteins (sequestering or capping proteins) or of actin itself, thereby inducing actin polymer formation. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, S-thiolation of actin has been shown in association with respiratory bursts (27Omann G.M. Harter J.M. Burger J.M. Hinshaw D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the sulfoxide isoform of the most abundant actin sequestering protein in mammalian cells, thymosin-β4, is unable to sequester actin monomers (28Heintz D. Reichert A. Mihelic-Rapp M. Stoeva S. Voelter W. Faulstich H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Considering the rather limited extent of the tyrosine kinase response to reoxygenation (Fig. 5), it is likely that a combination of the two mechanisms (i and ii) mediates the actin changes observed with reoxygenation. Interestingly, genistein inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation in reoxygenated cells induced the collapse of the actin superstructure, a change that goes far beyond the simple reversal of the remodeling of the cytoskeleton observed with reoxygenation (Fig. 4). No such collapse was observed upon inhibition of the tyrosine kinase response to reoxygenation in cells by overexpressing SOD. Hence, the cross-interaction between the oxidases producing superoxide and tyrosine kinases/phosphatases seems to be tightly regulated to lead to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton but preserves the integrity of the actin superstructure of endothelial cells. It is possible that the transient changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by oxidases contribute not only to the increased permeability of reoxygenated endothelial cells (29Lum H. Barr D.A. Shaffer J.R. Gordon R.J. Ezrin A.M. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but also, in concert with growth factors and their receptors, to the development of an angiogenic response. Activation of most of the small GTP binding proteins of the p21ras family, including Rac1, has been shown by us and others to generate ROS (13Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.-J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and to induce specific changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (14Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 15Ridley A.J. Hall A.

It is tempting to speculate at this point that ROS play a pivotal role in mediating the actin remodeling observed in cells activated by growth factor receptors, or by reoxygenation of previously hypoxic cells. We are in the process of testing this hypothesis using adenovirus constructs carrying either the cDNA for a dominant positive isoform (constitutively bound to GTP) or for a dominant negative isoform (constitutively bound to GDP) of Rac1 and overexpression of these isoforms in AEC."

To study the mechanism of sugar metabolite regulation on the expression of individual α-amylase genes, DNA fragments specific to each of eight rice α-amylase genes were synthesized and used as gene-specific probes. Comparison of the relative abundance of mRNA revealed that expression of the eight α-amylase genes in rice cells was differentially regulated by sucrose starvation. Accumulation of all the α-amylase mRNAs increased in response to sucrose starvation; however, levels of the αAmy3 and αAmy8 mRNAs were distinctly higher and constituted 90% of total α-amylase mRNAs. RNA gel blot and nuclear run-on transcription analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between the increased transcription rates and the elevated steady-state levels of α-amylase mRNAs induced by sucrose starvation. The half-lives of αAmy3, αAmy7, and αAmy8 were prolonged by sucrose-starvation; however, the stability of the three mRNAs seems controlled by different mechanisms. The translation inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin preferentially blocked the sucrose-suppressed expression of αAmy3 but not that of αAmy7 and αAmy8. These inhibitors also enhanced the sucrose starvation-induced accumulation of αAmy3 mRNA but not that of αAmy7 or αAmy8 mRNAs. Cycloheximide did not significantly alter the transcription rates of α-amylase genes, suggesting that labile proteins may selectively stabilize the αAmy7 and αAmy8 mRNAs but destabilize the αAmy3 mRNA.

Carbon catabolite repression is a fundamental and ubiquitous regulatory system in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (1Entian K.-D. Barnett J.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3McGrane M.M. Yun J.S.

In bacteria and yeast, catabolite-regulated gene expression is an essential mechanism for adjusting to changes in nutrient availability (5Carlson M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4873-4877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schuster J.R. Barr P.J. Brike A.J. Valenzuela P. Yeast Genetic Engineering. Butterworths, London1989: 83Google Scholar, 7Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants have revealed many of the components involved in the response to carbon catabolite repression, but it is still unclear how all of these components interact to regulate transcription (2Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Trumbly R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In higher plants, carbon metabolite regulation of gene expression provides a mechanism for maintaining an economical balance between supply (source) and demand (sink) for carbohydrate allocation and utilization within and among various organs and tissues (9Sheen J. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Expression of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism often is feedback-regulated by the sugar metabolites (9Sheen J. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For example, expression of seven maize photosynthetic genes in mesophyll protoplasts is repressed by sucrose and the mechanism involves transcriptional control (10Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of hexose sugars by hexokinase has been proposed to act as a key signal transmitter in initiating sugar repression responses of photosynthetic genes (11Jang J.-C. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and of malate synthase and isocitrate lyase genes involved in the glyoxylate cycle (12Graham I.A. Denby K.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). α-Amylases are major amylolytic enzymes for hydrolysis of stored starch in the endosperm during germination of cereal grains. In germinating cereal grains, gibberellic acid stimulates and abscisic acid represses α-amylase gene expression (reviewed in 13Jacobsen J.V. Chandler P.M. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones and Their Role in Plant Growth and Development. Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1987: 164Crossref Google Scholar). We have previously reported that expression of α-amylase genes in rice is under two different modes of tissue-specific regulation; the genes are activated by hormones in the aleurone of germinating seed and suppressed by sugars in cultured suspension cells (14Yu S.-M. Kuo Y.-H. Sheu G. Sheu Y.-J. Liu L.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21131-21137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yu S.-M. Tzou W.-S. Lo W.-S. Kuo Y.-H. Lee H.-T. Wu R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Later, expression of one α-amylase gene in the embryo of germinating rice seed was also reported to be suppressed by sugars (16Karrer E.E. Rodriguez R.L. Plant J. 1992; 2: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that sugars that accumulate in the embryo and endosperm during germination act as signals and osmotica to regulate the expression of α-amylase genes and the metabolic activities in germinating rice seeds (17Yu S.-M. Lee Y.-C. Fang S.-C. Chan M.-T. Hwa S.-F. Liu L.-F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of metabolite regulation of α-amylase gene expression in plants, we have used the cultured rice suspension cells as a model system. Previous work shows that, in cultured rice suspension cells, α-amylase expression, carbohydrate metabolism, and vacuolar autophagy are coordinately regulated by sucrose levels in the medium (18Chen M.-H. Liu L.-F. Chen Y.-R. Wu H.-K. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 6: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Both the transcription rate and mRNA stability of α-amylase genes in cells increase in response to sucrose depletion in the culture medium (19Sheu J.-J Jan S.-P. Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Use of transgenic rice carrying an α-amylase gene promoter/β-glucuronidase gene proved that the regulation of α-amylase gene expression by sugars involves a transcriptional control mechanism (20Chan M.-T. Chang H.-H. Ho S.-L. Tong W.-F. Yu S.-M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Chan M.-T. Chao Y.-C. Yu S.-M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our previous study on metabolite regulation involved measurement at the total α-amylase mRNA level rather than dealing with the individual mRNA encoding different α-amylase isozymes. To further study the mechanism(s) of metabolite regulation in detail, it is necessary to identify the individual α-amylase genes whose expression is regulated by sugars. This report demonstrates that the expression of various α-amylase genes in rice suspension cells is regulated in a coordinated way by sucrose present in the medium, but in a distinctly different manner according to the specific α-amylase genes. Both transcription rate and mRNA stability contribute to the regulation of the transcript level of the individual α-amylase gene. Suspension cell cultures of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Tainan 5) were propagated as described previously (14Yu S.-M. Kuo Y.-H. Sheu G. Sheu Y.-J. Liu L.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21131-21137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The paired 5′ and 3′ gene-specific primers derived from the regions surrounding the stop codons and the 3′-untranslated regions of various α-amylase genes (Fig. 1) were used for PCR. PCR was carried out in a 50-μl solution containing 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mM KCl, 2.75 mM MgCl2, 10% Me2SO, 0.4 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), 150 pmol of each primer, 0.5 μg of rice genomic DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Cycling was controlled by a programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research) programmed with conditions described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch R.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The annealing temperatures were 40°C for RAmy3A, 42°C for αAmy3, αAmy6, αAmy7, αAmy8, and αAmy10, and 45°C for RAmy1B and RAmy2A. The amplified DNA fragments were 91 bp for αAmy10, 124 bp for RAmy2A, 132 bp for αAmy7, 184 bp for αAmy6, 220 bp for RAmy3B, 221 bp for RAmy3A, 264 bp for αAmy8, and 288 bp for αAmy3. These DNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. One gram of rice suspension cells was ground in liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle and placed in a 2-ml Eppendorf tube. The ground tissue was suspended in 1 ml of urea extraction buffer (containing 7 M urea, 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, and 1% sarkosine) and extracted with 1 ml of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min. The aqueous phase was mixed with 200 μl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1 ml of isopropanol. DNA was spooled out, placed in 70% ethanol, and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 s. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% and 100% ethanol and air-dried. The genomic DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and stored at 4°C. Ten micrograms of genomic DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes and fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA gel blot analysis was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch R.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the α-amylase gene-specific DNAs as probes. The α-amylase gene-specific DNA fragments used as probes were excised from the plasmid vectors by appropriate restriction enzymes and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the random primer method (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled single-stranded cDNA probe was prepared from total cellular RNA using an oligo(dT) primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was denatured with 0.4 N NaOH at room temperature for 30 min, and neutralized with a 9-fold volume of 6 × SSC (containing 0.1% DNA agarose gel loading dye). The denatured DNA was blotted onto the Magna nylon membrane (MSI) using a suction slot-blotter (Life Technologies, Inc.) and hybridized with the cDNA probe. Hybridization was performed as described for DNA gel blot analysis (25Sambrook J. Fritsch R.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from rice suspension cells by the method of Verwoerd et al. (27Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). RNA gel blot analysis was performed as described by Chao et al. (28Chao Y.-C. Wood H.A. Chang C.Y. Lee H.-J. Shen W.-C. Lee H.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.4-kb αAmy8-C and Act1 cDNA inserts used as probes were excised from the plasmid vectors by restriction enzyme EcoRI and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Because the nucleotide sequence identity among the coding regions of rice α-amylase genes ranges between 75 and 95% 2J.-J. Sheu, T.-S. Yu, W.-F. Tong, and S.-M. Yu, unpublished data. and the coding regions of rice actin genes are highly conserved (23McElroy D. Rothenberg M. Wu R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the αAmy8-C and Act1 cDNA containing coding region probably hybridize to the mRNAs of all α-amylase and actin genes. The α-amylase gene-specific DNA probes were prepared by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method. In each experiment the hybridized α-amylase DNA probe on the Magna nylon membrane was stripped off by incubating twice (30 min each) in washing solution containing 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 90°C. The same membrane was rehybridized with different α-amylase gene-specific DNA probes or the actin cDNA probe. Nuclei were isolated from rice suspension cells as described by Watson and Thompson (29Watson J.C. Thompson W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 57-75Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on transcription analysis was performed as described previously (19Sheu J.-J Jan S.-P. Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rice α-amylase isozymes are encoded by nine genes (30Thomas B.R. Rodriguez R.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nomenclature and accession numbers of the rice α-amylase genes in GenBank™ are shown in Table I. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of α-amylase genes shows low identity except between RAmy3B and RAmy3C (Fig. 1). There is also some similarity between the 3′-UTRs of αAmy7(Ramy1A) and αAmy10(RAmy1C); however, several gaps are distributed between their homologous regions. Primers locating at the 5′ and 3′ regions in the 3′-UTR of each of the eight α-amylase genes were designed (Fig. 1) so that amplification of DNA fragments flanked by the paired primers would yield gene-specific DNA fragments. Replicated gel blots of genomic DNA digested with various restriction enzymes were hybridized with the 32P-labeled α-amylase gene-specific probes. Each probe hybridized specifically to the α-amylase gene from which it was derived (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the eight gene-specific probes were able to detect the individual α-amylase genes. To demonstrate over what range these probes can discriminate the mRNA of one gene from another, eight pieces of parallel prepared membranes containing three dilution series of each gene-specific DNA were hybridized with the individual probes. The result shows that only RAmy1B and RAmy1C probes slightly cross-hybridized with some of the other α-amylase gene-specific DNAs (Fig. 2B). No cross-hybridization was detected among the rest of the probes.Table I.Nomenclature of the rice α-amylase genesName of geneAccession no.RAmy1AαAmy7X16509RAmy1B−a− indicates that the gene has no synonym.M59350RAmy1CαAmy10M81143RAmy2A−M74177RAmy3A−X56336RAmy3BαAmy6X56337RAmy3C−X56338RAmy3DαAmy3M59351RAmy3EαAmy8M59352a − indicates that the gene has no synonym. Open table in a new tab The steady-state levels of α-amylase mRNA in rice suspension cells before and after sucrose starvation were examined by RNA gel blot analysis. Amount of rRNA was used as RNA amount loading control in the RNA gel blot analysis, although previously we have shown that the total transcription rate in cells provided with sucrose was twice that in cells starved for sucrose (19Sheu J.-J Jan S.-P. Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Accumulation of α-amylase mRNAs was very low or undetectable in cells provided with sucrose (Fig. 3, lane 2). In contrast, in sucrose-starved cells, accumulation of the α-amylase mRNAs increased (Fig. 3, lane 1). The magnitude of increase in mRNA concentrations varied with α-amylase genes and was particularly dramatic for αAmy3 and αAmy8. To compare the relative abundance of mRNA of the eight α-amylase genes, an excess of rice rRNA gene, actin cDNA, and α-amylase gene-specific DNAs was spotted onto a membrane and hybridized with the 32P-labeled, single-stranded cDNA probe transcribed from the total mRNA of sucrose-starved cells. The relative mRNA levels, corresponding to different genes in a given population of RNA, were then compared. The cDNA of the rRNA was also synthesized, probably due to the presence of the repeated short stretch of the poly(A) sequence in the rRNA (31Takaiwa G. Oono K. Sugiura M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5441-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Takaiwa G. Oono K. Iida Y. Sugiura M. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 37: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In sucrose-starved cells, the amounts of αAmy3 and αAmy8 mRNAs were distinctly higher than those of other α-amylase genes (Fig. 4). The αAmy3 mRNA was the most abundant (Fig. 4, slot 9), with αAmy8 mRNA the next most abundant (Fig. 4, slot 10). Together the results shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 suggest that the α-amylase genes are subject to differential metabolic regulation at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level. To define the mechanism that differentially regulates the expression of α-amylase genes, we compared the transcription rates of individual α-amylase genes. The nuclear run-on transcription analyses were performed with nuclei isolated from cells grown in the absence or presence of sucrose. In cells provided with sucrose, the transcription rates of all the α-amylase genes were undetectable (Fig. 5, upper panel). In contrast, in cells starved for sucrose for 12 h, the transcription rates of all the α-amylase genes increased, with αAmy3 the highest (Fig. 5, upper panel, slot 7) and αAmy8 the next highest (Fig. 5, upper panel, slot 8). In cells starved for 24 h (Fig. 5, lower panel), the transcription rates of all the tested genes decreased significantly; however, the transcription rates of αAmy3 and αAmy8 were still distinctly higher than that of the other α-amylase genes. Comparison of Fig. 4, Fig. 5 reveals that there is a positive correlation between the transcription rates and the steady-state levels of α-amylase mRNAs in cells starved for sucrose. To examine the effect of sucrose starvation on the half-life of individual α-amylase mRNA, degradation of the αAmy3, αAmy7, and αAmy8 mRNAs in vivo was monitored by RNA gel blot analysis following the inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D. Addition of 10 μg ml−1 actinomycin D to the medium has been shown previously to inhibit total RNA transcription by more than 95% over a 12-h time course (19Sheu J.-J Jan S.-P. Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The levels of individual α-amylase mRNAs were low in cells grown in the sucrose-containing medium (Fig. 6A, lane 1) and increased significantly after cells had been shifted to sucrose-free medium for 24, 36, and 45 h (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4). The levels of individual α-amylase mRNAs that accumulated after cells have been starved for 24 h and then pretreated with actinomycin D in the absence of sucrose for 12 h (Fig. 6A, lane 5 or lane 13) decreased slowly during the subsequent 9-h incubation in the medium still lacking sucrose but containing actinomycin D (Fig. 6A, lanes 14-19). In contrast, the levels of α-amylase mRNA decreased with time during the 9-h incubation in the medium containing both sucrose and actinomycin D (Fig. 6A, lanes 6-12). The level of actin mRNA was high in cells grown in the presence of sucrose (Fig. 6A, lane 1), but was low in the absence of sucrose (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4). In the medium containing actinomycin D, the levels of actin mRNA remained low regardless of the presence (Fig. 6A, lanes 5-12) or absence (Fig. 6A, lanes 13-19) of sucrose. The result of actin gene expression suggests that transcription of total mRNA was almost completely inhibited by actinomycin D; otherwise, accumulation of actin mRNA would increase in medium containing both sucrose and actinomycin D. The amounts of mRNA shown in Fig. 6A were quantified, and Fig. 6B shows the log plots of the α-amylase mRNA levels as a function of time. The half-life of mRNA was calculated from the slope of the line in the log plot of the data. The relative half-lives of αAmy3 and αAmy8, which were 82 and 98 min, respectively, in cells provided with sucrose, increased to 6 h in cells starved for sucrose (Fig. 6B). Both the half-lives of αAmy3 and αAmy8 mRNAs were substantially shorter than that of αAmy7 mRNA, regardless of the presence or absence of sucrose in the medium. The relative half-life of αAmy7 was almost 5 h in cells provided with sucrose and increased to 23 h in cells starved for sucrose. These results suggest that the α-amylase mRNAs are more stable in cells starved for sucrose. To examine whether the increase in mRNA levels of various α-amylase genes requires a prior synthesis of other gene products, cells were treated with translation inhibitors and accumulation of mRNA was monitored with RNA gel blot analysis. Levels of α-amylase mRNAs were very low or almost undetectable in cells provided with sucrose (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2), but increased greatly in cells starved for sucrose for 2 days (Fig. 7A, lanes 8 and 9). Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translocase (33Galling G. Encycl. Plant Physiol. New Ser. B. 1982; 14: 663-677Google Scholar), with concentrations ranging from 20 to 300 μM inhibited total protein synthesis by 90-98%. Cycloheximide inhibited the accumulation of αAmy7 and αAmy8 mRNAs regardless of the presence (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-7) or absence (Fig. 7A, lanes 10-14) of sucrose. In contrast, cycloheximide did not inhibit but instead effectively enhanced the accumulation of αAmy3 mRNA. In the absence of sucrose, cycloheximide significantly increased the level of αAmy3 mRNA independent of its dosage (Fig. 7A, lanes 10-14). In the presence of sucrose, cycloheximide increased the level of αAmy3 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-7). Accumulation of actin mRNA was high in the presence of sucrose (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2) and became low in the absence of sucrose (Fig. 7A, lanes 8 and 9). Cycloheximide also inhibited the accumulation of actin mRNA either in the presence (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-7) or absence (Fig. 7A, lanes 10-14) of sucrose but to a lesser extent as compared with the αAmy7 and αAmy8 mRNAs. Anisomycin, an inhibitor of transpeptidase (33Galling G. Encycl. Plant Physiol. New Ser. B. 1982; 14: 663-677Google Scholar), with concentration of 300 μM only 50% effective in inhibiting total protein synthesis, but the trends are exactly in the same direction as what was found when cycloheximide was used. Anisomycin promoted αAmy3 mRNA accumulation but suppressed αAmy7 and αAmy8 mRNA accumulation under both plus and minus sucrose conditions (Fig. 7B). Anisomycin also suppressed the actin mRNA accumulation under both plus and minus sucrose conditions. The suppression of αAmy8 mRNA accumulation in sucrose-starved cells by anisomycin (Fig. 7B, lane 4) was not as complete as that by cycloheximide (Fig. 7A, lanes 10-14), probably due to the less efficient inhibition of protein synthesis by anisomycin under our experimental condition. The availability of gene-specific probes corresponding to each of the eight α-amylase genes has enabled us to examine the abundance of mRNA encoding specific α-amylase isozymes. Although expression of the eight α-amylase genes increased in response to sucrose starvation (Fig. 3), levels of αAmy3 and αAmy8 mRNAs were significantly higher than those of other α-amylase genes and constituted approximately 90% of total α-amylase mRNA in cells starved for sucrose (Fig. 4). Therefore, expression of the α-amylase genes is coordinately up-regulated but in a distinct manner by sucrose starvation. A positive correlation between the transcription rates and the steady-state mRNA levels suggests that the transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the differential expression of α-amylase genes. Alteration in transcriptional activity suggests a model in which sugar-regulated transcription factors interact with cis-acting elements in the α-amylase gene promoters. Regions upstream from the TATA box of αAmy3 (RAmy3D) (22Huang N. Chandler J. Thomas B.R. Koizumi N. Rodriguez R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and αAmy8 (21Chan M.-T. Chao Y.-C. Yu S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17635-17641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) share conserved sequences (34Huang N. Koizumi N. Reinl S. Rodriguez R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7007-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and possess the elements necessary for sugar repression. However, none of these sequence elements has been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of rice α-amylase gene expression. Metabolic regulation of α-amylase gene expression by glucose has also been reported in other eukaryotes such as Drosophila melanogaster and Aspergillus oryzae. No significant sequence similarity is found between the Aspergillus (35Tsuchiya K. Tada S. Gomi K. Kitamoto K. Kumagai C. Tamura G. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the Drosophila (36Magoulas C. Bally-Cuif L. Loverre-Chyurlia A. Benkel B. Hickey D. Genetics. 1993; 134: 507-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) α-amylase gene promoters. However, some conserved sequences are found between the promoter region of either the Drosophila or the Aspergillus α-amylase gene with that of αAmy3. Under conditions in which transcription was inhibited, the half-lives of α-amylase mRNAs were longer in cells starved for sucrose than in cells provided with sucrose (Fig. 6), suggesting that increased mRNA stability contributed to an increase in α-amylase mRNA level in sucrose-starved cells. The αAmy7 mRNA seems inherently more stable because its half-life was 3-4 times longer than those of the αAmy3 and αAmy8 mRNAs, regardless of whether or not the cells were sucrose-starved. Compared with the αAmy7 mRNA, the αAmy3 and αAmy8 mRNAs were transcribed more rapidly in cells in response to sucrose starvation (Fig. 5) and were degraded more rapidly (Fig. 6) if cells were provided with sucrose. These results suggest that expression of αAmy3 and αAmy8 is under a stricter regulation and may encode isozymes essential for responses to changes of carbohydrate availability. It is unclear what mechanism directs the α-amylase mRNA to be degraded faster in cells provided with sucrose than in cells starved for sucrose. Regulated mRNA turnover has been described in detail in several vertebrate system (37Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), but the common regulatory mechanisms for mRNA turnover have not been found. Little is known about the processes responsible for the alteration of mRNA stability in plants, although mRNA stability can be affected by environmental conditions such as temperature (38Belanger F.C. Brodl M.R. Ho T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1354-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Brodl M.R. Ho T.-H.D. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and illumination levels (40Shirley B.W. Meagher R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Thompson D.M. Meagher R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3621-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sucrose-induced acceleration of α-amylase mRNA degradation indicates that the trans-acting factor(s) of the mRNA decay system is likely subject to regulation. This may be α-amylase transcript-specific, since transcripts of the three α-amylase genes are affected similarly but the actin transcripts are not affected (Fig. 6). The differential stabilities among α-amylase transcripts, on the other hand, may be promoted by transcript-specific sequence elements and/or secondary structures. Many unstable transcripts in mammalian cells contain sequences within their 3′-UTRs that are AU-rich and contain one or more copies of the motif AUUUA (42Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Unlike unstable mammalian transcripts, the 3′-UTRs of α-amylase mRNAs are not particularly AU-rich and do not contain multiple AUUUA sequences (Fig. 1). However, short AU-rich sequences are found throughout the 3′-UTRs of the α-amylase genes. Interestingly, although the α-amylase mRNA seems to be generally stabilized by starvation of cells (Fig. 6), the mechanism controlling the stability of different α-amylase mRNAs varied. Both the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin enhanced the accumulation of αAmy3 mRNA regardless of whether or not the cells were provided with sucrose (Fig. 7). Such an effect of translation inhibitors was specific to αAmy3 mRNA, as the accumulation of αAmy7 and αAmy8 mRNA was suppressed by the inhibitors, even in cells starved for sucrose. Nuclear run-on transcription analyses demonstrated that cycloheximide did not significantly alter the transcription rates of αAmy3, αAmy7, and αAmy8 regardless of whether or not the cells were provided with sucrose (data not shown). Together, the results suggest that labile proteins are involved in the destabilization of αAmy3 mRNA and the stabilization of αAmy7 and αAmy8 mRNAs. In conclusion, the differential response of α-amylase genes to sugars provides a potential mechanism for altering the pattern of enzyme accumulation in response to changing carbohydrate status and sugar import. Although transcription of the α-amylase genes is induced by sucrose starvation, the dramatic increase in their steady-state mRNA levels requires stabilization of the mRNA as well. The combined processes may lead to more rapid and more marked shifts in the expression of α-amylase genes. Both processes may share similar upstream signaling pathways and contribute differently and in gene-specific manners to the regulation of the pool size of transcripts of individual α-amylase genes.

It has become increasingly evident that the CS proteoglycans of cartilage are dynamic components that play several key roles in the normal physiology of cartilage tissues and regulate the biological processes such as cell migration and recognition, extracellular matrix deposition, and morphogenesis (for reviews, see 1Poole A.R.

The structural complexity of CS chains arises from an extensive series of modifications of a non-sulfated precursor with the structure (−4GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-)n. These modifications are achieved by specific modifying enzymes such as sulfotransferases and epimerases that mature the CS chains. Thus, the controlled expression of these biosynthetic enzymes is thought to be regulating factors in the elaboration of various CS isoforms. The CS chains from the cartilages of various animal species also have highly variable sulfation profiles, incorporating both oversulfated and non-sulfated structures, and they have been roughly classified into types A, B, C, D, E, and K (4Meyer K.

Preliminary chemical analyses have indicated that unlike the CS from many other cartilages, CSK isolated from that of the king crab seems to contain 3-O-sulfated GlcA residues (7Seno N. Murakami K. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 190-194Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 3-O-sulfated GlcA was later found in sea cucumber CS as well (8Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This novel structure forms a unique carbohydrate epitope on glycoproteins and glycolipids in nervous tissues, which is recognized by the HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (9Chou D.K.H. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C. Quarles R.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11717-11725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots of the CS proteoglycans of the brain as well as a number of nervous tissue glycoproteins are intensely stained by the HNK-1 antibody (10Gowda D.C. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4468-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have been conducting systematic structural studies of oversulfated CS from the cartilages of various animal species, including shark and squid (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Sugahara K. Takemura Y. Sugiura M. Kohno Y. Yoshida K. Takeda K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A.

In this study, four tetrasaccharides and a pentasaccharide from the CSK of king crab cartilage were isolated after hyaluronidase digestion. The analysis by enzymatic degradation and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy unambiguously demonstrated 3-O-sulfated GlcA residues in these oligosaccharides. Furthermore, an unexpected degradation of these oligosaccharides by the enzymatic action of chondroitinase ABC was revealed. Preliminary results have been reported in abstract form (14Sugahara, K., Tanaka, Y., Yamada, S., Kitagawa, H., Seno, N., (1994) Abstract of International Symposium on Cartilage Metabolism, Nov. 16-18, 1994, Osaka, pp. 12-13, Abstr. 16A-2.Google Scholar). CSK peptide preparation was purified from king crab cartilage as reported (15Seno N. Yamashiro S. Anno K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 343: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Six unsaturated standard CS disaccharides, chondroitinases ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) and AC-II (EC 4.2.2.5), chondro-4-O-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9, abbreviated as CS-4-sulfatase), and chondro-6-O-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.10, abbreviated as CS-6-sulfatase) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Sheep testicular hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35) was obtained from Sigma. Bio-Gel P-10 and Sephadex G-25 (fine) were obtained from Bio-Rad and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., respectively. The CSK peptide preparation (20 mg) was digested with 2 mg (approximately 3000 NFU) of sheep testicular hyaluronidase in a total volume of 2.0 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 150 mM NaCl (1 NFU corresponds to the amount of the enzyme that hydrolyzes 74 μg of hyaluronate/min) (16Poh C.H. Yuen R. Chung M.C.M. Khoo H.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 101B: 159-163Google Scholar, 17Sugahara K. Yamada S. Sugiura M. Takeda K. Yuen R. Khoo H.E. Poh C.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Digestion proceeded at 37°C for 18 h, after which an additional 1 mg (1500 NFU) of the enzyme was added and the incubation was continued for 7 h to complete the digestion. Thereafter, the digest was mixed with 0.42 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The precipitate was washed with 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The combined supernatant obtained from trichloroacetic acid precipitation was extracted with ether, the aqueous phase was neutralized with 1 M Na2CO3, and the sample was then applied to a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.6 × 95 cm) using 1 M NaCl, 10% ethanol as the eluent. Eluates were monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm, which is attributable mainly to the N-acetyl group of GalNAc. Tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharide fractions were pooled (Fig. 2), concentrated, desalted through a column (1.5 × 46 cm) of Sephadex G-25 (fine), and lyophilized. The smallest size fraction, which was presumed to contain tetrasaccharides, was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described for unsaturated CS tetrasaccharides (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The eluates were monitored by absorbance at 210 nm. Each peak was purified by rechromatography under the same conditions as the first step and desalted as described above. Each peak was quantified by the carbazole method, using GlcA as a standard (18Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5192) Google Scholar). The homogeneity of each fraction was judged by capillary electrophoresis (19Sugahara K. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as well as by HPLC. A new fused silica capillary (60 cm total length, 75 μm internal diameter; Millipore Corp.) was activated by sequential washes with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, distilled water, and 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0, before use. The electrophoretic fractions were detected by absorption at 185 nm. Samples (1 nmol/10 μl), prepared in distilled water, were injected using hydrostatic pressure to give a total injected volume of 24 nl. The electrophoresis was performed using constant voltage of 15 kV for a period of 20 min. The polarity of the power supply was negative. Oligosaccharides (2 nmol as GlcA) were digested using 5 mIU each of chondroitinases ABC or AC-II, or 50 mIU of CS-6-sulfatase as described (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CS-4-sulfatase digestion proceeded under either standard or harsh incubation conditions; the former or the latter used 20 or 50 mIU of the enzyme for 10 or 60 min, respectively, basically as described (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC as reported (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Eluates were monitored by absorption at both 210 and 232 nm. The sugar and sulfate compositions of oligosaccharides were determined by FAB-MS. FAB mass spectra of the oligosaccharide samples were obtained using a VG Analytical ZAB-2SE 2FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 20-25 kV. Data were acquired and processed using the VG Analytical Opus software. Monothioglycerol was used as the matrix. 1H NMR spectra of the oligosaccharides were measured on a Varian-500 at a probe temperature of 15, 26, 40, or 60°C as reported (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate, but were actually measured indirectly, relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in 2H2O (20Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides for NMR analysis were repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization. The oligosaccharide fractions 3, 4, or 5 (0.5 nmol each) were first digested using 5 mIU of chondroitinase ABC as described (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and evaporated to dryness. The digests were derivatized with 2-AB according to the manufacturer's instructions (Signal™ labeling kit, Oxford GlycoSystems). The labeled disaccharides were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan). The HPLC was performed in an LC-10AS system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear gradient from 16 to 798 mM NaH2PO4 over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. Samples prepared as described above were diluted to contain 50 pmol of disaccharides in 200 μl of 16 mM NaH2PO4. Eluates were monitored using an RF-535 fluorometric detector (Shimadzu Co.) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. The CSK peptide preparation (7.1 nmol as GlcA) was digested using 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC as described (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min, and half of the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC as reported (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Eluates were monitored by absorption at both 210 and 232 nm. The CSK peptide preparation purified from king crab cartilage was digested with sheep testicular hyaluronidase, as CSK was largely resistant to the enzymatic action of chondroitinases ABC and AC. As shown in Fig. 1, it was readily digested by hyaluronidase and was more susceptible than the other CS isoforms. The digest was fractionated by gel filtration on a column of Bio-Gel P-10. Three peaks were observed when monitored by absorbance at 210 nm caused primarily by N-acetyl groups and they were assigned as tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharide fractions as indicated in Fig. 2. The amounts of these fractions obtained from 20 mg of CSK were approximately 4.9, 13, and 1.7 mg, respectively. The elution profile was significantly different from that reported for a commercial CSD preparation (13Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in that there were no fragments larger than octasaccharides among the CSK degradation products. The large peak at around fraction number 80 was attributable to the buffer salts. The tetrasaccharide fraction was subfractionated into Fractions 1-5 by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. As shown in Fig. 3, Fractions 1 and 2 were eluted at the positions of authentic saturated tetrasaccharides with two and three sulfate groups, respectively, whereas Fractions 3-5 were eluted at higher salt concentrations. They were further purified by rechromatography to apparent homogeneity, as judged by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (data not shown), after which their structures were analyzed as described below. The amounts of the purified oligosaccharides in Fractions 1-5 from 20 mg of CSK are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3Subfractionation of the tetrasaccharide fraction by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. The tetrasaccharide fraction obtained by size fractionation (Fig. 2) was chromatographed on an amine-bound silica column using a linear salt gradient, as indicated by the dashed lines. Also indicated by arrows are the elution positions of the authentic sulfated tetrasaccharides with the common core saccharide structure GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc, prepared by hyaluronidase digestion of shark cartilage CSD (13Sugahara K.

Open table in a new tab FAB-MS analyses of the underivatized oligosaccharide samples in the negative-ion mode defined their molecular weights, from which the composition and the maximum number of O-sulfate groups present in each fraction were inferred, as in the case of heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides (19Sugahara K.

In the negative ion mode FAB spectrum, alkali-metal-attached molecular ions of the type [M − (x+1)H + xNa]− (M represents the fully protonated acid forms of oligosaccharides) were preferentially observed. The assignments of the molecular ion signals afforded by each of the analyzed fractions are listed in Table I. The molecular ion signal clusters at m/z 935, 957, 979, and 1001 afforded by Fraction 1 corresponded respectively to [M − H]−, [M + Na − 2H]−, [M + 2Na − 3H]−, and [M + 3Na − 4H]− of a disulfated saturated tetrasaccharide HexA2HexNAc2(OSO3H)2 (data not shown). Fractions 2 and 3 afforded similar FAB-MS data, suggesting that they are isomers of identical composition. The samples yielded molecular ion signals at m/z 1015, 1037, 1059, and 1081, corresponding to [M − H]−, [M + Na − 2H]−, [M + 2Na − 3H]−, and [M + 3Na − 4H]−, respectively, of a trisulfated saturated tetrasaccharide HexA2HexNAc2(OSO3H)3 (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, Fraction 4 afforded molecular ion signals at m/z 1095, 1117, 1139, and 1161, corresponding to [M − H]−, [M + Na − 2H]−, [M + 2Na − 3H]−, and [M + 3Na − 4H]−, respectively, of a tetrasulfated saturated tetrasaccharide HexA2HexNAc2(OSO3H)4. Fraction 5 afforded molecular ion signals at m/z 1271, 1293, 1315, 1337, and 1359, corresponding to [M − H]−, [M + Na − 2H]−, [M + 2Na − 3H]−, [M + 3Na − 4H]−, and [M + 4Na − 5H]−, respectively, of a tetrasulfated saturated pentasaccharide HexA3HexNAc2(OSO3H)4 (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 3, Fraction 1 was eluted upon HPLC at the position of the authentic disulfated tetrasaccharide GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S), where 4S denotes 4-O-sulfate (Fraction 2 derived from shark cartilage CSD in 13Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The disaccharide analysis of this fraction, which was carried out by exhaustive chondroitinase AC-II digestion followed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column, gave rise to a major peak at the elution position of ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4S) (ΔDi-4S) and a minor one at the position of the saturated disaccharide GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S) (Di-4S) slightly ahead of ΔDi-4S when monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm (data not shown). Only the major peak absorbed at 232 nm. The data are summarized in Table II with those obtained from the other fractions. Thus, the major and the minor peaks detected by absorbance at 210 nm were judged to be due to an unsaturated and a saturated disaccharide derived from the reducing and non-reducing side of the parent tetrasaccharide, respectively, as discussed (13Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the compound in Fraction 1 was concluded to be a tetrasaccharide with the structure GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S)Table II.Enzymatic analysis in conjunction with HPLC of five isolated oligosaccharidesFractionChondroitinasesChondroitinase digestion productsSensitivity to CS-4-sulfataseaUnder the standard incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) a sulfate group on the reducing GalNAc(4S) is preferentially removed.Proposed structuresbThe proposed structures were consistent with the m/z values determined by FAB/MS (see Table I).Saturated disaccharidesUnsaturated disaccharides1AC-IIDi-4SΔDi-4Sn.d.cn.d., not determined.U-G(4S)-U-G(4S)dG, U, and 4S stand for GalNAc, GlcA and 4-O-sulfate, respectively, and S represents a sulfate group at an unidentified position.ABCDi-4SΔDi-4S2AC-IIDisulfated disaccharideΔDi-4Sn.d.U(S)-G(4S)-U-G(4S)ABCDisulfated disaccharideΔDi-4S3AC-II−e−, not occurring because the oligosacharide is resistant to chondroitinase AC-II.−+U-G(4S)-U(S)-G(4S)ABCDi-4SNDfND, not detected.4AC-II−−+{disulfated (U-G)}-U(S)-G(4S)ABCDisulfated disaccharideND5AC-II−−+gDigested only when incubated under harsh incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”).{disulfated (U-G))}-U(S)-G(4S)-UABCMono- and disulfated disaccharidesNDa Under the standard incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) a sulfate group on the reducing GalNAc(4S) is preferentially removed.b The proposed structures were consistent with the m/z values determined by FAB/MS (see Table I).c n.d., not determined.d G, U, and 4S stand for GalNAc, GlcA and 4-O-sulfate, respectively, and S represents a sulfate group at an unidentified position.e −, not occurring because the oligosacharide is resistant to chondroitinase AC-II.f ND, not detected.g Digested only when incubated under harsh incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab When digested with chondroitinase AC-II or ABC, Fraction 2 yielded major and minor peaks at the elution positions of ΔDi-4S and between ΔHexA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(6S) (ΔDi-diSD) and ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) (ΔDi-diSE), respectively (Fig. 5A). The successive digestion of Fraction 2 with chondroitinase AC-II and CS-4-sulfatase yielded a major peak at the elution position of ΔDi-0S and a minor one shortly before the position of ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(6S) (ΔDi-6S) (data not shown). These results summarized in Table II indicated that the compound in Fraction 2 is a trisulfated tetrasaccharide composed of a Di-4S unit on the reducing side and an unidentified disulfated disaccharide unit with GalNAc(4S) on the non-reducing side, namely GlcA(S)β1-3GalNAc(4S)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S), where S represents a sulfate group at an unidentified position. Since Fraction 3 was resistant to chondroitinase AC-II, it was digested with chondroitinase ABC and the products were analyzed in the above HPLC system. HPLC analysis of the chondroitinase ABC digest gave rise to a single peak at the position of authentic Di-4S, slightly ahead of ΔDi-4S when monitored by absorbance at 210 nm (Table II). No peak was detected when monitored by the absorbance at 232 nm. The peak of Fraction 3 shifted on HPLC by 10 min upon CS-4-sulfatase digestion under the standard and harsh incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) (data not shown), indicating that it contained at least one sulfate group on C-4 of a GalNAc residue. Fraction 3 was resistant to CS-6-sulfatase. This enzyme specifically attacks GalNAc(6S) at the reducing end of unsaturated CS oligosaccharides (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Sugahara K. Takemura Y. Sugiura M. Kohno Y. Yoshida K. Takeda K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also showed that the enzyme digested saturated CS tetra- and hexasaccharides as well. 2Nadanaka, S., and Sugahara, K., Glycobiology, in press. In contrast, CS-4-sulfatase preferentially removes a sulfate group from GalNAc(4S) at the reducing terminus of CS oligosaccharides under the standard incubation conditions but also releases sulfate groups from internal GalNAc(4S) residues under harsh conditions (11Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The susceptibility to CS-4-sulfatase and the insusceptibility to CS-6-sulfatase suggested that the reducing GalNAc is monosulfated only at its C-4 position, and that the third sulfate group is probably on the internal GlcA residue, since the tetrasaccharide was resistant to chondroitinase AC-II (7Seno N. Murakami K. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 190-194Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the compound in Fraction 3 was assumed to be a trisulfated tetrasaccharide composed of a Di-4S unit on the non-reducing side and an unidentified disulfated disaccharide unit including the structure GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S) on the reducing side, possibly GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S)β1-4GlcA(S) β1-3GalNAc(4S). Since Fraction 4 was also resistant to chondroitinase AC-II, we digested it with chondroitinase ABC followed by HPLC analysis as described above. The digest gave rise to a single HPLC peak at a position between ΔDi-diSD and ΔDi-diSE when monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm (Fig. 5B). There was no peak when monitored by the absorbance at 232 nm (Fig. 5C and Table II). One sulfate group was lost upon CS-4-sulfatase digestion of Fraction 4 under the standard and harsh incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) as judged by HPLC (data not shown). These results and those from FAB-MS (Table I) indicated that the compound in Fraction 4 is a tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide composed of an unidentified disulfated disaccharide unit on the non-reducing side and an unidentified disulfated disaccharide unit including the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4S) structure on the reducing side; i.e. {disulfated (GlcAβ1- 3GalNAc)}β1-4GlcA(S)β1-3GalNAc(4S). Since Fraction 5 was also resistant to chondroitinase AC-II, we digested it with chondroitinase ABC and analyzed the products by HPLC as described above. Chondroitinase ABC digestion resulted in two discrete peaks, one at the position of authentic Di-4S and the other between ΔDi-diSD and ΔDi-diSE when monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm (Table II). No peak was detected unexpectedly at 232 nm (data not shown). One sulfate group of the parent compound in Fraction 5 was lost upon CS-4-sulfatase digestion under the harsh incubation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) as judged by HPLC (data not shown). These results together with those from FAB-MS indicate that the compound in F"

Recently, we purified a myosin I heavy chain kinase (MIHCK) from Dictyostelium based on its ability to activate the Dictyostelium myosin ID isozyme (Lee, S.-F., and Côté, G. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11776-11782). The complete sequence of the Dictyostelium MIHCK has now been determined, revealing a protein of 98 kDa that is composed of an amino-terminal domain rich in proline, glutamine, and serine, a putative Cdc42/Rac binding motif, and a carboxyl-terminal kinase catalytic domain. MIHCK shares significant sequence identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste20p kinase and the mammalian p21-activated kinase. Gel overlay assays and affinity chromatography experiments showed that MIHCK interacted with GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thiotriphosphate))-labeled Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA. In the presence of GTPγS-Rac1 MIHCK autophosphorylation increased from 1 to 9 mol of phosphate/mol, and the rate of Dictyostelium myosin ID phosphorylation was stimulated 10-fold. MIHCK may therefore provide a direct link between Cdc42/Rac signaling pathways and motile processes driven by myosin I molecules.

In the presence of GTPγS-Rac1 MIHCK autophosphorylation increased from 1 to 9 mol of phosphate/mol, and the rate of Dictyostelium myosin ID phosphorylation was stimulated 10-fold. MIHCK may therefore provide a direct link between Cdc42/Rac signaling pathways and motile processes driven by myosin I molecules."

The anchor is linked to the carboxyl terminus via an amide bond with ethanolamine. This linkage is formed by the transfer of a synthesized GPI anchor precursor to protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following the cleavage of a carboxyl-terminal GPI signal sequence. Synthesis of the GPI anchor precursor, in which at least six reaction steps are involved, proceeds in the ER by the sequential addition of each component to phosphatidylinositol (PI).

They have been characterized biochemically and grouped into complementation classes.The first reaction step is the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to PI to form the first intermediate GlcNAc-PI. GlcNAc-PI is thought to face the cytoplasm because those associated with intact microsomes prepared from murine thymoma cells and trypanosomes are sensitive to PI-specific phospholipase C acting from outside (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells belonging to three complementation classes (A, C, and H) cannot synthesize the first intermediate, indicating that at least three genes are involved in this step (5Hyman R.

The genes were termed PIG-A and GPI-H (or PIG-H) for phosphatidylinositol glycan class A and class H, respectively. A gene for class C, PIG-C, has not been cloned. The PIG-A cDNA consists of 4568 base pairs and encodes a predicted protein of 484 amino acids (12Miyata T. Takeda J. Iida Y. Yamada N. Inoue N. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Kitani T. Kinoshita T. Science. 1993; 259: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). There is a hydrophobic segment near the carboxyl terminus that may be a transmembrane domain. The carboxyl-terminal portion of about 40 residues is hydrophilic. There is no amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence. A region spanning amino acids 304-395 has homology to the bacterial GlcNAc transferase, RfaK, which is involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides, suggesting that PIG-A protein has a catalytic site for the transfer of GlcNAc (14Kawagoe K. Takeda J. Endo Y. Kinoshita T. Genomics. 1994; 23: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The PIG-H cDNA contains 1394 base pairs and encodes a predicted protein of 188 amino acids (13Kamitani T. Chang H.-M. Rollins C. Waneck G.L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20733-20736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence. There is a hydrophobic region in the middle of the molecule, but whether or not it is a transmembrane domain remains unclear. No homology has been found to known DNA and protein sequences in the data bases.There are also three complementation groups of yeast mutants in the first step: gpi1, gpi2, and gpi3 (7Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their genes have been cloned (15Leidich S.D. Kostova Z. Latek R.R. Costello L.C.

Acta. 1995; 1243: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is homologous to mammalian PIG-A (17Schonbachler M. Horvath A. Fassler J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Neither GPI1 nor GPI2 is homologous to PIG-H (15Leidich S.D. Kostova Z. Latek R.R. Costello L.C. Drapp D.A. Gray W. Fassler J.S. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and there is no structural homologue of PIG-H in the entire genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. If GPI1 or GPI2 is homologous to PIG-C, then either four genes, GPI1, GPI2, GPI3, and PIG-H functional homologue in yeast, as well as PIG-A, PIG-H, PIG-C, and the GPI1 or GPI2 homologue in mammals, are involved in this step or different combinations of three genes are involved in yeast and mammals.The nucleotide sequences of PIG-H, GPI1, and GPI2 have not provided clues as to their functions, nevertheless, their gene products may form a protein complex with the presumably catalytic PIG-A/GPI3 gene product. In this study we demonstrated that PIG-A and PIG-H form a complex with a cytoplasmic orientation in the ER. This orientation is in agreement with the notion that the first step of GPI anchor synthesis occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane.DISCUSSIONIn this study we showed that the products of two genes, PIG-A and PIG-H, which participate in the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis, are ER membrane proteins that together form a protein complex. This suggests that these proteins are involved in an enzyme complex that mediates the transfer of GlcNAc to PI.We determined the subcellular localization and orientation of PIG-A and PIG-H using GST as a tag and anti-GST antibody as a probe based on the observation that both PIG-A and PIG-H tagged by GST at either termini were functional (Fig. 1). PIG-A was an ER transmembrane protein consisting of a large amino-terminal domain of about 400 residues that resides on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, a transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus, and a small carboxyl-terminal domain within the ER lumen (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). A hydropathy profile of PIG-A indicated that there is no hydrophobic amino-terminal signal sequence for translocation through the ER membrane, that there is a hydrophobic region of 27 residues near the carboxyl terminus, and that the 42 carboxyl-terminal residues are hydrophilic. These characteristics are consistent with the orientation determined by the proteinase K protection assay. The overall domain organization of PIG-A is shared by many transmembrane proteins that have large cytoplasmic domains, such as cytochrome b5 and msALDH (21Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).PIG-H was also localized to the ER (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Both its amino and carboxyl termini were on the cytoplasmic side of the ER (Fig. 7). Consistent with this, there is no hydrophobic amino-terminal signal sequence, nor is there a typical hydrophobic segment for a transmembrane domain in the PIG-H sequence. Therefore, most of PIG-H would be on the cytoplasmic side of the ER. Data base search did not reveal any significant homology between PIG-H and known sequences (13Kamitani T. Chang H.-M. Rollins C. Waneck G.L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20733-20736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so we have no information regarding the function of PIG-H.The large amino-terminal domain of PIG-A is, as a whole, homologous to RfaK, a bacterial GlcNAc transferase of 381 amino acids (16.9% amino acid identity) (16Vossen J.H. Ram A.F.J. Klis F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In particular, the region spanning amino acids 304-395 of PIG-A has higher similarity to the stretch between amino acids 280 and 372 of RfaK (27% amino acid identity), which characterizes a family of glycosyltransferases that includes a number of bacterial, yeast, and plant proteins, such as RfaG, RfaB, KdtA, sucrose synthases, and glycogen synthases (14Kawagoe K. Takeda J. Endo Y. Kinoshita T. Genomics. 1994; 23: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the large cytoplasmic domain of PIG-A is a catalytic domain of a GlcNAc transferase that mediates the first reaction.The small lumenal domain of PIG-A was also important for function. The most carboxyl-terminal 19 residues were not essential, whereas the proximal 23 residues that are conserved in mouse and human PIG-A (14Kawagoe K. Takeda J. Endo Y. Kinoshita T. Genomics. 1994; 23: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were (Fig. 8). The non-functional mutant M2 that lacked the entire lumenal domain was found in membrane fractions at a lower density than those in wild-type PIG-A (Fig. 9). It was located in the smooth ER by electron microscopy (Fig. 10). Therefore, these 23 lumenal residues play a role in targeting and/or the retention of PIG-A to the proper membrane compartment, the rough ER.PIG-A appeared to form a protein complex with PIG-H (Fig. 11). In preliminary studies, the GST-PIG-A-containing protein complex that was partially purified with glutathione-Sepharose showed the activity to transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to PI.2 This suggests that the first reaction step is mediated by an enzyme complex. The complex was dependent on weak interactions because it was detected in the digitonin extract but not in the Nonidet P-40 extract (Fig. 11). It is not clear whether PIG-H is associated directly with PIG-A or whether they are the only components of the complex, because at least one more gene, PIG-C, is involved in the same step. PIG-C must be cloned to clarify these points. Since genetic data suggest that products of the yeast GPI1 and GPI2 genes interact (15Leidich S.D. Kostova Z. Latek R.R. Costello L.C. Drapp D.A. Gray W. Fassler J.S. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and hence a protein complex also participates in yeasts, identification and characterization of mammalian homologues of GPI1 and GPI2 would also be important.The results with the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were consistent with data obtained from analyzing of somatic mutations of PIG-A in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (26Bessler M. Mason P.J. Hillmen P. Miyata T. Yamada N. Takeda J. Luzzatto L. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Ostendorf T. Nischan C. Schubert J. Grussenmeyer T. Scholz C. Zielinska-Skowronek M. Schmidt R.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired genetic disorder of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis (2Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mono- or oligoclonal mutant cells bearing somatic mutation in PIG-A appear in multiple hematopoietic, but not in non-hematopoietic lineages (2Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Takeda J. Miyata T. Kawagoe K. Iida Y. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takahashi M. Kitani T. Kinoshita T. Cell. 1993; 73: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Many GPI-anchored proteins are not expressed on the surface of those mutant cells. In particular, deficient expression of GPI-anchored complement regulatory proteins on erythrocytes renders them very sensitive to complement, leading to intravascular hemolysis. About 80 somatic mutations in PIG-A determined to date are widely distributed in the coding regions and splice sites (2Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rosse W.F. Ware R.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas most coding region mutations reside within the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, two are within the lumenal domain. One is substitution of the AT dinucleotide with C in codon 450, causing a frameshift and a premature stop codon at position 455 (26Bessler M. Mason P.J. Hillmen P. Miyata T. Yamada N. Takeda J. Luzzatto L. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The other is a deletion of G in codon 459 that changes the latter sequence due to a frameshift (27Ostendorf T. Nischan C. Schubert J. Grussenmeyer T. Scholz C. Zielinska-Skowronek M. Schmidt R.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations would result in mutant proteins of PIG-A resembling M3 mutant protein and hence would cause mislocation of the PIG-A proteins, resulting in a GPI anchor deficiency.The orientation of PIG-A indicates that the transmembrane and lumenal domains of PIG-A must translocate across the ER membrane. Whether it occurs posttranslationally or cotranslationally is not known. However, it seems that the transmembrane domain acts as an efficient signal for membrane translocation because GST, which is a 27-kDa cytoplasmic protein by itself, was translocated into the ER lumen when it was connected to the carboxyl terminus of PIG-A (Fig. 7).This study provided evidence that the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis is mediated by a protein complex containing PIG-A and PIG-H that is localized in the ER. At present it is not clear why the transfer of GlcNAc to PI is mediated by a protein complex. The cytoplasmic orientation of PIG-H and of a large putative catalytic domain of PIG-A is consistent with a report that GlcNAc-PI faces the cytoplasm (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); together, they indicate that the first reaction occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the ER.Note Added in ProofWe recently demonstrated that human PIG-C is homologous to yeast GPI2.

https://openalex.org/W1983534416,"Structures of secreted forms of the human type I and II class A macrophage scavenger receptors were studied using biochemical and biophysical methods. Proteolytic analysis was used to determine the intramolecular disulfide bonds in the type I-specific scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain: Cys2-Cys7, Cys3-Cys8, and Cys5-Cys6. This pattern is likely to be shared by the highly homologous domains in the many other members of the SRCR domain superfamily. Electron microscopy using rotary shadowing and negative staining showed that the type I and II receptors are extended molecules whose contour lengths are ∼440 Å. They comprised two adjacent fibrous segments, an α-helical coiled-coil (∼230 Å, including a contribution from the N-terminal spacer domain) and a collagenous triple helix (∼210 Å). The type I molecules also contained a C-terminal globular structure (∼58 × 76 Å) composed of three SRCR domains. The fibrous domains were joined by an extremely flexible hinge. The angle between these domains varied from 0 to 180° and depended on the conditions of sample preparation. Unexpectedly, at physiologic pH, the prevalent angle seen using rotary shadowing was 0°, resulting in a structure that is significantly more compact than previously suggested. The apparent juxtaposition of the fibrous domains at neutral pH provides a framework for future structure-function studies of these unusual multiligand receptors. Structures of secreted forms of the human type I and II class A macrophage scavenger receptors were studied using biochemical and biophysical methods.

This is specific for the outer membrane and uncorrelated with the respiratory control ratio. This could result in a 7-fold difference between the concentration of ADP in the intermembrane space and that in the external environment (at 5 μM ADP). In both cases the permeability declines by a factor of 5, but NADH is more potent: KD = 86 μM for NADH versus 580 μM for NADPH. The lower apparent affinity for NADPH is partly explained by Mg2+-NADPH being the active species, and under our conditions only 30% of the NADPH is in this form. The corrected KD is 184 μM. Free NADH has the same charge as the Mg2+-NADPH complex, and thus both likely bind to the same site. The ability of NADH and NADPH to induce the closure of reconstituted VDAC channels is consistent with VDAC being the main pathway for metabolite flow across the outer membrane. Oncotic pressure, effective at inducing VDAC closure, also decreases the outer membrane permeability.

A growing body of evidence implicates the mitochondrial outer membrane in regulating mitochondrial function (8Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar; 4Benz R. Wojtczak L. Bosch W. Brdiczka D.

The outer membrane has been shown to limit the rate of metabolite flux under a variety of conditions (13Gellerich F.N. Bohnensack R. Kunz W. Azzi A. Naecz K.A. Naecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Anion Carriers of Mitochondrial Membranes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989: 349Crossref Google Scholar; 21Liu M.Y. Colombini M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; 20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADH, well known as a carrier of reducing equivalents within the cell, had been shown to be capable of reducing the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane to ADP by a factor of 6 (20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is well known that NADH exists mainly as the oxidized form, NAD+, in the cytosol (37Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), and this form is ineffective in controlling the permeability of the outer membrane (20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, its relative, NADPH, exists mainly as the reduced form (33Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest to determine the relative role of NADH and NADPH in regulating the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The roles of NADH and NADPH in the cytosol are quite different. The glycolysis of one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of ATP and two of NADH. The reducing equivalents in NADH are transferred to the mitochondrial inner membrane or matrix either by dehydrogenases on the outer surface of the inner membrane (plants and fungi; 26Palmer J.M. Møller I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 258-261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 22Møller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1986; 37: 309-334Crossref Google Scholar)) or via transhydrogenases and transport shuttles. These are fed into the electron transport chain for ATP synthesis. Thus NADH levels should reflect the relative rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Although NADPH is an analogs of NADH, it plays a different role. Mainly produced by the pentose phosphate pathway, cytosolic NADPH is consumed by the cellular synthetic systems. NADPH provides reducing equivalents for fatty acid synthesis. Because mitochondria are involved in both energy transduction and fatty acid metabolism, the relative effects of these reduced pyridine dinucleotides on the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane should provide insight on the role of this regulatory process. VDAC channels are believed to be the major pathway for the transport of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Many reports show that agents capable of closing VDAC channels also greatly reduce the permeability of the outer membrane (14Gellerich F.N. Wagner M. Kapischke M. Wicker U. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1142: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; 4Benz R. Wojtczak L. Bosch W. Brdiczka D.

This is also true for NADH (20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of NADPH to influence the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane should correlate with its ability to influence VDAC closure. This paper will examine the action of NADPH on both isolated mitochondria and VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes. Intact mitochondria from potato tubers were isolated as described previously (30Schwitzguebel J.P. Siegenthaler P.A. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 670-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygen consumption of the mitochondria (∼50-100 μg/ml protein) was measured in a 3-ml stirred cell containing respiration buffer at 24°C (0.3 M mannitol, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM KCl (pH 7.2)) by using a Clark oxygen electrode (Yellow Spring Instrument Co.). The mitochondria were pretreated with 0.1 mM EGTA for 10 or 5 min to block NADH or NADPH dehydrogenases, respectively. 5 mM succinate was used as the substrate for respiration. ADP was added to trigger state 3. Four state 3-state 4 respiration cycles were generated by four consecutive ADP (90 μM) additions. NADH was added between the first and second doses of ADP. NADPH was added just before the first dose of ADP. For the dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1The abbreviations used are: PEGpolyethylene glycolEBTeriochrome black TMOPS3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid. experiments, the mitochondria (final protein concentration, 50-100 μg/ml) were added directly in the respiration buffer containing dextran T-40 (Mr 40,000) or PEG (Mr 20,000). The P/O ratio was estimated from the ADP-dependent oxygen consumption. The oxygen concentration in the air-saturated medium was taken as 250 μM. polyethylene glycol eriochrome black T 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid. The intactness of the mitochondrial outer membrane was quantitated by measuring cytochrome c-dependent oxygen consumption (10Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-412Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Exogenously added reduced cytochrome c must pass through the outer membrane to be oxidized by cytochrome c oxidase. The percentage of intactness of the mitochondrial outer membrane was taken as 100 times 1 minus the ratio of KCN-sensitive cytochrome c-dependent oxygen consumption of untreated and osmotically shocked mitochondria (30 μl of mitochondrial suspension to 1.5 ml water for 3 min followed by addition of 1.5 ml of 2 × respiration buffer). Mitochondrial protein concentrations between 25 and 50 μg/ml were used. Mitochondrial intactness in all preparations ranged from 95 to 100%. VDAC was purified essentially as described previously (11Freitag H. Benz R. Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; 5Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The addition of 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to isolation buffers improved channel activity. 1 ml of isolated mitochondria (5 mg protein/ml) was incubated with 9 ml of hypotonic solution (1 mM KCl and 1 mM Hepes, pH 7.0) for 10 min on ice and then spun in a microfuge 30 min at 4°C. The pelleted membranes were dispersed in 0.7 ml of buffer A (15% dimethyl sulfoxide, 2.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0), shaken for 30 min, and then recentrifuged. The remaining steps were performed in a cold room (4°C). The supernatant was applied to a dry column containing 0.6 g of a mixture of 50% celite and 50% hydroxyapatite in Pasteur pipettes plugged with glass wool. The column was eluted with buffer A, and the first 0.7 ml of eluate, containing the VDAC protein, was collected. Mitochondrial protein was measured using the BCA method (Pierce) following addition of Triton X-100 (1% (w/v) final concentration). Bovine serum albumin was the standard. The oxidation of exogenous NAD(P)H was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm at room temperature (2Arron G.P. Edwards G.E. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 591-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eriochrome black T (EBT), a metallochromic indicator extensively used in metal chelation studies (16Harvey A.E. Komarmy J.M. Wyatt G.M. Anal. Chem. 1953; 25: 498-500Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), binds metals weakly and in doing so changes its absorption spectrum. EBT is blue between pH 7 and 11 (3Bell C.F. Atkins P.W. Holker J.S.E. Holliday A.K. Principles and Applications of Metal Chelation. Clarendon Press, Oxford1977: 86-90Google Scholar). The formation of the magnesium complex of EBT is accompanied by a spectral change (38Young A. Sweet T.S. Anal. Chem. 1955; 27: 418-420Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We used this to determine its dissociation constant for Mg2+ under our experimental conditions by measuring the absorbance as a function of [Mg2+] and fitting to the following equation: Mg2+fAbs−Absmin=1Absmax−Absmin∗Mg2+f+KDEAbsmax−Absmin(Eq. 1) where [Mg2+]f is the free magnesium, KDE is the dissociation constant of EBT for magnesium, and Abs, Absmax, and Absmin are the absorbance, the maximum absorbance, and the minimum absorbance at 528 nm, respectively, in the absence of Mg2+. The [Mg2+]f is equal to total magnesium in the absence of NAD(P)H because the total EBT concentration was 50 μM and thus negligible. Any Mg2+ bound to NAD(P)H would reduce [Mg2+]f and thus alter the absorbance of EBT by decreasing the [EBT - Mg2+]. Thus EBT reports [Mg2+]f, which can be substituted into the following equation to determine the binding constant of NAD(P)H for Mg2+: [NAD(P)H]T[Mg]T−[Mg]f−1=KDN∗1[Mg]f(Eq. 2) where [NAD(P)H]T is the total NAD(P)H concentration, [Mg2+]T is the total magnesium concentration, and KDN is the dissociation constant of NAD(P)H to magnesium The absorbance of EBT was measured as a function of total Mg2+ added to the medium in the presence of 20 mM NAD(P)H. The free Mg2+ was determined from Equation 1 for each level of total Mg2+. These values were inserted into Equation 2 and plotted as the equation of a straight line with the slope equal to the dissociation constant. The use of eriochrome black T was found to be complex. It was plagued by solubility problems and indications of slow reduction by NADPH. The following procedure was found to be adequate to estimate the binding constants. EBT was freshly prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in double distilled water and then diluted and supplemented with KCl and MOPS to prepare the working solution (100 μM EBT, 100 mM KCl, and 30 mM MOPS at final concentration, pH 7.2). Various concentrations of Mg2+ were prepared in the same buffer without dye. The color change of EBT upon addition of Mg2+ is time-dependent. However, a reasonably stable level was reached by 6 min. Thus, all experiments were started by mixing 0.5 ml of the EBT solution with 0.5 ml of a Mg2+ solution followed by a 6-min incubation prior to taking the absorption spectrum of the solution between 750 and 400 nm. (Note that EBT solution develops a very fine precipitate with time and thus must be used fresh and should be mixed just before taking a sample.) The experiment was repeated at different concentrations of Mg2+. When used, the NAD(P)H was dissolved directly in 0.5 ml of the Mg2+ solution and incubated for 15 min. Then 0.5 ml of the EBT solution was added followed by the 6-min wait and the recording of the absorption spectrum. Alternatively, the absorbance at 528 nm was recorded as a function of time, and the value at 6 min was used for the calculations. In a typical mitochondrial respiration experiment, four sequential ADP additions were performed resulting in the recording of four state 3-state 4 segments. The data were recorded and digitized by Axotape 2.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). The first of these was never used and was considered to be a treatment that would prime the mitochondria for further testing. Each of the subsequent three state 3-state 4 recordings following the addition of an aliquot of ADP were output to a qBasic program for analysis. The rate of respiration during the state 4 phase was subtracted from the immediately previous state 3 recording in order to obtain just ADP-dependent respiration. The oxygen concentration scale was converted to an ADP concentration scale by knowing the amount of ADP added to the chamber and assuming that during state 4 the [ADP] = 0. The method was described in detail in 20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP consumption involves three steps: transfer across the outer membrane, transfer across the inner membrane through the adenine nucleotide translocator, and phosphorylation by the mitochondrial ATP synthetase. At steady state (note small intermembrane space volume) the flux of ADP across outer membrane is equal to the flux across inner membrane. Therefore: Flux=d(ADP)dt=−P∗A∗Co−Ci=−Vmax∗CiKM+Ci(Eq. 3) where P is the permeability of the outer membrane to ADP; A is the total area of the outer membrane of all the mitochondria present; Ci and Co are the ADP concentrations in the intermembrane space and the medium, respectively; and Vmax and Km are enzyme kinetics parameters of the adenine nucleotide translocator. Solving for Ci in terms of Co yields: The theoretical curve of the decline of the medium [ADP] as a function of time was generated by calculating the [ADP] at time (t) at intervals (dt) corresponding to the collected data points. These were calculated as follows: Cot+dt=Cot±d(ADP)dtdt=Cot−Vmax∗CiKM+Cidt(Eq. 5) Vmax and P*A were allowed to vary so as to achieve the best fit. The planar membranes were generated by the monolayer method of 24Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar as modified (8Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using a 5:1 asolectin/cholesterol mixture. The aqueous solutions were 1 M KCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and 5 mM MgCl2 (or as indicated) except for the ion selectivity experiments where one side contained 0.1 M KCl rather than 1 M KCl. Error values reported are standard errors. The state of the channels was monitored by recording the current under voltage clamped conditions (9Colombini M. Choh L.Y. Tung J. König T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Calomel electrodes were used to interface with the solution. Current recordings in response to triangular voltage waves (4 mHz) were used to calculate the probability of the channel being open as a function of voltage and evaluate the two parameters that define the gating process: n, the gating valence, and V0, the potential where the probability of being open or closed are equal. The permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane to ADP was measured by analyzing the transition between state 3 and state 4 respiration as described in the methods and as previously reported (20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method allowed us to examine quantitatively the effect of various treatments on the permeability of the outer membrane and thus assess the importance of this pathway to mitochondrial function. Both NADH and NADPH reduce the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane to ADP. 2The actions of these dinucleotides are probably not the result of their ability to donate reducing equivalents. Both the NADH and NADPH dehydrogenases are Ca2+-dependent, and both were inhibited by the addition of EGTA. This also ensured no significant consumption of the dinucleotides during the experiments. Fig. 1 shows the rate of respiration of mitochondria after ADP addition at time 0. As the ADP is consumed, the rate remains constant for some time (state 3 rate of oxidation) and then declines as the mitochondria enter state 4. This decline is more gradual with increasing concentrations of NADPH in the medium. As previously reported for NADH, this too can be understood as a decrease in the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The method, described under “Experimental Procedures,” allows one to calculate the total permeability of the outer membrane for ADP, i.e. the permeability per unit area times the total area of the outer membrane. If the total area remains constant, then the permeability per unit area must decrease. Both NADH and NADPH have the same overall effect in that they decrease the total permeability to 0.1 cm3/s (Fig. 2). However, NADH is much more potent. Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for the binding of the dinucleotides to sites on the outer membrane, the KD for NADPH is 580 μM (Fig. 2, inset). This compares with a KD of 86 μM for NADH (20Lee A.-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the affinity of the binding sites for NADH is higher than that for NADPH by a factor of 7.

Recordings of mitochondrial respiration in states 3 and 4 were fitted to Equations 3, 4, and 5 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield the estimates of permeability*area (P*A) plotted in this figure. Three sets of experiments are shown, one for NADH (closed circle) and two for NADPH (open circle and triangle). Similar amounts of mitochondria were used (140-180 μg of protein/assay) in the incubation mixture in order to have similar membrane surface areas. The inset shows the estimate of the binding constant for NADPH. These data were plotted according to following equation: [NADPH]P−Po=1P+−Po∗[NADPH]+KDP+−Po(Eq. 6) where P is the permeability, Po is the maximal permeability (without NADPH), P+ is the minimal permeability, and KD is the dissociation constant. Two estimates of the KD (mean and range) were obtained by linear regression from different mitochondrial preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The measured permeability of the outer membrane is independent of the degree of coupling of the inner membrane. The respiratory control ratio is a way to express the efficiency of phosphorylation and the degree of coupling of mitochondria. By definition, there is no significant ADP in state 4. The oxygen consumption at state 4 is only due to leakage of protons through the inner membrane assuming the mitochondrial suspension does not contain other systems that consume oxygen such as a catalase or other oxidases. If the inner membrane were not leaky to protons, the oxygen consumption rate at state 4 would be very low. The respiratory control ratio (the ratio of state 3 divided by state 4) is a good way to express the degree of coupling, because it is very sensitive to the proton permeability of the inner membrane (the outer membrane is permeable to protons). The degree of coupling changes with incubation time as mitochondria age (Fig. 3A). However, the permeability of the outer membrane to ADP should be a characteristic of the outer membrane and should not change with changes in the inner membrane. As expected the measured outer membrane permeability did not follow changes in respiratory control ratio with time (Fig. 3A). Conversely, NADH decreased the permeability of the outer membrane to ADP but did not change the degree of coupling of the inner membrane (Fig. 3B). The theory used to fit the respiration experiments can be used to calculate the concentration of ADP in the intermembrane space and thus assess the degree by which the outer membrane limits the rate of respiration. Net flux of ADP through the outer membrane requires an ADP concentration difference between the medium and the intermembrane space. The magnitude of this difference depends on the permeability of the outer membrane and the net flux of ADP through the inner membrane. The calculations show that such a concentration difference exists throughout the respiration experiment (Fig. 4A). However, the percentage of reduction of the ADP concentration in the intermembrane space caused by the outer membrane becomes maximal at low medium ADP concentrations. Thus the outer membrane is most important as a physical barrier at the low (physiologically relevant) ADP concentrations. The differences are much greater in the presence of 2 mM of NADH (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the outer membrane is really a physical barrier whose function will be amplified by introducing reagents to decrease the permeability of the outer membrane. Because VDAC is believed to be the major permeability pathway across the mitochondrial outer membrane, NADH and NADPH should be acting by reducing the permeability of VDAC channels in the outer membrane. It has been shown that NADH increases the voltage dependence of VDAC channels (40Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the action of NADPH on potato VDAC. We reconstituted potato VDAC protein into planar phospholipid membranes. Addition of 14 mM of NADPH favors the closed state of VDAC channels (Fig. 5) without changing the single channel conductance in the presence of 5 mM magnesium. The data were plotted according to the linearized version of the Boltzmann distribution to obtain the values of the parameters defining the voltage dependence: n, the gating valence, is a measure of the steepness of the voltage dependence, and V0 is the midpoint of the switching region (half the channels are open and half closed). NADPH increases the steepness of the voltage dependence (n) of VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes. The voltage range over which the channel switches between being open or closed (V0) was not shifted (Table I). We found that 1 mM NADH increased the voltage dependence of VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes by 40%, whereas 3 mM NADPH increased this by 27% (Table I). Thus NADH and NADPH act on VDAC in a way that is consistent with their action on intact mitochondria. Both can increase the probability of VDAC closure, yet NADH is far more potent than NADPH.Table INAD(P)H increases the voltage dependence of VDACnChangeV0ChangeComment%mV%NADH5 mM Mg2+Control2.8 ± 0.127 ± 11 mM3.9 ± 0.128 ± 1Human VDAC (HVDAC1) from Zizi et al.

EBT binds Mg2+ weakly and changes its absorption spectrum in the process (Fig. 6A). The change is linear with concentrations of magnesium from 3 to 60 mM. Data from Fig. 6A were applied to Equation 1 and plotted in Fig. 7. The dissociation constant of EBT for magnesium is 11 mM under our conditions. This value is sensitive to ionic strength and pH. Fig. 6B shows absorption spectra of EBT at different levels of magnesium in the presence of 20 mM of NADH. The presence of NADH had almost no effect on the KD of EBT for Mg2+. A best fit to Equation 2 yielded an estimated value of 80 mM for the KD of NADH for Mg2+. Fig. 6C shows spectra of EBT with different levels of magnesium in the presence of 20 mM NADPH. Fitting four sets of data to Equation 2 yields a KD of NADPH for Mg2+ of 11.8 mM (Fig. 8). Thus the affinity of NADH for magnesium is seven times less than that of NADPH.Fig. 7The dissociation constant of eriochrome black T for magnesium at 0.1 M ionic strength. The absorbance of EBT at 528 nm (from spectra as in Fig. 6A) was obtained in the presence of varying amounts of Mg2+ (in the absence of NAD(P)H) and plotted according to Equation 1. The dissociation constant (intercept divided by slope) is indicated as the means ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 8Determination of the dissociation constant of NADPH for Mg2+. Four experiments are included, and the least squares fit line, constrained to intersect at zero, is shown. The slope of this line is the dissociation constant indicated in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All experiments with mitochondria were performed in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+. At 5 mM free Mg2+, negligible (6%) NADH is bound, but 30% of the NADPH is complexed with Mg2+. The free form of NADPH has no effect on the voltage dependence of VDAC (Table I). Therefore, VDAC channels must respond to the Mg2+-NADPH complex, and thus the KD for the complex should be 184 μM (as opposed to 580 μM for total NADPH). Because the charge on this complex should be essentially the same as that of free NADH, the result is understandable. If NAD(P)H were to bind in the region previously proposed (40Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it should be located within the pore based on proposed folding patterns for the channel (31Song J. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 151-159Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because both NADH and Mg2+-NADPH are negatively charged at pH 7.2, the binding of these within the pore should change the ion selectivity of the channel and thus the reversal potential in the presence of a salt gradient. Control experiments yielded 5.0 ± 0.5 mV (13 experiments) for a 10-fold gradient of KCl at pH 7.2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The presence of 4.5 mM NADH increased this slightly to 6.7 ± 0.3 mV (7 experiments) (significant at 95% level). A smaller and not statistically significant increase in the reversal potential (6.0 ± 0.4 mV (2 experiments)) was measured in the presence of 8.5 mM NADPH. Both changes are small, and their sign is opposite from the expected direction. In the cytosol, mitochondria and the VDAC channels of the outer membranes respond to dinucleotides in the presence of other substances. One such substance is the osmotic pressure due to the presence of macromolecules, the oncotic pressure. The combined effect of oncotic pressure and NADH may have a more profound effect on the permeability of the outer membrane or allow lower concentration of NADH to control this permeability. Uncharged polymers unable to permeate through VDAC have been shown to shift the voltage dependence (changing V0) of VDAC when reconstituted into planar membranes (39Zimmerberg J. Parsegian V.A. Nature. 1986; 323: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Their oncotic pressure favor the closed state of VDAC by inducing a negative pressure within the pore. If VDAC in the outer mitochondrial membrane behaves in the same way, oncotic pressure should decrease the permeability of the outer membrane by inducing VDAC channels to close. Dextran T-40 and PEG (20 K) were used to apply the oncotic pressure to intact mitochondria. As was the case for NADPH, these molecules broadened the transition between stat"

Pax9 expression was initiated at the end of the segmentation period in mesenchymal sclerotome cells on both sides of the notochord similarly to the corresponding mouse and chick genes. Two transcripts, Pax9a and -b, are generated by alternative splicing. The gene contains 4 exons with exon 3 being included in the Pax9a transcript and spliced out in the Pax9b transcript. The Pax9a and -b proteins are identical for 212 amino acids from the N terminus but contain distinct C-terminal regions of 131 and 58 amino acids, respectively. The paired domain of Pax9 displayed a binding-site specificity distinct from Pax6 but similar to Pax1 and −2. Both Pax9a and -b activated a promoter containing a paired domain binding site. However, this activation was observed when low amounts of Pax9 expression vectors were used. Higher amounts led to a sharp decrease in the activation and even turned into repression. Both the distinct C-terminal regions of Pax9a and -b harbored transcriptional activating domains of different potency not revealed in the context of the full-length proteins due to a negative influence of the N-terminal region including the paired domain.

Several of the multigene families acting as developmental control genes encode transcription factors containing conserved DNA-binding domains such as the homeodomain and the paired domain (1Affolter M. Schier A. Gehring W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The paired domain consisting of 125-128 amino acids, encoded by the paired box, was named after the Drosophila pair-rule segmentation gene paired (prd) where it was first identified (2Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the paired box-containing gene family contains five additional members: gooseberry (gsb), gooseberry neuro (gsbn), pox meso (poxm), pox neuro (poxn), and eyeless (ey) (2Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, genes containing a paired box are generally referred to as Pax (Paired box) genes. Presently, nine Pax genes have been found in mouse (Pax1 to Pax9) and man (PAX1 to PAX9) (4Stapleton P. Weith A. Urbá;nek P. Kozmik Z. Busslinger M. Nat.

Saule S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar), and chicken (11Goulding M.D. Lumsden A. Gruss P. Development. 1993; 117: 1001-1016PubMed Google Scholar), and their presence was confirmed in flatworms, nemerteans, nematodes, sea urchins, squid, frogs, and turtles (3Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 12Burri M. Tromvoukis Y. Bopp D. Frigerio G. Noll M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Except for Pax4, which may be a pseudogene, all of the murine Pax genes have been shown to be expressed. Unlike the much larger Hox gene family, which is organized in large gene clusters, the nine Pax genes are dispersed on eight chromosomes in humans and six chromosomes in mice (reviewed in 13Strachan T. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition to the paired domain prd, gsb, gsbn, ey, and Pax3, -4, -6, and -7 also contain a paired-type homeodomain (2Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 13Strachan T. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Pax2, Pax5, and Pax8 encode an amino acid stretch related to the first predicted α-helix of the paired type homeodomain (8Krauss S. Johansen T. Korzh V. Fjose A. Development. 1991; 113: 1193-1206PubMed Google Scholar, 14Deutsch U. Gruss P. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1991; 2: 413-424Google Scholar). All the Pax genes, except for Pax6 (9Krauss S. Johansen T. Korzh V. Moens U. Ericson J.U. Fjose A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3609-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Walther C. Gruss P. Development. 1991; 113: 1435-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), encode a conserved octapeptide of unknown function (12Burri M. Tromvoukis Y. Bopp D. Frigerio G. Noll M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This sequence is also absent in the Prd protein and the Drosophila Pax6 homologue Ey (3Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 12Burri M. Tromvoukis Y. Bopp D. Frigerio G. Noll M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The Pax genes show distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns during embryogenesis. Several Pax genes, including Pax2, Pax3, Pax5, Pax6, Pax7, and Pax8 are expressed in dorsoventrally restricted domains along the hindbrain and spinal cord (i.e. see 16Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar and 17Chalepakis G. Stoykova A. Wijnholds J. Tremblay P. Gruss P. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1367-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The expression of Pax1 is unique as it is confined exclusively to mesodermal tissue that gives rise to the axial skeleton (18Deutsch U. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Cell. 1988; 53: 617-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). An evolutionary relationship between Pax1 and Drosophila pox meso is apparent both in terms of paired domain sequence homology and mesodermal expression (2Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Bopp D. Jamet E. Baumgartner S. Burri M. Noll M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3447-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Strikingly, mutations in the three murine Pax genes Pax1, Pax3, and Pax6 have been shown to cause the developmental mutants undulated, Splotch, and Small eye, respectively. Furthermore, mutations in the PAX3 and PAX6 genes are associated with the human inherited disorders Wardenburg's syndrome and aniridia (reviewed in 13Strachan T. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Studies with transgenic mice lacking Pax5 show this gene to be important for normal development of the midbrain and absolutely essential for B cell development (20Urbá;nek P. Wang Z.Q. Fetka I. Wagner E.F. Busslinger M. Cell. 1994; 79: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and deregulated expression of Pax2 leads to severe kidney abnormalities (21Dressler G.R. Wilkinson J.E. Rothenpieler U.W. Patterson L.T. Williams Simons L. Westphal H. Nature. 1993; 362: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, Pax2 is required for proper formation of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (22Krauss S. Maden M. Holder N. Wilson S.W. Nature. 1992; 360: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Convincing evidence for Pax6 as a master control gene for eye morphogenesis was recently provided (23Halder G. Callaerts P. Gehring W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Pax proteins in rodent fibroblasts is oncogenic (24Maulbecker C.C. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and in the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, chromosomal translocations result in fusions of the paired and homeo domains of PAX3 or PAX7 to the transactivating domain of a forkhead family transcription factor (25Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher F.J. d. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 26Davis R.J. CM D.C. Lovell M.A. Biegel J.A. Barr F.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2869-2872PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the association with severe developmental defects and oncogenesis both in mouse and man suggest that the members of the relatively small Pax gene family seem to exert crucial functions in the regulation of development. Consistent with this notion, evidence showing that Pax proteins function as transcription factors has recently been provided. Pax proteins show specific binding to isolated sequences and to promoter sequences from different putative target genes (27Adams B. Dörfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbá;nek P. Maurer Fogy I.

We have previously reported the cloning and embryonic expression patterns of zebrafish pax[zf-a] and pax[zf-b] (7Krauss S. Johansen T. Korzh V. Fjose A.

Here, we report the molecular characterization of two alternatively spliced variants of zebrafish Pax9, the DNA-binding specificity of the paired domain and transactivation potentials of the two isoforms, as well as the genomic structure and embryonic expression pattern of this gene.

HindIII-EcoRI fragment from the paired box of murine Pax1 as a probe, was used to screen 7.8 × 105 plaques of a 20-28-h embryonic λZAP-II library at high stringency. This way four new clones were isolated. Two of these clones were sequenced completely on both strands and correspond to the Pax9a and -b sequences shown in Fig. 1. Screening of cDNA libraries, subcloning, and DNA sequencing were done according to standard procedures (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The GCG software package (version 8.0) was used for general sequence analyses. The PHYLIP (version 3.5c) (41Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) and MegAlign (DNASTAR) program packages were used for phylogenetic analyses (42Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl.

For secondary structure predictions the Alexis program of the Seqsee program suite (44Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar) was used, together with the PHD neural network method (45Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). A Takara LA PCR Kit (Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd.) was used to analyze the genomic structure of the Pax9 gene with genomic DNA isolated from adult zebrafish as the template. Pax9 genomic DNA fragments were amplified using different combinations of 8 oligonucleotide primers: 1, CTGGACATATGGCAATGCATAG; 2, GCTGTGACATAACTGTTCACTG; 3, TTAGTGACAATCCGTCCTTTCC; 4, CTGGTTGTATTTTGCTTCAGG; 5, CTATCACATCCGTCTCGGACGC; 6, CGGGATCCTTAGCGGAGAATCCTACTAATTG; 7, GAATTCCATGGAGCCAGCCTTTGGGGA; and 8, ATGCTCCTGTTATCATATGTCCGTC. The PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced directly from their ends using the approriate primers essentially as described by Khorana et al. (46Khorana S. Gagel R.F. Cote G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3425-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two proteins Pax9a and Pax9b were expressed in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the Promega TNT in vitro transcription and translation kit. Pax9a and Pax9b cDNAs were cloned in the sense orientation downstream of the SP6 promoter in pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega) by ligating AvaI-NcoI-cut cDNA fragments into the EcoRV and NcoI sites of the vector. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the Pax9 paired domain and the unique C-terminal domain (amino acids 207-270) of Pax9b using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Protein extracts for Western blots were made by crunching and boiling zebrafish embryos (24-26 h) frozen in liquid nitrogen in SDS sample buffer. Following electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10% gels, the proteins were blotted to a Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4°C in 1% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS (Tris-buffered saline) (pH 7.4). Anti-Pax9 sera and secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, alkaline phosphatase conjugate, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC2007) were diluted 1:5000 and 1:2500 in blocking buffer, respectively, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following each incubation the membrane was washed five to six times during 1 h with 0.1% Tween 20, TBS. A chemiluminescence substrate, CDPstar (Boehringer Mannheim), was used to develop the signals. Total RNA for Northern blot was isolated from zebrafish embryos (26-36 h) using the TRIzol™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Dynabeads oligo(dT)25 (Dynal). Northern blot analysis was carried out following standard procedures (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The paired domain coding sequences of zebrafish Pax2, Pax6, and Pax9 were amplified from their respective cDNA clones by PCR. The specific primers were constructed so that the 5′ primer contained a NcoI site, whereas the 3′ primer contained a BamHI site. The paired domain PCR products were cut with NcoI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the E. coli expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). The following primers were used: Pax2, GAATTCCATGGCACATATGCACCGGCACGGC and CGGGATCCTTATCGAATTATCCTGTTTATAG; Pax6, GAATTCCATGGAAAACAGTCACAGTGGAGT and CGGGATCCTTAGCGCAGTACTCTGTTTATCG; and for Pax9, primers 6 and 7 described above were used. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as host strain for protein expression, which was performed according to the Novagen Instruction Manual for pET vectors. Dilutions of crude extracts were run on a 20% (29:1) polyacrylamide gel (47Okajima T. Tanabe T. Yasuda T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the percentage of the overexpressed paired domains relative to total bacterial proteins was determined by densitometric scanning following Coomassie Blue staining using the UVP System 5000 gel documentation system with the GelBase software package.

Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The amount of bound DNA was analyzed by the use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). GAL4-Pax9 fusions were made by cloning parts of Pax9a and Pax9b in frame with the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 (amino acids 1-147) in the pSG424 vector (49Sadowski I. Ptashne M.

All constructs were verified by sequencing through the junctions, and the expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal GAL4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reporter vector pTKG5CAT containing five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter was constructed by inserting a 140-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment from pG5E1bTATA-CAT (50Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) into pBLCAT2 (51Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The enhancer reporter vector, pTKCATG5, was made by inserting the same 140-bp fragment following end-filling into the SmaI site downstream of the CAT gene in pBLCAT2. Expression vectors for Pax9a and -b were made by inserting the cDNAs as NotI-ApaI fragments into pRc-CMV (Invitrogen) and a reporter vector containing a single Pax-binding site was made by inserting the CD19-2(A-ins) oligonucleotide into the BamHI site upstream of the tk promoter of pBLCAT2. For transient transfection assays, HeLa cells (ATCC CCL 2) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mML-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Transfections, preparations of cell extracts, and CAT assays were performed as described previously (52Bjørkøy G. Øvervatn A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21299-21306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transfections were repeated with different DNA preparations. In situ hybridization on tissue sections was carried out as described previously (8Krauss S. Johansen T. Korzh V. Fjose A. Development. 1991; 113: 1193-1206PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1330-bp EcoRI fragment from the Pax9a cDNA as the probe. For whole mount embryos two probes were used, both giving similar staining patterns: (i) pBluescriptSK-Pax9a linearized with PvuII, to give a full-length probe, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and (ii) pBluescriptSK-Pax9b linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. For the latter probe, the staining reaction was left overnight at 4°C. In situ hybridization on whole mount embryos was performed as described by Krauss et al. (53Krauss S. Concordet J.P. Ingham P.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 1431-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA clones derived from two transcripts, Pax9a and Pax9b, were isolated from a zebrafish embryonic cDNA library (see “Materials and Methods”). The sequences are identical except for an insertion of 140 bp in the coding region of Pax9a relative to Pax9b (nt positions 782-921), and an A to C transversion as well as a 6-nt deletion in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of Pax9b relative to Pax9a (see Fig. 1). These two latter differences are probably due to natural allelic polymorphisms. The Pax9a and -b cDNAs represent alternatively spliced transcripts with Pax9a containing a 140-bp exon that is spliced out during the generation of the Pax9b mRNA (see below). A 144-nt 5′-UTR precedes the start codon which can be unambiguously assigned since the 5′-UTR is devoid of other potential start codons and contains two in frame stop codons (see Fig. 1A). The start codon sequence context compares favorably with the Kozak consensus for initiator methionine codons (54Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). The putative proteins (denoted Pax9a and Pax9b) are identical for 212 amino acids from the N terminus, including the 125-amino acid paired domain and the conserved octapeptide sequence, but differ in their C-terminal sequences downstream of the octapeptide. Due to the presence of the 140-bp exon, the Pax9a cDNA encodes a 131-amino acid C-terminal region distinct from the 58-amino acid C-terminal region encoded by Pax9b, since the two C termini are encoded by different reading frames (see Fig. 1). The common 84-residue long region downstream of the paired domain is very hydrophilic with a preponderance of proline (14.3%), serine (10.7%), and glutamine (9.5%) residues. The unique C-terminal region of Pax9a is rich in serine (17%) and proline (13%) residues. The 58-amino acid C-terminal region of Pax9b contains histidine and serine as the most abundant amino acids (27.5%). These features are characteristic for many transcription factors (55Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Interestingly, eight putative phosphorylation sites for proline-directed protein kinases (56Vulliet P.R. Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16292-16298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are present in Pax9a (three in Pax9b, Fig. 1A). Pax9a is a 343 amino acids long protein of 37.3 kDa, whereas Pax9b is only 270 amino acids long (29.7 kDa), making it the smallest Pax protein known to date. The predicted sizes of the proteins were confirmed by coupled in vitro transcription and translation of the two cDNAs. As seen in Fig. 2A, the appearant molecular masses of 38 and 30 kDa determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following in vitro translation correspond very well to the molecular masses predicted from the cDNA sequences. To confirm the presence of two Pax9 proteins, we performed immunoblot analyses of whole zebrafish embryo extracts using antisera raised against the paired domain of Pax9 and against the unique C-terminal domain of Pax9b. As seen from Fig. 2B, immunoreactive bands with molecular masses corresponding to both Pax9a and -b were seen with the paired domain antiserum (lane 2), while only the band corresponding to the size of Pax9b was detected with the antiserum raised against the C-terminal domain of Pax9b (lane 4). The 3′-UTRs of Pax9a and -b do not contain the consensus polyadenylation signal AATAAA. However, the sequence ATTAAA located 12 nt upstream of the poly(A) tail is also known as a functional poyadenylation signal (57Hook A.G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2337-2343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pax9a and -b cDNA clones are 1939 and 1782 nt long, respectively. Northern blot analysis of zebrafish mRNA isolated at 26-36 h of development displayed two broad bands of 2.1 ± 0.1 kb and 1.3 ± 0.1 kb, respectively (see Fig. 2C). The Pax9a and -b transcripts differing only by the presence/absence of the 140-bp exon will not be resolved on this gel. Assuming poly(A) tracts of ≈200 nt, this suggests that the cDNA sequences shown in Fig. 1A are close to full-length. The 1.3-kb transcript is most probably due to the use of an alternative ATTAAA polyadenylation signal located about 470 nt upstream of the ATTAAA sequence directing polyadenylation of the cDNA sequences shown in Fig. 1A. The 3′-UTR of Pax9a is (A + T)-rich (64%), contains an uninterrupted stretch of 27 A-T residues, and one copy of the nonamer motif TTATTTATT recently shown to be the crucial AU-rich sequence motif that mediates degradation of unstable mRNAs (58Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The fact that the human PAX9 gene contains an intron at exactly the same position (4Stapleton P. Weith A. Urbá;nek P. Kozmik Z. Busslinger M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) as the 140-bp insertion in Pax9a suggested that the Pax9a and -b transcripts could be generated by alternative splicing. Furthermore, the absence of consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences at the junctions of the 140-bp insertion made it unlikely that Pax9a represented an incompletely spliced transcript. Also, PCR on two different cDNA libraries and reverse transcription-PCR analyses of RNA from different developmental stages with primers flanking the putative 140-bp exon in Pax9a consistently confirmed the presence of both transcripts (data not shown). PCR analyses and sequencing on zebrafish genomic DNA revealed that the gene contains four exons and three introns with exon 3 being the alternatively spliced exon included in the Pax9a transcript and spliced out in the Pax9b transcript (Fig. 3). The first long intron is located in the second codon of the gene. Similar to other class I paired-box genes (4Stapleton P. Weith A. Urbá;nek P. Kozmik Z. Busslinger M. Nat.

Structurally, it has 11 Arm repeats, a protein interaction motif, found in the Drosophila Armadillo protein, a homolog of mammalian β-catenin. We have isolated here an Smg GDS-interacting protein from a human brain cDNA library by use of the yeast two-hybrid method and named it SMAP (Smg GDS-associated protein). SMAP was a protein with a Mr of 91,189 and 792 amino acids. SMAP had 9 Arm repeats. Recombinant SMAP interacted with recombinant Smg GDS but did not affect the two activities of Smg GDS on RhoA. SMAP was tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src, and this phosphorylation reduced the affinity of SMAP for Smg GDS. Tissue and subcellular distribution analyses indicated that SMAP was ubiquitously expressed and highly concentrated at the endoplasmic reticulum area. Searches for sequence homology to SMAP revealed that SMAP was significantly homologous to sea urchin SpKAP115, suggesting that SMAP is a mammalian counterpart of SpKAP115 or its related protein. SpKAP115 is an accessory subunit of sea urchin kinesin II, an ATPase motor that transports vesicles along microtubules. These results suggest that SMAP serves as an adaptor for both Smg GDS and kinesin II or its related protein and links them with both the Smg GDS-regulated small G protein and Src tyrosine kinase signalings.

Smg GDS has originally been isolated as a regulator that stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of Rap1 small G protein (1Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J.

Subsequently, Smg GDS has been shown to be active on a group of small G proteins including the Rho and Rap1 family members and Ki-Ras and to require the post-translational lipid modifications of these substrate small G proteins for its action (3Hiroyoshi M.

Moreover, Smg GDS has been shown to inhibit the interactions of these lipid-modified substrate small G proteins with membranes (5Kawamura S. Kaibuchi K. Hiroyoshi M. Hata Y. Takai Y. Biochem.

Armadillo is the Drosophila segment polarity gene product (10Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P.

The role of Arm repeats has not fully been understood, but APC has been shown to be associated with β-catenin through the Arm domain of β-catenin and the non-Arm domain of APC (19Rubinfeld B.

SMAP fused to MBP (MBP-SMAP) and Smg GDS fused to GST (GST-Smg GDS) were purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli (21Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inoue H.

A rabbit anti-SMAP polyclonal antibody was generated against MBP-SMAP, passed through a MBP-coupled affinity column, and further purified by a MBP-SMAP-coupled affinity column (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The antibody reacted with SMAP that was cleaved from MBP-SMAP by factor Xa (See Fig. 4B, a). A baculovirus expressing v-Src was provided by F. McCormick (Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA). Mouse anti-v-Src, anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Oncogene Science Inc. (Cambridge, MA), Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA), respectively. Yeast strain L40 carrying pBTM116-HA-Smg GDS was transformed with a human brain cDNA library made in pGAD10 (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The screening was carried out (24Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The full-length human brain SMAP cDNA was determined by use of the human brain 5′-RACE-Ready™ cDNA Kit (Clontech). A DNA fragment encoding the HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope was inserted into the cloning site of pBTM116 (25Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar) to express the LexA-HA-tagged fusion protein. Plasmids used in the yeast two-hybrid method were as follows; pBTM116-HA-Smg GDS containing LexA-HA-Smg GDS fusion gene; pACTII-HK-Smg GDS containing GAD-HA-Smg GDS fusion gene (26Ozaki K. Tanaka K.

The m-importin cDNA was from Y. Yoneda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan); pGAD424-β-catenin was from S. Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan); GBT9-APC was from T. Akiyama (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan); and pBTM116-Ras(G12V) and pVP16-Raf were from K. Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) (24Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The yeast strains used were L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 ade2 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) for pBTM116-HA-Smg GDS and pBTM116-Ras(G12V) and Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1 ade2 ura3 leu2 LYS2::GAL-HIS3 URA3::GAL-lacZ cyhr) for GBT9-APC. Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody confirmed that yeast strains carrying pBTM116-HA-Smg GDS, pACTII-HK-Smg GDS, pACTII-HK-SMAP, and pACTII-HK-m-importin expressed proteins of about 70, 70, 50, and 80 kDa, the expected sizes of Smg GDS, SMAP, and m-importin fused to LexA-HA or GAD-HA, respectively. GST or recombinant GST-Smg GDS (1.5 nmol) was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (100 μl) equilibrated with 2 ml of Buffer A (20 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT). After the column was washed with Buffer B (20 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT), 100 μl of recombinant MBP-SMAP (2.8 μg) was applied to the column. After the column was washed with 3 ml of Buffer B, the bound protein was coeluted with GST or GST-Smg GDS by 0.4 ml of Buffer B containing 20 mM glutathione. 120 or 20 μl of the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting, respectively. The phosphorylation of SMAP by v-Src was performed in both cell-free and intact cell systems. In a cell-free system, the cytosol fraction of v-Src-expressing Sf9 cells was obtained (4Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 200 μl of the cytosol fraction (2 mg of protein) was incubated with the anti-v-Src antibody (10 μl) for 1.5 h at 4°C. After 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 0.5 ml of Buffer C (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) were added, the immunocomplex was precipitated and washed sequentially with Buffer C and Buffer D (20 mM Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). Reaction was started by the addition of 30 μl of Buffer D containing 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol) and 0.2 μM MBP-SMAP to the precipitate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 15 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography and Western blotting. In an intact cell system, COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C. Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105/60-mm dish. After 16 h, cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEF-BOS-HA-tagged SMAP and 6 μg of pcD-v-Src (provided by M. Seiki, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan) by the DEAE-dextran method, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h (27Komuro R. Sasaki T. Orita S. Maeda M. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HA-tagged SMAP was immunoprecipitated from lysates with the anti-HA antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (28Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. We attempted to isolate an Smg GDS-interacting protein by use of the yeast two-hybrid method with Smg GDS as a bait from a human brain cDNA library. Among the selected clones, one clone encoded a novel amino acid sequence that had Arm repeats. We isolated the entire coding sequence of the clone. The cDNA obtained had a 2,379-base pair open reading frame (Fig. 1A). The neighboring sequence of the first ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start site proposed by Kozak (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar), and in-frame stop codons were present upstream of the first ATG. The open reading frame encoded a protein with a Mr of 91,189. We named this protein SMAP (GenBank accession number U59919). SMAP had 9 Arm repeats between amino acid residues 156 and 615 (Fig. 1, A, B, and C). Searches for sequence homology to SMAP revealed that it shared 66% amino acid sequence identity (89% similarity) with SpKAP115, an accessory subunit of sea urchin kinesin II (30Wedaman K.P. Meyer D.W. Rashid D.J. Cole D.G. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). By use of the yeast two-hybrid method Smg GDS interacted with SMAP. Ras(G12V) and Raf, known to interact in the yeast two-hybrid method, were used as positive controls (24Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). However, Smg GDS did not interact with β-catenin, APC, or importin (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, APC interacted with β-catenin, when yeast strain Y190 expressing APC was transformed with the plasmid encoding β-catenin instead of Smg GDS (data not shown). The direct interaction of Smg GDS with SMAP was confirmed in a cell-free system using the recombinant proteins. MBP-SMAP was first applied to a GST-coupled or GST-Smg GDS-coupled glutathione-Sepharose column, and the bound protein was coeluted with GST or GST-Smg GDS by glutathione. MBP-SMAP was coeluted with GST-Smg GDS but not with GST (Fig. 2B). However, when MBP was applied to a GST-Smg GDS-coupled glutathione-Sepharose column, MBP was not coeluted with GST-Smg GDS (data not shown). Under these conditions, about 15% of MBP-SMAP applied bound to GST-Smg GDS. This result indicates that Smg GDS directly interacts with SMAP. Of the substrate small G proteins for Smg GDS, RhoA is the best substrate (4Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It was examined whether SMAP affects the two activities of Smg GDS to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of RhoA and to inhibit its interaction with membranes. MBP-SMAP did not affect the activity of Smg GDS to stimulate the [35S]GTPγS binding to RhoA (data not shown). Neither did it affect the activity of Smg GDS to inhibit the interaction of RhoA with erythrocyte membranes (data not shown). p120 and β-catenin have been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src (31Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 32Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). SMAP has a C-terminal tyrosine-rich region that includes consensus sequences for tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, it was examined whether SMAP is tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src. MBP-SMAP was tyrosine phosphorylated by recombinant v-Src in a cell-free system (Fig. 3A). When the stoichiometry of this phosphorylation was examined in the same way as described (33Kato M. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Takahashi K. Araki K. Shirataki H. Matsuura Y. Ishida A. Fujisawa H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 2 mol of phosphate were maximally incorporated into 1 mol of MBP-SMAP. To confirm that SMAP is tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src in intact cells, HA-tagged SMAP was expressed alone or coexpressed with v-Src in cultured COS-7 cells. HA-tagged SMAP was tyrosine phosphorylated only in the v-Src-expressing COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that SMAP is tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src in both cell-free and intact cell systems. The effect of the v-Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of SMAP on its interaction with Smg GDS was next examined. The amount of the phosphorylated form of SMAP bound to Smg GDS was about one-third of that of the unphosphorylated form (Table I). This result indicates that the v-Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of SMAP reduces its affinity for Smg GDSTable IEffect of the v-Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of SMAP on its interaction with Smg GDSMBP-SMAPTotalBound to and co-eluted with GST or GST-Smg GDS%GST + unphosphorylated form1000GST + phosphorylated form1000GST-Smg GDS + unphosphorylated form10015GST-Smg GDS + phosphorylated form1005 Open table in a new tab In the last set of experiments, the tissue and subcellular distributions of SMAP were examined. Northern blotting indicated that a 4.1-kb band was detected strongly in brain and weakly in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis (Fig. 4A). 2A 2.8-kb band was detected in testis. The exact reason for this band is not known, but one explanation is that it results from alternative splicing of the primary transcript of a single gene. The message size was enough long to encode a 90-kDa protein. The tissue distribution of the SMAP mRNA was similar to that of the Smg GDS mRNA (2Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Fujioka H. Yamamoto T. Kishi K. Fukumoto Y. Hori Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The anti-SMAP antibody by Western blotting of rat brain recognized only a single band of 90 kDa, which was similar to a Mr value calculated from the open reading frame (Fig. 4B, a). However, the position of the band was slightly lower than that of SMAP, which was cleaved from MBP-SMAP by factor Xa on SDS-PAGE. This difference might be due to the difference in species. This band disappeared when the antibody was preincubated with an excess amount of SMAP (Fig. 4B, a). Western blotting of various rat tissues showed the similar ubiquitous distribution of SMAP with its high expression in brain and testis (data not shown). Immunostaining of cultured PC12 cells with the anti-SMAP antibody but not with preimmune rabbit IgG showed an ER pattern estimated with DiOC6 (3Hiroyoshi M. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hata Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2962-2969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, b-d). The area strongly stained with wheat germ agglutinin and p58, Golgi complex markers, was not stained with the anti-SMAP antibody (data not shown). These results suggest that SMAP is highly concentrated at the ER area. We have isolated here an Smg GDS-interacting protein and determined its primary structure. Arm repeats are defined as sequences with ≥10 of 48 matches to an individual protein consensus (18Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). According to this definition, the Smg GDS-interacting protein isolated here is a novel protein having 9 Arm repeats and named SMAP. We have moreover shown by use of the yeast two-hybrid method that Smg GDS does not interact with other proteins having Arm repeats and specifically interacts with SMAP. The direct interaction of Smg GDS with SMAP has moreover been confirmed in a cell-free system using the recombinant proteins. We have not yet determined the domains of Smg GDS and SMAP that interact with each other, but the interaction of Smg GDS with SMAP does not interfere with the two activities of Smg GDS on RhoA, suggesting that Smg GDS has at least two regions, each interacting with RhoA and SMAP. During the present study, the full sequence of sea urchin SpKAP115 was reported, and it shares 66% amino acid sequence identity with SMAP, although it was not shown that SpKAP115 has Arm repeats (30Wedaman K.P. Meyer D.W. Rashid D.J. Cole D.G. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SMAP is likely to be a mammalian counterpart of SpKAP115 or its related protein. SpKAP115 is an accessory subunit of sea urchin kinesin II. Sea urchin kinesin II consists of SpKRP85, SpKRP95, and SpKAP115. It has been reported that the murine homologs of SpKRP85 and SpKRP95, namely KIF3A and KIF3B, respectively, form a heterotrimeric complex with a third polypeptide, KAP3 (34Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), which has not yet been characterized. It seems likely that KAP3 will turn out to be a homolog of SpKAP115 and SMAP. Sea urchin kinesin II is an ATPase motor that may transport vesicles along microtubules from their minus to plus ends (for a review see 35Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SpKAP115 may select the vesicles as an adaptor for sea urchin kinesin II (30Wedaman K.P. Meyer D.W. Rashid D.J. Cole D.G. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical studies have demonstrated that kinesin is located at the ER Golgi area (36Lippincott-Schwarz J. Cole N.B. Marotta A. Conrad P.A. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but the exact localization of kinesin II is not known. We have shown here that SMAP is ubiquitously expressed and highly concentrated at the ER area in PC12 cells. It is likely that SMAP is associated with kinesin II or its related protein and regulates the ER Golgi vesicle transport as an adaptor for both Smg GDS and kinesin II or its related protein. The kinesin-bound vesicles could be transported between the ER and Golgi membranes along microtubules (36Lippincott-Schwarz J. Cole N.B. Marotta A. Conrad P.A. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Microtubules are generally known not to directly interact with the plasma membranes or the membranes of intracellular organelles. It could be speculated that microtubules between the membranes of intracellular organelles are connected by microfilaments. The Rho family members are known to regulate reorganization of actin filaments (8Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 9Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and to be located not only at the plasma membranes but also at the ER Golgi area (37Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). SMAP may determine the positions of both Smg GDS and kinesin II or its related protein, where Smg GDS regulates reorganization of actin filaments through its substrate Rho family members. This reorganization of actin filaments may be involved in the kinesin II- or kinesin II-related protein-mediated vesicle trafficking. We have shown here that SMAP is tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src in both cell-free and intact cell systems. We have not determined here the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SMAP, but SMAP has three consensus tyrosine sites, Tyr698, Tyr787, and Tyr788, for the v-Src phosphorylation, and consistently the incorporation of phosphate was maximally 2 mol/mol for SMAP. The two Tyr residues of the three may be the phosphorylation sites. The physiological function of this phosphorylation remains to be clarified, but we have shown here that this phosphorylation reduces the affinity of SMAP for Smg GDS. Therefore, it is possible that the v-Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of SMAP regulates its interaction with Smg GDS. Src has also been shown to be associated with the perinuclear vesicles, presumably at the ER Golgi area, and to be involved in the vesicle trafficking (38Redmond T. Brott B.K. Jove R. Welsh M.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). It could be speculated that this action of Src may be mediated through SMAP. After submission of this article, Yamazaki et al. (41Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) reported the primary structure of mouse KAP3A. The sequence of mouse KAP3A shares 97% amino acid sequence identity with human SMAP. This result indicates that human SMAP is a true counterpart of mouse KAP3A."
https://openalex.org/W2034608670,"Sodium salicylate has long been known to be an inducer of the heat shock puffs and presumably heat shock gene transcription in the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila salivary gland cells. Stress-induced transcription of the heat shock genes is mediated by the transcription factor known as Heat Shock Factor (HSF). In yeast, sodium salicylate has been reported to induce the DNA binding of HSF but not heat shock gene transcription itself, and similar findings have been reported in human cells. This apparent discrepancy in the induction of certain aspects of the heat shock response between these organisms prompted us to carefully reexamine the induction of the heat shock response in Drosophila salivary gland cells of third instar larvae and Drosophila tissue culture (SL2) cells. Sodium salicylate (3-30 mM) decreases intracellular ATP levels in SL2 cells and induces HSF binding activity in SL2 and salivary gland cells in a dose-dependent manner. Despite the induction of HSF binding and heat shock puffs in polytene chromosomes, we found no evidence for increased hsp 70 gene transcription suggesting that chromosomal puffing and gene transcription may be separable events. Salicylate did not induce the HSF hyperphosphorylation that is normally associated with HSF activation. Furthermore, salicylate (30 mM) prevented heat-induced hyperphosphorylation of HSF and hsp 70 gene transcription indicating that salicylate's inhibitory effect on hsp 70 transcription may be independent of its effect on HSF binding activity. We propose that the reduction in intracellular ATP caused by the addition of salicylate likely plays a role in the activation of HSF binding and the inhibition of both HSF hyperphosphorylation and hsp 70 gene transcription.

We propose that the reduction in intracellular ATP caused by the addition of salicylate likely plays a role in the activation of HSF binding and the inhibition of both HSF hyperphosphorylation and hsp 70 gene transcription. One of the most widely administered family of drugs is the anti-inflammatory salicylates. Although many aspects of their action have been characterized, such as their effect on prostaglandin biosynthesis (1Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar), a total understanding of their pharmacological mechanism is not known. Salicylate has been demonstrated also to have both positive and negative effects on the transcriptional activity of a number of genes. In plants, salicylate can accumulate in disease ridden organisms and is believed to be involved in the induction of pathogenesis related genes (2Delaney T.P. Uknes S. Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Weymann K. Negrotto D. Gaffney T. Gur-Rella M. Kessmann H. Ward E. Ryals J. Science. 1994; 266: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). In contrast, other genes expressed during leaf wounding apparently are inhibited by salicylate (3Li N. Parsons B.L. Liu D.R. Mattoo A.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In human cells, salicylate has been shown to inhibit nuclear factor κB activation and transcription of genes regulated by this transcription factor (4Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Over 30 years ago Ritossa reported that heat (30°C), 1 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 10 mM sodium salicylate induced the puffing of a specific set of loci in the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila salivary gland cells (5Ritossa F. Experientia (Basel). 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 6Ritossa F. Dros. Inf. Serv. 1963; 37: 122-123Google Scholar). These “heat shock” puffs have always been assumed to be the site of active transcription of the heat shock genes because [3H]uridine is incorporated at these sites (7Ritossa F. Exp. Cell Res. 1964; 35: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Ashburner M. Bonner J.J. Cell. 1979; 17: 241-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) and heat shock gene cDNAs hybridize to RNA found at the puff sites (9Livak K.J. Freund R. Schweber M. Wensink P.C. Meselson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5613-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of RNA synthesis inhibitors blocks the induction of the heat shock puffs (for review, see 8Ashburner M. Bonner J.J. Cell. 1979; 17: 241-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of the heat shock puffs, the heat shock response has been described in every organism examined and a multitude of different “stress” inducers have been identified (for review, see 10Nover L. Heat Shock Response. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the transcriptional response to stress is mediated through a transcription factor known as heat shock factor (HSF) 1The abbreviations used are: HSFheat shock factorBis-Trisbis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methaneEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayHSEheat shock elementhspheat shock proteinSL2Schneider line 2TB1transcription buffer 1TBETris-borate-EDTAPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

In metazoans, stress induces a transformation of HSF from a monomer (for HSF1) to a trimer; and it is this latter form that binds to a specific DNA sequence known as the HSE (for review, see 15Fernandes M. O'Brien T. Lis J.T. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 375Google Scholar).

In Drosophila tissue culture cells (Schneider Line 2, SL2), heat, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and salicylate treatments have been shown to induce the high affinity binding of HSF in vivo (16Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Experiments using human cells have indicated that salicylate is capable of inducing both HSF binding and heat shock gene transcription at certain concentrations, while other concentrations induce HSF binding only (17Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Jurivich D.A. Pachetti C. Qiu L. Welk J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24489-24495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The situation is somewhat different in yeast where sodium salicylate stimulates HSF binding, but transcription of heat shock genes does not occur. Surprisingly, addition of salicylate prevents the induction of heat shock genes by heat in this organism (19Giardina C. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10369-10372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that sodium salicylate (3-30 mM) induces activation of HSF binding activity in both salivary gland cells and SL2 tissue culture cells. Puffing of the heat shock gene loci occurs in salivary glands exposed to 10 mM salicylate, and to a lesser extent, with exposure to 3 mM salicylate. No puffing occurs with 30 mM salicylate treatments, and this concentration prevents puffing of the heat shock gene loci by heat. However, salicylate treatments (3-30 mM) do not induce transcription of the hsp 70 heat shock genes in salivary glands nor in SL2 cells as assayed by primer extension analysis. These results suggest that chromosomal puffing and gene transcription are likely separable events. In addition, and similar to what is seen in yeast, salicylate (30 mM) prevents heat-induced transcription of the heat shock genes. It is not known how salicylate activates HSF binding, but models have been proposed which indicate that the lowering of intracellular pH (19Giardina C. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10369-10372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or the accumulation of newly synthesized aberrant proteins (17Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24489-24495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) might be involved in the activation process. Here we show that, in Drosophila cells, salicylate dramatically inhibits cellular ATP levels and prevents HSF hyperphosphorylation normally seen with heat-induced activation of HSF. We propose that sodium salicylate interferes with oxidative respiration resulting in decreased cellular ATP. A model as to how lowered ATP levels might activate HSF binding and prevent transcription of the heat shock genes is discussed. Salivary glands were dissected from wandering third instar “Oregon R” Drosophila melanogaster larvae in a drop of modified TB1 buffer (15 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, 80 mM KCl, 16 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% polyethylene glycol 6000) (20Bonner J.J. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Myohara M. Okada M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 396-406Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Only glands exhibiting puff stage 1 morphology (as described in 21Myohara M. Okada M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 396-406Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were used in experiments. Experiments were performed in depression slides kept in humidified chambers. Glands were first incubated in TB1 for 60 min at room temperature. One lobe of each pair was then transferred to a depression slide containing the appropriate concentration of sodium salicylate dissolved in TB1; the other lobe remained in TB1 as a control. For experiments involving heat shock, glands were transferred to depression slides containing sodium salicylate in TB1, or TB1 alone, in a humidified container kept partially submerged in a water bath. A temperature probe inside the container allowed for monitoring of the temperature, which was maintained at 36.5°C for heat shock. After the appropriate incubation time, experimental and control lobes were fixed immediately in 3.7% formaldehyde, 50% acetic acid, and squashed on microscope slides under coverslips treated with Sigmacote (Sigma). These preparations were frozen by submersing in liquid nitrogen. The coverslips were removed, and slides were stored in 95% ethanol until they were immunostained. Salivary gland chromosome preparations were stained for HSF as described previously (22Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), with a primary rabbit anti-HSF antibody (943) and a secondary fluoroscein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel, catalog no. 55655). DNA was stained for fluorescence with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Photography was performed using a Nikon Microphot fluorescence microscope, a Nikon Plan 40× objective and Fujichrome Sensia 400 ISO film. Exposure times ranged from 2 to 6 s (with neutral density filters) for Hoechst-stained preparations, and from 25 to 40 s for fluoroscein isothiocyanate-stained samples. 35-mm transparencies and autoradiograms were digitized using an Agfa Arcus II scanner. When necessary, digitized images were adjusted for contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop. Drosophila Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells were used for all experiments involving tissue culture cells. Cells were grown in Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 20 μg/ml gentamycin solution (Sigma). Cells were grown at 21-23°C in T-75 tissue culture flasks (for suspension cells; Starstedt). Prior to all experiments, cells at a concentration of 1-1.4 × 107 cells/ml were transferred to 50-ml polypropylene tubes at a volume of 2.5-6.5 ml. Cells were aerated in these tubes by shaking at 175 rpm, 21°C, for 4 or more h prior to the experiment. 21°C controls were prepared by taking cells that had not been subjected to any stress agents, but had undergone the aeration described above. All other cell treatments were also performed after aeration. 36.5°C heat shocks were performed by incubating the cells in the polypropylene tubes in a temperature-controlled circulating water bath (Neslab). Salicylate was added to cells from a 1 M sodium salicylate stock prepared in a physiological Drosophila saline (45 mM potassium glutamate, 45 mM sodium glutamate, 8.7 mM MgSO4, 5.0 mM Bis-Tris, 6.8 mM CaCl2·H2O, 12 g/liter glucose, pH 6.9), to the concentrations indicated in each experiment. 30 mM salicylate plus heat shock experiments were performed by incubating cells in 30 mM salicylate for 5 min at 21°C and then transferring the cells to 36.5°C for the remaining time interval. For experiments studying the effects of protein synthesis inhibition, cycloheximide was added to cells at a concentration of 118 μM 30 min prior to further cell treatments (23Zimarino V. Tsai C. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were continually shaken at 175 rpm during this period. Cells were treated to the conditions described in each experiment. 1-ml aliquots of cells were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 7000 rpm, at 4°C, for 2 min in a Beckman microcentrifuge. Supernatants were aspirated off, and cell pellets were immediately frozen under liquid nitrogen and either stored at −72°C or processed immediately as follows: pellets were thawed by resuspension in five pellet volumes of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5.0% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were then transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube, frozen under liquid nitrogen, and stored at −72°C. An HSE consensus sequence (HSE3; 5′-GGG CGT CAT AGA ATA TTC TCG AAT TCT GGG TCA GG-3′) was annealed to a shorter complimentary oligonucleotide (5′-CC TGA CCC AGA ATT CGA G-3′) and the overhang was filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase with 0.167 mM each of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP; 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN); and 2.5 units of Klenow (New England Biolabs) used in the labeling reaction. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a gel filtration (Sephadex G25, Pharmacia) spin column. Gel shift assays were performed essentially as described in 16Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar. 4 μl of Drosophila SL2 cell extract was mixed with 6.1 μl of reaction mix containing: 4 μl of ddH2O, 1 μl of 10 × buffer mix (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 30% glycerol, w/v), 1 μl of 10 × bovine serum albumin/nucleotide mix (0.5 mg/ml Escherichia coli DNA, 0.2 mg/ml poly-d(N)6, 2 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 0.1 μl of 32P-labeled HSE3 (0.01 pmol). The binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min on ice (0°C) and then 2 μl of 6 × loading dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanole, 30% glycerol (w/v), 3 × TBE) was added. Samples were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel (Seakem ME) for 1.25 h at 82 V in 0.5 × TBE buffer. Gels were blotted and dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and exposed to preflashed Kodak XRP-1 film with a Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screen (DuPont) at −72°C. For SL2 cells, 5 × 107 cells were used for each preparation. After treatment, cells were pelleted and washed once in one volume of Drosophila saline. RNA extractions were performed using the guanidinium/CsCl method for total RNA extraction described in 24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995Google Scholar. For salivary glands, total RNA was extracted from 20 pairs of salivary glands for each treatment studied and glands were treated in the same manner as for immunostaining. RNA was prepared using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. RNA samples were stored at −72°C until use in primer extension analysis. For SL2 cells, 5 or 10 μg of total RNA was lyophilized and resuspended in an 18.5-μl final volume of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 20 units/μl RNAguard (Pharmacia), and 0.1 pmol of 32P-end-labeled hsp 70 oligomer (5′-CCC AGA TCG ATT CCA ATA GCA GGC-3′) and/or H2B oligomer (5′-GCC TTT CCA CTA GTT TTC GGA GGC-3′). For salivary glands, 1 or 2 μg of total RNA was lyophilized and resuspended in 9.25 μl of the above buffer and 0.05 pmol of each oligomer was added. Oligomers (10 pmol) were end labeled using 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to 24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995Google Scholar, followed by removal of unincorporated ATP with a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia) spin column. The reaction was heated to 85°C for 5 min and then transferred to 42°C and incubated overnight (14-18 h). The next morning dNTPs were added to a final concentration of 2 mM, and then 100 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Life Technologies, Inc.) to give a final total volume of 20 μl (or 50 units of reverse transcriptase and a final volume of 10 μl for salivary gland RNA). The reaction was then incubated at 42°C for another 60 min. Primer extension reactions were then ethanol-precipitated with 3 μl of 2 M sodium acetate and 50 μl of 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried. Primer extension products were resuspended in 10 μl of formamide loading dye (Stop solution, U. S. Biochemical Sequenase Rapidwell DNA sequencing kit), denatured by heating to 100°C, and electrophoresed on an 8% PAGE, 7 M urea gel in 1 × TBE, which had been prerun for 30 min at 200 V. Gels were run until the bromphenol blue marker had run 2/3 of the length of the gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed using Kodak XAR5 film at −72°C with a Lightning Plus (DuPont) intensifying screen. The molecular sizes of the hsp 70 and H2B primer extension products were originally determined on large gels (35 × 40 cm) and determined to be 275 bp (for hsp 70) and 78 bp (for H2B), which was in good agreement with the sizes of 270 and 70 bp estimated from the sequences of the genes. All autoradiograms that were to be analyzed by densitometry were prepared on Kodak XRP-1 film, which had been preflashed with an Amersham Sensitize flash unit to obtain a linear range of exposure. Autoradiograms were digitized using an Agfa Arcus II scanner. Densitometric analysis was performed using the profile analyst feature of the Molecular Analyst software program (Bio-Rad). For the EMSA assays, HSF binding activity was expressed as a percentage of the heat shock (36.5°C) cell sample. For the primer extension assays, the hsp 70 signal intensities were first normalized using the H2B signals. These normalized values were then used to compare signal intensities between different treatments and the results were expressed as the ratio (fold) of hsp 70 message relative to the control (21°C) level. In some instances no hsp 70 signal was detectable under control conditions, and thus relative amounts could not be calculated. Intracellular ATP was measured using Boehringer Mannheim's Constant Light Source Kit II. Cell extracts were prepared as per the instructions included with the kit. 110 μl of cells (approximately 1 × 106 cells) were added to 1000 μl of boiling 100 mM Tris, pH 7.75, 4 mM EDTA solution. Samples were boiled for 2 min and then centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g and 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and kept at 4°C. For each reading, 100 μl of the extract was added to 100 μl of the luciferase reagent provided in the kit. Readings were taken using a scintillation counter (Wallac model 1409) over 20-s intervals with the windows wide open. All conditions were performed in triplicate. ATP levels were determined with the aid of a standard curve prepared using pure ATP over a 10−5 to 10−9M concentration range. 100 μCi of 32Po phosphate (DuPont NEN) was added to 1 ml of cells at 1.0 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-free M3 medium. Immediately after addition of phosphate, salicylate was added to the cells, or cells were heat-shocked by submersion in a 36.5°C water bath. After the appropriate time interval, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 s. Supernatants were removed, and 10 volumes of TETN400 buffer was added (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 v/v) (25Firestone G.L. Winguth S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Pellets were immediately lysed and resuspended by drawing through a 28.5-gauge needle. Samples were stored at −72°C until processed by immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described in 25Firestone G.L. Winguth S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar with a few modifications. Cell extracts were made using a buffer with increased salt concentration (400 mM NaCl) and thus in order to maintain a 250 mM NaCl concentration, an equal volume of TETN100 (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 v/v) rather than TETN250 was added to each extract for binding reactions to give a final 250 mM NaCl concentration. 1 μl of anti-Drosophila HSF antiserum (943) (22Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) was added to each 100-μl binding reaction, and the entire sample was immunoprecipitated and loaded onto a 8% PAGE gel. HSF has been shown previously to undergo a change in its DNA binding pattern on the polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster third instar salivary gland cells when the larvae are exposed to heat stress (22Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Glands dissected at room temperature showed a diffuse, nonspecific association of presumably inactive HSF with the polytene chromosomes (Fig. 1D). Upon an increase in temperature (for instance, 15 min at 36.5°C), HSF is found localized at numerous specific chromosomal sites (Fig. 1B). Most notably, it is bound to all nine of the heat shock gene sites and has induced the corresponding heat shock puffs. These sites include the hsp 70 gene loci; two copies of hsp 70 are found at 87A and three copies at 87C. In this study we have mostly limited our description on puff sites to the 87C locus, the largest and easiest to identify of the heat shock puffs. It was observed in the present series of experiments that the previously published in vivo (whole larvae) findings could be duplicated in an in vitro (isolated salivary glands) heat shock assay (Fig. 1B). The ability to induce the heat shock response in isolated salivary glands maintained in organ culture allowed for the easy addition of chemical agents. One set of conditions where in vivo and in vitro results did differ was during a prolonged heat shock. A prolonged (60-120 min) in vivo heat shock, resulted in HSF staining returning to a non-shock type staining pattern (Fig. 1E), whereas a prolonged in vitro heat shock resulted in a partial degradation of the salivary gland preparations that proved to be refractory to staining (results not shown). Control (room temperature) glands did not appear to degrade and stained normally during a prolonged incubation in vitro (at least up to 180 min) (see Fig. 1, C and D). The addition of sodium salicylate yielded a temporally different HSF binding pattern and a temporal and qualitatively different heat shock puffing pattern than heat stress. At a concentration of 3 mM, salicylate was found to be able to induce both HSF binding and heat shock puffing in the salivary glands. Within 30 min, binding was consistently evident at high affinity heat shock gene sites (such as the 63BC chromosomal locus, the site of the hsp 82 gene and 87A and 87C) (Fig. 1F). Binding at all of the heat shock puff sites, however, was not observed. By 60 min of induction, however, binding patterns were comparable to those seen in a 15-min heat shock (Fig. 1G). Puffing was also observed at the heat shock loci, although visual examination of the 87C locus suggested that the degree of puffing was noticeably less than that seen in heat shock. Continued exposure past 60 min saw an apparent partial recovery from the response and by 120 min, HSF was bound in considerably lesser amounts, and puffing at the heat shock loci appeared to be diminished (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that a mild response to salicylate occurs at the 3 mM concentration. While HSF activation and heat shock puffing does occur, it does so over a longer time scale and both the intensity of HSF staining and the size of the puffs are less than what a heat shock produces. By comparison, a rapid response was observed with a 10 mM salicylate treatment. The activation and the binding of HSF was observed within 2 min and, similar to heat shock, full binding was evident within 5 to 15 min. While a small degree of puffing was detectable at 87C within 15 min of induction (Fig. 1H), maximal levels were not obtained until 45-60 min of continuous salicylate treatment, and at this point, the degree of puffing and the sites that are puffed (Fig. 1I, but only the 87C puff is identified) was comparable to a 15-min heat shock (Fig. 1B). Thus, the binding of HSF and the activation of heat shock puffing in 10 mM salicylate displays separate kinetics. No recovery of the response was observed at 180 min after induction; full levels of HSF binding and heat shock puffing were still present (data not shown). This differs to what is observed during an in vivo heat shock where HSF binding and heat shock puffs return to an unshocked pattern by 60-120 min (Fig. 1E). A 30 mM salicylate treatment also causes rapid HSF binding kinetics. Within 1-2 min, considerable levels of HSF binding were observed, with full levels apparent after about 5 min (data not shown). Very small or no puffs were detected within 5-15 min of induction, and no further increases in puff size were recorded (Figs. 1J and 2A). As in the case with 10 mM salicylate, recovery from the response was not observed. Similar to a prolonged heat shock, prolonged (60-120 min) exposure to 30 mM salicylate resulted in the partial degradation of the gland and poor staining (data not shown). At optimum time points, all of the concentrations tested displayed similar HSF staining intensities. Although the 30 mM condition appeared to stain brighter, this was likely due to the absence of puffs causing a condensation, and thus a concentration, of intensity in the staining region. To investigate the possibility that high amounts of salicylate might be inhibitory toward heat shock gene transcription, glands were incubated first for 15 min in 30 mM salicylate and were then heat-shocked in the presence of salicylate. The results of this experiment show that heat shock-induced puffing is indeed prevented in the presence of 30 mM salicylate (Fig. 2B). In a similar experiment, glands were treated for 15 min in 30 mM salicylate and then heat-shocked in the absence of salicylate. Under these conditions, full HSF binding and puffing patterns were observed (Fig. 2C). These res"

The level of αB crystallin returned to near the control level within two subsequent days of culture in the normal medium. Northern blot analysis showed that the accumulation of αB crystallin was preceded by an increase in the level of the mRNA for αB crystallin. Nuclear run-off transcription assays showed that colchicine induced new synthesis of mRNA for αB crystallin. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that αB crystallin accumulated in the peripheral areas of cells, as did the depolymerized tubulin, after several hours of treatment with colcemid, and then it gradually became more conspicuous in the cytoplasm. Vinblastine and nocodazole, which also promote the disassembly of microtubules by binding to tubulins, also induced the synthesis of αB crystallin. Furthermore, induction of αB crystallin by these drugs was observed in quiescent cells that had been cultured in serum-free medium. However, taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing antimitotic agent, did not stimulate the synthesis of αB crystallin, but rather, it suppressed the induction of synthesis of αB crystallin by the microtubule-disrupting drugs. Induction of αB crystallin by colchicine or by other drugs that promote the disassembly of microtubules was sensitive to staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases, and the induction was completely suppressed in the presence of 10 nM staurosporine. These results suggest that the expression of αB crystallin is stimulated, via phosphorylation reactions that are sensitive to staurosporine, when the depolymerization of microtubules is enhanced.

However, increases in the level of expression of αB crystallin have also been observed in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts upon exposure to dexamethasone (11Aoyama A. Fröhli E. Schäfer R. Klemenz R. Mol.

Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), αB crystallin accumulates destructively in astrocytes. However, the cause of the abnormal expression and accumulation of αB crystallin in these patients is not known. It has also been shown that the expression of stress proteins is under the control of the cell cycle and that the transcription of genes for HSP70 (18Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9517-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and HSP90 (19Jérôme V. Vourc'h C. Baulieu E. Catelli M-G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) increases during the synthetic (S) phase of the cell cycle.We report here that agents that promote the depolymerization of microtubules also induce the synthesis and accumulation of αB crystallin, but not of HSP27 and HSP70, in rat C6 glioma cells in culture and that this process is sensitive to staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases.DISCUSSIONThe expression of HSP70 (18Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9517-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and HSP90 (19Jérôme V. Vourc'h C. Baulieu E. Catelli M-G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is regulated during the cell cycle, and the levels of mRNAs for HSP70 and HSP90 increase rapidly upon entry of cells into the S phase, declining by the late S and G2 phases. The levels of αB crystallin in C6 cells were significantly elevated during the growing phase (50-100 ng/mg of protein), as compared with those in confluent cultures (<10 ng/mg of protein). Therefore, the possible regulation of the expression of αB crystallin during the cell cycle was examined by the exposure of C6 cells to various inhibitors. Among the inhibitors tested, drugs that promote the disassembly of the microtubule by binding to tubulin and that interrupt the cell cycle at the early M phase induced the accumulation of αB crystallin but not that of HSP27 and HSP70. However, the induction of αB crystallin by these drugs was also observed in quiescent cultures of cells without serum and, moreover, the level of αB crystallin barely increased in cells during synchronous culture in normal medium. These results suggest that the increased accumulation of αB crystallin was not due to the continuous expression at the early M phase but was due to an unknown mechanism that was not directly related to progression of the cell cycle. Stimulation of the synthesis of αB crystallin was also observed in rat BRL-3A and 3Y-1 cells that had been exposed to 1 μM colchicine (data not shown).It has been reported (31Crossin K.L. Carney D.H. Cell. 1981; 23: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that the depolymerization of microtubules early in the cell cycle is sufficient to initiate DNA synthesis and that colchicine and other drugs that promote the disassembly of microtubules enhance the synthesis of DNA, as does thrombin, a growth factor. However, human thrombin (2 μg/ml), when added to the culture medium of C6 cells with or without serum, did not induce the synthesis of αB crystallin nor did it stimulate the induction by colchicine (data not shown). The induced synthesis of αB crystallin by colcemid or nocodazole was strongly suppressed by taxol, a drug that stabilizes cytoplasmic microtubules and prevents their depolymerization by tubulin-binding antimitotic drugs (32De Brabander M.J. Geuens G. Nuydens R. Willebrords R. De Mey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5608-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The suppressive effect of taxol on the colchicine-inducible response was not as great as its effect on the colcemid- or nocodazole-induced response. This difference was probably due to the low reversibility of the binding of colchicine to tubulin, as compared with that of colcemid (33Banerjee A.C. Bhattacharyya B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 99: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or nocodazole. It is likely that exposure to colcemid or nocodazole increases the pool of free tubulin in cells, whereas taxol reduces the size of this pool by preventing depolymerization. Therefore, it is suggested that the increased depolymerization of microtubules might be a trigger for the increased synthesis of αB crystallin.The results of nuclear run-off assays indicated that the increased synthesis of αB crystallin was a result of the increased rate of transcription of the gene for αB crystallin. The elevated level of αB crystallin protein in cells that had been exposed to colcemid for 24 h decreased rapidly from 24 to 48 h after the addition of cycloheximide or staurosporine (Fig. 7A) and in cultures in the normal medium (Fig. 1A). However, high levels of αB crystallin protein (Fig. 7A) and mRNA (Fig. 7B) were maintained for 24 h even after the addition of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, which completely blocked the induction of αB crystallin when added simultaneously with colcemid. These results suggest that the microtubule-disrupting drugs enhance not only the transcription of the gene for αB crystallin but also the stabilization of the mRNA for αB crystallin in cells.During several hours of exposure of cells to colcemid, the αB crystallin in some cells was colocalized with the depolymerized tubulin in the peripheral areas of cells. However, it remains to be determined whether or not the two proteins are associated under these conditions.The induction of the synthesis of αB crystallin by colchicine and by other microtubule-disrupting drugs was completely suppressed in the presence of 3-10 nM staurosporine. It has been reported (34Kim S.H. Kim J.H. Erdos G. Lee Y.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the heat-induced synthesis of HSP70 and HSP27 is suppressed in the presence of staurosporine at 2-10 μM, concentrations about 1,000-fold higher than the present effective concentrations. Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinases, with IC50 values of 2.7 nM for protein kinase C, 8.2 nM for protein kinase A, and 6.4 nM for the tyrosine protein kinase p60v−srk (30Tamaoki T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The IC50 value for the colchicine-induced response of αB crystallin was about the same as that for protein kinase C (Fig. 4). However, exposure of cells for 20 h to 0.1 μM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (an activator of protein kinase C), 20 μM forskolin (an activator of protein kinase A), or 30 μM sodium orthovanadate (an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphoprotein phosphatase) did not induce the accumulation of αB crystallin nor did these treatments stimulate the colchicine-induced accumulation of αB crystallin (data not shown).It is not known which protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction cascade of the colchicine-induced response. However, the present results suggest that the synthesis and accumulation of αB crystallin are stimulated, via phosphorylation reactions that are sensitive to staurosporine, when the depolymerization of intracellular microtubules is enhanced. INTRODUCTIONαB crystallin, a major structural protein of vertebrate lenses, is also expressed in various nonlenticular tissues such as central nervous tissues (1Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem.

The expression of αB crystallin in cells and tissues is stimulated under various stressful conditions, as is that of HSP27 1The abbreviations used are: HSP27mammalian small stress protein of 27-28 kDaHSP70inducible mammalian stress protein of 70 kDaHSP90 mammalian stress protein of 90 kDa PBSphosphate-buffered salineSsyntheticMmitotic. and HSP70 (7Klemenz R.

However, increases in the level of expression of αB crystallin have also been observed in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts upon exposure to dexamethasone (11Aoyama A. Fröhli E. Schäfer R. Klemenz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1824-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in dog lens epithelial cells and kidney glomerular endothelial cells in response to hypertonicity (12Dasgupta S. Hohman T.C. Carper D.

Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The increased expression of αB crystallin has also been observed under certain pathologic conditions (2Iwaki T.

Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), αB crystallin accumulates destructively in astrocytes. However, the cause of the abnormal expression and accumulation of αB crystallin in these patients is not known. It has also been shown that the expression of stress proteins is under the control of the cell cycle and that the transcription of genes for HSP70 (18Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9517-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and HSP90 (19Jérôme V. Vourc'h C. Baulieu E. Catelli M-G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) increases during the synthetic (S) phase of the cell cycle.We report here that agents that promote the depolymerization of microtubules also induce the synthesis and accumulation of αB crystallin, but not of HSP27 and HSP70, in rat C6 glioma cells in culture and that this process is sensitive to staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases."

GlcNα-PI(C8) was acylated in an manner requiring acyl-CoA. Thus, the process involving acyl-CoA reported for yeast has been conserved in mammals. Furthermore, both GlcNα-PI(C8) and GlcNα-acyl-PI(C8) could be mannosylated in vitro, but mannosylation of the latter was significantly more efficient. This provides direct support for the earlier suggestion that acylation precedes mannosylation in rodents cells. A similar result was also observed with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannosyltransferase.In contrast, it has been reported that mannosylation of endogenous GlcNα-PI by Trypansoma brucei membranes occurs without prior acylation. The same result was obtained with GlcNα-PI(C8), confirming that the mannosyltransferase of trypanosomes is divergent from those in yeasts and rodents.

In vivo, it is important that the substrate specificities and activities of these enzymes are stringently regulated.

A variant of the T-cell phosphatase, named PTP-S (protein tyrosine phosphatase of spleen) was isolated by us from rat spleen cDNA library, which differs from the former in its C-terminal non-catalytic domain (16Swarup G. Kamatkar S. Radha V. Rema V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mouse and human variants of TC PTP have also been isolated (17Champion-Arnaud P. Gensel M.C. Foulkes N. Ronsin C. Sassone-Corsi P. Breathnech R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1203-1209PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mosinger Jr., B. Tillmann U. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently shown that four different forms of PTP-S (named PTP-S1, PTP-S2, PTP-S3, and PTP-S4), which arise due to alternative splicing (19Reddy R.S. Swarup G. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), are expressed in rat cells. PTP-S1 is the same as PTP-S, described previously. PTP-S4 is very similar to the human T-cell phosphatase or p48TC (15Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PTP-S2 is a polypeptide of 382 amino acids and is very similar to human p45TC or mouse homolog MPTP (17Champion-Arnaud P. Gensel M.C. Foulkes N. Ronsin C. Sassone-Corsi P. Breathnech R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1203-1209PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mosinger Jr., B. Tillmann U. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PTP-S1 and PTP-S3 are minor forms and are expressed in rat and mouse cells but not in human cells, due to loss of an internal splice site by mutation (19Reddy R.S. Swarup G. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The last 6 amino acids of PTP-S2 are replaced by 34 amino acids (mostly hydrophobic) in PTP-S4. Previously it has been shown that PTP-S1 binds to nonspecific DNA through the C-terminal 57 amino acids (10Radha V. Kamatkar S. Swarup G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which are present in PTP-S2 as well. Very little is known about the cellular function of any isoform of PTP-S. Mitogenic stimulation of a wide variety of cells such as T-lymphocytes, HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and liver cells results in an increase in mRNA levels during G1 phase, raising the possibility of a role in cell proliferation (20Rajendrakumar G.V. Radha V. Swarup G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J.

In these studies individual isoforms were not analyzed; therefore, it is not known whether one or more isoforms are induced by mitogens. Major protein products of this PTP, recognized by a monoclonal antibody, are present in the cell nucleus largely in association with chromatin in rat fibroblasts (3Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mouse homolog MPTP is localized in the nucleus in transfected cells (22Tillmann U. Wagner J. Boerboom D. Westphal H. Tremblay L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3030-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two splice variants of human T-cell PTP p45TC and p48TC have different subcellular locations in transfected cells; their enzymatic and other molecular properties have not been examined (23Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the DNA binding properties of the two major splice variants, PTP-S2 and PTP-S4, determined their subcellular location, and also studied their enzymatic and other molecular properties. Our results show that although there is only a small difference in the primary structure of these two proteins, their substrate specificity, subcellular location, and other molecular properties are quite different. PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 cDNAs, described previously, were cloned by amplifying mRNA using reverse transcription and PCR (19Reddy R.S. Swarup G. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These were cloned in the BamHI site of plasmid vector pET-3a (24Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D. Lin S. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) for expression of the protein in Escherichia coli. Deletion of the C-terminal end of PTP-S4 was created by amplifying the desired region (amino acids 1-376) by PCR using sense primer RR11 (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCGGCTACCATCGAGCGG-3′) and antisense primer SK6 (5′-CGGGATCCTCACCTTTTCCTTTTCCGTTCAGTTTC-3′) with BamHI sites. The resulting cDNA was digested with BamHI, cloned in pUC18, sequenced, and then cloned in pET-3a. This construct named ΔPTP-S4 gives rise to a protein lacking the C-terminal 34 amino acids of PTP-S4 (Fig. 1D). These cDNAs were also cloned in pCB6 vector in the BglII site for expressing in eukaryotic cells. This vector drives the expression using cytomegalovirus promoter (25Brewer C.B. Roth M.G Methods in Cell Biology; Protein Expression in Animal Cells. Vol 43. Academic Press Inc., New York1994: 233Google Scholar). Two deletion mutants of PTP-S2 lacking the C-terminal 40 or 68 amino acids (Δ40 PTP-S2 and Δ68 PTP-S2) were made by amplifying the required region by PCR using appropriate primers. BL-21 (DE3) was transformed by the pET expression plasmids, and proteins were expressed by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (10Radha V. Kamatkar S. Swarup G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared, and DNA binding experiments by Southwestern blotting were carried out as described (10Radha V. Kamatkar S. Swarup G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Bacterial cell lysates expressing PTP-S2, PTP-S4, ΔPTP-S4, or uninduced controls were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, proteins transferred to Immobilon P membranes, and incubated with 32P-labeled DNA, after renaturing/blocking overnight. Single-stranded probe was made by heating the double-stranded labeled probe at 100°C for 10 min and then cooling on ice immediately. Nuclear matrix was prepared as described previously (26Klempnauer K.-H. Sippel A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The nuclear matrix preparation was suspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) containing 150 mM NaCl, and incubated on ice for 30 min with various amounts of either PTP-S2, PTP-S4, or ΔPTP-S4 (or control buffer). These samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. The pellet was washed three times with buffer A containing 400 mM NaCl, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and fractionated on SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with PTP-S monoclonal antibody. HeLa or COS-1 cells grown as monolayers on coverslips or Petri dishes to about 70% confluence were used for transient transfection using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. For better expression, 16 h before fixing the cells for immunofluorescence, sodium butyrate was added to the medium to a final concentration of 5 mM. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence as described earlier (3Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using anti-PTP-S monoclonal antibody. For obtaining stable cell lines expressing PTP-S2, HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmid pCB6-PTP-S2 using Lipofectin reagent. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were replated into medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks, neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and checked for PTP-S2 protein expression by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Subcellular fractionation of stably transfected clone D3 expressing PTP-S2 or COS-1 cells transiently transfected with PTP-S4 was carried out essentially as described (3Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Klempnauer K.-H. Sippel A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). E. coli cells carrying the appropriate expression plasmid were induced in the mid log phase with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. Cells from 45 ml of induced culture were suspended in 15 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.025% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 200 mM NaCl) and incubated for 30 min at 25°C. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-75 column (1.6 × 65 cm) equilibrated with column buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.1, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.025% 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). PTP-S4 was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column under the same conditions. Column fractions were assayed for enzyme activity using pNPP as substrate. Peak fractions were stored in aliquots at −70°C. The columns were calibrated with Pharmacia molecular weight markers. The position of markers was determined by analyzing the column fractions by SDS-PAGE. The marker proteins used were catalase (232,000), aldolase (158,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), and chymotrypsinogen (25,000). PTP assay was carried out as described (28Swarup G. Subrahmanyam G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7801-7808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using poly(Glu4,Tyr1) or MBP as substrate. MBP (Sigma) was phosphorylated using a tyrosine kinase from rat spleen in the same manner as described for the phosphorylation of poly(Glu4,Tyr1) previously (28Swarup G. Subrahmanyam G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7801-7808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PTP assay buffer contained 25 mM Tris, pH 7.1, 20 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.005% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol, and indicated amounts of substrate. After incubating for 5 min at 30°C, the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid. Assay with pNPP was also carried out under the same conditions as described (28Swarup G. Subrahmanyam G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7801-7808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partial hepatectomy, RNA isolation from liver biopsies, and quantitation of PTP-S transcripts by RNA-PCR was performed essentially as described earlier, using the primers RR6, RR7, and RR8 for 28 cycles (19Reddy R.S. Swarup G. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J. Biosci. 1995; 20: 461-471Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The PTP-S mRNAs were coamplified with the mRNA for GAPDH as control for 23 cycles (which is within the logarithmic scale of amplification for GAPDH mRNA; data not shown). For this purpose, the primers RR15 (5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTA-3′) and RR17 (5′-ACCTTGCCACAGCCTTGGCAG-3′), designed for amplifying nucleotides 97-653 of rat and human GAPDH cDNAs (29Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), were added at the end of fifth cycle after starting the amplification of PTP-S mRNAs. In each reaction during amplification, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP was included. In order to analyze the DNA binding and enzymatic properties, PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 were expressed in E. coli using the T7 promoter-based expression system (Fig. 1A). These two proteins were enzymatically active and could dephosphorylate 32P-labeled poly(Glu4,Tyr1) and pNPP. DNA binding properties of PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 were examined by Southwestern blotting using 32P-labeled nonspecific DNA (pUC18). PTP-S2 could bind to double-stranded as well as single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 2). Surprisingly, PTP-S4 did not show any interaction with DNA (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 3) even after longer exposure (data not shown). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 in the C-terminal region (Fig. 1D) suggests that either the last 6 amino acids of PTP-S2 are critical for DNA binding or the last 34 amino acids of PTP-S4 are inhibiting interaction with DNA. Therefore, we made a vector expressing a truncated form of PTP-S4 lacking the C-terminal 34 amino acids (Fig. 1A, lane 4). This protein showed PTP activity and could interact with double-stranded as well as single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 4). This suggests that C-terminal 34 amino acids inhibit interaction of PTP-S4 with nonspecific DNA. The C-terminal 6 amino acids of PTP-S2 do not appear to be critical for interaction with DNA, although they contribute to some extent to this interaction (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 2 and 4). Human T-cell phosphatase (p48TC) expressed in E. coli did not show any interaction with DNA, but a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 34 amino acids showed interaction with DNA as determined by Southwestern blotting (data not shown). Subcellular location of these proteins was examined in transfected cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, using a monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal antibody, which has been characterized previously (3Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), recognized rat and mouse PTP-S proteins but not the human protein from HeLa cells, as determined by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblot analysis (data not shown). This antibody could interact with PTP-S2 as well as PTP-S4. Transfected HeLa cells showed that PTP-S2 was present mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 2B), whereas PTP-S4 showed prominent perinuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2D). In addition, the cells transfected with PTP-S4 plasmid showed a distinct reticular pattern of staining of the area surrounding the nucleus extending throughout the cytoplasm. Except for the nuclear membrane, no prominent staining was visible within the nucleus (Fig. 2D). This pattern of staining suggests that PTP-S4 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane. In order to determine the role of the C-terminal hydrophobic domain in subcellular localization, HeLa cells were transfected with a vector carrying ΔPTP-S4 cDNA. This protein localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2F) like the PTP-S2 isoform, showing that the C-terminal 34 amino acids prevent PTP-S4 from entering the nucleus or are essential for its cytoplasmic localization. Within the nucleus, PTP-S2 as well as ΔPTP-S4 showed more prominent staining of nucleoli (Fig. 2, B and F). To further investigate and confirm the subcellular distribution of PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 the cells were subjected to biochemical fractionation and the distribution of protein was determined by immunoblotting. For this purpose a stable cell line (D3) of HeLa cells expressing rat PTP-S2 was obtained. No stable transfectant of HeLa cells expressing PTP-S4 could be obtained, in spite of repeated efforts. Therefore for PTP-S4, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were used for biochemical fractionation, where the transfection efficiency was higher (20-30% as compared to 1-3% of HeLa cells) with a much higher level of protein expression. Cells were fractionated into a nuclear and post-nuclear fraction by the detergent lysis method. PTP-S2 was present in both the nuclear and post-nuclear fractions, whereas PTP-S4 was enriched in the post-nuclear fraction (Fig. 3, B and D). The nuclei were further fractionated into chromatin fraction, a high salt-extractable fraction, and the residual insoluble pellet called the nuclear matrix. It was observed that PTP-S2 was predominantly associated with the chromatin fraction, and a very small amount was present in the nuclear matrix (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, little PTP-S4 was present in the nuclear fraction, most of which was associated with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 3, E and F). In the immunofluorescence staining experiment, very little extranuclear staining could be seen in PTP-S2 transfected cells, while this protein was present in the post nuclear supernatant after cellular fractionation. This may be due to leakage of the protein from the nuclei when the cells are lysed in the presence of detergent, which is also likely to remove the outer nuclear membrane. We examined whether bacterially expressed purified PTP-S2 or PTP-S4 could interact with the nuclear matrix isolated from rat fibroblasts. Accordingly, nuclear matrix preparation was incubated with different amounts of PTP-S2 or PTP-S4 (or control buffer) at 0°C for 30 min; after washing three times with buffer containing 400 mM NaCl, bound PTP-S proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 4B, PTP-S4 could interact with isolated nuclear matrix strongly, whereas PTP-S2 showed only a weak interaction. The truncated PTP-S4 protein lacking the C-terminal 34 amino acids showed only a weak interaction with nuclear matrix as compared with full-length PTP-S4 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the C-terminal 34 amino acid fragment of PTP-S4 is required for interaction with the nuclear matrix. In order to examine the enzymatic and molecular properties of these two PTPs, bacterially expressed PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 were chromatographed on a Sephadex G-75 column. PTP-S2 eluted as a monomer at the expected elution volume (Fig. 5A). However, PTP-S4 eluted in the void volume, suggesting that it was forming a high molecular weight complex (Fig. 5B). The apparent molecular weight of PTP-S4 by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 column was estimated to be about 200,000, suggesting that it forms a tetramer. Truncated PTP-S4 lacking the C-terminal 34 amino acids eluted at the expected position as a monomer (Fig. 5C). These observations suggest that the C-terminal 34 amino acid region is required for oligomerization of PTP-S4. All the three G-75 purified PTPs: PTP-S2, PTP-S4, and ΔPTP-S4 (Fig. 5D), were recognized by the monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5E) against PTP-S. Both PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 were inhibited by a micromolar concentration of orthovanadate, a known inhibitor of most of the PTPs (10Radha V. Kamatkar S. Swarup G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Swarup G. Subrahmanyam G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7801-7808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 was determined in vitro by using poly(Glu4,Tyr1) and MBP as substrate. PTP-S2 preferentially dephosphorylated poly(Glu4,Tyr1), whereas PTP-S4 preferred MBP as substrate (Fig. 6). The difference in the substrate specificity is also seen from the Vmax and Km of these two isoforms for the two substrates, as shown in Table I. With MBP as substrate, the enzymatic properties of these two enzymes are easily distinguishable. PTP-S4 shows strong preference for the basic protein, MBP (higher Vmax, lower Km, Table I). Removal of the C-terminal 34 amino acids of PTP-S4 results in a phosphatase that shows a 4-fold decrease in Vmax and 27-fold increase in Km for MBP as substrate (Table I). With pNPP as substrate, there was very little difference in the enzymatic properties of these forms of PTP-S (Table I).Table IEnzymatic properties of PTP-S2, PTP-S4, and deletion mutantsSubstrateEnzymeKmVmaxμmnmol min−1 mg−11.

Both of these mutants showed increased activity toward poly(Glu4,Tyr1) as substrate but their activity toward MBP was not increased (Table I). In order to determine the relative levels of these two mRNAs, reverse transcription coupled with PCR was used. In each PCR reaction, the levels of GAPDH mRNA was also determined by including appropriate primers. Since GAPDH mRNA levels are relatively constant in many tissues, this was used as a reference for quantitation. Amplification of PTP-S2 as well as PTP-S4 was linear up to 28 cycles (data not shown). The highest level of PTP-S2 mRNA was found in the rat spleen (Table II). PTP-S4 level was generally 4-10 times lower as compared to PTP-S2. Comparison of the levels in different tissues and cells involves the assumption that the GAPDH expression is the same in all these cells. However, this assumption is not required for the quantitation of relative levels of the isoforms in a given tissue or cell. PTP-S1 and PTP-S3 mRNAs could be detected in rat tissues and cell lines, but their levels were less than 5% of PTP-S2 levels (data not shown).Table II.Relative levels of PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 mRNAsTissue/cell lineSpecies/typeRelative level of PTP-S isoformsPTP-S2aRelative mRNA levels are expressed as percentage of PTP-S2 in spleen.PTP-S4aRelative mRNA levels are expressed as percentage of PTP-S2 in spleen.SpleenRat10027ThymusRat8620TestisRat4410BrainRat4712LiverRat183F111Rat fibroblast4210Rat2Rat fibroblast4611HeLaHuman epithelial208CCRFHuman lymphoma165A375Human melanoma7113SW620Human colon cancer475M14Human melanoma305MDA-MB-453Human breast cancer173SNB19Human central nervous system121A549Human lung cancer121a Relative mRNA levels are expressed as percentage of PTP-S2 in spleen. Open table in a new tab Mitogenic stimulation of various cells leads to increase in mRNA levels of PTP-S (20Rajendrakumar G.V. Radha V. Swarup G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J. Biosci. 1995; 20: 461-471Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Tillmann U. Wagner J. Boerboom D. Westphal H. Tremblay L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3030-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, since full-length cDNA probes were used for Northern blot or dot blot analysis, in these studies it is not known whether one form or both the major forms are induced by mitogens. Using quantitative PCR methods, we observed that both PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 are induced during rat liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (Fig. 7). Relative quantitation of these isoforms showed that PTP-S4 was induced somewhat more than PTP-S2 isoform. As a control, expression of GAPDH mRNA was also analyzed during liver regeneration, which showed a small increase (about 3-4-fold) over control liver. Increase in level of GAPDH mRNA during liver regeneration has been reported earlier (31Loyer P. Glaise D. Cariou S. Baffet G. Meijer L. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2491-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA it was found that both PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 still showed 5-6-fold increase in their levels after 6 h of partial hepatectomy. To our knowledge, PTP-S is the first PTP that has been shown to generate, by alternative splicing, two forms with inherent differences in their substrate specificity. These forms differ in their enzymatic activity toward phosphorylated protein substrates but not with pNPP as substrate, suggesting thereby that the amino acid residues in the non-catalytic domain are important in determining the interaction with polypeptide substrates even in vitro. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that deletion of C-terminal amino acids of PTP-S2 results in much higher activity toward poly(Glu4,Tyr1) as substrate, but the activity toward MBP does not increase. Previously it has been reported that alternative splicing generates two forms of a PTP in Drosophila (dPTP61F), which show different subcellular location (nucleus and mitochondria) but show similar phosphatase activity as judged by the use of pNPP as substrate (14McLaughlin S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6839-6842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of these forms was not compared using polypeptide substrates. The most unexpected observation we have made is that PTP-S4 does not interact with nonspecific DNA in vitro although it has the DNA binding domain that is present in PTP-S2. The DNA binding potential of PTP-S4 is revealed by deleting the C-terminal 34 amino acids. Our results suggest that the C-terminal 34 amino acids are likely to fold in such a manner that it would make the basic DNA binding domain of PTP-S4 inaccessible for interaction with nonspecific DNA. This “masking” of basic domain, physically or functionally, may allow interaction of a basic substrate (such as MBP) with the acidic domain that precedes the basic domain. Such a model would predict that the deletion of basic domain of PTP-S2 would increase enzyme activity with MBP as substrate but not with poly(Glu4,Tyr1). However, deletion of basic domain of PTP-S2 resulted in an enzyme with increased activity toward poly(Glu4,Tyr1) but not with MBP. Therefore, it seems possible that the C-terminal 34 amino acid domain may be directly involved in the binding of the basic substrate (e.g. by providing contact points), in addition to masking the basic domain of PTP-S4. PTP-S2 localizes in the cell nucleus largely in association with chromatin, although a small amount is associated with the nuclear matrix. The DNA binding property of PTP-S2 suggests that its association with chromatin may be through direct interaction with DNA. The human equivalent of PTP-S2, p45TC, was found to be a nuclear protein by immunostaining (23Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Upon cell lysis, however, p45TC fractionates as a soluble protein. This is likely to be due to the use of hypotonic buffer with EDTA (without divalent ions) for cell lysis; under these conditions, nuclei are not likely to be intact (23Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, PTP-S2 shows more prominent nucleolar staining in transfected cells. A similar pattern has been observed for the mouse homolog (22Tillmann U. Wagner J. Boerboom D. Westphal H. Tremblay L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3030-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The human homolog of PTP-S2, however, showed no staining in the nucleolus (23Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We observed that untransfected HeLa cells stained with a polyclonal anti-PTP-S antibody showed prominent nuclear staining, but the nucleolus was not stained (data not shown). This suggests that a signal for nucleolar localization may be present in rat and mouse PTP-S2, but it may be nonfunctional (or absent) in the human homolog. PTP-S4 localizes mainly in the cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes. Its staining pattern is very similar to that of human T-cell phosphatase (p48TC), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane (23Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Faure R. Posner B.I. Glia. 1993; 9: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another related phosphatase, PTP-1B, has been shown to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6Woodford-Thomas T.A. Rhodes J.D. Dixon J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The staining pattern of PTP-S4 differs from that of PTP-1B in having prominent staining of nuclear membrane. Interaction of PTP-S4 with nuclear matrix is much stronger than that of PTP-S2 and requires the C-terminal 34-amino acid domain. The association of PTP-S4 with nuclear matrix is of particular interest, since this subnuclear structure is involved in several nuclear functions such as DNA replication, transcription, etc. (33Pienta K.J. Partin A.W. Coffey D.S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2525-2532PubMed Google Scholar). Recently tyrosine kinase activity has been found in the nuclear matrix, which shows cell cycle-dependent changes that are maximal during G1/S transition (27Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the tyrosine kinases found tightly associated with nuclear matrix is Lyn, a member of the Src family (27Radha V. Nambirajan S. Swarup G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that PTP-S mRNA levels increase upon mitogenic stimulation of T lymphocytes and that the increase is due to post-transcriptional stabilization of mRNA in the stimulated cells (20Rajendrakumar G.V. Radha V. Swarup G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PTP-S mRNA was superinduced in lymphocytes in the presence of cycloheximide (20Rajendrakumar G.V. Radha V. Swarup G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both the major isoforms, PTP-S2 and PTP-S4, are induced upon mitogenic stimulation of liver cells (this study). The timing of induction of PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 suggests that these are delayed early genes. Higashitsuji et al. (34Higashitsuji H. Arii S. Furutani M. Imamura M. Kaneko Y. Takenawa J. Nakayama H. Fugita J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that during mouse liver regeneration, PTP-PEST and PTP-RL9 (a novel intracellular phosphatase) are induced to peak levels at 6 h after partial hepatectomy, while another enzyme, PTP-RL10, increases and peaks only after the first round of cell division, i.e. 48-72 h. PRL-1, MKP-1, Pac-1, and VH1 family members are examples of tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases that behave as immediate early genes upon mitogenic stimulation (35Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Rohan P.J. Davis P. Maskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siebenlist U. Kelly K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1156-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Upon growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells, one of the isoforms of PTP-1B is induced, reaching peak levels by late G1, but the generation of this isoform requires protein synthesis (38Shifrin V.I. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25376-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different PTPs show distinct pattern of induction in response to mitogenic stimulation, but their role in cell proliferation remains to be elucidated. We thank Drs. D. Balasubramanian and U. Srinivas for critical reading of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2075025406,"Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) on the mucosal mast cell line, RBL-2H3, results in the rapid and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav. Immunoprecipitation of Vav from activated cells revealed co-immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins of molecular weights identical to the FcϵRI β and γ chains, and the former was reactive with antibody to the FcϵRI β chain. Conversely, Western blots revealed the presence of p95 Vav in FcϵRI immunoprecipitates. The association of Vav and of Grb2 with the receptor was found to be regulated by aggregation of the receptor, and the interaction of Vav with the FcϵRI was localized to the γ chain. To gain insight on the signaling pathway in which Vav participates, we investigated the in vivo associations of Vav with other molecules. A reducible chemical cross-linking agent was used to covalently maintain protein interactions under nonreducing conditions. A fraction of Vav increased in mass to form a complex of >300 kDa in molecular mass. Under reducing conditions the cross-linked Vav immunoprecipitates showed the presence of Grb2, Raf-1, and p42mapk (ERK2). In vitro kinase assays of Raf-1 activity associated with Vav revealed that this complex had an activity greater than that of Raf-1 derived from nonactivated cells, and aggregation of the FcϵRI did not modulate this activity. In contrast, aggregation of the FcϵRI increased the total Raf-1 activity by 2-5-fold. These results demonstrate that Vav associates constitutively with components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to form an active multimeric signaling complex whose in vivo activity and associations may be directed by aggregation of the FcϵRI. The findings of this study may also be relevant to other members of the immune recognition receptor family that share the T-cell antigen receptor ζ/γ chains. Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) on the mucosal mast cell line, RBL-2H3, results in the rapid and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav. Immunoprecipitation of Vav from activated cells revealed co-immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins of molecular weights identical to the FcϵRI β and γ chains, and the former was reactive with antibody to the FcϵRI β chain. Conversely, Western blots revealed the presence of p95 Vav in FcϵRI immunoprecipitates. The association of Vav and of Grb2 with the receptor was found to be regulated by aggregation of the receptor, and the interaction of Vav with the FcϵRI was localized to the γ chain. To gain insight on the signaling pathway in which Vav participates, we investigated the in vivo associations of Vav with other molecules. A reducible chemical cross-linking agent was used to covalently maintain protein interactions under nonreducing conditions. A fraction of Vav increased in mass to form a complex of >300 kDa in molecular mass. Under reducing conditions the cross-linked Vav immunoprecipitates showed the presence of Grb2, Raf-1, and p42mapk (ERK2). In vitro kinase assays of Raf-1 activity associated with Vav revealed that this complex had an activity greater than that of Raf-1 derived from nonactivated cells, and aggregation of the FcϵRI did not modulate this activity. In contrast, aggregation of the FcϵRI increased the total Raf-1 activity by 2-5-fold. These results demonstrate that Vav associates constitutively with components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to form an active multimeric signaling complex whose in vivo activity and associations may be directed by aggregation of the FcϵRI. The findings of this study may also be relevant to other members of the immune recognition receptor family that share the T-cell antigen receptor ζ/γ chains. Antigen triggering of mast cells and basophils via cell-bound immunoglobulin E (IgE) stimulates the activity of serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases leading to phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates (1Benhamou M.

A critical step in the antigen activation of mast cells is the phosphorylation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) 1The abbreviations used are: FcϵRIthe high affinity receptor for IgEDNP-BSAdinitrophenyl25-bovine serum albuminDTSSP3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate]GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorRas-GAPRas-GTPase activating proteinMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular-regulated protein kinaseCAPS3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acidITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifGSTglutathione S-transferaseMEKMAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. on both the β and γ chains of the tetrameric receptor (αβγγ) (3Quarto R.

A number of molecules that participate either in the phosphorylation of the receptor or of other substrates, in response to aggregation of the receptor, have been identified. These include p56lyn (Lyn), pp60src (Src), p72syk (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and PKC-δ (5Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 6Hutchcroft J.E. Geahlen R.L. Deanin G.G. Oliver J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence has been presented for the recruitment of some of these molecules to the receptor, in response to the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM, 9) present on the β and γ chains of this receptor. Benhamou and colleagues (10Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the association of the Syk with the γ chain as being dependent on the state of phosphorylation of the receptor. The src family kinase Lyn was found to associate with the FcϵRI (5Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and further recruitment of this kinase is dependent on aggregation of the receptor (11Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In general, these studies develop a theme analogous to growth factor receptors whereby phosphorylation of the receptor is critical for its ability to recruit molecules that link receptors to downstream effectors (12Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). the high affinity receptor for IgE dinitrophenyl25-bovine serum albumin 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate] guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ras-GTPase activating protein mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular-regulated protein kinase 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif glutathione S-transferase MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In the mast cell one potential downstream effector is Vav, a hematopoietic cell-specific protein that exhibits high homology to guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) proteins (13Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar). Vav is expressed as a p95 proto-oncogene product or a p85 oncogenic product (14Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The homology of the Vav with other members of the GEF family suggests that Vav may regulate guanine nucleotide exchange on the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins (13Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar). However, in T and B lymphocytes Vav was reported to exhibit an increased GDP exchange activity directed toward Ras (15Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Gulbins E. Langlet C. Baier G. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Herbert E. Altman A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2123-2129PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies suggest that Vav does not exhibit direct exchange activity toward Ras but requires Ras activity to demonstrate its phenotype (17Bustelo X.R. Suen K.-L. Leftheris K. Meyers C.A. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2405-2413PubMed Google Scholar). Whether Vav has intrinsic GEF activity toward Ras, or any other GTP-binding protein, or if its association with a GEF expressed in hematopoietic cells (18Clevenger C.V. Ngo W. Sokol D.L. Luger S.M. Gewirtz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13246-13253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) accounts for the exhibited GEF activity is still unclear. Nevertheless, Vav has been shown to form a complex with a variety of proteins including ZAP 70, Grb2, and the RNA-binding protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (19Katzav S. Sutherland M. Packham G. Yi T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32579-32585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20225-20228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These associations may be important to its role in development of T and B cells as well as in T-cell antigen receptor signaling (22Zhang R. Alt F.W. Davidson L. Orkin S.H. Swat W. Nature. 1995; 374: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Fischer K.-D. Zmuidzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Guidos C. Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 45Tarakhousky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In contrast, other hematopoietic cells including cells of mast cell lineage appear to develop normally from progenitor cells that lack Vav (24Zmuidzinas A. Fischer K.-D. Lira S.A. Forrester L. Bryant S. Bernstein A. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that Vav might serve a different role in mast cells or, alternatively, other proteins might compensate for Vav signaling in these cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95 Vav in response to aggregation of the FcϵRI (25Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) suggests a role for this protein in receptor-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. The phosphorylation of Vav has been linked to the expression of Syk kinase activity in the mucosal mast cell model, RBL-2H3 (26Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since Syk is recruited to the FcϵRI upon its aggregation (10Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated whether a potential downstream effector such as Vav could associate with the receptor and might this association be regulated by aggregation of the receptor. Furthermore, to gain insights as to the signaling pathway in which Vav participates in mast cells, we analyzed which proteins complex with Vav in vivo and determined if kinase activity is associated with Vav. Anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-specific mouse monoclonal IgE (27Liu F.-T. Bohn J.W. Ferry E.L. Yamamoto H. Molinaro C.A. Sherman L.A. Klinman N.R. Katz D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2728-2737PubMed Google Scholar) was purified as described previously (28Holowka D. Metzger H. Mol. Immunol. 1982; 19: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgE was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The monoclonal antibody to the FcϵRI β chain (mAbβ JRK) was purified as described (29Rivera J. Kinet J.-P. Kim J. Pucillo C. Metzger H. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 647-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive to ERK1 or ERK2, Grb2, MEK1, Pan Ras, PLCγ, Shc, Sos 1/2, Rac1/2, Raf-1/2, Ras-GAP, p56lyn, ZAP 70, RhoA, RhoB, Rho-GAP were purchased from either Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, or Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Vav, raised to either a peptide corresponding to amino acids 528-541 of human Vav or to a 20.6-kDa fragment of human Vav (amino acids 620-797), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech or Transduction Laboratories, respectively. A mouse monoclonal antibody to Vav raised to a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein of full-length human Vav was purchased from Upstate Biotech. Rabbit antisera to Syk was kindly provided by Dr. R. Siraganian (NIDR, NIH). Purified normal rabbit or goat IgG was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA. The 2H3 subline of RBL cells was cultured as a monolayer in stationary flasks essentially as described (30Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). For experiments the cells were sensitized with 125I-labeled or unlabeled dinitrophenyl-specific mouse monoclonal IgE (as indicated) at 2.5 μg/ml for 5 × 106 cells/ml for 1 h at room temperature or by addition directly to the culture flask of 1 μg/ml overnight at 37°C. Cells in modified Tyrode's buffer (31Furuichi K. Rivera J. Isersky C. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1513-1520PubMed Google Scholar) were activated by incubation with 0.4-1.0 μg/ml dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) at 37°C for 3 min or for the indicated time. Activation was stopped by the immediate addition of a 2 × ice-cold lysis buffer (see below). For some experiments cells in media were activated as above, and activation was quenched by addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed. For studies to analyze the association of Vav with receptor, 0.5-5.0 × 107 cells previously labeled with 125I-IgE were solubilized at a final concentration of 0.0625% Triton X-100 (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) for 5 × 106 cells. All solutions contained protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described (32Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11446-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Solubilization was for 1 h at 4°C which allowed for recovery of greater than 95% of the nonaggregated and DNP-BSA-aggregated receptor. Soluble cell lysates were recovered after a 15-min microcentrifugation at 13,000 × g. Lysates were treated with protein G or protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. The cleared lysates were subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse IgE (10-20 μl) or with 10 μg of rabbit antibodies to Vav, Lyn, Grb2, ZAP 70, and rabbit IgG for each individual sample. Protein G or protein A-Sepharose was added after 2 h, and incubation was continued overnight at 4°C. Recovered immunoprecipitates were washed 6 × in 0.01% Triton X-100 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 125I-IgE receptors recovered in the immunoprecipitates of Vav, Lyn, Grb2, and ZAP 70 were quantitated by counting in a Packard Minaxi Auto Gamma 5000 (Downers Grove, IL). Samples of the immunoprecipitated proteins were also solubilized in Tris glycine-SDS sample buffer and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. For analysis of Vav-associated proteins, cells (2 × 107) were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and Vav, ERKs or Syk were immunoprecipitated by addition of 10 μg of anti-Vav or anti-ERK or 40 μg of an IgG fraction of anti-Syk followed by protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 time in 0.01% Triton X-100 and solubilized in Tris glycine-SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved and immunoblotted as described below. For chemical cross-linking experiments nonactivated or activated cells (2 × 107) were solubilized in cross-linking buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mM KCl, 119.4 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM CaCl2) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The soluble cell lysates were incubated, for 30 min on ice, with 2 mM DTSSP (3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate]), pH 8.0, a concentration determined to cause effective cross-linking and maintain antibody reactivity. Reaction was stopped by addition of 40 mM glycine and further incubation on ice for 20 min. Immunoprecipitation was as described above, and recovered pellets were vigorously washed 5 times in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) followed by 1 time in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The antibodies used to detect cross-linked proteins were tested for their ability to recognize the protein in chemically cross-linked cell lysates. Glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins were purified and used as described previously (8Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified Vav was obtained from cells solubilized in 0.5-1.0% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. In some experiments nuclei were removed by microcentrifugation, and supernatants were applied to a Vav affinity column (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4°C. Columns were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline using 20-fold bed volume per wash. Proteins bound were eluted with 100 mM CAPS buffer, pH 11.7, and immediately neutralized to pH 7.4 with 1 N HCl. Proteins were resolved on 8, 10, and 4-12% Tris glycine gels under reducing conditions, unless otherwise stated, and transferred as described (8Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and phosphotyrosine containing proteins, and FcϵRI β and γ chains were identified (8Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect Vav a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody specific to Vav was used at a dilutions of 1:1667 or 1:1000, respectively. In some experiments the F(ab′)2 fragment of donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) was utilized at a 1:12,500 dilution as a secondary antibody. In other experiments a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-rabbit Ig was used as a secondary antibody with subsequent addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Extravidin (Sigma). Visualization of reactive proteins was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Relative quantitation was by densitometric analysis of exposures in the linear range using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer and ImageQuant software for analysis (Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were incubated for 8 h in serum-free or serum-containing media prior to stimulation to obtain Vav from quiescent or nonquiescent cells. Antigen stimulation, lysis, chemical cross-linking, and immunoprecipitation are described above. Raf-1 and Vav immunoprecipitates were subjected to three washes in 1% Nonidet P-40 (see above). Thirty microliters of Raf kinase assay buffer (0.2 mM ATP, 30 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 40 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 μM okadaic acid, 0.2%β-mercaptoethanol) was added to each immunoprecipitate along with 1 μg of purified human recombinant MEK1. Incubation was at 30°C for 10 min followed by the sequential addition of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of purified ERK2 kinase-inactive mutant (K52R) for a final volume of 50 μl and a subsequent incubation of 2 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by addition of boiling 5-fold-concentrated SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by 10% Tris glycine-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, as above, and probed for the presence of Raf-1 and subsequently exposed to autoradiography. We did not observe significant differences in Raf-1 activity derived from quiescent or nonquiescent cells. Aggregation of the FcϵRI on RBL-2H3 cells results in the phosphorylation of the receptor and of associated proteins (Fig. 1, IgE). To determine whether Vav and the Vav-associated Grb2 (20Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12629-12633Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) might complex to receptor in response to its aggregation, we first analyzed the apparent molecular masses of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that immunoprecipitated with Vav or Grb2 in nonstimulated and antigen-stimulated cells. Fig. 1 shows that in immunoprecipitates of Vav derived from resting cells, Vav is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav is increased upon aggregation of the receptor. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were also detected in immunoprecipitates of Vav. Two such proteins at 18 and 30 kDa had the identical molecular mass of the FcϵRI β chain and γ chain dimer, respectively, under nonreducing conditions. Previous studies have shown that Grb2 associates with multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in response to aggregation of the FcϵRI (33Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9500-9506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results immunoprecipitates of Grb2 revealed multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with Grb2 prior to and after the aggregation of the receptor (33Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9500-9506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aggregation of the receptor induced only a slight increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc under nonquiescent conditions (33Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9500-9506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but new phosphoproteins at molecular masses of 18, 30, 33, and 75 kDa were observed (Fig. 1). To determine if the 18-kDa band in immunoprecipitates of Vav and Grb2 had the characteristics of the disulfide-linked γ chain dimer of the FcϵRI, immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Almost complete loss of the bands ranging from 14 to 20 kDa was observed in immunoprecipitates of Vav and significant loss of the phosphoproteins of this molecular mass range was observed in immunoprecipitates of Grb2 (data not shown). The association of Vav with FcϵRI might be dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav or of the receptor. We investigated the kinetics of phosphorylation of Vav and compared this to phosphorylation of the FcϵRI β and γ chain. Fig. 2 shows that the tyrosine phosphorylation of p95 Vav is rapid with a maximum reached between 1 and 3 min of aggregation of the receptor. This mimics the early phosphorylation kinetics of the FcϵRI β and γ chains, but dephosphorylation of the receptor is rapid while phosphorylation of Vav is maintained through 27 min of activation. All further experiments to study the Vav and Grb2 interactions with receptor or Vav interactions with other proteins were done 2 min after addition of the aggregating antigen (DNP-BSA). The possible association of Vav with the FcϵRI was further investigated by isolation of the receptor or Vav under conditions that maintain receptor subunit association (8Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11446-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav upon aggregation of the receptor by addition of DNP-BSA. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav was not detected in the immunoprecipitates of the receptor prior to or after FcϵRI aggregation. However, when blots, first probed with antibody to phosphotyrosine, were subsequently stripped (8Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reprobed with antibody to Vav, a reactive band was detected in the immunoprecipitates of the receptor. In subsequent experiments, this anti-Vav-reactive band was detected with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to Vav. The presence of Vav was detected in immunoprecipitates of the receptor derived from resting and activated cells, although the association of Vav with receptor was increased by aggregation of the receptor (Fig. 3, A and B). In three experiments an average increase of a 1.8-fold was found after aggregation of the receptor. However, relative quantitation of the immunoblots suggests that only a small fraction (0.1-0.5%) of the total cellular Vav was associated with the FcϵRI. This might explain the inability to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav in association with receptor. Furthermore, preliminary experiments suggest that only a small fraction of Vav (<20%) is tyrosine-phosphorylated which would further decrease the sensitivity of phosphotyrosine detection. In contrast when Vav was immunoprecipitated from activated cells, 2-3% of the receptor, as detected by immunoprecipitation of cell surface-bound and radiolabeled IgE, was co-immunoprecipitated with Vav (Fig. 3B). The extent of this co-immunoprecipitation was comparable with the co-immunoprecipitation of receptor with antibody to the receptor-associated p53/56lyn kinase (Fig. 3B), although without use of chemical cross-linking agents the latter association was variable. To determine which subunit of the FcϵRI might interact with Vav, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of the FcϵRI β and γ chains were reacted with cell lysates derived from both nonactivated and activated RBL-2H3 cells. Fig. 3C shows a 95-kDa band reactive with antibody to Vav associated with the C-terminal domain of the γ chain. This association was specific since associations with GST or with other GST-fusion proteins were not observed, and probing of the GST-fusion proteins with antibody to PKC-δ revealed this isozyme was associated with the GST-βc construct as described previously (data not shown, 8). An increased association of Vav with GST-γ could not be detected with Vav derived from either nonactivated or activated cells. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody to Vav recognized this GST-γ-associated protein (data not shown). Interestingly, only the 95-kDa protein reactive with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to Vav was observed with the GST-γ-fusion protein or with receptor, although a Vav antibody-reactive protein of 85 kDa (which appears to be a proteolytic product of Vav; data not shown) is detected in cell lysates. The association of the FcϵRI with Vav or Grb2 is regulated by aggregation of the receptor (Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitates of Vav or of Grb2 isolated under conditions that maintain the intact tetrameric structure of the receptor showed the presence of co-immunoprecipitated receptor, as detected by monoclonal antibody to FcϵRI β chain. In close agreement with the data presented in the previous section, relative quantitation of immunoblots showed that approximately 2% of the receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with both Vav and Grb2 (Fig. 4A) after aggregation of the receptor. While these results suggest that receptors interact with Vav or Grb2, only after aggregation of the receptors, long exposures of the immunoblots revealed the presence of the β chain in the immunoprecipitates derived from nonaggregated cells (data not shown). This is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 3A. Nevertheless, an enhancement of the association is seen upon aggregation of the receptor, and kinetic analysis of receptor association with Vav revealed that peak association occurs between 1 and 3 min, a time when the phosphorylation of the receptor is maximal (Fig. 4B and Fig. 2). Collectively, the data suggest that a 2-4-fold enhancement of Vav in association with the receptor is mediated by the aggregation of the FcϵRI. Prior studies implicate Vav as a component of the Syk-dependent activation of MAP kinase activity (26Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine if the association of Vav with the FcϵRI might link the receptor to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, we analyzed whether Vav might associate with proteins that lead to MAP kinase activation in mast cells (34Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar). Nonactivated cells were solubilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 or 1.0% Nonidet P-40 to obtain maximal solubility of cellular proteins.

In particular, IFN-γ gene expression is significantly affected by vitamin A and/or its derivatives (e.g. retinoic acid (RA)). Here, we analyze the effect of retinoic acid on IFN-γ transcription. Transient transfection assays in the human T lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat demonstrated that the activation of the IFN-γ promoter was significantly down-regulated in the presence of RA. Surprisingly, two different AP-1/CREB-ATF-binding elements situated in the initial 108 base pairs of the IFN-γ promoter and previously shown to be critical for transcriptional activity were unaffected by RA. Utilizing promoter deletions and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, we identified a USF/EGR-1-binding element cooperating in the modulation of IFN-γ promoter activity by RA. This element was found to be situated in a position of the IFN-γ promoter close to a silencer element previously identified in our laboratory. These results suggest that direct modulation of IFN-γ promoter activity is one of the possible mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of retinoids on IFN-γ gene expression.

C., and Sytkowski, A. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 681-684; Patel H. R, Choi H.-S, and Sytkowski A. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21300-21302). In the present study we demonstrate that up-regulation of c-myc requires the PKC-ε isoform and that this pathway is required for erythropoietin-induced DNA synthesis (growth) but apparently not for β-globin expression (differentiation). Treatment of Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells resulted in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 and activation of PKC-ε as evidenced by its translocation from soluble to particulate subcellular fractions. Artificial down-regulation of PKC-ε with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides blocked erythropoietin's up-regulation of c-myc in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, and -ζ had no effect. Although down-regulation of PKC-ε blocked the increase in c-myc expression, it did not inhibit erythropoietin induction of β-globin expression, a marker of erythroid differentiation. However, down-regulation of PKC-ε did block factor-dependent DNA synthesis quantified by measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA of normal murine erythroid cells.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used these two genes as reporters for the arrival of the erythropoietin signal at the erythroid nucleus and have shown that these genes are differentially regulated by two discrete signaling pathways, a protein kinase C-dependent pathway to c-myc and a protein phosphatase 1/2a-dependent pathway to c-myb (10Spangler R.

These cells are an in vitro model system for erythroid progenitor cells and have been used extensively in studies of erythroid differentiation and of erythropoietin's mechanism of action. Normal (nontransformed) erythroid cells were obtained from the spleens of mice treated with phenylhydrazine (17Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 100 units of erythropoietin/ml (Elanex Pharmaceuticals) for specified times in 100-mm dishes at 37°C. The cells were transferred to centrifuge tubes containing an equal volume of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 4°C. The soluble and particulate fractions were isolated (18Clark K.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7097-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-PKC-ε antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) overnight at 4°C. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Cells were treated with 100 units of erythropoietin/ml for 5 min at 37°C and harvested as described above. They were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (pH 7.4). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mixed monoclonal antibodies against bovine PLC-γ1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4°C overnight. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the samples were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and detected with ECL. The membrane was reprobed with anti-PLCγ-1 antibody to serve as a loading control. Thiolated oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) were purchased from Genosys and were purified further by gel filtration. The antisense sequences were derived from the published coding sequences of the respective PKC isoform cDNA. The sequences are as follows: PKC-α, 5′-TCATCTGATGTGGGAGCC (19Ohno S. Kawasaki H.

The sequences are: PKC-ε, 5′-TATGTGCGTCATTATAAG; PKC-ε (thymidine-free), 5′-GCCGAGCCGAGCCGA. Cells growing in log phase were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml (0.5 ml/well). For the analysis of c-myc and PKC expression, oligos were added to the cell culture at specified concentrations, and cells were incubated for 18 h. A second oligo addition of one-half the initial concentration was made, and cells were harvested after further incubation of 6 h. Recombinant human erythropoietin (100 units/ml) was added to the culture 60 min before harvest. For analysis of β-globin expression, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of antisense oligos for 24 h followed by incubation with erythropoietin ± oligos for another 24 h before harvesting. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium lysis method (22Puissant C. Houdebine L.M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total cellular RNA by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.26Google Scholar). For analysis of c-myc or β-globin expression, 10 μg of total cellular RNA were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred to GeneScreen Plus filters (DuPont). cDNA probes for c-myc and β-globin were 32P-labeled by nick translation. In each Northern analysis, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (24Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S.E. Dani C. Jeanteaur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) cDNA probe was used as an internal control. After exposure to x-ray film, the relative intensities of c-myc and GAPDH transcripts in each lane were determined by quantitative scanning laser densitometer (LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Cells grown in culture were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, washed in cold hypotonic buffer, containing 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM HEPES, and 200 mM sucrose, pH 7.5 (25Challberg M.D. Kelly Jr T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and resuspended in hypotonic buffer without sucrose. After incubation on ice for 10 min, cells were lysed by 25 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer (ball A). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (0.375 M Tris-HCI, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 3.1% dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) and heated in boiling water for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 90 min, subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE, and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). The membrane was blocked in PBST buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 5 mM Na2HPO4, 1.7 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) containing 10% non-fat dry milk (w/v) at room temperature for 4 h followed by an incubation in PBST containing affinity-purified anti-PKC-ε antibody (0.5 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% non-fat dry milk for 12 h at 4°C. After three 15-min washes in PBST, the membrane was incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) (1:1000 dilution in PBST, 5% non-fat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Corp.). PCR primers for PKC-ε and PKC-ζ were derived from the published sequences of respective PKC isoform cDNA. The sequences of the primers and their positions in the coding sequences are as follows: PKC-ε, 5′ primer, 5′-ACGTTCTGTGACCACTGT (944-961); 3′ primer, 5′-CTTGCCAAAGCTGCCTTT (1431-1448); PKC-ζ, 5′ primer, 5′-GCGTACTGTGGCCAGTGC (572-589); 3′ primer, 5′-CTTGGCATAGCTTCCACG (925-942). First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 1 μg of cellular RNA in 20 μl of reverse transcription reaction containing 250 mM Tris-HCl, 375 mM KCl 15 mM MgCl2, 1 uM oligo(dT)18, 1 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), pH 8.3, at 42°C for 1 h. One-tenth of the reaction was used for PCR amplification. PCR amplification was carried out in standard buffer (Perkin-Elmer) with 2 mM MgCl2 for 35 cycles of 95°C/1 min, 50°C (55°C for PKC-ζ)/30 s, and 72°C/2 min in a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler 480. For internal controls, human GAPDH primers (1 μM) (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) flanking a 1-kilobase pair GAPDH cDNA fragment were included in each PCR reaction. The PCR products were resolved in a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. The ability of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to block erythropoietin's mitotic signal was examined in the standard in vitro bioassay that measures erythropoietin-stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine into newly synthesized DNA of normal murine splenic erythroid cells (17Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar). For each assay, a standard curve of 5-200 milliunits of erythropoietin/ml was used. Each oligo was added in the presence of 50 milliunits of erythropoietin/ml, a value chosen for its position in the linear portion of the standard curve. Samples were assayed in triplicate, and variation among replicates was ±5%. For these studies thymidine-free oligos were used (see sequences above) in order to avoid reducing the specific activity of the [3H]thymidine intracellularly, which can result in a spurious decrease in measured [3H]thymidine incorporation (26Heikkila R. Schwab G. Wickstrom E. Loke S.L. Pluznik D.H. Watt R. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using molecular blocking agents demonstrated that erythropoietin's signal to c-myc is dependent upon PKC (10Spangler R. Bailey S.C. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 681-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Spangler R. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to begin to identify the specific PKC isoform(s) involved, we carried out preliminary loss-of-function experiments using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells were incubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, or -ζ, 100 μg/ml, followed by 100 units of erythropoietin/ml for 1 h. We have shown previously that this time of exposure to erythropoietin is optimal for demonstrating the up-regulation of c-myc expression (9Chern Y.E. Spangler R. Choi H.-S Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Spangler R. Bailey S.C. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 681-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, RNA was prepared, and Northern analyses were carried out to quantify c-myc and GAPDH (control) steady-state mRNA levels. In the absence of antisense oligos, erythropoietin up-regulated c-myc expression 3-4-fold. Of the six antisense oligos tested, only antisense PKC-ε achieved significant inhibition (60%) of erythropoietin's c-myc up-regulation. Based upon these initial screening experiments, we selected PKC-ε for further study. We demonstrated that erythropoietin treatment of Rauscher cells results in activation of PKC-ε by quantifying the amount of PKC-ε in the soluble and particulate cellular fractions of cells incubated in the absence or presence of the hormone. Cells were incubated for 5 min in the absence or presence of erythropoietin. The soluble and particulate fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-PKC-ε antibody. As seen in Fig. 1, cells incubated in the absence of erythropoietin exhibited 77% of PKC-ε in the soluble fraction and 23% in the particulate fraction. In contrast, erythropoietin treatment induced a marked translocation of PKC-ε, resulting in only 8% in the soluble fraction and 92% in the particulate fraction. The results of repeated experiments were very similar. Consistent with the activation (translocation) of PKC-ε shown above is the demonstration that erythropoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 in Rauscher cells. We treated the cells for 5 min, prepared lysates, and subjected them to immunoprecipitation with mixed monoclonal antibodies to PLC-γ1. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies (Fig. 2). In the absence of erythropoietin, no tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was detected in the range of 145 kDa. However, after erythropoietin treatment, a distinct 145-kDa band was detected with anti-phosphotyrosine. Importantly, this band coincided precisely with the 145-kDa PLC-γ1 band visualized using anti-PLC-γ1 antibody. As expected, the total amounts of PLC-γ1 protein detected in untreated and treated cells were identical. These results are in agreement with previous work demonstrating the induction of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation after erythropoietin treatment of a different cell line (27Ren H-Y Komatsu N. Shimizu R. Okada K. Miura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19633-19638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense PKC-ε oligos blocked the erythropoietin-dependent up-regulation of c-myc in a concentration-dependent manner. As seen in Fig. 3, erythropoietin up-regulated c-myc expression 2.5-fold. Treatment with 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 μg of antisense PKC-ε oligo/ml inhibited erythropoietin's induction of c-myc in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing the level of c-myc expression down to that seen in the absence of erythropoietin, but not below. As a control experiment, missense oligos with the same nucleotide composition were used. No effect on erythropoietin's up-regulation of c-myc was observed (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Lack of effect of missense PKC-ε oligodeoxynucleotide on erythropoietin's up-regulation of c-myc expression. The experiment was performed as in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We confirmed that antisense PKC-ε oligo treatment had down-regulated PKC-ε transcript by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig. 5). Total cellular RNA from cells incubated in the absence or presence of antisense or missense oligos was reverse transcribed, and the cDNA was PCR amplified using primers specific for PKC-ε as well as primers specific for GAPDH, a control transcript. The PKC-ε primers amplified a single 505-bp product, the exact size predicted from the primers selected. Importantly, this product was not detected using RNA from cells treated with antisense PKC-ε oligo, but was detected using RNA from cells treated with the missense oligo. A 1000-bp GAPDH product was co-amplified equally using RNA from cells incubated under each of the three conditions, confirming the specificity of the antisense PKC-ε effect. We also confirmed the action of antisense PKC-ε oligo by demonstrating down-regulation of PKC-ε protein using Western blot analysis of cell lysates (Fig. 6). PKC-ε was readily detected as a ∼94-95-kDa protein. Its abundance was not changed by erythropoietin treatment, as expected. This is consistent with our previous observation that erythropoietin up-regulates c-myc as a primary response gene (cycloheximide resistant) (9Chern Y.E. Spangler R. Choi H.-S Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, PKC-ε protein was reduced by 77% (to 23% of control) in cells treated with antisense PKC-ε oligo. As a further control for the specificity of the antisense PKC-ε effect, we carried out similarly detailed experiments using antisense oligos to another isoform expressed in these cells, PKC-ζ. In contrast to the marked effect of PKC-ε down-regulation on erythropoietin's signal to c-myc, antisense oligos to PKC-ζ had no effect (Fig. 7). Cells were treated with antisense PKC-ζ oligos at the same concentrations as those used for PKC-ε. No inhibition of erythropoietin-induced c-myc expression was observed for all of the concentrations of antisense PKC-ζ oligo tested. We confirmed that antisense PKC-ζ oligos did indeed down-regulate PKC-ζ in these experiments by RT-PCR (Fig. 8). RT-PCR with primers specific for PKC-ζ resulted in amplification of the expected 371-bp product using RNA from untreated cells. This PKC-ζ product was no longer detected when RNA from cells treated with antisense PKC-ζ oligo was used. The control 1000-bp GAPDH product was co-amplified equally using RNA from either cell preparation. As noted above, antisense oligos to four other isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ) also did not affect the c-myc response. We did not perform similarly extensive experiments documenting the effect of these oligos on their respective target transcripts and proteins.Fig. 8Effect of antisense (A.S.)

See Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies of c-myc in Friend murine erythroleukemia cells, which differentiate when treated with various chemical agents but not with erythropoietin, have demonstrated that changes in the c-myc expression are necessary for this differentiation (28Lachman M.M. Skoultchi A.I. Nature. 1984; 310: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 29Coppola J.A. Cole M.D. Nature. 1986; 320: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 30Dmitrovsky E.

Nature. 1986; 322: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether blocking erythropoietin's signal to c-myc with antisense oligos to PKC-ε would prevent differentiation of Rauscher cells induced by the growth factor. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of antisense PKC-ε oligo for 24 h followed by another 24 h of incubation with erythropoietin to induce differentiation. These are conditions under which PKC-ε mRNA is completely down-regulated. Total cellular RNA was prepared and subjected to Northern analysis using a probe for β-globin (Fig. 9). Erythropoietin's induction of β-globin mRNA was equivalent (3-4-fold) whether or not its signal to c-myc had been blocked. This indicates that the up-regulation of c-myc is not necessary for erythropoietin-induced differentiation and either that PKC-ε is also not necessary or that it is required at a much lower concentration. In marked contrast, we found that PKC-ε is clearly necessary for erythropoietin-induced cell growth. To demonstrate this we measured the erythropoietin-dependent incorporation of [3H]thymidine into newly synthesized DNA of normal murine splenic erythroid cells. This assay is acknowledged widely as a standard in vitro bioassay for erythropoietin. Addition of increasing concentrations of antisense PKC-ε oligo to cells treated with a constant amount of erythropoietin resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis down to 28% of that seen in the absence of oligo (72% inhibition) (Fig. 10, closed circles). Interestingly, the percent of growth inhibition was nearly identical to the percent reduction in PKC-ε protein achieved with antisense oligos (Fig. 6). No growth inhibition was seen when the missense oligo was used (Fig. 10, open circles). In the present study we have begun to elucidate the PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway by which the hematopoietic growth factor erythropoietin regulates expression of the proto-oncogene, c-myc. We have now correlated the activation of this pathway with erythropoietin's mitogenic signal. In previous work we demonstrated that the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb are both regulated by erythropoietin as primary response genes (immediate/early genes); that is, their regulation does not require de novo protein synthesis (9Chern Y.E. Spangler R. Choi H.-S Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used c-myc and c-myb as endogenous reporter genes to monitor the arrival of erythropoietin's signal in the nucleus (10Spangler R. Bailey S.C. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 681-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Spangler R. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Patel H.R Choi H.-S Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21300-21302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using molecular blocking agents we showed that each gene is regulated transcriptionally (by modulation of transcriptional attenuation) via discrete signaling pathways. Erythropoietin's up-regulation of c-myc requires a PKC-dependent pathway, whereas its down-regulation of c-myb is dependent upon a class 1,2a protein phosphatase. We have now shown that erythropoietin's PKC-dependent signal to c-myc requires PKC-ε, a member of the calcium-independent group of PKC isoforms. Moreover, artificial down-regulation of PKC-ε blocks erythropoietin's mitogenic signal, but has no apparent effect on the hormone's ability to induce differentiation, i.e. globin expression. PKC-ε is clearly required for erythropoietin-induced up-regulation of c-myc and for DNA synthesis. There are at least two potential modes by which PKC-ε may function. Firstly, it may directly mediate the signal pathway to c-myc and DNA synthesis, i.e. serve a causal role. Secondly, it may be necessary for other reactions and processes that are required for efficient transmission of the effector signal, i.e. a “permissive” role. The present data do not allow an unequivocal decision to be made regarding which of these alternatives is the more likely. Whether or not the signal pathway to c-myc is identical to that which mediates erythropoietin's “anti-apoptotic” effect (32Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) has not yet been determined. In these studies we employed two different cell types. Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells do not require erythropoietin for proliferation. Therefore, they proved especially useful in assessing potentially differentiation-specific processes. Normal murine erythroid cells were used to assess potentially growth-specific processes. Although our previous studies have indicated excellent agreement between these two cell systems with respect to signaling events (11Spangler R. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is, nonetheless, possible that differences exist between their erythropoietin induced signal pathways. For example, although Rauscher cells may not require PKC-ε for globin expression, the same conclusion cannot yet be made for normal cells. Unfortunately, their factordependent and PKC-ε-dependent growth requirement in all likelihood precludes designing a definitive experiment to answer this question. With acknowledgement of these several alternatives, we propose the hypothesis that erythropoietin may trigger separate growth and differentiation signals (or groups of signals) which may be subject to differential manipulation. There is other evidence in support of such a “two-signal” hypothesis. Erythroid progenitor cells infected with Friend erythroleukemia virus and related viruses become independent of erythropoietin for their proliferation (33D'Andrea A. Li J. Baltimore D. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This is apparently due to activation of their endogenous erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) by its interaction with the virally encoded gp55. However, this EpoR-gp55 interaction does not trigger differentiation, suggesting “uncoupling” of the EpoR growth and differentiation signals. Recently, transforming growth factor-β has been shown to induce differentiation of normal human erythroid cells while decreasing their growth (34Krystal G. Lam V. Dragowski W. Takahashi C. Appel J. Gontier A. Jenkins A. Lam H. Quon L. Lansdorp P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the two hypothetical signals could be mapped topographically to discrete domains of the erythropoietin receptor. Several direct (protein-protein) interactions have been documented between the receptor and signal transduction effector molecules (1Damen J.E. Mui A.L. Puil L. Pawson T. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3204-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mayeux P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Mauduit P. Sabbah M. Druker B. Vainchenker W. Fischer S. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Eur. J.

Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). It is possible that the proliferative signal might result from one such interaction while the differentiation signal might result from another. Moreover, it is not known whether each individual receptor molecule (or receptor-receptor dimer) is capable of generating both (all) signals, i.e. interacts simultaneously with all signal transduction molecules. Also, the proliferative and differentiation limbs may result from a single interaction that results in a signal which bifurcates downstream. Other studies have implicated PKC in erythroid cell differentiation and growth. Melloni et al. (35Melloni E. Pntremoli S. Sparatore B. Patrone M. Grossi F. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4417-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported originally that the incorporation of partially purified PKC-β into Friend murine erythroleukemia cells accelerated chemically induced differentiation. These investigators later revised their identification of the isoform in question to PKC-ε (36Powell C.T. Leng L. Dong L. Kiyokawa H. Busquets X. O'Driscoll K. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most recently it has been suggested that PKC-α, -δ, -ε, -ζ, and -η may all play a role in this enhancement of chemically induced Friend cell differentiation (37Leng L. Yu F. Dong L. Busquets X. Osada S. Richon V.M. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5554-5558PubMed Google Scholar). A PKC-like activity localized to the nucleus of Friend cells has been reported as necessary for cell proliferation (38Beckman B.S. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 324-327PubMed Google Scholar). Its abundance is apparently decreased by chemical inducers. However, such chemical agents induce differentiation of these cells by a mechanism that is different from erythropoietin signaling, that is, the receptor is by-passed. Thus, it is likely that the role of PKC isoforms in enhancing chemically induced differentiation also differs from that played by PKC-ε in erythropoietin signaling. The PKC-ε isoform has been associated with numerous functions in a wide variety of cell types. Perhaps of special relevance to the data presented here are observations indicating that its overexpression in fibroblasts is transforming, indicating that it can function as an oncogene (39Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with its role in erythropoietin's mitogenic action. PKC-ε may not be the only isoform capable of transducing erythropoietin's mitogenic (anti-apoptotic?) signal under all circumstances. 5 et al. (40May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the suppression of apoptosis in FDC-P1/ER cells associated with expression of bcl2 protein is mediated by PKC-α. This would imply that the functions of the various PKC isoforms are quite lineage-specific, even among the various types of hematopoietic cells. However, evidence indicates that the “mitogenic” and “anti-apoptotic” actions of erythropoietin and, presumably, other growth factors are not identical (41Spivak J.L. Pham T. Isaacs M. Hankins W.D. Blood. 1991; 77: 1228-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the erythropoietin's growth enhancing signaling mechanism consists of more than one pathway. Erythropoietin has been reported to induce nuclear localization of PKC-β isoforms (42). It would be of interest to compare the levels of expression of PKC isoforms in various erythroid cells, both normal and transformed, from several species. It is unknown at present whether the role of PKC-ε in erythropoietin's mitogenic signal demonstrated in the present study can be performed by other isoforms in other erythroid cells. Further identification of the kinases and their substrates involved in these processes will help to clarify these questions.

https://openalex.org/W2084519494,"LTA cells synthesize a minor population of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGact) bearing anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSact) with a specific monosaccharide sequence that accelerates the action of antithrombin (AT). LTA cells also synthesize a major population of heparan sulfate proteoglycans endowed with nonanticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSinact) lacking the AT-binding site. To investigate the pathway-specific features of HSPGact generation, we established a novel detergent-containing cell-free system with unlabeled and labeled microsomes from wild-type and variant LTA cells, respectively. The unlabeled microsomes provide “HSact conversion activity” that requires 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to convert [35S]HSPGinact into [35S] HSPGact, presumably by sulfation. The reaction kinetics demonstrate that the rate of HSact synthesis is constant over the first 4 h of incubation. During this time, the rate of HSact production is linearly dependent on the amount of unlabeled LTA microsomal protein over a range of 10 to 50 μg as well as on the level of [35S]HS substrate over a range of 0.4 to 4.0 μg, microsomal protein. Compared with labeled microsomes, equivalent or slightly greater levels of HSact were generated from 35S-labeled HSPG, microsomal HS, or cell surface HS, which demonstrates that HSinact is the minimal substrate and that large amounts of HSact precursor exit the Golgi apparatus. Indeed, extensive modification of wild-type LTA cell surface [35S]HS elevated HSact content from 9 to 35%. The hypothesis that microsomal HSact conversion activity predicts the cellular rate of HSact generation was tested with wild-type or variant LTA cells in which production of HSact has been significantly altered by mutagenesis or overexpression of core protein or growth conditions. The data demonstrate that microsomal HSact conversion activity accurately reflects the cellular rate of HSact synthesis over a very wide range of conditions. The possibility that the reduced HSact generation is due to an inhibitor was excluded by mixing experiments. The possibility that reduced HSact generation is caused by decreased levels of HSact precursor was excluded as equivalent levels of HSact were formed from wild-type and variant [35S]HS. Based upon the above data, the LTA cell microsomal HSact conversion activity contains one or more limiting components that kinetically regulate the rate of cellular HSact generation and the levels of HSact precursor in HS greatly exceed HSact production.

The elucidation of the structure-function relationships for anticoagulant heparin, a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1The abbreviations used are: GAG(s)glycosaminoglycan(s)ATantithrombinBSAbovine serum albuminCSchondroitin sulfateHS(PG)heparan sulfate (proteoglycan)HS(PG)actanticoagulant heparan sulfate (proteoglycan)HS(PG)inactnonanticoagulant heparan sulfate (proteoglycan)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salinePG(s)proteoglycan(s)PAPS3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfateMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. of mast cells, has served as a model for discerning the role of anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGact) in the vascular system. The circulating plasma protease inhibitor, antithrombin (AT), neutralizes proteolytic enzymes of the coagulation cascade by slow formation of a binary complex. However, in the presence of heparin, AT binds to a unique oligosaccharide structure and undergoes a conformational change that dramatically accelerates the rate of complex formation (1Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6490-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delineation of the critical monosaccharide sequence of sulfated and nonsulfated glucosamine and uronic acid residues that enhances neutralization of hemostatic enzymes was made possible by affinity purification of heparin fragments with AT and detailed structure-function studies of the resulting oligosaccharides (2Lam L.H.

Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), this abundance is greater than would be predicted by the completely random assembly of the constituents of the AT-binding domain (11Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), which indicates that generation of this oligosaccharide sequence requires coordination of biosynthetic enzymes. glycosaminoglycan(s) antithrombin bovine serum albumin chondroitin sulfate heparan sulfate (proteoglycan) anticoagulant heparan sulfate (proteoglycan) nonanticoagulant heparan sulfate (proteoglycan) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline proteoglycan(s) 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The pharmacologic action of heparin exploits a natural anticoagulant mechanism of the blood vessel wall, which is based on the highly specific interaction described above (12Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin, Chemical and Biological Properties: Clinical Applications. Edward Arnold, London1989: 275Google Scholar). Endothelial cells produce HSPGact, a minor subpopulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that accelerate neutralization of coagulation enzymes through the heparan sulfate (HS) component that contains the appropriate oligosaccharide structure to bind AT (HSact) (13Marcum J.A.

Invest. 1984; 74: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The remaining HSPGs are nonanticoagulant (HSPGinact) and contain HS chains that lack the AT-binding site (HSinact). The demonstration of an HSPG that contains regions of defined monosaccharide sequence that mediate a specific biologic function suggests that a similar situation may exist for other biologic systems. However, unlike the generation of other biopolymers, the ordered assembly of distinct disaccharide units does not involve a simple template, and so it remains unclear how HSPGact is formed. The capacity of the HSPG biosynthetic enzymes to generate HSPGact may stem exclusively from inherent abundance and interactive properties or alternatively could require additional specific interactions with either unique or non-unique core proteins or regulatory factors. However, Kojima et al. (15Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kojima T. Leone C.W. Marchildon G.A. Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4859-4869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated two major endothelial cell HSPGs, ryudocan (syndecan-4) and syndecan-1, and found that both contained HSact and HSinact, which demonstrates that the generation of HSact does not require a single unique core protein. These findings were subsequently extended to fibroglycan, glypican, and perlican isolated from endothelial cells (17Mertens G. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. Vermylen J. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20435-20443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, it remained conceivable that purified PGs might contain an undetected component with a minor variation in primary sequence that directs generation of HSact. To resolve this issue, Shworak et al. (18Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) expressed epitope tagged rat ryudocan in LTA cells and early passage endothelial cells, both of which produce HSPGact, isolated the exogenous origin PGs, and demonstrated that a single core protein with a unique primary sequence initiates synthesis of both HSact and HSinact. Furthermore, the expression of mutated forms of epitope tagged ryudocan containing only a single functional GAG acceptor site demonstrates that each of the three acceptor regions initiates synthesis of both forms of HS to a similar degree. We have further examined the functioning of the Golgi biosynthetic machinery by overexpressing epitope tagged ryudocan and determining the extent of synthesis of HSact and HSinact (18Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of HSPGinact increased linearly as a function of ryudocan expression, which indicates that synthesis of this GAG is limited by the availability of core protein. In striking contrast, the production of HSPGact decreased as a function of ryudocan expression, which suggests that synthesis of this GAG is limited by factors other than core protein. The subsequent data strongly supported the view that increased intracellular levels of ryudocan are responsible for decreased generation of HSPGact. In particular, the reduction in HSPGact production occurred with overexpression of the ryudocan ectodomain, which is directly secreted into the medium, or by a ryudocan form incapable of augmenting the synthesis of GAGs due to mutated attachment sites. However, the suppression in HSPGact production did not appear to involve the direct inhibition of general HS biosynthetic enzymes by core protein as overexpression of ryudocan failed to significantly reduce the size of HSact or HSinact or perturb the structure of HSact and HSinact. On the basis of the above results, we concluded that the increased intracellular levels of ryudocan most probably saturate the capacity of a component that is specific to the HSact biosynthetic pathway. The existence of a pathway-specific component is also supported by the investigation of the chemically mutated LTA cell line, VI-7 (19Colliec-Jouault S. Shworak N.W. Liu J. de Agostini A.I. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24953-24958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although LTA VI-7 produces normal levels of HSinact, synthesis of HSact is 5-7-fold lower than for wild-type LTA cells. This abnormality is not due to a defect in core protein production as complementation is not observed when mutant LTA cells are transfected with the ryudocan core, which can initiate HSact production. Structural analyses revealed that HSact and HSinact from LTA VI-7 are indistinguishable from wild-type HSact and HSinact, respectively, which indicates that the general HS biosynthetic enzymes were not altered. Together, the analyses of LTA VI-7 and the core protein overexpressing cell line suggest that the production of HSact involves a pathway-specific component that limits the capacity of the general HS biosynthetic enzymes to generate the defined monosaccharide sequence of HSact. If the pathway-specific component limits a single biosynthetic step, then the precursor for this step should be present in excess. The existence of such a precursor should permit the development of a cell-free system that would allow the identification of both the limiting component and the structure of the required precursor. In the present report, we characterize a novel cell-free system that employs microsomal HSact conversion activity to generate HSact from HSinact, and we demonstrate that this microsomal HSact conversion activity predicts cellular HSact production. Thus, we have established an experimental approach for elucidating the pathway-specific features of HSact biosynthesis. The analysis of variant LTA cell lines reveals that HSinact contains an excess pool of molecules that function as a precursor for HSact synthesis. Moreover, the level of HSact production is limited by the activity of one or more microsomal sulfotransferases that modify this precursor population. LTA refers to our previously described clone 1A (20de Agostini A.L. Lau H.K. Leone C. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 1963; 31: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We have previously described the generation from the LTA line of a transfection-derived line that overexpresses the ryudocan12CA5 cDNA, clone 33 (18Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a chemically mutated clone, VI-7 (20de Agostini A.L. Lau H.K. Leone C. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9784-9788Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The distantly related line LA9 refers to clone 3B, which was isolated by two successive rounds of limiting dilution from A9 (23Littlefield J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a mouse L cell line deficient in both adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. All cell lines were maintained in logarithmic growth by subculturing biweekly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C under 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere as described previously (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cultures were generated by inoculating 54,000 cells/cm2 and incubating for 2 days while postconfluent cultures were produced by inoculating 50,000 cells/cm2 and growing for 10 days with medium exchanges on days 4, 7, 8, and 9. The methods for analyzing cellular HS have been previously described in great detail (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, proteoglycans were metabolically labeled for 1 h by incubating cultures in modified BME medium (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% Nutridoma-SP (Boehringer Mannheim) and 2 mCi/ml of Na235SO4 (carrier free, ICN) adjusted to 5000 Ci/mol. Monolayers were extensively washed with PBS and then solubilized with 0.75 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM iodoacetate, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3), for 20 min on ice. The cell extracts were collected, and labeled proteoglycans were isolated by DEAE chromatography. GAGs were prepared by β-elimination and then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Chondroitin sulfate was removed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC, and HS was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. To examine HS size, samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and migration profiles were recorded with a Betascope 603 Blot Analyzer (Betagen, Waltham, MA), and the Mr values were determined by calibration against CS size standards as described previously (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomal isolation procedure was derived from a previously described protocol (26Fleischer B. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 219: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and all steps were performed on ice or at 4°C with prechilled solutions. For either growth state, 11 150-mm plates were placed on ice, monolayers were washed extensively with PBS, and then cells were removed by scraping and were pelleted by centrifugation at 260 × g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 13.75 ml of 0.25 M sucrose and lysed in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with 10 strokes. For exponentially growing cells, phase contrast microscopic examination of this initial homogenate revealed that >80% of nuclei were free of subcellular structures. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to produce an initial supernatant, and from the pellet a second homogenate was generated and centrifuged, as described above. The first and second supernatants were then pooled. For postconfluent cells, microscopic examination of the initial homogenate revealed that >95% of nuclei displayed adherent Golgi apparatus. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the initial supernatant was discarded. The Golgi containing pellet was subjected to two additional cycles of homogenization and centrifugation, as described above, and the second and third supernatants were pooled. Regardless of growth state, nuclei were free of visible subcellular structures after the final homogenization. The pooled supernatants were then layered over 5-ml cushions of 0.6 M sucrose in ∼13-ml tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Each pellet of microsomes was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 M sucrose; protein concentration was determined by the procedure of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard, and samples were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. For both exponential and postconfluent cultures, this fractionation recovered ∼10% of initial protein and >90% of initial starting microsomal HSact conversion activity. 35S-Labeled microsomes were generated from 16 100-mm plates of exponentially growing clone 33 unless stated otherwise. Two plates were washed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37°C for 10 min in 2 ml/plate of sulfate-free modified BME medium (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 31 μM (50 mCi/ml) of carrier-free Na235SO4 (ICN) and 1% Nutridoma-SP. Monolayers were then washed with cold PBS and stored on ice while the recovered medium was sequentially transferred to and incubated with each subsequent pair of plates. Upon completion of labeling, monolayers were extensively washed with PBS, and cells were removed by scraping. Microsomes were prepared as described above except that 8 ml of 0.25 M sucrose was used for each of the two homogenization steps, and microsomes were pelleted without the 0.6 M sucrose cushion. Samples contain ∼200,000 cpm/μg of which 95% was ethanol-precipitable, whereas ∼65% was incorporated into GAG as determined by DEAE chromatography. Proteoglycans were prepared from cell-free reactions by preparative DEAE chromatography, as described previously (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare GAGs, the resulting 1-ml eluate was subjected to β-elimination by the addition of 10 μl of 8.88 M NaOH containing 0.89 M NaBH4 and ∼16 h incubation at 46°C. Samples were quenched with 60 μl of 8.54 M ammonium formate containing 1.7 M HCl and then chilled on ice and extracted against 0.75 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The aqueous phase was dried down by vacuum centrifugation; a slurry was generated by resuspension in 60 μl of water, and salt was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was added to 200 μl of water, and GAGs were precipitated by the addition of 1.25 ml of absolute ethanol followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 0.0005% Triton X-100 followed by removal of residual ethanol by incomplete vacuum centrifugation. To prepare 35S-labeled proteoglycans, 25 × 106 cpm (total radioactivity) of 35S-labeled microsomes were solubilized in 250 μl of lysis buffer and 750 μl of PLB (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and samples were subjected to preparative DEAE chromatography, as described previously (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the elution buffer contained 2.5 μg/ml glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim) as carrier instead of dextran sulfate, which inhibits cell-free HSact synthesis. Half of the eluate was mixed with 1 ml of 4 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and the mixture was applied to a Centricon-100 ultrafilter, and the buffer was then exchanged four times with 2 ml of water. The resulting purified proteoglycans were recovered by soaking the membrane overnight in 100 μl of 30 μg/ml BSA, 0.03% Triton X-100, and 2 μg/ml glycogen at 4°C and were used as substrate for cell-free HSact synthesis reactions. 35S-Labeled GAGs were isolated from proteoglycans by subjecting the remaining half of the DEAE eluate to β-elimination and ethanol precipitation, as described above. To remove CS the GAG sample was incubated in 150 μl containing 10 μg of BSA, 2 μg of glycogen, 30 mM NaCl, 25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, and 0.02 units of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, number C-2905) for 4 h at 37°C. The reaction was extracted against 200 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1); the organic phase was back-extracted against 50 μl of water, and the pooled aqueous phases were combined with 10 μl of 2 M NaCl and 1 ml of ethanol. The precipitated HS was then collected by centrifugation as described under “Preparation of GAGs.” Cell surface HS was prepared from a 75-cm2 flask of an exponentially growing culture inoculated with 38,000 cells per cm2. Two days postinoculation the monolayer was rinsed twice with PBS and then incubated for 16 h in 4 ml of sulfate-free modified BME medium (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 50 mCi/ml carrier-free Na235SO4 (ICN), 200 μM Na2SO4 and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Monolayers were extensively washed with PBS and then incubated in 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mM Na2SO4 at room temperature for 30 min followed by 37°C for 10 min. The cell suspension was collected; the flask was rinsed with 0.5 ml of PBS, and this solution was added to the trypsinate along with 87 μl of 25 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were removed by centrifugation at 560 × g for 15 min, and 2.5 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 6.5 ml of PLB. Proteoglycans were isolated by DEAE chromatography; GAGs were prepared by β-elimination, and CS was removed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC as described under “Purification of Microsomal Proteoglycans and HS.” 50-μl reactions were assembled on ice and unless stated otherwise contained 40 μg (protein) of unlabeled microsomes isolated from postconfluent cultures of LTA cells, 400,000 total cpm (∼272,000 cpm in HS) of microsomes (∼2 μg) prepared from exponential cultures of clone 33, 35 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM MES, pH 7.0, 1 mM PAPS (Sigma), 24% nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, L4980), 50 μM NAD (Sigma), 50 μM ATP, 4 mM disodium phosphocreatine (Sigma, P6915), and 2 units of type I creatine phosphokinase from rabbit muscle (Sigma, C 3755). Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 4 h and quenched by the addition of 250 μl of lysis buffer with 750 μl of PLB; 35S-labeled GAGs were isolated by preparative DEAE chromatography and β-elimination as described above and then analyzed for HSact content. The percentage of HS chains containing AT-binding sites was calculated as the product of the GAG HS content and the GAG HSact content. The relative contents of HS and CS were measured from representative samples of each preparation of 35S-labeled microsomes as ethanol-soluble 35S counts generated by digestion with Flavobacterium heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC, respectively, as described previously (24Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically Flavobacterium heparitinase degraded 85% of GAG lyase-digestible material. GAG HSact content was determined by AT-affinity microchromatography, as described by Shworak et al. (18Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled clone 33 microsomes (2 × 106 cpm) were mixed with 32 μg of protein G-purified 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Harvard Monoclonal Antibody/Cell Culture Facility) in a 13-μl volume containing 75 mM NaCl with 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1 h. This mixture was then subjected to a standard reaction for the synthesis of HSact. Subsequently, the reaction was mixed with 4 μl of 10% SDS, 50 μl of NET (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3) as well as 40 μl of NET equilibrated (1:1 slurry) protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.), and then incubated for 1 h with shaking. The beads, which bound complexes of antibody·epitope tagged ryudocan, were collected by centrifugation for 10 s at 3,000 × g and washed in 1.25 ml of NET containing 0.1% SDS and then 1.25 ml of NET adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl. Beads were washed twice with BDT (0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 μM dextran sulfate, 3.3 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.33% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3). Tagged ryudocan was then eluted by three sequential 100-μl incubations in BDT containing 24 μM of the 12CA5 epitope peptide YPYDVPDYA (Berkeley Antibody Co. Inc.). GAGs were then removed by β-elimination, purified, and analyzed for HSact content as described above.

However, PAI-2 can be secreted as a glycoprotein by a process of facultative translocation due to the presence of an inefficient internal signal sequence (2Belin D. Wohlwend A. Schleuning W.-D.

The extracellular form functions as an efficient inhibitor of plasminogen activators leading to the clearance of plasminogen activator/PAI-2 complexes (4Jensen P.H. Christensen E.I. Ebbesen P.

A direct inhibition of apoptogenic proteinases by PAI-2 seems likely because cells transfected with a PAI-2 mutant with changed proteinase inhibitory specificity failed to protect the cells against TNF cytotoxicity (7Dickinson J.A.

Some serpins have developed structures that make them bind ligands other than proteinases, e.g. the hormone binding to the noninhibitory carrier serpins, corticosteroid binding globulin and thyroxine binding globulin (8Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). However, ligand binding to some inhibitory serpins is important for their functional state, e.g. the increased antiproteolytic activity of antithrombin III upon heparin binding (8Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and the changed specificity and increased stability of PAI-1 when bound to vitronectin (9Keijer J.

We have previously demonstrated Gln83,84,86 in PAI-2 to be substrate sites for the intracellular enzyme transglutaminase (10Jensen P.H. Schüler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Højrup P.

Hypothesizing that the intracellular functions of PAI-2 are subject to modulation by binding to cytosolic nonproteinase ligands, we have probed the existence of such binding sites and localized the protein binding domain in PAI-2 to the exon 3 coded segment.

Wild-type recombinant human PAI-2, the deletion mutant lacking amino acids 66-98 (Δ(66-98)PAI-2), and human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were described previously (10Jensen P.H. Schüler E.

The monoclonal anti-human PAI-2 IgG2a (No. 3750) was obtained from American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT. The rabbit polyclonal PAI-2 antiserum was raised against recombinant human PAI-2 expressed in Escherichia coli. The rabbit polyclonal anti-human annexin I was described previously (20Pepinsky R.B.

The rhodamine-labeled phalloidin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A were from Sigma, and the monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody was from Amersham Corp. All other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma and are of analytical grade unless stated otherwise. PAI-2, Δ(66-98)PAI-2, and uPA were iodinated as described previously (4Jensen P.H. Christensen E.I. Ebbesen P. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 1043-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Jensen P.H. Schüler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Højrup P.

The (66-98)PAI-2 peptide was iodinated by incubating 160 pmol of (66-98)PAI-2 with 100 pmol of 125I in 25 μl of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, with 0.04 mg/ml chloramine-T for 3 min at room temperature. The iodination was terminated by Sephadex G25 chromatography on a 5-ml column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0. The specific activity was 90 mCi/mg corresponding to a molar ratio of 125I:(66-98)PAI-2 of 0.17. Ten mg of recombinant PAI-2 were immobilized on 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Crude placental cytosol was prepared from term placentae obtained after normal deliveries at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital. The placental tissue was cut in approximately 4-g pieces, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. All of the following procedures were performed at 4°C. The placental tissue was homogenized using a conventional kitchen-type Waring blender for 3 × 15 s in 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mM iodoacetamide, 0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40000, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.8. The homogenate was cleared by successive centrifugation at 2200 rpm for 4 min and 40000 rpm for 60 min, discarding the pellet after each centrifugation. The cytosol preparation was stored at −80°C or directly passed over the PAI-2 affinity column. The latter was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Prior to elution, the column was washed in 30 ml of wash buffer (150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl, 0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40000, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2). PAI-2-binding proteins (PBPs) were eluted from the column by increasing the concentration of KCl to 1 M. The column was washed in 10 ml of 4 M urea followed by 20 ml of wash buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and 0.05% NaN3. The samples destined for 125I-labeled PAI-2 binding assays were made of 45% glycerol prior to storage at −20°C. The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Sigma). The PBPs, approximately 14 μg/ml, were coated on Polysorb microtiter plates (NUNC, Copenhagen, Denmark) in 0.2 M NaHCO3, pH 9.6, for 2 h on ice. The residual protein binding capacity was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. The plates were rinsed twice in binding buffer (150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0) prior to incubation with 100 μl of 125I-tracer (100,000 cpm/ml equivalent to approximately 50 pM) in binding buffer. All measurements were performed in four replicates with background values (wells were coated only with BSA) measured for each condition. The intraassay coefficient of variation was 2.5% on replicates. 125I-Labeled PAI-2 ligand blotting was performed on material resolved either by nondenaturing SDS-PAGE or 1% agarose electrophoresis. The samples for the SDS-PAGE, diluted 1:1 in 1% SDS-20 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, were neither heated nor reduced. The proteins were resolved by 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 16 h at 200 mA in a tank electroblotting apparatus (Hoefer). The membranes were blocked in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, plus 2% Tween-20 for 2 h at ambient temperature and then treated with 100 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 in the same buffer with 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4°C and washed extensively with the 0.05% Tween containing buffer. The filters were dried, and bound PAI-2 was detected by autoradiography using Amersham MP films at −80°C for 16 to 72 h. By this approach, 10 ng of urokinase plasminogen activator, used as a positive control, could be detected after autoradiography for 16 h. The samples for thin layer electrophoresis were diluted 1:1 in 75 mM barbital, 20% glycerol, pH 8.6, and resolved in 1-mm thick 1% agarose gels on a Pharmacia Multiphor, essentially as described (12Jensen P.H. Lorand L. Ebbesen P. Gliemann J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) was performed as described above, and the filter was quenched by 5% BSA for 2 h at 4°C prior to incubation with 1 nM125I-labeled PAI-2. Bound PAI-2 was detected by autoradiography. The human melanoma cell line M24met was cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mM glutamine as described previously (22Mueller B.M. Yu Y.B. Laug W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All culture surfaces were preincubated in the conditioned medium from the M24met cell line for 3 h at room temperature prior to seeding of the cells to improve the adhesion and spreading of the transfected cells. Cells were tested for Mycoplasma contamination by Hoechst staining (Boehringer Mannheim). For the induction of the PAI-2 expression, M24met cells were incubated in the presence of human recombinant TNF (Amersham Corp.) for 24 h prior to fixation for immunofluorescence studies. M24met cells were incubated in methionine-free RPMI medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) for 2 × 15 min prior to incubation for 5 h in the same buffer supplemented with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. For cross-linking of cellular proteins, cells were rinsed three times on ice with prechilled PBS, supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2, then incubated with 1 mM dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP; Pierce) in the Ca2+ and Mg2+ supplemented PBS for 30 min at 4°C. A 50 mM DSP stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide solution was prepared fresh. Cross-linking reactions were quenched by rinsing the cells three times in Tris-buffered saline, supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2. Cells were lysed on ice in PBS supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM EDTA (500,000/ml). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Equal aliquots of the supernatant were incubated with 5 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-PAI-2 IgG2a or 5 μg of rabbit anti-human recombinant PAI-2 IgG for 16 h at 4°C. The following agents were used as controls: (a) the equivalent amounts of nonimmune mouse IgG2a (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) or preimmune rabbit IgG; and (b) saturation of the antibody with 10 μg of recombinant human PAI-2 prior to incubation with the cell lysate. The IgG was collected by treating the lysates with 40 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h followed by centrifugation. The GammaBind-G Sepharose was washed seven times in 10 ml of 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and bound IgG was released by heating samples to 95°C for 3 min in SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 10% glycerol). Some samples were supplemented with 20 mM dithioerythritol to cleave the disulfide bridge in the cross-linker. All samples were resolved by 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized by fluorography after the gels had been impregnated in Amplify (Amersham Corp.). M24met cells were grown in four-well tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc). The cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 2 min at 4°C, rinsed in PBS, and incubated with (20 μg/ml) monoclonal anti-PAI-2 IgG in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 20°C. The primary antibody was detected by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled swine anti-rabbit (Dako, Denmark) for 30 min at 20°C. The culture slides were washed and mounted. Control labeling was performed without the primary antibody. The cells were examined using a Olympus BX50 immunofluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). We have used a crude placental cytosol preparation as a source for putative PAI-2-binding proteins because PAI-2 is abundantly expressed in this tissue. For the detection of PAI-2-binding proteins, the binding of 125I-PAI-2 was analyzed using a solid phase microtiter plate binding assay. The placental cytosolic preparation was passed over an affinity column containing immobilized recombinant human PAI-2. Fig. 1 demonstrates the elution of the proteins, designated PAI-2-binding proteins (PBPs), from the PAI-2 Sepharose column by increasing the ionic strength to 1 M KCl. The protein concentration of the eluted fractions correlated directly with the 125I-labeled PAI-2 binding activity. The binding of 50 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 to immobilized PBP was specific because it could be saturated by the presence of 1 μM PAI-2 (compare Fig. 2). Although elution of the affinity column with 50 mM glycine, pH 2.5, or 4 M urea produced a similar set of eluted proteins, no binding activity could be detected, despite neutralization or dilution of the eluate, respectively (data not shown). The binding activity of the proteins in 1 M KCl eluate was also demonstrated by a ligand blotting technique after the samples were resolved by native electrophoresis, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and incubated with 125I-labeled PAI-2 after a blocking step in BSA (data not shown). From 0.55 liter of the placental cytosol (containing 11.6 mg/ml of protein), we recovered 3 mg of PBP, representing approximately a 2000-fold purification.Fig. 2Association of 125I-labeled PAI-2 to immobilized PBP. PBP-coated microtiter wells were incubated with 50 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 for the indicated time prior to washing and counting of the bound 125I-labeled PAI-2 (•). The PBP-dependent binding (▴) is calculated by subtracting the binding to wells coated with BSA (▪) from the total binding (•). Nonspecific binding of 50 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 to PBP-coated wells was measured in the presence of 1 μM PAI-2 (□). The ordinate shows the percentage of bound tracer (% Bound). Each point represents the mean of four replicates in one of three experiments; bars, S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 2 demonstrates that the association of 50 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 to immobilized PBP reached a plateau by about 6 h at 4°C. The nonspecific absorption to the BSA-coated control wells was rapid and accounted for about 25% of the total binding. Dissociation experiments were performed by removing nonbound ligand in the wells and continuing the incubation in fresh buffer (data not shown). By 24 h, approximately 30% of the label had dissociated, whereas the amount of bound tracer remained unchanged when the nonbound tracer was left in the well. This demonstrates that the dissociation was not due to “leakage” of bound PBP from the solid phase surface. The rate of dissociation was not increased by inclusion of excess unlabeled ligand in the buffer (data not shown). The PAI-2 binding to immobilized PBP was sensitive to increased ionic strength and was completely inhibited by more than 0.4 M KCl (data not shown). The PBP was purified in Ca2+-free buffers. However, inclusion of 0.5 mM Ca2+ in the buffer caused an about 20% increase in the PAI-2 binding (data not shown). A striking characteristic of the binding was its sensitivity toward nonionic detergents as inclusion of 0.001% Triton X-100 in the assay buffer completely abrogated the binding (data not shown). The zwitterionic detergent CHAPS was tolerated at a concentration of 0.01% with only a 60% reduction in the specific binding activity (data not shown). Competition experiments demonstrated half saturation of the binding of 20 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 to PBP by 10 nM PAI-2 (Fig. 3B, left panel). The observed IC50 values ranged between 10 and 100 nM in four independent experiments (data not shown). To identify the protein binding domain of PAI-2, we used three PAI-2 constructs (Fig. 3A): a recombinant full-length human PAI-2 molecule; a recombinant deletion mutant lacking residues 66-98 (Δ(66-98)PAI-2); and a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 66-98. The Δ(66-98)PAI-2 mutant retains full proteinase inhibitory activity (10Jensen P.H. Schüler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Højrup P. Petersen T.E. Rasmussen L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15394-15398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, left panel, the wild-type PAI-2 molecule blocked the binding of 20 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 at concentrations between 100 pM and 1 μM. By contrast, the presence of 1 μMΔ(66-98)PAI-2 did not inhibit the tracer binding significantly, suggesting that this region of PAI-2 was responsible for binding PBP. To test this possibility further, we evaluated the synthetic peptide (66-98)PAI-2 as a competitor for the binding of wild-type PAI-2. A complete inhibition of the 125I-labeled PAI-2 tracer binding was observed, although about 100-fold higher competitor concentration of the peptide was needed as compared to the wild-type molecule (Fig. 3B, left panel). The number of PAI-2 binding sites was estimated to 1 × 10−13 mol/well, assuming a 1:1 stochiometry in the binding of 10% of the 10 nM PAI-2. This corresponds to 4 ng of protein, assuming a molecular mass of 40 kDa, and is in accordance with the amount of protein that can be immobilized in microtiter wells. Furthermore, direct binding of 125I-labeled (66-98)PAI-2 peptide to PBP was saturable by PAI-2 or (66-98)PAI-2 (Fig. 3B, left panel). Finally, the importance of this domain for the binding of PAI-2 to PBP was supported by studies using a rabbit serum raised against the (66-98)PAI-2 peptide (Fig. 3B, right panel). As compared to the control samples incubated with 100 μg/ml nonimmune rabbit IgG, the anti-(66-98)PAI-2 peptide IgG inhibited the binding by about 55% to about a level obtained by IgG raised against the recombinant PAI-2. Thus, the exon 3 encoded PAI-2 structure, making up the CD interhelical region, represents a protein binding domain with specificity for cytosolic PAI-2-binding proteins. Serpins inhibit their target proteinases by forming tight complexes with the catalytic site of the proteinase. Fig. 4 shows that the binding of PAI-2 to PBP does not abrogate its function as an inhibitor because the PBP-bound PAI-2 still can bind the catalytic domain of the proteinase urokinase plasminogen activator. Experimentally, microtiter wells were coated with PBP followed by quenching of the excess protein binding capacity of the plastic with BSA. Control wells were blocked in BSA alone. The wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PAI-2, and the antiproteolytic function of the bound PAI-2 was probed by incubation with 125I-labeled uPA. The binding of 125I-labeled uPA was both dependent on the amount of PBP immobilized and on the amount of added PAI-2. The uPA binding was specific because 100 nM unlabeled uPA completely abrogated the PBP-dependent tracer binding. Maximal PBP-dependent binding was obtained at a PAI-2 concentration about 0.4 μg/ml. Analysis of the placental cytosolic proteins eluted from the PAI-2 affinity column by reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, left) revealed a complex mixture of proteins ranging from more than 250 kDa to approximately 35 kDa. The absent binding of the Δ(66-98)PAI-2 to immobilized PBP suggested that all of the PAI-2 binding exclusively took place via the CD-interhelical region. PAI-2 reactive proteinases reacting with the reactive site loop would, as such, not be expected. Still, the absent detection of proteins binding to the reactive site loop might have been due to the solid phase microtiter plate assay. To address this question, we used a 125I-labeled PAI-2 blotting assay (Fig. 6) capable of demonstrating PAI-2 reactive proteinases. PBP or the proteinases (uPA and tPA) were resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane; then PAI-2 reactive proteins were detected after incubation with 125I-labeled PAI-2 followed by autoradiography. We did not anticipate any binding to the detergent sensitive CD-interhelical binding PBPs because the samples were treated with SDS prior to electrophoresis. By this technique, 10 ng of two-chain uPA but not noninhibitory single-chain pro-uPA was readily detected (Fig. 6, lane 1 versus lane 2). Activation of the single-chain uPA to two-chain uPA by in situ plasmin treatment allowed 125I-labeled PAI-2 binding (Fig. 6, lane 5). Similar results were obtained with tissue-type plasminogen activator, where the single-chain form also bound 125I-labeled PAI-2, although as expected to a lower extent than the two-chain form (data not shown). When 15 μg of aliquots of PBP were analyzed, no 125I-labeled PAI-2-binding proteins were detected, even after plasmin treatment (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 6). Longer exposure of the blot also gave no signal (data not shown). Thus, neither the two-chain nor single-chain PAs are present in the PBP elution fractions at significant levels. Since this technique probably would detect other proteinases with specificity for PAI-2, we infer that they are also absent from the preparation.Fig. 6125I-PAI-2 ligand blotting to PAI-2-binding proteinases. Ten ng of two-chain (lanes 1 and 4), single-chain uPA (lanes 2 and 5), and 15 μg of PBP (lanes 3 and 6) were resolved by nonreducing 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The filters were blocked with Tween 20, incubated with 100 pM125I-labeled PAI-2 for 16 h at 4°C, and washed; bound PAI-2 was detected by autoradiography. Lanes 4-6 were incubated with 1 μg/ml plasmin for 30 min at 20°C prior to incubation with the PAI-2 tracer to proteolytically activate the single-chain uPA (lane 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify PAI-2-binding proteins, we mixed PBPs with a [35S]methionine-labeled human keratinocyte extract and resolved the sample by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and then subjected to fluorography. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained PBP spots that colocalized with [35S]methionine-labeled keratinocyte proteins in the fluorogram were compared with the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis keratinocyte data base (23Celis J.E.

Among the proteins resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, annexin I was one of the predominant PBP proteins, whereas actin and albumin were absent (data not shown). The latter two are markers of nonspecific absorption of abundant intra- and extracellular proteins. The identity of annexin I in the PBP preparation was verified by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-human annexin I antibody (Fig. 5, right panel). Annexin I belongs to a highly conserved gene family representing major intracellular proteins. Structurally, they are composed of a variable short N terminus followed by a larger conserved C terminus, the latter containing four to eight repeated copies of a homologous Ca2+ and phospholipid binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W2028794912,"The sequence NYKKPKL in the NH2 terminus of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 has been proposed to affect the long term activities of FGF-1 through its function as a nuclear translocation signal or its role in stabilization of the structure required to sustain binding and activation of the transmembrane receptor kinase. A dynamic molecular model of FGF-1 docked into a duplex of the FGF receptor ectodomain and a hexadecameric heparin chain suggests that the NYKKPKL sequence does not directly interact with heparin or the receptor, but rather the lysine-leucine residues within the sequence indirectly stabilize a major receptor-binding domain. Concurrent with a marked increase in dependence on exogenous heparin for optimal activity, sequential deletion of residues in the NYKKPKL sequence in FGF-1 resulted in a progressive loss of thermal stability, resistance to protease, mitogenic activity, and affinity for the transmembrane receptor. The largest change resulted from deletion of the entire sequence through the lysine-leucine residues. In the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of heparin, the deletion mutants exhibited mitogenic activity equal to wild-type FGF-1. The results confirm that a primary role of the NYKKPKL sequence domain is to maintain the structural integrity of FGF-1 required for optimal binding to and activation of the heparan sulfate-transmembrane receptor complex.

FGF-(28-154), a form in which the nuclear translocation sequence 21NYKKPKL27 had been deleted, bound to the tyrosine kinase receptor and activated kinase activity and immediate early gene expression but failed to elicit a mitogenic response in cultured fibroblasts equal to that of a wild-type isoform, FGF-(21-154), containing the sequence (1Imamura T.

Subsequent results revealed that FGF(28-154) and several mutants with substitutions in the 21NYKKPKL27 sequence of FGF-(21-154) promoted levels of mitogenic activity much more similar to wild-type FGF-(21-154) when they were purified by cation exchange rather than reversed phase chromatography (2Friedman S.

In this report, we show that a model of FGF-1 that results after performance of molecular dynamics calculations on the ligand docked into a complex of heparin and the FGF receptor kinase ectodomain (hereafter referred to as FGFR1β) predicts that the nuclear translocation sequence 21NYKKPKL27, particularly Lys26 and Leu27, play a role in stability and structure of a key domain of FGF-1 that directly interacts with the receptor. Sequential deletion of residues 21NYK23, 21NYKKP25, and 21NYKKPKL27 in FGF-(21-154) caused progressive changes in stability, dependence on heparin, and mitogenic activity of FGF-1. The results suggest that the NYKKPKL sequences play a role in structural integrity of FGF-1 that is required for optimal interaction with and activation of the heparan sulfate-transmembrane receptor complex. Atomic models of a ternary complex of FGF, heparin, and the two immunoglobulin (Ig) loops of FGFR1β (3Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L.

Mitchell W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4186-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Details of construction, properties, and predictive features of the model are described in more detail in separate reports. 2M. Kan, F. Wang, M. Kan, J. L. Gabriel, and W. L. McKeehan, submitted for publication. 3Y. Luo, W. Lu, F. Wang, M. Kan, J. L. Gabriel, and W. L. McKeehan, manuscript in preparation. Ternary complexes were constructed from the crystal structure coordinates for bovine FGF-1 (1BAR) and human FGF-2 (3FGF), the CL region of a mouse Fab fragment (2IGF) (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank), and a hexadecameric polysaccharide chain of heparin. Since both Ig loops II and III of FGFR1β are structurally homologous to the CL region of IgG, the x-ray coordinates of the backbone atoms of the region were used as a structural template for each of the FGFR1β loops placed in tandem and separated by the FGFR1β interloop sequence. Heparin-binding sequences in proteins typically consist of two basic amino acids, most frequently arginine and lysine, that are located 20 apart facing opposite directions of an α-helix or β-strand structure (7Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other basic amino acids are often dispersed between the two ends. The 20-Å interval accommodates a pentasaccharide. On the basis of experimental data from the literature, Margalit et al. (7Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the heparin-binding domain of FGF-2 conforms to the above paradigm and is composed of discontinuous sequence residues 33-54 and 119-149. Throughout this study, the numbering system for full-length native products of both FGF-1 and FGF-2, beginning with the NH2-terminal acetyl-alanine as residue 1, is used. It has been demonstrated that a dodecamer from native heparin appears to be the minimum oligosaccharide in respect to length that will support the mitogenic activity of FGF-2, although shorter oligosaccharides can bind independently to FGF (4Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FGFR1β.3 A decameric or shorter oligosaccharide antagonizes the activity of heparin (4Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).3 The contiguous 20-amino acid sequence in the NH2 terminus of Ig loop II of FGFRβ1, which has been identified as a primary heparin-binding domain (3Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) also generally conforms to the structure proposed by Margalit et al. (7Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When FGF-2 and FGFR1β were docked together in an orientation to accommodate experimental data from our laboratory and the FGF literature and molecular dynamics calculations were performed, it was apparent that the heparin-binding domains of FGF-2 and the FGFR1β ectodomain formed a contiguous S-shaped channel that could accommodate a single oligosaccharide of heparin of 10-12 units. To ensure occupancy of all available sites within the heparin-binding domains of both FGFR1β and FGF, we chose to construct a hexadecameric heparin chain that is four residues longer than the dodecamer that is necessary for mitogenic activity of FGF (4Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the organic builder section within the main Biograf program, a model of heparin was constructed from 16 alternating monomeric units of sulfated D-glucosamine and L-iduronic acid using α-1,4-linkages. The resulting hexadecameric chain was then subjected to molecular dynamics calculations. The resultant hexadecameric chain of heparin was then initially docked into the heparin-binding sequences of FGF-2 (residues 33-54 and 119-149) suggested by Margalit et al. (7Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be important for binding to heparin. Subsequent to docking the heparin-FGF-2 complex into the FGFR1β ectodomain, the energy of the complex was minimized to convergence. The interaction among components of the ternary complex was then further refined by performance of molecular dynamics calculations after the docking process. A model of the ternary complex containing FGF-1 was constructed by the same process. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed as described (6Gabriel J.L. Mitchell W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4186-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More recently, divalent cations have been integrated into the above models at sites of maximum coordination among receptor, heparin, and ligand residues2,3 but are not shown in the illustrations in this report. Human FGF-1α cDNA (8Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hereafter referred to as FGF-(21-154), was used as a template in the polymerase chain reaction to generate cDNAs coding for the FGF-1 products summarized in Fig. 1. cDNA products were generated between different sense oligonucleotide primers each containing an NdeI restriction site and a common antisense primer containing a BglII site. All polymerase chain reactions were performed for 40 cycles at 93°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min. Sense primers used were 5′-GGCATATGGCTAAGCCCAAACTCCTCTACTGT-3′ for FGF-(24-154), 5′-CGCATATGGCTAAACTCCTCTACTGTAGCAAC-3′ for FGF-(26-154), and 5′-CCCATATGGCTCTCTACTGTAGCAACGGGGGC-3′ for FGF-(28-154). An antisense primer, 5′-GCAGATCTTTAATCAGAAGAGACTGG-3′, common to the 3′-region of the FGF-1α cDNA template was used. The polymerase chain reaction products were isolated and purified by electroelution, digested with NdeI and BglII, and cloned into the pET-3c vector between NdeI and BamHI sites. Each construct in the pET-3c vector was used to transform the expression host, BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI), and single colonies of the cells containing each recombinant vector were selected on ampicillin-containing plates. The sequence for each construct was confirmed using T3 and T7 primers with the Sequenase Quick-Denature Plasmid Sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in pBluescript ll SK(+/−) plasmid at the EcoRV site. Recombinant bacteria were grown in 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37°C and then diluted to 200 ml with the same medium and incubated until the A600 reached 0.5-0.6. Expression of recombinant FGF-1 products was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 50 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM glucose, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then freeze-thawed three times and sonicated for 2.5 min (25 s with pauses of 20 s). After centrifugation at 17,200 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl in TE buffer at pH 7.2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated by rotation in an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) with 1 ml of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4°C for 2 h. After settling, the beads were washed sequentially with 20 ml of TE buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and then 20 ml containing 0.7 M NaCl. The recombinant proteins were eluted with 1.2 M NaCl in TE buffer, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2), and purified by reversed phase HPLC as described (9Crabb J.W. Armes L.G. Carr S.A. Johnson C.M. Roberts G.D. Bordoli R.S. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4988-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The FGF-1 products were stored in PBS or 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at −20°C. Purified products were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver stain. Immunoblots were performed as described (10Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-FGF-1 monoclonal antibody Y16K and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig as second antibody. To enhance yields of FGF-(28-154), which were significantly reduced by using the conditions described above for production of wild-type FGF-1 and the other mutants, expression of FGF-(28-154) was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 25°C instead of 37°C. Precautions were taken to maintain all solutions at 4°C and minimize the interval from production to recovery of purified product. All solutions prior to reversed phase HPLC contained 10 mM EDTA and 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sonication time was shortened to 1 min, and incubation time with heparin-Sepharose was shortened to 10 min. Eluates from heparin-Sepharose were dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 3) overnight to remove elution salts and stored in 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at −20°C. Relative sensitivity to heat was determined by heating samples of wild-type FGF-1 and the mutants at the indicated concentrations in PBS (pH 7.2) at different times at 85°C in the presence or absence of heparin (25 μg/ml). Heparin was then adjusted to 25 μg/ml in all samples, and the stimulatory activity of a portion of each sample on DNA synthesis in MK and NIH 3T3 cells at 10 ng/ml was determined. Sensitivity to trypsin was determined by treatment of the sample of wild-type FGF-(21-154) and FGF-(28-154) (500 ng/ml) with 200 ng/ml trypsin in PBS or 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM MgCl2 for 2 or 4 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of heparin (25 μg/ml) followed by analysis of the remaining FGF-1 antigen by immunoblot. DNA synthesis was assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into quiescent mouse keratinocytes (MK) and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts as described (11Kan M. Shi E. McKeehan W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Test samples and heparin (25 μg/ml) were added at the indicated concentrations followed by the addition of [3H]thymidine 16 h later. After 6 h, the cells were solubilized with 0.5 M NaOH, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Native bovine FGF-1 was iodinated, and 125I-FGF-1 binding to specific receptor sites was distinguished from heparan sulfate sites as described previously (11Kan M. Shi E. McKeehan W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Confluent MK or NIH 3T3 cells in 24-well plates were incubated in the absence of added FGF-1 in serum-free medium for 24 h. Fresh medium containing 125I-labeled native FGF-1 (2 ng/ml) and the indicated concentrations of recombinant FGF-1 products in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml heparin was added, and incubation was performed at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS, with PBS containing 250 μg/ml heparin, and then with PBS again before extraction with 1% Triton X-100. The detergent extract was counted in a γ-counter. Neither current experimental results nor molecular models of individual components or the ternary complex of FGF, FGFR1β, and heparin indicated obvious direct contacts or interaction of the 21NYKKPKL27 sequence domain in FGF-1 or its counterpart (24HFKDPKR30) in FGF-2 (Fig. 1) with FGFR1β or heparin (12Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D.R. Lear J.D.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).2,3 Therefore, we looked for internal contacts and interactions within FGF-1 and FGF-2 that might indirectly impact structure and stability. No obvious interactions were noted within the static crystal structures of FGF-1 (14Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham A. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), FGF-2 (14Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham A. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C.

Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed an atomic model of the ternary complex of FGF, a single heparin chain, and FGFR1β (3Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 4Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol.

Dev. 1994; 39: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and then looked for new FGFR1β, heparin, or internal interactions of residues within the NH2-terminal sequence domains. After performance of molecular dynamics calculations on the ternary complex, interactions became apparent that involved the NH2-terminal sequence domain within both FGF-2 and FGF-1 that might indirectly impact the structure of important functional domains that interact with the FGFR1β-heparin complex. Basic residues Lys29 and Arg30 of FGF-2 each fit into negatively charged pockets formed by residues at the head of distinct loop structures within FGF-2 formed by sequence residues 72-104 and 38-49, respectively (Fig. 2A). The carbonyl of Ser72 and the carbonyl and carboxyl of Glu104 on each end of loop 72-104 are in proximity to Lys29 of FGF-2. In our models, the loop structure shown in pink in Fig. 2A that is between residues 72-104 within FGF-2 engages Ig Loop III of FGFR1β3 and contains a residue (Arg89) that has been implicated experimentally in the interaction of FGF-2 with heparin (12Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Substitution of Glu104 with Ala, Gln, or Lys significantly reduces the affinity of FGF-2 for FGFR1β (19Zhu H. Ramnarayan K. Anchin J. Miao W.Y. Sereno A. Millman L. Zheng J. Balaji V.N. Wolff M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21869-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). FGF-2 residues 49-56 form a loop structure shown in red in Fig. 2A, which does not engage FGFR1β. The loop encounters heparin at Arg52 (see Footnote 3), which has not been implicated in the independent interaction of FGF-2 with heparin, either experimentally (12Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) or in the hexadecamer-FGF-2 crystal structure (18Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Arg30 of FGF-2 is in proximity to the carbonyl of Val51 and the carboxyls of Asp49 and Asp56 within loop 49-56. The positively charged side chain of Lys26 within the nuclear translocation sequence 21NYKKPKL27 of FGF-1, which is the counterpart of Lys29 in FGF-2, also fits into a negatively charged pocket formed by the carboxyl of Glu101 and the α-carbonyl of Val151 (Fig. 2, B and C). Val151 is three residues from the COOH terminus of FGF-1 predicted from cDNA; however, it is the COOH-terminal residue in the resolved crystal structure (14Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham A. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and is shown with a free α-carboxyl in Fig. 2C. Ile70 and Glu101 in FGF-1, which are at homologous positions to Ser72 and Glu104 in FGF-2, are at the head of a homologous Ig loop III-binding domain 70-101 in FGF-1 (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast to Arg30 of FGF-2, the nonconserved counterpart Leu27 of FGF-1 is part of an extended hydrophobic interaction composed of residues Leu27, Leu58, Leu60, Ile70, and Leu149, which spans the entire FGF-1 sequence. This hydrophobic interaction is predicted to further stabilize the structure of the FGFR1β-binding loop 70-101. The participation of Leu149, which is at the COOH terminus of the major Ig loop II-binding domain of FGF-1 (residues 126-149) in this model, suggests that the extended interaction may have an impact on both FGFR1β-binding domains of FGF-1. In contrast to FGF-2, which exhibits heparin-binding residue Arg89 (12Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar)3 within the FGFR1β-binding loop bounded by Ser72 and Glu104, the counterpart FGFR1β-binding loop between residues Ile70 and Glu101 in FGF-1 shown in pink in Fig. 2B exhibits no interaction with heparin.3 FGF-1 residues Gly85-Gln91 on one side of loop 70-101 lie parallel to, but approximately 10 Å away from, the heparin chain bound to the contiguous channel formed by the heparin-binding domains of FGF-1 and FGFR1β (Fig. 2B). The ordered structure of FGF-1 resolved by crystallography begins with Pro25 (14Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham A. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To determine whether residues NH2-terminal to Pro25 might also contribute to the internal structure of FGF-1 when present in a model ternary receptor complex, we added the 21NYKK24 sequence to FGF-1 in the current model,3 and after performance of molecular dynamic calculations we looked for interactions of residues within the sequence with downstream structural domains in FGF-1 (data not shown). The exercise suggested that side chains of Lys23 and Lys24 are sufficiently near the negatively charged side chain of Glu63, which in turn is near Lys26, to result in electrostatic interactions that may impact the orientation of the loop formed between residues 46 and 56 of FGF-1. Loop 46-56 (Fig. 2B) is the counterpart of loop 49-56 in FGF-2 (Fig. 2A). Similar to the FGF-2 counterpart, the FGF-1 loop 46-56 does not engage the receptor, but rather interacts with heparin through residues Arg49 and Arg51.3. In sum, dynamic molecular models of FGF-1 within a ternary complex of heparin and FGFR1β predict that the NH2-terminal sequence of FGF-1, 21NYKKPKL27, and particularly, Lys26 and Leu27, plays an important role in stabilization of the FGF-1 structure that indirectly affects the interaction with the heparan sulfate and the FGFR1β components of the complex and consequently mitogenic activity. Wild-type FGF-(21-154) and mutant products with the above NH2-terminal deletions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantitation by immunoblot and amino acid sequence of yield during production and purification of the four recombinant products revealed that specifically FGF-(28-154) was severely reduced at steps prior to purification on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography relative to the other three products. Production and recovery procedures were optimized in order to enhance yields of specifically FGF-(28-154) and to standardize quantities of all four constructs by immunoblot and amino acid analysis prior to use in experiments (Fig. 3, inset). Since the results indicated that specifically FGF-(28-154) was either unstable or susceptible to proteolytic activity under the conditions used in production and recovery, we compared the sensitivity to heat and trypsin of FGF-(26-154) and FGF-(28-154) to that of wild-type FGF-(21-154). Previous studies have indicated that heparin confers enhanced thermal stability and resistance to trypsin on wild-type FGF-(21-154) (20Rosengart T.K. Johnson W.V. Friesel R. Clark R. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Volkin D.B. Tsai P.K. Dabora J.M. Gress J.O. Burke C.J. Linhardt R.J. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the presence of heparin, loss of 50% of the mitogenic activity of wild-type FGF-(21-154) for MK required heating at 85°C for over 60 min, while loss of 50% of the mitogenic activity of FGF-(28-154) occurs after only 10 min (Fig. 3, MK). In the absence of heparin, loss of activity in FGF-(28-154) was complete within 5 min, while 50% of the activity of wild-type remained after 40 min. In the presence of heparin, deletion mutant FGF-(26-154) exhibited a significant, but much less dramatic, decrease in thermal stability relative to that observed with FGF-(28-154). However, FGF-(26-154) was only slightly more stable than FGF-(28-154) in the absence of heparin (Fig. 3, MK). The thermal stability of FGF-(24-154) was only slightly less than that of wild-type FGF-(21-154) (data not shown). Although both wild-type and the mutant constructs appeared overall more labile under the same conditions when assayed for stimulation of DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells, the differential stability between constructs was similar to that observed in MK cells (Fig. 3). Currently this cell type-dependent difference in activity of heat-treated FGF-1 constructs, both wild-type and deletion mutants, as well as the apparent initial increase in activity of heat-treated wild-type FGF-1 in 3T3 cells is unexplained. It may be related to the difference in repertoire of endogenous heparan sulfates or proteases displayed between the two cell types. Controlled experiments designed to test the heparin-dependent resistance of the recombinant products to protease revealed that, in the presence of the same levels of heparin, FGF-(28-154) was completely digested after a 2-h exposure to trypsin, while wild-type FGF-(21-154) was completely resistant after a 4-h incubation (Fig. 4). Extension of the incubation period overnight resulted in less than 20% degradation of the wild-type product (data not shown). Mitogenic activity of wild-type FGF-(21-154) and mutant products FGF-(24-154), FGF-(26-154), and FGF-(28-154) was assessed by stimulation of DNA synthesis in cultured MK and NIH 3T3 cells in the presence and absence of 25 μg/ml heparin. In the presence of heparin, all three mutants supported peak levels of DNA synthesis that were 85% of that supported by wild-type FGF-1 in both the MK (Fig. 5) and NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). Stimulatory activity of wild-type FGF-(21-154) and mutant products FGF-(24-154), FGF-(26-154), and FGF-(28-154) was half-maximal at concentrations of 70, 100, 110, and 500 pg/ml, respectively, in MK cells (Fig. 5) and 100, 300, 400, and 1000 pg/ml, respectively, in 3T3 cells (data not shown). In the absence of heparin, mutants FGF-(24-154) and FGF-(26-154) supported peak levels of DNA synthesis that were 70% that of wild-type FGF-(21-154). However, about 8 times more (800 pg/ml) of mutant FGF-(26-154) was required to support a half-maximal stimulation than wild-type FGF-(21-154) and deletion mutant FGF-(24-154) (100 pg/ml). Mutant FGF-(28-154) exhibited the most dramatic increase in dependence on heparin. In absence of heparin, a concentration greater than 100 ng/ml of mutant FGF-(2"

CA1P is a branched chain, phosphorylated sugar acid (1Gutteridge S. Parry M.A.J. Burton S. Keys A.J. Mudd A. Feeney J. Servaites J.C. Pierce J.

Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 13-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose parent sugar is commonly known as hamamelose. At dawn, CA1P is released from the catalytic site of Rubisco by Rubisco activase (6Robinson S. Portis A.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 413-416Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and rendered noninhibitory by a specific CA1P phosphatase, which converts it to 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol (CA) and inorganic phosphate (7Holbrook G.P. Bowes G. Salvucci M. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 673-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gutteridge S. Julien B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 225-230Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Kingston-Smith A.H.

CA, administered to leaves through the petiole, is converted to CA1P in a subsequent period of darkness (11Moore B.d. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, since CA is present in species that make little CA1P, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (10Moore B.d.

The ready conversion of CA into CA1P in the leaf tissue of some plants, taken together with the identification of CA1P phosphatase, led to the conclusion that CA1P and CA participate in a metabolic substrate cycle in vivo, remote from mainstream metabolism (11Moore B.d. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, Andralojc et al. (13Andralojc P.J. Dawson G.W. Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated that up to 8% of recently assimilated carbon could be incorporated into CA1P and CA. This indicates a considerable flux of new carbon from Calvin cycle intermediates into CA and CA1P. Of the Calvin cycle intermediates, the most obvious potential precursor is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) which undergoes intramolecular rearrangement in vivo and in vitro to form hamamelose 21,5-bisphosphate (HBP) (14Gilck H. Beck E. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1974; 72: 395-409Crossref Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion is the increased incorporation of newly assimilated radiolabel into CA1P when assimilation takes place at low irradiance (13Andralojc P.J. Dawson G.W. Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); conditions under which FBP concentrations would be relatively high (15Sassenrath-Cole G.F. Pearcy R.W. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In leaves of an alpine primrose (Primula clusiana Tausch), HBP is metabolized to hamamelose 21-phosphate, hamamelose 5-phosphate and hamamelose (14Gilck H. Beck E. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1974; 72: 395-409Crossref Google Scholar, 16Beck E. Encycl. Plant Physiol. (New Series). 1982; 13A: 124-157Google Scholar). Hamamelose (2-hydroxymethyl-D-ribose) is very widely distributed among plant species (17Sellmair J. Beck E. Kandler O. Kress A. Phytochem. 1977; 16: 1201-1204Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, radiolabeled hamamelose was prepared in order to explore its metabolism in leaves. It was specifically metabolized to CA in the light and to CA and CA1P in the dark. These results therefore provide a link, through hamamelose, between CA1P (or CA) and reports of the synthesis of HBP from FBP. Hamamelitannin (2 molecules of gallic acid esterified to hamamelose) (18Shafizadeh F. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1956; 11: 263-283Google Scholar) was isolated from the bark of witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) according to the method of Gilck et al. (19Gilck H. Thanbickler A. Sellmair J. Beck E. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 39: 160-161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The tannin was hydrolyzed using tannase (ICN Biomedicals Ltd., UK), and the hydrolysate was treated with Dowex 50-H+, followed by neutralization with Dowex-1 carbonate. Such treatment removed the gallic acid and further decolorized the sample. Approximately 800 mg of the liberated sugar (dissolved in 40 ml of H2O) were resolved chromatographically using a (60 g/60 g) charcoal/Celite column (46 cm × 2.5-cm diameter), eluted with a gradient of 0-10% (v/v) ethanol in water at 0.7 ml·min−1, in 24 h, at room temperature. Approximately 300 mg of pure hamamelose were recovered from the effluent collected between 11 and 14 h. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra obtained for this purified product (in D2O) were diagnostic of hamamelose (20Schilling G. Keller A. Liebigs Ann.

Gutteridge (DuPont). 100 mM TEA-acetate, pH 7.5. After 60 min at 25°C, the mixture was acidified (pH 1.5) with Dowex 50-H+. Glacial acetic acid was added to a concentration of 0.3 M and the mixture transferred to a glass tube with a Rotaflo stopcock. 2.9 mg of hydrogenated Pd/BaSO4 catalyst (Sigma, UK) in H2O were added, and the tube was flushed repeatedly with hydrogen gas, finally being left under 1 atmosphere of hydrogen for 6 h at 25°C with constant agitation, recharging with hydrogen after the 1st h. The catalyst was sedimented, and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.0 with 1 M TEA. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −70°C, until HPLC separation of the resulting diastereoisomers (see below). French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Tendergreen) and wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Alexandria) were grown in a glasshouse with supplementary lighting to ensure a photoperiod of 16 h, with a minimum photon flux density (PFD) of approximately 200 μmol·m−2·s−1. Leaves were harvested between 14 and 21 days after sowing. 10 discs were cut from seedling leaves of P. vulgaris using a cork borer of 13-mm diameter. Stacks of 10 discs accumulated in the cork borer were transferred to the bottom of a 10-ml plastic syringe barrel. Just prior to infiltration, the plunger of the syringe was pushed into place to exert gentle pressure on the stack of discs. Syringes containing the disc samples were supported vertically in a large vacuum desiccator with their nozzles submerged in 0.5 ml of [14C]hamamelose (4 × 106 dpm; 58 mCi·mmol−1) or [14C]CA (2.2 × 106 dpm; 55.3 mCi·mmol−1) held in a small glass cup. (In some experiments, inhibitors were infiltrated along with hamamelose; see Table II.) A vacuum was applied until the substrate solution began to boil (2.3 kPa, 20°C). The desiccator was held at this vacuum for 20 s, and then air was readmitted. The solution filled the space below the plunger and entered all the leaf discs, giving complete infiltration. The discs were quickly removed and spread out in plastic Petri dishes, with their upper surfaces downward, without removing adhering substrate solution (which served to attach the discs to base of the dish). To prevent desiccation, the lids of the Petri dishes were lined with a wet filter paper. The dishes were inverted under metal halide lamps, providing a PFD of 200 μmol·m−2·s−1, followed by a period of darkness (as indicated) prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen, to await analysis. The samples of 10 discs weighed approximately 0.25 g, fresh weight (fw). In experiments using wheat seedlings, 1-cm leaf strips (totalling 0.25 g, fw, per sample) were treated in the same wayTable IIInhibition of CA and CA1P synthesis from hamamelose by DTT and sodium fluorideTreatment[14C]Hamamelose[14C]CA[14C]CA1P%Control31.264.34.5DTT10 mM80.518.21.350 mM98.11.90NaF20 mM93.56.30.1100 mM98.91.10 Open table in a new tab Infiltrated, frozen leaf material was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and mixed rapidly with 1 ml of ice-cold 3.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 0.15% (w/v) 8-hydroxyquinoline.

The treated extracts were evaporated to dryness in vacuo over NaOH pellets and anhydrous CaCl2, then immediately rehydrated and stored at −25°C, awaiting HPLC. Extracts to be analyzed for hamamelose were neutralized with Dowex 1 carbonate directly after the Dowex 50 treatment, before freezing. Leaf material infiltrated with [14C]CA was subsequently analyzed for [14C]CA1P. In this case, CA1P was extracted as a complex with Rubisco, after which the protein was separated from low molecular weight components by gel filtration (1Gutteridge S. Parry M.A.J. Burton S.

We used a Bio-LC chromatography system (Dionex, UK) with a pulsed amperometric detector (PAD; Dionex, UK) or a radioisotope detector (RID; Berthold LB507A fitted with solid scintillant flow cell YG 150; EG & G Berthold, UK). The absolute radioactivity (disintegrations/min) of resolved solutes was determined by subjecting the fractionated eluate to liquid scintillation counting, in Ultima Gold scintillation mixture (Canberra Packard, UK).

The sample (in H2O) was carefully neutralized with NaOH and applied through a 1.0-ml injection loop. The column was regenerated for 10 min with 0.05 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0 (see Fig. 3).

A known weight (between 0.90 and 1.50 g, fw) of leaf material from P. vulgaris was extracted as described above in 2 ml of 3.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, containing 10.5 nmol of radiolabeled hamamelose (2.8 mCi mmol−1). Hamamelose was purified from these extracts and the endogenous hamamelose deduced from the dilution of radiolabel, as evidenced by the altered PAD/radioactivity ratio, using a similar approach to that described for the quantitation of CA1P (12Moore B.d. Kobza J. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The peak of radioactivity with an identical retention time to CA, derived from leaf material infiltrated with radiolabeled hamamelose (Fig. 3, track B), was collected and treated with an excess of Dowex 50-H+. Hydrochloric acid was then added, to a final concentration of 10 mM (pH ≈ 3), and the sample was evaporated in vacuo over NaOH pellets and anhydrous CaCl2. Just before subsequent HPLC analyses, the samples were rehydrated in water (Fig. 4) or 5 mM H2SO4 (Fig. 6). The peak of radioactivity with an identical retention time to CA1P, derived from leaf material infiltrated with radiolabeled hamamelose (Fig. 3, track B), was treated with Dowex 50-H+, followed by evaporation in vacuo, over NaOH pellets and anhydrous CaCl2. The sample was dissolved in 0.3 ml of 10 mM TEA. Two units of alkaline phosphatase (bovine intestine, Sigma, UK) were added, and the mixture was kept at 25°C for 2 h, after which it was mixed with 0.02 ml of Dowex 50-H+. The resulting solution was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5). Acid-stable neutral plus anionic metabolites, derived from hamamelose-infiltrated leaf material, were resolved by anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 3) and collected in a series of 0.5-ml fractions as they emerged from the column. Aliquots (35 μl) were incubated for 5 min in 0.5 ml of 100 mM Bicine, pH 8.2 (NaOH), 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, and 10 μg of Rubisco (previously carbamylated by exposure to the same concentrations of Bicine, MgCl2, and NaHCO3, for 40 min at 37°C). Rubisco activity was then determined, following addition of 0.5 ml of 100 mM Bicine, pH 8.2 (NaOH), 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaH14CO3 (0.5 mCi mmol−1), and 0.66 mM ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The assay was stopped with 0.1 ml of 10 M formic acid after 5 min. The samples were oven-dried, and the acid-stable 14C was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Witch hazel bark was a generous gift from Berk (Materials for Industry) Ltd., Basingstoke, Berkshire, UK. [21-14C]-Radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled CA, CA1P, and 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CABP) were synthesized as described previously (9Kingston-Smith A.H. Major I. Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and either potassium [14C]cyanide (Amersham, UK) or nonradiolabeled potassium cyanide. NaH14CO3 was obtained from Amersham, UK. Dowex resins (AG 50W-X8 and AG 1-X8) were supplied by Bio-Rad, UK. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Authentic hamamelose, from hamamelitannin, was resolved from common sugars by two distinct HPLC procedures. Thus, using anion exchange HPLC with 40 mM NaOH as eluent, hamamelose (retention time 16.0 min; Fig. 1, track C, peak 5) was fully resolved from galactose, glucose, fructose, and sucrose. It was also resolved from glucose, sucrose, and ribose by means of IMP HPLC, using 5 mM H2SO4 as eluent (retention time 15.5 min; Fig. 2, track A). These two HPLC procedures exploit different properties of hamamelose, and so their combined use provides a powerful tool in the separation of this sugar from complex mixtures (see below). Reduction of the products of the reaction of K14CN and D-ribulose 5-phosphate (see “Materials and Methods”) yielded two components that were resolved by anion exchange HPLC, with retention times similar to sugar monophosphates and each accounting for 20-25% of the detected radiolabel. Radiolabel was also incorporated into an unresolved mixture of the 5-phosphates of 2-carboxyarabinitol and 2-carboxyribitol (30-40% of radiolabel) and an unidentified neutral component (10-15% of label). The sugar constituent of only one of the sugar phosphate peaks had identical chromatographic properties to hamamelose, as evidenced by HPLC (Figs. 1, track B, and 2, track D) and also by TLC (not shown) and so was identified as 2-C-(hydroxymethyl)-D-ribose 5-phosphate (hamamelose 5-phosphate). The sugar liberated by phosphatase treatment of this compound was therefore [1-14C]hamamelose (using nomenclature adopted by Beck et al. (5Beck E. Scheibe R. Reiner J. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 13-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and was used in the following experiments. Leaf discs were vacuum-infiltrated with solutions of the [14C]hamamelose, illuminated (PFD 200 μmol·m−2·s−1) for 2 h, then placed in total darkness for 6 h. Analysis of the acid extracts by anion-exchange HPLC at neutral pH revealed three radiolabeled peaks (Fig. 3, track B). The first radiolabeled component to emerge from the column was neutral, having the same retention time as hamamelose (approximately 2.8 min; peak 1). This was followed by a weakly anionic component (peak 2), then a strongly anionic component (peak 3), and these had retention times identical to CA (6.2 min) and CA1P (15.7 min), respectively. Each of these peaks was subjected to further analysis to confirm their identities. Material from the neutral peak (Fig. 3, track B) was shown exclusively to be hamamelose, by means of IMP (Fig. 2, track C). This demonstrates that the hamamelose administered had not been metabolized to any other neutral component in the course of the experiment. When the component with the same retention time as CA (Fig. 3, track B, peak 2) was dehydrated in acid and then rehydrated immediately before anion exchange HPLC (at pH 6.0) it had a shorter retention time, consistent with a neutral compound. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows the elution profiles of [14C]CA standards before (track A) and after (track B) such treatment, as well as of the treated product of [14C]hamamelose metabolism (track C). This behavior is consistent with the formation of a lactone (which is uncharged) and would be expected if the compound were CA. Anion exchange HPLC at pH > 12 (i.e. at or above the pKa of sugar hydroxl groups) (23Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), using sodium hydroxide as eluent, gives baseline resolution of CA from other weakly anionic components (Fig. 5, track A), including gluconic acid (GA), which can also form a lactone. Under these conditions, the weakly anionic compound derived from [14C]hamamelose (Fig. 5, track C) runs as a single peak with the same retention time as the [14C]CA standard (Fig. 5, track B). Finally, both authentic CA and the weakly anionic product of hamamelose metabolism were dehydrated/rehydrated in dilute mineral acid (to ensure complete lactonization) prior to IMP. Again, the compound in question yielded a single peak (Fig. 6, track C) with the same elution profile as the CA (lactone) control (Fig. 6, track B). Furthermore, 96% of the applied radiolabel was recovered in each of the peaks (of tracks B and C). We concluded that this compound was exclusively CA. The component with the same retention time as CA1P (Fig. 3, track B, peak 3) was collected as it emerged from the column, in a series of fractions, collected at 0.5-min intervals. Analysis of these fractions showed that radioactivity and ability to inhibit Rubisco coincided in three separate experiments (Fig. 7, A, B, and C), suggesting that radiolabeled CA1P had been formed. The amounts of CA1P present (60-80 nmol·g−1, fw) were estimated by reference to a standard CA1P-inhibition curve, constructed contemporaneously, and are similar to published values (12Moore B.d. Kobza J. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Andralojc P.J. Dawson G.W. Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phosphatase treatment of this compound, followed by anion exchange HPLC, yielded a single peak of radioactivity (Fig. 5, track E) with a retention time identical to that of an authentic sample of CA1P treated in the same way (track D), and of authentic CA (track B). Additionally, 97% of the radiolabel associated with the strongly anionic component was accounted for beneath the peak of track E (Fig. 5), following phosphatase treatment. This confirms the identity of the strongly anionic peak as exclusively CA1P. The conversion of infiltrated hamamelose exclusively into CA and CA1P by leaves of P. vulgaris strongly suggests that hamamelose is a precursor of these compounds in vivo, for which it must be present in the leaves of P. vulgaris. A combination of anion-exchange and IMP HPLC of the acid-stable, neutral compounds extracted from leaf material demonstrated the presence of hamamelose and allowed an estimate of its amount. An acid extract of leaves was treated with Dowex 50-H+ and then neutralized using excess Dowex 1 carbonate, prior to HPLC. The supernatant was first analyzed by anion exchange HPLC at high pH, yielding several components with short retention times, followed by three large peaks corresponding to glucose, fructose and sucrose. Finally, a single, small peak emerged with a retention time identical to that of hamamelose (Fig. 1, track A). This peak was collected and treated immediately with excess Dowex 50-H+ to remove Na+ ions and acidify. This was further resolved by IMP HPLC, revealing 2 major peaks (Fig. 2, track B). The first to emerge had a retention time similar to sucrose (track A), while the second, larger, peak had a retention time identical to that of hamamelose and was symmetrical, indicating base line resolution from other components. We concluded that this (latter) peak was hamamelose. A radioisotope dilution assay was conducted to measure the hamamelose content of leaves. This involved addition of 14C-labeled hamamelose of known specific radioactivity to the leaf material at the (initial) acid extraction, followed by isolation of the hamamelose in the extract by the two sequential HPLC fractionations.

The shM preparation consisted of equimolar amounts of polypeptides corresponding to an intact heavy chain, rod chain, essential light chain, and regulatory light chain. In electron micrographs the shape of shM showed the presence of a single head domain to which a normal looking rod was attached. Myosin and shM bound Ca2+ with association constants of 5 × 106 and 11 × 106M−1, respectively. The ATPase activity of shM was activated about 3-fold by Ca2+. Both heads of myosin and shM had comparable ATPase activities in the presence of Ca2+. The activation of the ATPase activity of single-headed scallop myosin by Ca2+ paralleled closely the Ca2+ binding, in sharp contrast to the activation of intact myosin by Ca2+, which is highly cooperative. Single turnover experiments of myosin with radioactive ATP gave a half-life for the ATPase cycle of ∼3 min in the presence of EGTA, whereas that of single-headed myosin was shorter than ∼30 s, which was the resolution time of these measurements.

Muscle myosins belong to class II of the myosin family (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These proteins consist of a pair of heavy chains (HCs), 1The abbreviations used are: HCheavy chainELCessential light chainRLCregulatory light chainshMsingle-headed myosinS1subfragment 1HMMheavy meromyosinMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineFTPformycin triphosphate. two ELCs, and two RLCs. Muscle myosins can be divided into three categories depending on the mode of activation by Ca2+. In skeletal muscles contraction occurs after the binding of Ca2+ to the thin filaments, which changes the interactions of the myosin cross-bridges with the actin filaments. In contrast to skeletal muscle myosin, smooth muscle and molluscan myosins are regulated molecules (cf. 2Adelstein R.S. Eisenberg E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 921-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin is regulated by phosphorylation of its RLC by a Ca2+-and calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. Contraction of molluscan muscles is regulated by binding of Ca2+ to myosin. The Ca2+ binding site of molluscan myosins is located in domain I of the ELC and is stabilized by specific contacts between the ELC and both the RLC and the HC (3Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The affinity for Ca2+ is preserved in the proteolytic fragments of myosin, regulatory domain, subfragment 1 (S1), and heavy meromyosin (HMM) (4Kwon H. Goodwin E.B. Nyitray L. Berliner E.

The structural requirements for the ELC, RLC, and HC that are needed for the formation of the specific Ca2+ binding site have been studied by the construction of hybrids between naturally occurring and mutant LCs and HCs (5Kwon H.

The structural features of the regulated smooth and molluscan muscle myosins that place the molecules in the off state have been studied by examining the properties of three proteolytic fragments of these myosins: S1, HMM, and shM. The single-headed S1 and the double-headed HMM are soluble, whereas shM forms filaments in conditions similar to those of the parent myosin. In contrast to HMMs, S1s derived from smooth and molluscan myosins are not regulated, suggesting a role for the presence of the two heads and/or the coiled coil rod in the regulation of these myosins (9Szent-Györgyi A.G.

The activating effect of Ca2+ on the ATPase activity of mixtures of single- and double-headed scallop myosin (prepared by papain digestion of scallop myosin) indicated that single-headed scallop myosin was regulated by Ca2+, since the increase of the ATPase activity of the preparations could not be attributed entirely to the presence of intact myosin (10Stafford W.F. Szentkiralyi E. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5273-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was calculated that Ca2+ increased the ATPase activity of shM by 3-4-fold These experiments supported the notion that the head-rod junction of molluscan myosins has an important role in regulation (10Stafford W.F. Szentkiralyi E. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5273-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, Cremo et al. (12Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar) obtained a pure single-headed smooth muscle myosin preparation, which was fully active in the absence of phosphorylation, showing that only the two-headed smooth muscle myosins are regulated molecules. A similar conclusion was reached from studies of expressed smooth muscle HMMs with short rod domains of different lengths that enabled them to exist in equilibrium between a monomeric and a dimeric form (13Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this article we report the purification and properties of a single-headed scallop myosin preparation. The data suggest that the presence of both heads and the attachment of the head to the coiled coil contribute to the “off” state of scallop myosin. Scallop myosin was prepared from the striated adductor muscle of Argopecten irradians as described previously (10Stafford W.F. Szentkiralyi E. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5273-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was suspended in 140 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7, at 6-10 mg/ml and digested with affinity-purified papain (14Funk M.O. Nakagawa Y. Skochdopole J. Kaiser E.T. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1979; 13: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 20°C, using a w/w ratio of myosin/papain of 2000. The digestion was stopped by adding leupeptin to 20 μg/ml, and the sample was diluted with 4 volumes of ice-cold water. The filaments were pelleted and washed three times by centrifugation in 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM Pi, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3 mM NaN3, 0.5 mM DTT, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7. Then MOPS was added to 20 mM, MgCl2 to 5 mM, and ATP to 0.5 mM, the pH was adjusted to 7, and the filaments were solubilized by the addition of NaCl to 0.6 M. The sample was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was diluted slowly with an equal volume of a solution containing 3 M ammonium sulfate, 40 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT, pH 6.8, and the sample (∼150 mg) was applied to a 25-ml column of Toyopearl ether 650 S (TosoHaas), equilibrated in 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM DTT, pH 6.8. Bound proteins were eluted with an 800-ml gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1.5 to 1 M. An aliquot of the collected fractions was dialyzed against 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM Pi, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaN3, and 0.5 mM DTT and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing shM were pooled and dialyzed against 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM Pi, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 3 mM NaN3, pH 7, and the formed filaments were collected by centrifugation and suspended in the same buffer. Native 4% polyacrylamide gels were prepared by polymerizing a solution of 4% acrylamide, 0.1% bisacrylamide, 10% glycerol, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 3.3 mM TEMED, pH 9, by the addition of ammonium persulfate to 0.33 mM. Prior to electrophoresis the samples were solubilized by the addition of an equal volume of 40% glycerol, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 9. The electrophoresis buffer contained 10% glycerol and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 9, and was circulated from the lower to the upper electrophoresis chamber with the aid of a peristaltic pump. Gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding measurements with myosin and shM were carried out as described previously (16Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) at 22°C in a medium containing 40 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaN3, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM [45Ca]CaCl2, and various concentrations of EGTA to obtain the desired free Ca2+ concentration at pH 7.0. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated with a program that uses an iterative procedure (17Chantler P.D. Szent-Györgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) taking into account the amount of contaminating Ca2+ (5 μM). Myosin or shM were suspended at 4 mg/ml, in 40 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 3 mM NaN3, and 0.1 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.0. [γ-32P]ATP was mixed with myosin or shM at 4 mg/ml, and 10 s later 200 μl of the sample was diluted with 4 ml of buffer also containing 0.1 mM unlabeled ATP and 0.1 mM Pi. At various time intervals a 600-μl aliquot was filtered on a Millipore 0.45-μm filter type HA, and the filter was washed with 4 ml of the buffer. The filter was then removed and counted. The filaments were retained quantitatively on the filter. The duration of the filtration and washing was 20-30 s. Samples of myosin or shM were diluted to about 15 μg/ml in a spraying buffer containing 30% (by volume) 1 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 70% glycerol. They were sprayed onto mica and rotary shadowed with platinum as described previously (18Flicker P.F. Wallimann T.A. Vibert P. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 723-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded at a 50,000 × magnification in a Philips EM301 electron microscope. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured with the coupled assay method (19Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1965: 10Google Scholar) or by quantitating the amount of inorganic Pi according to the method of Taussky and Shorr (20Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Both methods gave identical results. The digestion of scallop myosin with papain was stopped when 75-90% of the myosin heads were clipped by papain. Attempts to purify shM from the mixture of scallop myosin, shM, and rods by binding of shM and myosin to filamentous actin, coupled with selective displacement of shM, according to the method developed by Cooke and Franks (21Cooke R.

The products of the proteolytic digest were separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography under native conditions. The mixture of rods, shM, and myosin was made to 1.5 M in ammonium sulfate before it was loaded to a Toyopearl ether 650 S column. At this concentration of ammonium sulfate the rods were partly retained on the column, whereas shM and myosin bound quantitatively. Higher concentrations of ammonium sulfate were not used to avoid precipitation of proteins. The shM did not elute as a single peak and was partly overlapped by rods and myosin. However, fractions highly enriched in shM could be obtained, as shown in Fig. 1. The preparations of shM contained equimolar amounts of intact heavy chains, polypeptides of rod chains, RLCs, and ELCs (Fig. 1). Eleven residues were clipped from the N terminus of the RLC (3Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which usually occurs during prolonged digestions of scallop myosin with papain (Fig. 1). In addition to the electrophoretic pattern in native gels, electron microscopy provided strong evidence that the isolated product was shM. The electron micrographs of shM preparations showed a single head attached to a rod of the same diameter as that of the double-headed conventional myosins (Fig. 2), in good agreement with the electrophoretic pattern of shM.Fig. 2Rotary shadowed electron microscopic pictures of myosin and single-headed myosin. Both molecules show the presence of a rod domain. Two heads are attached to the rod of myosin (A), whereas only one head can be seen attached to the rod of shM (B). No difference is seen between the rods of the two myosins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ATPase activity of shM was not as tightly regulated as the activity of intact myosin. Although the ATPase activity of shM was comparable with that of intact myosin (per head) in the presence of Ca2+, the activity in the presence of EGTA was considerably higher. This resulted in a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of 60-70% (percentage of Ca2+ sensitivity = (1 − ATPase rate + EGTA/ATPase rate + Ca2+) × 100) in shM. The activities of various shM preparations were in the range 0.4-0.7 s−1 in the absence of actin. Actin activated the ATPase activity of shM 2-3-fold. These activities and the degree of actin activation were comparable with those of the starting myosin preparation. Undigested myosin that was recovered from the hydrophobic column also maintained its ATPase activity during the treatment and suffered a small loss in its Ca2+ sensitivity, which was decreased from ∼97 to ∼87%. Therefore, the lower Ca2+ sensitivity of shM relative to that of control myosin cannot be attributed entirely to the experimental treatment. Preparations of scallop myosin contain varying amounts of unregulated heads, probably due to the experimental manipulation of the protein, which have high activity in the presence of EGTA. Therefore, the degree of regulation of scallop myosin and shM is underestimated by ATPase activities. Myosin was activated by Ca2+ in a highly cooperative fashion, as was found previously under somewhat different ionic conditions (16Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Ca2+-activated ATPase activity of shM showed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of free Ca2+, with half-maximal activation at 0.09 μM Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Thus, the highly cooperative activation of the scallop myosin by Ca2+, which displays Hill coefficients as high as 5 (16Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), is related to the double-headed nature of myosin. The Ca2+ binding of myosin and shM was examined in a medium containing 40 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaN3, 0.5 mM DTT, and various concentrations of free Ca2+ at pH 7.0. Myosin and shM bound Ca2+ stoichiometrically to their head content with association constants of 5 × 106 and 11 × 106M−1, respectively (Fig. 3). The activation of the ATPase activity of shM by Ca2+ paralleled closely the saturation of its specific Ca2+ binding site by Ca2+ (Fig. 3), indicating a correlation between the two phenomena. The 3-fold activation of the ATPase activity of shM by Ca2+ can be attributed either to the presence of two populations of molecules, one highly regulated and one unregulated, as is the case with scallop HMM (22Wells C. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 260-264Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), or to a single population of molecules with enzymatic properties that have been altered. To settle this question we carried out single turnover experiments with [γ-32P]ATP. The radioactive ATP was mixed with myosin or shM, and after stopping the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP with an excess of cold ATP (see “Experimental Procedures”), an aliquot of the reaction was filtered and washed on the filter. Since the filter retains filaments quantitatively, the radioactivity associated with the filter is proportional to the amount of labeled ATP and ADP-32Pi remaining at the active sites. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4. In the presence of EGTA the release of phosphate from the active site of myosin followed first order kinetic behavior with a rate constant of 0.22 min−1. When the filter was washed with buffer containing 0.1 mM CaCl2 instead of 1 mM EGTA, the radioactivity remaining on the filter decreased to background levels. This control experiment indicated that the filtration did not damage scallop myosin, since although bound to the filter, the molecule maintained its ability to be activated by Ca2+. Fig. 4 also shows that the concentration of intermediates having bound Pi at the active site increased with the concentration of [γ-32P]ATP at ratios of ATP/myosin heads of greater than 1. In the presence of Ca2+ the same reaction was too fast to measure with this method, which has a resolution time of ∼30 s. In contrast to myosin, the release of Pi from the active site of shM in the presence of EGTA was also too fast to be measured with this method, suggesting that the proteolytic removal of one of the myosin heads alters the enzymatic properties of the remaining head.Fig. 4Single turnovers of myosin and single-headed myosin with [γ-32P]ATP. The experimental details of these measurements are given under “Experimental Procedures.” There were 10-fold (□; 16 μM myosin heads, 160 μM ATP) and 1.2-fold (∘; 16 μM myosin heads, 19.2 μM ATP) molar excesses of [γ-32P]ATP to myosin heads in the presence of EGTA. The rates of Pi release were 0.22 and 0.23 min−1, with 10- and 1.2-fold molar excesses of ATP to myosin heads, respectively. There was a 10-fold (×) molar excess of [γ-32P]ATP to myosin heads in the presence of Ca2+. ▪, amount of radioactivity remaining on the filter when myosin, treated with a 10-fold molar excess of [γ-32P]ATP to myosin heads in the presence of EGTA, was filtered and washed with buffer containing 0.1 mM CaCl2 instead of 1 mM EGTA. Single-headed myosin (8.5 μM) reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of [γ-32P]ATP (85 μM) in the presence of Ca2+ (▴) or in the presence of EGTA (▵). The high turnover rate of shM in the presence of EGTA (typical values were 0.2-0.3 s−1) did not allow for the measurement of the rate of Pi release with this method, which has a resolution time of ∼30 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The electrophoretic profiles and the electron microscopic observations of the single-headed scallop myosin preparation showed that the isolated protein was highly purified, containing at least 97% shM. The RLC of the shM was partly clipped by papain. When the RLC of myosin is replaced by the papain-clipped RLC, the hybrid myosin maintains the activity and degree of regulation of the parent myosin (23Sellers J.R. Chantler P.D. Szent-Györgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 223-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of the single-headed scallop myosin preparation cannot be attributed to the modification of its RLC. On addition of Ca2+, the ATPase activity of the single-headed scallop myosin was increased about 3-fold, both in the presence and absence of actin. A similar degree of activation of the ATPase activity of shM by Ca2+ was calculated from the effect of Ca2+ on the actin-activated ATPase activity of mixtures of myosin and shM (10Stafford W.F. Szentkiralyi E. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5273-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ activation of the ATPase activity of shM paralleled closely the saturation of its specific Ca2+ binding site, indicating a correlation between the two phenomena. The absence of an activating effect of Ca2+ on the ATPase activity of scallop S1 (9Szent-Györgyi A.G. Szentkiralyi E.M. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Stafford W.F. Szentkiralyi E. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5273-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggests that the attachment of the head to the coiled coil rod establishes a “communication” between the Ca2+ binding site and the ATPase site. In contrast to shM, Ca2+ activates the ATPase activity of scallop myosin cooperatively. The Hill coefficient for the activation of the scallop myosin ATPase by Ca2+ is usually greater than 4 (16Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hyperbolic dependence of the Ca2+-activated ATPase activity of shM on the concentration of free Ca2+ indicates that the cooperativity seen with scallop myosin requires the presence of its two heads. The behavior of shM in regulation is between the fully regulated intact myosin and the unregulated S1. The interaction of a single head with the coiled coil rod confers to it a limited form of regulation, which lacks the cooperative features of the fully regulated double-headed myosin. Nevertheless, it clearly shows Ca2+ dependence that is not observed in S1. To explain the slow turnover rates of scallop myosin and scallop HMM in the presence of EGTA, Jackson and Bagshaw (24Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) proposed the following scheme (Scheme I) that was based on the results of single turnover experiments of the regulated scallop HMM with the ATP analogue FTP. They suggested that in the presence of EGTA the rate constants k3 and k+r are comparable, whereas k−r≪ k3 or k+r. This leads to accumulation of M*FDP.Pi (refractory state) which cannot release Pi. Ca2+ shifts the equilibrium toward MFDP.Pi, which releases Pi fast, thereby increasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis. M∗ FDP.P iM+FTPk1k−1MFTPFastMFDP.Pik3M+PrSCHEME I From Jackson and Bagshaw (24Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). k+1 = 2 × 105 M−11 s−1≫ k−1; k3 = 0.15 s−1; k+r≫ k−r. We used filtration to measure the concentration of intermediates with ATP and ADP-Pi at the active site in single turnover experiments of scallop myosin and shM. This method is suitable for samples of myosin in the filamentous state and gives good signal/noise ratio, and the physiological substrate (ATP) can be used. The single turnovers of scallop myosin with [γ-32P]ATP provided further support for the presence of a refractory state (24Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), since the amount of Pi bound at the ATPase site increased with the concentration of ATP with ratios of ATP/myosin heads of greater than 1. This is what would be expected with an excess of ATP over myosin heads according to Scheme I. The molecules in the MADP.Pi conformation that will not isomerize into the refractory state will release the products of ATP hydrolysis and go through another cycle. The refractory state (M*ADP.Pi) accumulates because k+r≫ k−r. The absence of a slow phase of Pi release from shM suggests that the 3-fold activation of the ATPase activity of shM by Ca2+ was not due to the presence of two populations of molecules, i.e. one regulated with properties similar to those of myosin and one unregulated that has high ATPase activity in the presence of EGTA. The data are consistent with a homogeneous shM preparation with enzymatic properties different from those of myosin. The activating effect of Ca2+ can be explained by: (i) a decrease in the value of the equilibrium constant for the refractory state (Scheme I) in the presence of Ca2+; or (ii) an effect of Ca2+ on the rate of product release from MADP.Pi. The resolution time (∼30 s) of the single turnover measurements did not allow for distinguishing between these possibilities. The regulation of shM cannot be explained by head-to-head interactions. The communication between the Ca2+ binding site, which is formed by the light chains, and the nucleotide binding site of the motor domain is probably affected by the head-rod junction, since scallop S1 is unregulated. An interaction of the two heads of scallop myosin, possibly between the LCs, may be sufficient to account for the cooperative activation of scallop myosin by Ca2+ and its greater degree of regulation than that of shM. The data presented in this article suggest that both the double-headed nature of myosin and the attachment of the head to the coiled coil rod contribute to the “off” state of scallop myosin. The coiled coil rod seems to have a less important role in the regulation of smooth muscle myosin, since single-headed smooth muscle myosin is not activated by phosphorylation (12Cremo C.R.

These stimulatory effects of phospholipid are Ca2+-independent but are inhibited by Ca2+-calmodulin (21Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably because Ca2+-calmodulin and acidic phospholipids compete for the same binding site on the kinase. The roles and locations of the multiple autophosphorylation sites and how the different regulatory factors affect the conformation, and hence the activity, of the kinase molecule are not known. Previous studies involving limited proteolysis by chymotrypsin showed that binding of both acidic phospholipid and Ca2+-calmodulin to MIHC kinase is greatly reduced by removal of the NH2-terminal 7 kDa of the polypeptide (21Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a 54-kDa COOH-terminal fragment (F54) retains the full kinase activity and 3-4 of the ∼11 phosphorylation sites of the native enzyme. Just as for the native MIHC kinase, the activity of F54 is greatly enhanced by autophosphorylation; however, the rate of autophosphorylation of F54 is the same in the presence and absence of phospholipid and comparable with that of native kinase in the presence of phospholipid (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest the presence of at least two, sequentially separated, regulatory regions: the acidic phospholipid (plasma membrane)/Ca2+-calmodulin-binding NH2 terminus and the autophosphorylatable, catalytic COOH terminus. In this paper, we report that a 35-kDa fragment obtained by tryptic proteolysis of fully phosphorylated MIHC kinase retains complete catalytic activity and three phosphorylation sites. The conformation of the 35-kDa region depends on the state of kinase phosphorylation with an internal site accessible to trypsin only when the kinase is not phosphorylated.

A polyclonal antibody (α11K) against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of F11 (ASVVGTTYWMAPEVV, see “Results,” synthesized using the MAP resin technology to increase the immunogenic response) was raised in rabbits by Research Genetics; its titer against synthetic peptide was greater than 1:500,000 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For immunoblots, proteins and peptide fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Calbiochem) was used as second antibody. Unphosphorylated MIHC kinase (97 kDa) was rapidly cleaved by trypsin to four major fragments of approximate masses of 90, 66, 60, and 11 kDa and three minor fragments of 75, 45, and 35 kDa (Fig. 1, Coomassie, 2 and 5 min). By 30 min, all of these fragments had almost disappeared, except for the 11-kDa fragment which became stronger, and a doublet at 36 and 38 kDa and a prominent band at 25 kDa had appeared. The 25- and 11-kDa fragments were resistant to further proteolysis and became the major products by 60 min. Trypsin cleavage of fully phosphorylated kinase, which, as reported previously (18Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3591-3594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had a higher apparent mass by SDS-PAGE (107 kDa) than the unphosphorylated kinase, produced a similar pattern of large fragments (90, 75, 66, and 60 kDa) at short incubation times (Fig. 1, Coomassie, 2 and 5 min), but of slightly slower electrophoretic mobilities as expected for phosphorylated peptides. However, bands corresponding to the 45- and 11-kDa fragments from unphosphorylated kinase were not present (Fig. 1, 2 and 5 min). At longer digestion times of the phosphorylated kinase, a diffuse doublet of 36 and 38 kDa appeared (which is seen more clearly by autoradiography, Fig. 1, 32P) and a stable fragment of 35 kDa accumulated (Fig. 1). All fragments derived from phosphorylated MIHC kinase were phosphorylated (Fig. 1, 32P). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the 90-, 66-, 60-, and 38-kDa fragments derived from unphosphorylated kinase were the same as the NH2-terminal sequences of the corresponding phosphorylated fragments (Table I). Thus, the latter were almost certainly the phosphorylated counterparts of the former. On the assumption that this was most likely also true for the fragments that were not sequenced, all of the proteolytic fragments from both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated kinase are hereinafter referred to by the apparent masses of the unphosphorylated fragmentsTable I.NH2-terminal sequences of the tryptic fragments of myosin I heavy chain kinaseCycleF90F66F60F38F35F25F11−P−P+P−P+P+P−PaAfter digestion for 30 min, a second sequence identical to that of F66 appeared in the digest of unphosphorylated kinase suggesting that a second “F60” was formed by COOH-terminal cleavage of F66.

This is likely the same fragment previously seen under slightly different digestion conditions (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Phosphorylated F66 and F60 were consistently degraded much more slowly than unphosphorylated F66 and F60 and persisted until at least 90 min (Fig. 1); a slightly slower rate of degradation was also observed for phosphorylated F90. There was no counterpart of phosphorylated F35 in the final tryptic products of unphosphorylated kinase. Conversely, tryptic digests of phosphorylated kinase never contained F25 or F11 that were the major stable products of tryptic digestion of unphosphorylated kinase. Although the relative amounts of the larger fragments varied in different experiments, the final products were always the same irrespective of the length of the digestion and with up to eight times more trypsin, i.e. F35 was always obtained from phosphorylated kinase and F25 and F11 from unphosphorylated kinase. The different NH2-terminal sequences of phosphorylated F90, F66, and F60 (Table I) suggest that they were derived from MIHC kinase by progressive cleavages at the NH2 terminus; each may, or may not, extend to the COOH terminus of the native kinase (Fig. 2, lower). The NH2-terminal sequence of F38 (Table I) was the same as that of F66, which indicates that F38 was derived from the NH2 terminus of F66 (Fig. 2, lower left). This line of reasoning makes it most likely that F35, the final, stable digestion product of phosphorylated kinase whose NH2-terminal sequence differed from those of all of the larger fragments (Table I), was derived from the COOH-terminal end of MIHC kinase (Fig. 2, lower left). The NH2-terminal sequence of unphosphorylated F25 was identical to that of phosphorylated F35 and the NH2-terminal sequence of unphosphorylated F11 differed from those of all of the other fragments of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated kinase (Table I). Therefore, it seems highly likely that F25 and F11 represented the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments, respectively, of F35 (Fig. 2, lower right). The assignments based on the NH2-terminal sequences were supported by immunoblots of SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3). Antibody α11K, which was raised against a 15-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of F11, recognized F35 (Fig. 3, lane d) and F11 (Fig. 3, lane b), but not F25 (Fig. 3, lane b), consistent with F11 originating from the COOH-terminal region of F35. The antibody also recognized intact kinase (Fig. 3, lanes a and c), traces of F90 (Fig. 3, lanes b), F66 and F60 (Fig. 3, lanes b and d). These latter results support the conclusion that F90, F66, and F60 were produced by progressive cleavages at the NH2 terminus of MIHC kinase and contained most, if not all, of the COOH-terminal 35-kDa region of the kinase. Both F66 and F60 were more resistant to proteolysis when derived from phosphorylated kinase, but the most striking effect of phosphorylation was the difference in the final digestion products, i.e. COOH-terminal F35 from phosphorylated kinase and F25 and F11 from unphosphorylated kinase. Thus, phosphorylation strongly inhibits proteolysis at a site about 11 kDa from the COOH terminus. More detailed analysis of the data in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 provides additional evidence for the greater susceptibility to proteolysis of the COOH terminus of unphosphorylated kinase. For example, F45, which occurred early in the digestion of unphosphorylated kinase (Fig. 1, 2 and 5 min) but was not seen in the digestion of phosphorylated kinase, was not recognized by α11K (Fig. 3, lane b), indicating that it lacks the COOH-terminal 11-kDa region. Also, sequence data suggest that the COOH terminus of F66 derived from unphosphorylated kinase, but not of F66 derived from phosphorylated kinase, is cleaved during extensive incubation with trypsin (see Table I, Footnote a). We reported previously (24Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 196: 12-23Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that chymotrypsin digestion produces a 54-kDa peptide from the COOH terminus of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MIHC kinase and that F54 retains full catalytic activity and approximately four autophosphorylation sites that must be phosphorylated for maximal enzymatic activity. As the 35-kDa tryptic peptide should be contained within the 54-kDa chymotryptic peptide, it was of interest to determine whether F35, F25, and/or F11 were catalytically active. This was difficult to determine in digestion mixtures such as those shown in Fig. 1, because even after prolonged incubations, these still contained a number of larger fragments that would be expected to have enzymatic activity. To avoid this problem, we employed a two-step digestion procedure, chymotrypsin followed by trypsin (Fig. 2, upper). As expected, chymotrypsin cleaved phosphorylated kinase (Fig. 4, lanes a) to F54 (Fig. 4, lanes b) which was cleaved by trypsin to F35 (Fig. 4, lanes c) that had identical SDS-PAGE mobility as F35 obtained by direct trypsin cleavage of phosphorylated kinase (Fig. 4, lanes d). The only difference was that the F35 obtained by two-step cleavage, like its 54-kDa precursor, appeared as a closely spaced doublet (Fig. 4, lanes c), probably, as suggested previously (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because of partial chymotryptic cleavage at the COOH terminus. The F35 obtained by single step trypsin cleavage was more heavily contaminated by F66, F60, and the F36/F38 doublet, as is most easily seen on the autoradiogram (Fig. 4, lanes d). The kinase activities of F54 and F35 produced by sequential chymotrypsin and trypsin digestion were significantly higher than the activity of native, phosphorylated kinase (Table II). The apparently still higher activity of F35 obtained by direct trypsin digestion may reflect a contribution from the contaminating larger fragments. Because the specific activities were calculated back to the initial kinase concentration, assuming 100% conversion to the final digestion product, the specific activities calculated for the fragments may be underestimates, and therefore, F35 is probably at least 45% more active than native, phosphorylated kinaseTable II.Kinase activity and phosphorylation sites of tryptic peptides of MIHC kinaseSampleaF54, F35, etc. refer to proteolytic fragments of the indicated masses (by SDS-PAGE) obtained from native phosphorylated or unphosphorylated kinase (as indicated) by either chymotrypsin (C), trypsin (T), or chymotrypsin followed by trypsin (C, T) digestion.Specific activityPhosphorylation sitesμmol/(min)(mg)mol/molPhosphorylatedNative kinase12.416F54 (C)21.64.4F35 (C, T)17.31.4F35 (T)25.12.7UnphosphorylatedNative kinase1.1F54 (C)18.3F25 (C, T)00F11 (C, T)0F25 (T)0F11 (T)3a F54, F35, etc. refer to proteolytic fragments of the indicated masses (by SDS-PAGE) obtained from native phosphorylated or unphosphorylated kinase (as indicated) by either chymotrypsin (C), trypsin (T), or chymotrypsin followed by trypsin (C, T) digestion. Open table in a new tab The analogous experiment with unphosphorylated kinase is shown in Fig. 5. Trypsin digestion of F54 of the initial chymotrypsin digestion (Fig. 5, lane b) produced an amount of F25 (Fig. 5, lane c) comparable with that obtained by direct trypsin cleavage of native kinase (Fig. 5, lanes e and f). However, only a relatively small amount of F11 was obtained in the two-step digestion (Fig. 5, compare lane c with lanes e and f) perhaps, at least in part, because the 54-kDa fragment is probably a mixture of two peptides with identical NH2 termini, but differing slightly at their COOH-terminal ends (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, if F11 is stabilized by interaction with other peptides, it might be less stable to trypsin when produced from F54 in the two-step procedure than when it is produced directly from native kinase. As expected, the enzymatic activity of unphosphorylated kinase was quite low, while the activity of the F54 derived from it was equivalent to that of the F54 obtained from phosphorylated kinase (Table II). This is because, as shown previously (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), F54 autophosphorylates much more rapidly than native kinase (in the absence of phospholipid) and thus becomes fully active very early in the assay of its ability to phosphorylate substrate. No kinase activity was detected when the digestion mixture containing F25 derived from unphosphorylated F54 was incubated with PC9. As mentioned, all of the products of trypsin digestion of phosphorylated kinase that were detected by Coomassie Blue were phosphorylated (Fig. 1). The strong intensity on the autoradiogram of the F36/F38 doublet relative to its staining by Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1, 30, 60, and 90 min; Fig. 4, lanes d) indicates that those fragments were highly phosphorylated. F38 has the same NH2-terminal sequence as F66 (Table I). Therefore, if, as we have deduced above, the NH2 terminus of F66 originates from a position about 31 kDa from the NH2 terminus of the native kinase, the highly phosphorylated F38 would originate from approximately the middle third of the molecule. The autoradiogram of the digest of phosphorylated kinase shows that F35, which is derived from the COOH-terminal third of the native kinase, is phosphorylated (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). When a digestion mixture obtained by one-step cleavage of unphosphorylated kinase, in which F25 and F11 were the main components, was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, F11 was phosphorylated and its electrophoretic mobility decreased (Fig. 1, 60+ATP; Fig. 5, lane g), but 32P was not incorporated into F25. As would be expected, F60 and the F36/F38 doublet were also labeled (Fig. 5, lane g). The same results were obtained when the digestion mixture was incubated with fully active, phosphorylated native kinase, F11 became heavily labeled with only traces of radioactivity incorporated into F25 (data not shown). Thus, the autophosphorylation site(s) in the COOH-terminal third of the kinase molecule are, most likely, exclusively in the COOH-terminal 11 kDa region. Only traces of 32P were incorporated into F11 when the products of the two-step digestion of unphosphorylated kinase were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5, lane d), in agreement with the observation that this mixture lacks significant kinase activity (Table II). The phosphate contents of F54, F35, F25, and F11 were quantified from the experiments illustrated in Figs. 1, 4, and 5. Intact kinase was autophosphorylated to the extent of 16 mol/mol. F54 derived from autophosphorylated kinase retained about 4 mol and F35 about 3 mol of phosphate when obtained by one-step trypsin cleavage and about 1.5 mol when obtained by two-step cleavage (Table II). The amount of 32P incorporated into F11 obtained by two-step cleavage was too small to measure and F11 obtained by direct, one-step trypsin cleavage incorporated about 3 mol of phosphate/mol (Table II). Within the limits of these assays, then, it appears that about four of the autophosphorylatable sites of native kinase reside in the COOH-terminal 54-kDa region and three in the COOH-terminal F35, with essentially all of the latter being in the COOH-terminal F11 segment and none in the adjacent F25. Its monomeric structure, its multiple phosphorylation sites, and the regulation of its activity by autophosphorylation, acidic phospholipids, and Ca2+-calmodulin make MIHC kinase an extremely interesting member of the protein kinase family. The catalytic domain, localized previously to the 54-kDa COOH terminus by alignment of chymotryptic peptides (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has now been further limited to the COOH-terminal 35-kDa region by alignment of the peptides produced by trypsin digestion (Fig. 6). The catalytic activity of F35 obtained from phosphorylated MIHC kinase is at least as high as that of the native enzyme. The mixture containing unphosphorylated F25 and small amount of F11 derived from the 35-kDa COOH terminus of unphosphorylated kinase by two step cleavage had no detectable kinase activity when assayed with synthetic peptide as substrate and did not autophosphorylate, although F11 could be phosphorylated by native kinase or large fragments that retained kinase activity. The simplest interpretation of these results is that cleavage of the 35-kDa catalytic domain at the “25/11” site disrupts the integrity of its catalytic site (Fig. 6). The MIHC kinase catalytic domain (F35) obtained from fully phosphorylated native kinase contained 2.7 mol of phosphate/mol. F11 obtained from unphosphorylated kinase incorporated 3 mol of phosphate/mol when incubated with active kinase, whereas no phosphate was incorporated into F25. Therefore, despite some experimental limitations (e.g. the calculations of stoichiometry assume 100% recovery of digestion products, 1 mol/mol could reflect partial phosphorylation of more than 1 site, and peptides might be phosphorylated differently than the parent enzyme), these data strongly indicate that the catalytic domain of MIHC kinase contains two to three phosphorylation sites, all located within the COOH-terminal 11 kDa. It is interesting that the 25/11 site is readily accessible to trypsin cleavage when MIHC kinase is unphosphorylated, but strongly protected in phosphorylated kinase. As discussed more extensively in the accompanying paper (23Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27056-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the 25/11 trypsin cleavage site lies within a variable “linker” region between residues that are highly conserved in the ∼370 kinases that have been sequenced (26Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar, 27Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell.

Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Many kinases are (auto)- phosphorylated within the linker region, and this phosphorylation often affects kinase activity (for summary, see 28Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 29Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E.

For example, the crystal structure of unphosphorylated, inactive MAP kinase ERK2 shows that the linker region partially blocks the substrate-binding site (31Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and Cdk2 kinase (32De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S-H.

The change in susceptibility of MIHC kinase to trypsin cleavage described in this paper provides direct evidence for a phosphorylation-dependent conformational change in this functionally important loop and a conformational change in the linker region of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2) was recently demonstrated by solving the crystal structures of the inactive (32De Bondt H.L.

Nature. 1995; 376: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in the accompanying paper (23Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27056-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), MIHC kinase has a putative autophosphorylation site downstream from the 25/11 cleavage site. This is likely to be one of the sites that are phosphorylated in F11. By sequence analogy (23Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27056-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the 25/11 cleavage site lies in a region that corresponds to the activation loop of PKA and the putative autophosphorylation site in the P+1 loop (29Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although, we were unable to determine the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of F35 (which contains F11), because we could not obtain this fragment in its unphosphorylated form, we have shown previously (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the activity of the COOH-terminal F54 fragment (which contains F35) is enhanced by autophosphorylation. The NH2-terminal sequences of trypsin fragments F66, F60, and F35 (Table I) and chymotrypsin fragments F60 and F54 (22Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are all proline-rich, indicating that the middle third of MIHC kinase has a very high proline content (Fig. 6). Interestingly, proline-rich and polyacidic sequences separate the catalytic domain from the regulatory p21-binding domain of PAK (36Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.-S. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and PAK is activated by autophosphorylation within its proline-rich region as well as within the catalytic domain (37Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although it is not known whether this region has a similar role in all kinases, the presence of phosphorylation sites within this region of MIHC kinase (Fig. 6) raises the possibility that phosphorylation might regulate the conformation of this region as well the conformation of the linker region. This possibility is strengthened by our observation that phosphorylation of MIHC kinase increases the resistance of this region to proteolysis. The sequence similarity of MIHC kinase to the PAK family is discussed in more detail in the accompanying paper (23Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2035768520,"A mutant of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) containing a deletion of the N-terminal amino acid residues 18-75 and lacking the C-terminal 120 amino acid residues was expressed in COS-1 cells. The deletion in the N-terminal region did not significantly affect the level of expression of the Ca2+ pump. Tryptic digestion of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) mutant resulted in the appearance of the same fragments obtained by proteolysis of the hPMCA4b(ct120) enzyme, suggesting that deletion of residues 18-75 neither impeded the insertion in the membrane nor extensively affected the folding of the mutant protein. The functional competence of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) enzyme was examined by measuring the Ca2+ transport and the Ca2+ ATPase activity of COS-1 cell microsomes expressing the mutant protein. Both tests proved the mutant to be inactive. Under conditions in which hPMCA4b(ct120) becomes phosphorylated, hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) was incapable of reacting with ATP and Ca2+ to form the phosphoenzyme.

A mutant of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) containing a deletion of the N-terminal amino acid residues 18-75 and lacking the C-terminal 120 amino acid residues was expressed in COS-1 cells. The deletion in the N-terminal region did not significantly affect the level of expression of the Ca2+ pump. Tryptic digestion of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) mutant resulted in the appearance of the same fragments obtained by proteolysis of the hPMCA4b(ct120) enzyme, suggesting that deletion of residues 18-75 neither impeded the insertion in the membrane nor extensively affected the folding of the mutant protein. The functional competence of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) enzyme was examined by measuring the Ca2+ transport and the Ca2+ ATPase activity of COS-1 cell microsomes expressing the mutant protein. Both tests proved the mutant to be inactive.

Taken together these results suggest that the segment of amino acids 18-75 is essential for the activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. The Ca2+ pump from plasma membranes (PMCA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMCACa2+ pump from plasma membraneshPMCA4bhuman PMCA isoform 4b (the hPMCA4b has also been called hPMCA4CI; Ref. 2) is a calmodulin regulated, P2-type ATPase (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) responsible for maintaining the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in eukaryotic cells by actively extruding Ca2+ to the extracellular space. Four mammalian genes coding for different PMCA isoforms have been identified, each of them producing different mRNAs by alternative splicing processes (2Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The PMCA polypeptide would transverse the lipid bilayer about 10 times, and most of the pump, including two major loops and both terminal ends, would be exposed to the cytosol (3Adamo H.P. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14244-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PMCA contains regions highly conserved in all P-type ATPases and other regions that are distinctive of the PMCA because they are found only in the PMCA isoforms. The regions of the PMCA encompassing the aspartate residue that forms the phosphorylated intermediate (4James P. Zvaritch E. Shakhparanov M. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the putative ATP binding site (5Filoteo A.G. Gorski J.P. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6526-6530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) belong to the type of highly conserved regions. In contrast the C-terminal region after the transmembrane segment 10, which is involved in the regulation of the activity of the enzyme by calmodulin (6James P. Maeda M. Fischer R. Verma A.K. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the N-terminal region upstream the first transmembrane segment belong to the regions that are not homologous to that of the other P-type ATPases. Ca2+ pump from plasma membranes human PMCA isoform 4b (the hPMCA4b has also been called hPMCA4CI; Ref. 2) Recently a PMCA mutant called hPMCA4b(ct120) with a deletion of the C-terminal 120 residues including the calmodulin-binding site was expressed in COS-1 cells and found to be fully active, and as expected its activity no longer regulated by calmodulin (7Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now investigated the functional relevance of the N-terminal region of the PMCA, which extends from the initial methionine to about the beginning of the first transmembrane segment. With this aim, we constructed a mutant called hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) by removing the nucleotide sequence coding for amino acids 18-75 from the cDNA of hPMCA4b(ct120). The measurements of the activity of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) expressed in COS-1 cells indicate that the residues 18-75 are essential for a functional Ca2+ pump. The construction of the cDNA of mutants hPMCA4b(ct120) and hPMCA4b(d18-75) was described previously, and the latter was called Hinm1 (3Adamo H.P. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14244-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the deletion of residues 18-75, the presence of a new unique restriction site for MluI produced the replacement of serine 17 by threonine in the hPMCA4b(d18-75). To obtain the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) mutant, the SalI-DraIII fragment was removed from hPMCA4b(d18-75) and cloned into h4PMCA(ct120). The wild-type and mutant cDNAs were cloned into the pMM2 vector (7Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protein expression, COS-1 cells (9Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran-chloroquine method (8Adamo H.P. Verma A.K. Sanders M.A. Heim R. Salisbury J.L. Wieben E.D. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and harvested after 48 h. The microsomal fraction was isolated as described previously (7Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by means of the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (10Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30111-30114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoresed on a 7.5% acrylamide gel according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and subsequently transferred to Millipore Immobilon membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes overnight at 4°C in a solution of 160 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 5F10 monoclonal antibody from ascites fluid (dilution, 1:1000). For staining, biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were used. Ca2+ uptake assays were performed as described previously (10Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30111-30114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3 at 37°C), 5 mM NaN3, 400 nM thapsigargin, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 6 mM ATP, 95 μM EGTA, and enough MgCl2 and CaCl2 to give a concentration of free Mg2+ of 800 μM and of free Ca2+ of 1 μM. The free concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ were calculated using the program of Fabiato and Fabiato (12Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles (5-10 μg of protein) were preincubated at 37°C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP. The reaction was terminated after 5 min by filtering the samples through a 0.45-μm filter. The 45Ca taken up by the vesicles was then determined by counting in a liquid scintillation counter. Uptake activities were expressed per mg of COS-1 cell membrane protein. The activity of the expressed Ca2+ pump was estimated after subtracting the activity of the endogenous enzyme from COS-1 cells transfected with the empty plasmid pMM2. Ca2+ ATPase was measured by monitoring the [32P]Pi liberated from [γ-32P]ATP (13Richards D.E. Rega A. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 37°C), 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM NaN3, 0.5 mM ouabain, 4 μg/ml oligomycin, 400 nM thapsigargin, and 10 μg of membranes. The Ca2+ ATPase was taken as the difference of ATPase activities in the presence and the absence of Ca2+. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out at 4°C in medium containing 10 μg of microsomal protein, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4°C), 400 nM thapsigargin, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.02 μM CaCl2, and 0.02 μM LaCl3 in a reaction volume of 0.25 ml. La3+ is known to stabilize the phosphoenzyme of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (14Luterbacher S. Schatzmann H.J. Experientia. 1983; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μM [γ-32P]ATP and terminated after 30 s with 1 ml of stopping solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mM Pi, and 1 mM cold ATP at 4°C. After adding 50 μl of 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, the denatured proteins were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, washed once more with stopping solution, and washed once with distilled water. The precipitated samples were dissolved in sample buffer and separated by SDS-electrophoresis in a 7% acrylamide gel according to Sarkadi et al. (15Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the gel, autoradiographs were produced. Digestion of COS-1 microsomes with trypsin was done on ice in a medium containing 10 μg of microsomes, 0.1 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7 at 4°C), 0.25 mM sucrose, 0.15 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of trypsin to give a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and terminated after 15 or 30 s with 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Controls of undigested microsomes (0 s) were done by adding the inhibitor before the trypsin. COS-1 cells were transfected with the vector without insert or with either the hPMCA4b(ct120) or the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) DNAs. Different amounts of membranes from the transfected cells were submitted to SDS gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using antibody 5F10, which recognizes an epitope located between amino acids 724-783 in the central part of the Ca2+ pump protein (3Adamo H.P. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14244-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoblot is shown in Fig. 1. One band of about 140 kDa corresponding to the endogenous Ca2+ pump from COS-1 cells was detected in membranes from cells transfected with the empty vector pMM2. An additional band of about 120 kDa was observed in membranes from hPMCA4b(ct120) transfected cells. Membranes from COS-1 cells transfected with hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) DNA showed a band at about 114 kDa, the expected molecular mass of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) protein. The intensity of the bands of the hPMCA4b(ct120) and hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) were close, indicating that both proteins were expressed at a similar level. As a test for the topology of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) Ca2+ pump, microsomes containing the expressed protein were exposed briefly to the action of trypsin. Fig. 2 shows an immunoblot of the proteolyzed membranes using antibody 5F10. In agreement with previous reports (7Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the treatment of COS-1 membranes expressing hPMCA4b(ct120) with 20 μg/ml of trypsin for 30 s resulted in the appearance of a major band of approximately 76 kDa. Because the N-terminal part of the molecule containing amino acid residues 1-315 is removed early during proteolysis and is not recognized by 5F10 (3Adamo H.P. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14244-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) providing the insertion and folding of the enzyme was the same, differences are not expected between the proteolytic pattern of the hPMCA4b(ct120) and hPMCA(d18-75)(ct120). As shown in Fig. 2 this was indeed the case, suggesting that both the hPMCA4b(ct120) and the hPMCA(d18-75)(ct120) proteins exposed the same sites to trypsin and hence produced similar proteolytic fragments containing the epitope for antibody 5F10. Results in Table I show that the Ca2+ uptake of microsomes from cells transfected with the hPMCA4b(ct120) DNA was about 12 times higher than that from control microsomes from cells transfected with the empty vector. The Ca2+ transport activity of microsomes expressing the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) protein was not significantly different from that of the control, indicating that the mutant enzyme was not able to transport Ca2+. As also shown in Table I, the Ca2+ ATPase activity of microsomes from COS-1 cells transfected with the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) DNA was similar to that of the control, indicating that the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) was also not capable of hydrolyzing ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner.Table ICa2+ transport and Ca2+ ATPase activities of microsomes isolated from cells transfected with PMM2, hPMCA4b(ct120) or hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120)DNA transfectedCa2+ transportCa2+ ATPasenmol Ca2+/mg membrane protein/minnmol Pi/mg membrane protein/minpMM20.14 ± 0.120.45 ± 0.25hPMCA4b(ct120)1.80 ± 0.346.08 ± 1.08hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120)0.25 ± 0.120.33 ± 0.43 Open table in a new tab In control experiments (not shown), the effects of the deletion of amino acid residues 18-75 on the activity of the full-length hPMCA4b was investigated. The hPMCA4b(d18-75) enzyme was also inactive, indicating that the C-terminal regulatory end of the PMCA was not involved in the mechanism leading to inactivation. The first step of the normal Ca2+ pump cycle involves the reaction of the enzyme with Ca2+ and ATP to form a phosphoenzyme. The ability of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) mutant to form a phosphorylated intermediate was investigated. Fig. 3 shows that two bands corresponding to the endogenous PMCA and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps were observed when membranes from COS-1 cells transfected with the empty vector were phosphorylated with ATP in the presence of Ca2+ plus La3+. As expected an additional band in the molecular mass region of 120 kDa was observed in membranes containing the hPMCA4b(ct120) enzyme. The phosphorylation pattern of membranes containing the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) protein was similar to that of the control, indicating that no phosphorylation attributable to the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) mutant had occurred. In the present work we have investigated the functional consequences of a deletion in the N-terminal region of the hPMCA4b between the initial methionine and the first transmembrane domain. Mutant hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) was expressed in amounts comparable with those of the hPMCA4b(ct120), indicating that the N-terminal deletion did not significantly affect the level of expression of the PMCA. The measurements of Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis indicated that the mutant protein was unable to perform any of these functions. In addition, no detectable amounts of phosphoenzyme were formed by the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) enzyme. Thus the lack of Ca2+ transport and ATPase activities of mutant hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) could be ascribed to its inability to react with Ca2+ and ATP to form the phosphoenzyme. Deletion of several amino acid residues could result in alterations of the folding or insertion in the membrane of the mutant protein. Although this possibility cannot be discarded, several observations suggest that this may not be the case of the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) mutant: (i) the expressed hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) protein was always found associated with membranes, and after cell lysis it was recovered in the microsomal fraction, (ii) immunoblots of membranes from COS-1 cells transfected with the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) DNA showed only one major product of about 114 kDa in amounts similar to those of the hPMCA4b(ct120), indicating that both proteins were equally stable to degradation by intracellular proteases, and (iii) digestion with trypsin and immunoblotting of the hPMCA4b(ct120) and the hPMCA4b(d18-75)(ct120) revealed similar proteolytic fragments, suggesting that both proteins exposed the same limited number of sites to the protease. Early analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteolytic fragments produced by treatment of red cell membranes with trypsin has shown that the protease acts on several specific sites of the PMCA resulting in major peptides of 90, 81, and 76 kDa (15Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zvaritch E. James P. Vorherr T. Falchetto R. Modyanov N. Carafoli E.

Chem. 1984; 259: 618-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of the 76-kDa fragment in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is concomitant with a highly active PMCA. Based on these results (15Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the 76-kDa polypeptide was a fully competent Ca2+ transporter and therefore that the N- and C-terminal amino acid residues missing in the 76-kDa fragment are not essential for activity. However, as mentioned in 16Zvaritch E. James P. Vorherr T. Falchetto R. Modyanov N. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8070-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, the effective separation of the N-terminal fragment containing the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 from the 76-kDa product in the absence of SDS was not proved. Recently, the expression of N-terminally and C-terminally truncated PMCA mutants allowed to directly assess the activity of the fragments produced by trypsinolysis. Although truncation of the hPMCA4b generating a C terminus similar to that of the 76 kDa fragment produces a highly active enzyme (7Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a mutant starting with the N terminus of the 90-kDa polypeptide (PMCA105) is inactive (18Heim R. Iwata T. Zvaritch E. Adamo H.P. Rutishauser B. Strehler E.E. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24476-24484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As was suggested previously (18Heim R. Iwata T. Zvaritch E. Adamo H.P. Rutishauser B. Strehler E.E. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24476-24484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of activity of the PMCA105 mutant is probably related to the absence of a large portion of the pump containing the first two transmembrane domains and the region highly conserved in all P-ATPases, which has been called the transducing domain. Results in this paper show that a smaller deletion between the N terminus and the first transmembrane domain, a region previously assumed irrelevant for the function of the enzyme, suffices for inactivation. Studies of mutants with smaller deletions and substitutions of amino acids in the N-terminal region will be needed to obtain a more precise knowledge of the residues involved and their role during Ca2+ transport by the PMCA."

In addition, variant Hb A2 tetramers were expressed in yeast to assess effects of amino acid changes on oxygen binding and stability to heat and mechanical agitation. The G → T change at codon 27 and the A → G change in IVS-2 both affect RNA splicing, whereas the C → T change at codon 97 and the AT deletion in IVS-2 have no effect. Oxygen equilibrium curves of the Hb A2 variants expressed in yeast were similar to that of wild type Hb A2.

Co-expression in yeast of α-globin chain and the δ-chain variant containing a Leu → Pro change at codon 141 yielded no identifiable tetramers, suggesting lack of assembly or severe tetramer instability. These studies show the probable cause for decreased Hb A2 for two alleles is due to defective splicing, whereas decreased protein stability, increased tetramer association with red cell membranes, increased interdisulfide bond formation of δ-chains, which inhibits assembly with α-chains, and/or reduced assembly is suggested for the other three alleles.

A2 (α2δ2) comprises about 2.5% of total adult hemoglobin. These mutations can, however, mask the presence of β thalassemia, which is usually characterized in heterozygotes by low mean cell volume and high Hb A2. Compound heterozygotes for β thalassemia and a δ-globin gene mutation may have low mean cell volume and normal Hb A2 levels and therefore be overlooked as β-thalassemia heterozygotes. Identification of these mutations is important in areas where the thalassemia syndromes are prevalent, such as the Mediterranean populations (1Trifillis P. Ioannou P. Schwartz E. Surrey S.

The molecular basis of δ thalassemia has been clarified in only nine instances (4Steinberg M.H. Adams III, J.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 2165-2177PubMed Google Scholar).

The G → C change at codon 30 interferes with normal δ-globin mRNA splicing of IVS-1 because it changes the splice consensus sequence from CAG′gttggt to CAC′gttggt.

Blood. 1990; 75: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-one δ-globin variants have been characterized so far (18Huisman, T. H. J., (ed) (1993) Hemoglobin 17, 89-198.Google Scholar), and all appear to be stable except for the codon 98 and 121 variants. Unstable hemoglobin variants caused by single amino acid replacements within critical regions of the α- or β-globin chains can lead to congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia. Precipitated unstable hemoglobins form Heinz bodies that associate with membranes and lead to premature red cell destruction (19Williamson D. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 146-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unstable δ-globin variants are of little clinical importance because Hb A2 is such a minor portion of the total hemoglobin. Mutations that result in globin instability either affect structure of globin and heme subunit or hemoglobin tetramer. Loss of interactions stabilizing structure, disruption of subunit interactions, changes affecting hydrophobic interior, and perturbing secondary structure, such as introduction of proline in a helical region, all can create unstable hemoglobins. Other mutations in the δ-chain may not necessarily result in unstable hemoglobins but may promote intermolecular and/or intramolecular disulfide bond formation and thereby decrease δ-chain levels available for assembly with α-chains. Other possibilities include mutations that promote tetramer interaction with red cell membranes and/or those that lead to decreased affinity for assembly with α-chains. In this report, we attempt functional characterization of five δ-globin gene alleles in the Greek Cypriot population that are associated with reduced Hb A2. These mutations could affect splicing, such as the G → T change at codon 27 and the AG → GG change at the 3′-acceptor of IVS-2, or result in formation of structural variants such as the G → T at codon 27 Ala → Ser, the C → T at codon 116 Arg → Cys, and the T → C at codon 141 Leu → Pro. Finally, we were also interested in defining which of the following changes, a C → T at codon 4 Thr → Ile, a C → T at codon 97, or the AT deletion in IVS-2 found in the same δ-globin gene, is responsible for reduced Hb A2.

The Amersham Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL) was used to construct G → T at codon 27, C → T at codon 97, the AT deletion at position 722 in IVS-2 and AG → GG in the 3′-splice acceptor of IVS-2 in the δ-globin genomic clone using primers 27-30. Mutagenized clones were identified by PCR followed by digestion with appropriate restriction endonucleases (1Trifillis P. Ioannou P. Schwartz E. Surrey S. Blood. 1991; 78: 3298-3305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trifillis P. Kyrri A. Kalogirou E. Kokkofitou A. Ioannou P. Schwartz E. Surrey S. Blood. 1993; 82: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): primers 40 and 6 followed by EcoO 109 I digestion for codon 27 change; primers 4 and 6 followed by NlaIII digestion for codon 97 change; and primers 5 and 8 with SacII digestion for AG → GG change. The AT deletion does not alter a restriction pattern and therefore had to be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Positive clones were reconfirmed using the PRISM Ready reaction dyedeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequence was compared with known δ-globin gene sequence (20EMBL/GenBank database (Bolt, Beranek, Newman Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, and Eur. Mol. Biol. Lab., Heidelberg).Google Scholar, 21Poncz M.

COS-1 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, streptomycin, and penicillin in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected with wild type or mutant plasmids using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). RNA was harvested 48 h after transfection using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Radiolabeled riboprobe was made using the Riboprobe Gemini in vitro transcription kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). RNase protection assays were performed using the Ambion RPA II kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX), and protected fragments were electrophoresed on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Details of RT-PCR assays are described elsewhere (23Keller M.A. Cassel D.L. Rappaport E.F. McKenzie S.E. Schwartz E. Surrey S. PCR Methods and Applications. 1993; 3: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Primer 24 was used in a reverse transcription reaction using Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) to synthesize cDNA, which was amplified with Taq Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) in a PCR reaction using primers 23 and 43 or 4 and 24 for IVS-1 and IVS-2 regions, respectively. PCR products were run on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel. An Argus-50 Image Processor (Hamamatsu, Photonics Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ) was used to quantitate the density of the 88-bp (normally spliced exon 1) versus the 72-bp (aberrantly spliced exon 1) bands in the codon 27 lane of Fig. 1. The results were normalized for radiolabeled CTP content for the 72- and 88-nucleotide RNase-resistant fragments. A yeast system was used for expression of wild type and variant soluble hemoglobins. The expression vector, pGS389, contains α- and β-globin cDNAs under control of galactose-inducible glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase yeast promoters (24Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitez L. Wieczorek A. Hoffman S. Durfee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The β-globin cDNA together with the promoter and yeast 3′-flanking sequences were excised from pGS389 as an XhoI fragment and was cloned into pBluescript SK+ to create the shuttle vector pGS188 in order to facilitate subcloning and replacement of β- with δ-globin cDNA. Wild type δ-globin cDNA was made employing RT-PCR with primers 23 and 24 using RNA isolated from COS-1 cells transfected with pSVK3 5′δ SalI-PstI. PCR fragments of the galactose-inducible promoter (primers 21 and 22), full-length δ-globin cDNA (primers 23 and 24) and yeast mating type α-gene 3′-untranslated region (primers 25 and 26) were joined using overlap PCR with primers 21 and 26, and the product was cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, CA). DNA sequence of the full-length wild type δ-globin cDNA was determined, and the plasmid was digested with BstBI and KpnI, which cut several nucleotides upstream of the δ ATG and downstream of the yeast mating type α-gene 3′-untranslated region, respectively. This fragment was inserted into a BstBI- and KpnI-digested pGS188 β shuttle vector to create pGS188 δ, which ensures the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase yeast promoter driving expression of δ-globin cDNAs does not contain any PCR-induced mutations. The XhoI fragment from pGS188 δ containing the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase yeast promoter, δ-globin cDNA, and yeast mating type α-gene 3′-untranslated region was inserted into pGS389 (α+β) following digestion with XhoI to create pGS389 (α+δ). Clones carrying the δ-globin cDNA insert were identified by PCR using primers 4 and 42. Once the different mutations were constructed in pGS188δ (see below), insertion of the corresponding XhoI fragments into pGS389 was then repeated, resulting in construction of wild type and variant Hb A2 expression vectors. Homologous PCR recombination was used for mutagenesis (25Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial wild type δ-globin cDNA amplified by RT-PCR contained an unanticipated PCR-induced T → C at codon 141 Leu → Pro that was identical to one of the δ-chain variants. This plasmid was used to generate a bona fide wild type δ-globin cDNA. Normal primers 31 and 39 were used to amplify one region of pGS188, whereas primers 32 and 38 were used to amplify the other half. These two PCR products have complementary ends and were introduced into maximum efficiency DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The complementary ends recombine during growth in bacteria to create the wild type δ-globin cDNA plasmid, pGS188 δ. Similarly, primer pairs 31/22 and 32/33 were used to introduce the codon 4 change in wild type δ-globin cDNA and primer pairs 31/34 and 32/35 for the codon 27 change and primer pairs 31/37 and 32/36 for the codon 116 change. DNA sequence analysis was also done for all plasmids to confirm that these were the only PCR-induced changes using the PRISM Ready reaction dyedeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Yeast expression vectors containing wild type or mutant δ-globin cDNAs were electroporated (26Lorrow-Murray D. Jessee J. Focus (Idaho). 1991; 13: 65-68Google Scholar) into GSY112 yeast cells (27Martin de Llano J.J. Schneewind O. Stetler G. Manning J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 918-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using a Cell-Porator (Life Technologies, Inc.). Yeast growth, harvesting, and purification of Hb A2 and variants were performed as described previously (25Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Hb A2 variants were subjected to electrospray mass analysis (Fisons Instruments, VG Biotech, Altricham, UK) using the multiply charged ion peaks from the α-globin chain (molecular mass, 15,126.4 Da) as an external reference for mass scale calibrations (28Shackleton C.H. Witkowska H.E. Desiderio D.M. Mass Spectrometry: Clinical and Biomedical Applications. Vol 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 135Google Scholar). Hemoglobin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically on a Hitachi U2000 spectrophotometer using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 13.4 at 540 nm for carbonmonoxyhemoglobin and 13.5 at 541 nm for oxyhemoglobin (29Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reaction Ligands. North Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1971Google Scholar). Hemoglobin tetramers were electrophoresed on cellulose acetate at pH 8.6 using Super Heme buffer (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) and were stained with Ponceau S stain (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Heat stabilities of the recombinant oxyhemoglobins (at ∼40 μM) were determined in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, by heating 500-μl samples in a heating block at 45°C for 10-min intervals. Interdisulfide bond formation of Hb δR116C was assessed by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography employing Superose-12 HR 10/30 using 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 4°C followed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15% w/v) as described previously (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207050) Google Scholar). Mechanical stabilities of the recombinant hemoglobins were measured in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature as described previously using a TCS shaker Model 250 (TCS Medical Products Co., Huntington Valley, PA) (31Asakura T. Ohnishi T. Friedman S. Schwartz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1594-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After shaking, the cuvette was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to remove denatured, insoluble hemoglobin. Concentration of the soluble hemoglobin was determined spectrophotometrically. Oxygen association curves of hemoglobins were determined in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 20°C using a Hemox-Analyzer (TCS Medical Products Co.) as described previously (32Festa R.S. Asakura T. Transfusion. 1979; 19: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Having previously identified five δ-globin gene alleles (1Trifillis P. Ioannou P. Schwartz E. Surrey S. Blood. 1991; 78: 3298-3305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trifillis P. Kyrri A. Kalogirou E. Kokkofitou A. Ioannou P. Schwartz E. Surrey S. Blood. 1993; 82: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to define how each leads to reduced levels of Hb A2. We were also interested in determining which of the three changes, C → T at codon 4, C → T at codon 97, or the AT deletion in IVS-2, found in the same δ-globin gene, was responsible for reduced Hb A2. Changes were grouped into two categories: (a) those that could potentially affect splicing such as G → T at codon 27, C → T at codon 97, IVS-2 AT deletion, and AG → GG at the 3′-acceptor of IVS-2 and (b) those that result in generation of structural variants such as C → T at codon 4 Thr → Ile, G → T at codon 27 Ala → Ser, C → T at codon 116 Arg → Cys, and T → C at codon 141 Leu → Pro. We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce G → T at codon 27, C → T at codon 97, the IVS-2 AT deletion, and AG → GG at the 3′-acceptor of IVS-2 in the normal δ-globin gene. These modified δ-genes were placed in pSVK3, a mammalian expression vector, under the control of the SV40 early promoter, and plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells to evaluate effects on splicing using RNase protection and RT-PCR assays. A radiolabeled riboprobe that detects exon 1, IVS-1, and exon 2 δ-globin gene sequences was used (Fig. 1). Wild type and codon 97 plasmids produce two sets of doublets at ∼237 and 88 bp; therefore, the codon 97 change does not alter splicing of IVS-1. On the other hand, the codon 27 plasmid gives, in addition to those bands, smaller sized bands at ∼72 bp, consistent with activation of a cryptic splice site near the mutation in δ-globin mRNA. RT-PCR was employed to define the cryptic splice site used. COS-1 transfected RNA was reverse transcribed, and the exon 1/exon 2 boundary was amplified by PCR. The 398-bp product present in all lanes (Fig. 2) corresponds to amplification of either contaminating plasmid DNA or unspliced mRNA, both of which contain IVS-1 sequences. The 271-bp product, also present in all lanes, is the result of correctly spliced mRNA lacking intronic sequences. In the codon 27 RT-PCR lane, there is an additional band at 255 bp. This PCR product, which contains the alternatively spliced message, was excised from the gel, and the DNA sequence was determined to define the location of the cryptic splice. Genomic DNA sequence encompassing the codon 27 change in this individual is shown in Fig. 3 with outlined letters starting with GGTG and dotted line splice to ATT … indicating the sequence of aberrantly spliced message deduced from the PCR product. The G → T change at codon 27 activates a cryptic splice site (GTGGTGAGG to GTG′GTGAGT) within δ-globin mRNA, whose last six nucleotides match perfectly to the donor splice site consensus listed at the bottom. Use of this cryptic splice results in a smaller mRNA containing a frameshift and premature termination at codon 55. Aberrant splicing of this pre-mRNA accounts for about 80% of total mRNA, as determined by densitometric scans of RNase protection patterns.Fig. 3Nucleotide sequence from codon 27 aberrantly spliced mRNA. Exonic sequences in normal mRNA are shown in boxed areas with capital letters, and intronic sequences in lowercase letters with the solid V-shaped line indicating normal splicing. The outlined letters show the sequence in the alternatively spliced codon 27 mRNA with the dashed line indicating aberrant splicing. The T → A change at the third position of codon 24, the G → A change at the first position of codon 26, and the G → T change at the first position of codon 27 are shown with arrows. The prime mark indicates the codon triplets. The underlined sequence indicates the cryptic splice site that is activated by this mutation. At the bottom left corner of the figure the consensus splice donor sequence is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As evident from both RNase protection and RT-PCR, the codon 97 change does not alter splicing around IVS-1. Because this mutation is at the 3′-end of exon 2, it could potentially affect splicing of ISV-2. To test this, a riboprobe that detects exon 2, IVS-2, and exon 3 sequences was hybridized to COS-1 transfected RNAs from three different plasmids containing either the codon 97, IVS-2 AT deletion, or AG → GG change in the 3′-splice acceptor of IVS-2 (Fig. 4). Wild type, codon 97, and IVS-2 AT deletion plasmids produce expected 258- and 201-bp bands, indicating that these changes do not alter splicing. An additional doublet is present in the codon 97 lane, which most likely represents an artifact, because it appears in wild type and AT deletion lanes upon longer exposure. On the other hand, the AG → GG in the 3′-acceptor splice site of IVS-2 results in aberrant splicing because only the 201-bp band is present in this lane. There is no evidence of a larger protected fragment to indicate use of a cryptic splice site in IVS-2. Because the 201-bp band corresponds to hybridization of riboprobe to exon 2 sequences and the 258 bp band corresponds to hybridization to exon 3 sequences, we conclude that the AG → GG change completely abolishes only the 3′-splice acceptor site of IVS-2. The 5′-donor site is still used because the 201-bp band is detected. Most likely, a 3′-acceptor site in the vector is being used, which cannot be detected by this riboprobe. These results were also confirmed using RT-PCR. COS-1 transfected RNA from wild type, codon 27, codon 97, IVS-2 AT deletion, or mutant IVS-2 3′-acceptor plasmids were reverse transcribed, and the exon 2/exon 3 boundary was subsequently PCR amplified. A single band of 320 bp was observed except for the mutant IVS-2 3′-acceptor plasmid where no bands were detected (data not shown). The 320-bp band corresponds to normal excision of IVS-2; therefore, absence of this band indicates IVS-2 is not excised normally. Furthermore, the fact that there are no additional bands in either the RNase protection or the RT-PCR assays suggests that there is no cryptic splice site activated in IVS-2 or in the coding region from exon 3. PCR would detect such a cryptic splice because the 3′-primer (primer 24) used in the RT-PCR was complementary to the end of the coding region in exon 3. Of the four changes evaluated in the RNase protection/RT-PCR assays, only the G → T at codon 27 and AG → GG in the 3′-splice acceptor of IVS-2 result in aberrant splicing. Because neither codon 97 nor IVS-2 AT deletion changes leads to aberrant splicing, we conclude that the third change in this complex allele, the C → T at codon 4 Thr → Ile, is responsible for decreased Hb A2. We were also interested in understanding how the four different δ-chain structural variants lead to reduced Hb A2. The C → T at codon 4 Thr → Ile, G → T at codon 27 Ala → Ser, C → T at codon 116 Arg → Cys, and T → C at codon 141 Leu → Pro were introduced separately into normal δ-globin cDNA using homologous PCR recombination (25Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variant δ-globin chains were expressed in a yeast system, which results in production of soluble Hb A2 tetramers, which can be readily isolated. Characterization of oxygen binding properties and stability to heat and mechanical agitation were evaluated in order to monitor functional consequences of these changes. Normal and variant carbonmonoxy forms of the soluble tetramers were purified from yeast using carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-52) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S chromatography (33Adachi K. Konitzer P. Lai C.H. Kim J. Surrey S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of three of the four δ-chain variants resulted in production of soluble variant Hb A2 tetramers, which coeluted with wild type Hb A2. Hb δT4I, Hb δA27S, and Hb δR116C were isolated to homogeneity for further study. No Hb δL141P tetramers were observed after the expression of the codon 141 Leu → Pro δ-chain variant in yeast. Only α-globin monomers were detected after expression of this plasmid. This is most likely due to globin instability or inability to form Hb δL141P tetramers. A sample of each of the other three purified tetramers was studied by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate at pH 8.9 (data n"
