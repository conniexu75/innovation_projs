The uncritical listing of 'species' and the construction of inadequate keys leads to the creation of more 'species' on no grounds other than that they do not fit the described 'species'. No study of the variation within or between species or genera is required, so, in the majority of cases, none is made. Cowan2 has suggested the abolition of priority, and recognition of only such forms as are preserved as type cultures. The difficulty here is that cultures tend to vary upon repeated subculture, some properties (for example, agar digestion, motility, luminescence) being lost very rapidly by some strains. This is especially the case with sapro-phytic forms and is probably not appreciated by those who work only with the more stable pathogenic types and their allies. Furthermore, few type culture collections will include these saprophytic forms."

They are thus complementary to recent discussions, in the Nuffield College Statement and the report of the University Grants Committee, where the academic aspect was dominant. Sir Robert Robinson, after a passing reference to the importance to chemical industry of the duty on light hydrocarbon oils, in which he advocated not only its retention but also extension of the duty and the refund scheme to cover solvents as well, reviewed the question of research in the universities. Sir Robert's opinion that the main function of the universities and colleges is the training of students cannot be taken as implying that research is only a secondary function. In this speech he reiterated the view that academic research should be basic and general in character and not, as is usual in industrial research, directed to limited and specific objectives."
