https://openalex.org/W2036870885,"Developmental fate decisions are dictated by master transcription factors (TFs) that interact with cis-regulatory elements to direct transcriptional programs. Certain malignant tumors may also depend on cellular hierarchies reminiscent of normal development but superimposed on underlying genetic aberrations. In glioblastoma (GBM), a subset of stem-like tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) appears to drive tumor progression and underlie therapeutic resistance yet remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a core set of neurodevelopmental TFs (POU3F2, SOX2, SALL2, and OLIG2) essential for GBM propagation. These TFs coordinately bind and activate TPC-specific regulatory elements and are sufficient to fully reprogram differentiated GBM cells to ""induced"" TPCs, recapitulating the epigenetic landscape and phenotype of native TPCs. We reconstruct a network model that highlights critical interactions and identifies candidate therapeutic targets for eliminating TPCs. Our study establishes the epigenetic basis of a developmental hierarchy in GBM, provides detailed insight into underlying gene regulatory programs, and suggests attendant therapeutic strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2102554836,"Cell migration is a critical process for diverse (patho)physiological phenomena. Intriguingly, cell migration through physically confined spaces can persist even when typical hallmarks of 2D planar migration, such as actin polymerization and myosin II-mediated contractility, are inhibited. Here, we present an integrated experimental and theoretical approach (""Osmotic Engine Model"") and demonstrate that directed water permeation is a major mechanism of cell migration in confined microenvironments. Using microfluidic and imaging techniques along with mathematical modeling, we show that tumor cells confined in a narrow channel establish a polarized distribution of Na+/H+ pumps and aquaporins in the cell membrane, which creates a net inflow of water and ions at the cell leading edge and a net outflow of water and ions at the trailing edge, leading to net cell displacement. Collectively, this study presents an alternate mechanism of cell migration in confinement that depends on cell-volume regulation via water permeation."
https://openalex.org/W2160395304,"A major goal of systems biology is the development of models that accurately predict responses to perturbation. Constructing such models requires the collection of dense measurements of system states, yet transformation of data into predictive constructs remains a challenge. To begin to model human immunity, we analyzed immune parameters in depth both at baseline and in response to influenza vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomes, serum titers, cell subpopulation frequencies, and B cell responses were assessed in 63 individuals before and after vaccination and were used to develop a systematic framework to dissect inter- and intra-individual variation and build predictive models of postvaccination antibody responses. Strikingly, independent of age and pre-existing antibody titers, accurate models could be constructed using pre-perturbation cell populations alone, which were validated using independent baseline time points. Most of the parameters contributing to prediction delineated temporally stable baseline differences across individuals, raising the prospect of immune monitoring before intervention."

However, the neural basis for this effect is unclear, and the underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms are unknown. Previous studies revealed that Bhlhb5(-/-) mice, which lack a specific population of spinal inhibitory interneurons (B5-I neurons), develop pathological itch. Here we characterize B5-I neurons and show that they belong to a neurochemically distinct subset. We provide cause-and-effect evidence that B5-I neurons inhibit itch and show that dynorphin, which is released from B5-I neurons, is a key neuromodulator of pruritus. Finally, we show that B5-I neurons are innervated by menthol-, capsaicin-, and mustard oil-responsive sensory neurons and are required for the inhibition of itch by menthol. These findings provide a cellular basis for the inhibition of itch by chemical counterstimuli and suggest that kappa opioids may be a broadly effective therapy for pathological itch."
https://openalex.org/W2126238482,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Elevated LRRK2 kinase activity and neurodegeneration are linked, but the phosphosubstrate that connects LRRK2 kinase activity to neurodegeneration is not known. Here, we show that ribosomal protein s15 is a key pathogenic LRRK2 substrate in Drosophila and human neuron PD models. Phosphodeficient s15 carrying a threonine 136 to alanine substitution rescues dopamine neuron degeneration and age-related locomotor deficits in G2019S LRRK2 transgenic Drosophila and substantially reduces G2019S LRRK2-mediated neurite loss and cell death in human dopamine and cortical neurons. Remarkably, pathogenic LRRK2 stimulates both cap-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation and induces a bulk increase in protein synthesis in Drosophila, which can be prevented by phosphodeficient T136A s15. These results reveal a novel mechanism of PD pathogenesis linked to elevated LRRK2 kinase activity and aberrant protein synthesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2003027140,"Gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are produced endogenously and mediate effects through diverse mechanisms. H2S is one such gasotransmitters that regulates multiple signaling pathways in mammalian cells, and abnormal H2S metabolism has been linked to defects in bone homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) produce H2S in order to regulate their self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation, and H2S deficiency results in defects in BMMSC differentiation. H2S deficiency causes aberrant intracellular Ca(2+) influx because of reduced sulfhydration of cysteine residues on multiple Ca(2+) TRP channels. This decreased Ca(2+) flux downregulates PKC/Erk-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling which controls osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs. Consistently, H2S-deficient mice display an osteoporotic phenotype that can be rescued by small molecules that release H2S. These results demonstrate that H2S regulates BMMSCs and that restoring H2S levels via nontoxic donors may provide treatments for diseases such as osteoporosis that can arise from H2S deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2009301312,"RNA-protein interactions drive fundamental biological processes and are targets for molecular engineering, yet quantitative and comprehensive understanding of the sequence determinants of affinity remains limited. Here we repurpose a high-throughput sequencing instrument to quantitatively measure binding and dissociation of a fluorescently labeled protein to >10(7) RNA targets generated on a flow cell surface by in situ transcription and intermolecular tethering of RNA to DNA. Studying the MS2 coat protein, we decompose the binding energy contributions from primary and secondary RNA structure, and observe that differences in affinity are often driven by sequence-specific changes in both association and dissociation rates. By analyzing the biophysical constraints and modeling mutational paths describing the molecular evolution of MS2 from low- to high-affinity hairpins, we quantify widespread molecular epistasis and a long-hypothesized, structure-dependent preference for G:U base pairs over C:A intermediates in evolutionary trajectories. Our results suggest that quantitative analysis of RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) provides generalizable insight into the biophysical basis and evolutionary consequences of sequence-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1992502609,"Identifying the proteins synthesized at specific times in cells of interest in an animal will facilitate the study of cellular functions and dynamic processes. Here we introduce stochastic orthogonal recoding of translation with chemoselective modification (SORT-M) to address this challenge. SORT-M involves modifying cells to express an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair to enable the incorporation of chemically modifiable analogs of amino acids at diverse sense codons in cells in rich media. We apply SORT-M to Drosophila melanogaster fed standard food to label and image proteins in specific tissues at precise developmental stages with diverse chemistries, including cyclopropene-tetrazine inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions. We also use SORT-M to identify proteins synthesized in germ cells of the fly ovary without dissection. SORT-M will facilitate the definition of proteins synthesized in specific sets of cells to study development, and learning and memory in flies, and may be extended to other animals."
https://openalex.org/W2038650172,"The rapid pace of species discovery outstrips the rate of species description in many taxa. This problem is especially acute for Caenorhabditis nematodes, where the naming of distinct species would greatly improve their visibility and usage for biological research, given the thousands of scientists studying Caenorhabditis. Species description and naming has been hampered in Caenorhabditis, in part due to the presence of morphologically cryptic species despite complete biological reproductive isolation and often enormous molecular divergence. With the aim of expediting species designations, here we propose and apply a revised framework for species diagnosis and description in this group. Our solution prioritizes reproductive isolation over traditional morphological characters as the key feature in delineating and diagnosing new species, reflecting both practical considerations and conceptual justifications. DNA sequence divergence criteria help prioritize crosses for establishing patterns of reproductive isolation among the many species of Caenorhabditis known to science, such as with the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS2) DNA barcode. By adopting this approach, we provide new species name designations for 15 distinct biological species, thus increasing the number of named Caenorhabditis species in laboratory culture by nearly 3-fold. We anticipate that the improved accessibility of these species to the research community will expand the opportunities for study and accelerate our understanding of diverse biological phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2036030316,"Prenatal exposure of the developing brain to various environmental challenges increases susceptibility to late onset of neuropsychiatric dysfunction; still, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we show that exposure of embryos to a variety of environmental factors such as alcohol, methylmercury, and maternal seizure activates HSF1 in cerebral cortical cells. Furthermore, Hsf1 deficiency in the mouse cortex exposed in utero to subthreshold levels of these challenges causes structural abnormalities and increases seizure susceptibility after birth. In addition, we found that human neural progenitor cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from schizophrenia patients show higher variability in the levels of HSF1 activation induced by environmental challenges compared to controls. We propose that HSF1 plays a crucial role in the response of brain cells to prenatal environmental insults and may be a key component in the pathogenesis of late-onset neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2086930913,"Glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2) modulates the activity of several mitochondrial proteins in cardiac tissue by catalyzing deglutathionylation reactions. However, it remains uncertain whether Grx2 is required to control mitochondrial ATP output in heart. Here, we report that Grx2 plays a vital role modulating mitochondrial energetics and heart physiology by mediating the deglutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins. Deletion of Grx2 (Grx2−/−) decreased ATP production by complex I-linked substrates to half that in wild type (WT) mitochondria. Decreased respiration was associated with increased complex I glutathionylation diminishing its activity. Tissue glucose uptake was concomitantly increased. Mitochondrial ATP output and complex I activity could be recovered by restoring the redox environment to that favoring the deglutathionylated states of proteins. Grx2−/− hearts also developed left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, and mice became hypertensive. Mitochondrial energetics from Grx2 heterozygotes (Grx2+/−) were also dysfunctional, and hearts were hypertrophic. Intriguingly, Grx2+/− mice were far less hypertensive than Grx2−/− mice. Thus, Grx2 plays a vital role in modulating mitochondrial metabolism in cardiac muscle, and Grx2 deficiency leads to pathology. As mitochondrial ATP production was restored by the addition of reductants, these findings may be relevant to novel redox-related therapies in cardiac disease.

Glutathionylation reactions have emerged as key post-translational modifications required to control protein function in response to changes in redox (1Mieyal J.J. Gallogly M.M. Qanungo S.

Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1941-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These modifications involve the formation of a disulfide bridge between glutathione (GSH) and an available protein cysteine thiol. Reactions can either proceed nonenzymatically or enzymatically, depending on cell conditions (2Xiong Y. Uys J.D. Tew K.D. Townsend D.M. S-Glutathionylation: from molecular mechanisms to health outcomes.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 15: 233-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).

Nonenzymatic glutathionylation reactions are nonspecific and can lead to the hyper-glutathionylation of proteins, altering their activity (3Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J.

Enzymatic glutathionylation reactions, however, are tightly controlled and highly specific post-translational modifications that occur normally in response to fluctuations in local redox environments (6Wang J.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13086-13091Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The glutaredoxin (Grx) proteins are currently thought to be the chief enzymes that catalyze these reactions (9Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Holmgren A. Glutaredoxin systems.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1304-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Specifically the Grx proteins catalyze the deglutathionylation of protein glutathione disulfide (PSSG) mixtures. In the cytosol, Grx1 is required to catalyze the deglutathionylation of target proteins (10Pai H.V. Starke D.W. Lesnefsky E.J. Hoppel C.L. Mieyal J.J. What is the functional significance of the unique location of glutaredoxin 1 (GRx1) in the intermembrane space of mitochondria?.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Grx1 catalyzes the deglutathionylation of protein targets in two steps as follows: 1) N-terminal cysteine on Grx1 deglutathionylates PSSG via a thiol disulfide exchange reaction yielding the deglutathionylated protein (PSH) and a Grx1-glutathionylated protein (SSG) intermediate; 2) Grx1-SSG binds GSH, and the glutathionyl moiety is removed regenerating Grx1 and producing GSSG (11Gallogly M.M.

Kinetic and mechanistic characterization and versatile catalytic properties of mammalian glutaredoxin 2: implications for intracellular roles.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11144-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the mechanistic details of the catalytic reaction still require clarification (12Deponte M. Glutathione catalysis and the reaction mechanisms of glutathione-dependent enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830: 3217-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), several models for the characteristic nucleophilic displacement ping-pong mechanism of Grx1 have been proposed and include a glutathione scaffold, glutathione activator, and an oxidative half-reaction (12Deponte M. Glutathione catalysis and the reaction mechanisms of glutathione-dependent enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830: 3217-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidence has also suggested that the Grx enzymes can also catalyze protein glutathionylation (13Starke D.W. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J.

This can be mediated via the stabilization of a glutathione thiyl radical that is then subsequently transferred to an available protein thiol (13Starke D.W. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J.

Mitochondrial processes are particularly susceptible to regulation by glutathionylation. This is due to the unique physical properties of the matrix environment. The slight alkalinity of the matrix ionizes protein thiols increasing reactivity toward glutathione (14Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M. Brown S.E. Filipovska A. Murphy M.P. Glutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mitochondria also contain high amounts of protein thiols (60–90 mm), reduced glutathione (GSH; ∼5 mm), and are a major source of ROS, factors that render protein glutathionylation reactions more favorable (14Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M. Brown S.E. Filipovska A. Murphy M.P. Glutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins.Antioxid.

Mitochondrial redox environment fluctuations also occur during fuel oxidation, electron transfer, and the formation of ROS. The thiol oxidoreductase glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2), which has ∼34% homology to Grx1, was recently identified as the enzyme required to catalyze deglutathionylation reactions in mitochondria (16Gallogly M.M.

Intriguingly, Grx2 has been shown to catalyze both the deglutathionylation and glutathionylation of target proteins in mitochondria. The reversible nature of Grx2 is associated with its sensitivity to changes in 2GSH/GSSG as follows: a high 2GSH/GSSG promotes protein deglutathionylation and a low 2GSH/GSSG activates Grx2 glutathionylase activity (24Beer S.M.

Clearly, mitochondrial ATP production is central to heart function. A variety of control mechanisms converge on mitochondria to adjust ATP output. Changes in redox due to temporal differences in mitochondrial metabolism (ROS production, NAD(P)H levels, and GSH and GSSG levels) can feedback to modulate oxidative phosphorylation.

Redox regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthase: implications for cardiac resynchronization therapy.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These proteins fulfill important energetic roles in cardiac mitochondria, including energy substrate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Alterations in the control of mitochondrial glutathionylation can have profound physiological effects. Grx2 overexpression prevents doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury, and this is associated with recovery of mitochondrial respiration (34Diotte N.M. Xiong Y. Gao J. Chua B.H. Ho Y.S. Attenuation of doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury by mitochondrial glutaredoxin 2.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Irregularities in the glutathionylation of the ATP synthase α subunit are associated with cardiac dysfunction (33Wang S.B. Foster D.B. Rucker J. O'Rourke B. Kass D.A. Van Eyk J.E. Redox regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthase: implications for cardiac resynchronization therapy.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, glutathionylation of complex I compromises aerobic metabolism in the heart, contributing to the development of cardiac dysfunction (31Passarelli C. Tozzi G. Pastore A. Bertini E. Piemonte F. GSSG-mediated complex I defect in isolated cardiac mitochondria.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2010; 26: 95-99PubMed Google Scholar). Ischemic reperfusion injury also alters the glutathionylation state of complex II (32Chen Y.R. Chen C.L. Pfeiffer D.R. Zweier J.L. Mitochondrial complex II in the post-ischemic heart: oxidative injury and the role of protein S-glutathionylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32640-32654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the disruption of controlled protein glutathionylation reactions can compromise ATP output by cardiac mitochondria, potentially leading to disease. Despite the number of glutathionylation targets in cardiac mitochondria, it still remains unknown if reversible glutathionylation can regulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS; ATP output). It is also unclear if deregulation of protein deglutathionylation reactions (e.g. loss of Grx2 deglutathionylase activity) in mitochondria can contribute to the development of cardiac dysfunction. In this study, we examine the importance of Grx2 function in cardiac physiology and metabolism. We used germ line Grx2 whole body knock-out (Grx2−/−, Grx2-deficient) mice, which we have recently characterized (28Mailloux R.J. Xuan J.Y. Beauchamp B. Jui L. Lou M. Harper M.E. Glutaredoxin-2 is required to control proton leak through uncoupling protein-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8365-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we found that Grx2 deficiency did not induce any major defects (linear growth, food intake, and liver physiology), but we did note that hearts weighed significantly more (28Mailloux R.J. Xuan J.Y. Beauchamp B. Jui L. Lou M. Harper M.E. Glutaredoxin-2 is required to control proton leak through uncoupling protein-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8365-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the impact of Grx2 deficiency on cardiac metabolism and function. We found that OXPHOS was substantially decreased in cardiac mitochondria from Grx2-deficient mice. The decrease in OXPHOS was due to the glutathionylation of complex I resulting in decreased activity. These biochemical effects were reversed with dithiothreitol (DTT), a reductant known to prompt protein deglutathionylation (35Garcia J. Han D. Sancheti H. Yap L.P. Kaplowitz N. Cadenas E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 21865-21875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), thereby favoring deglutathionylation. The biochemical changes in OXPHOS were associated with development of cardiac abnormalities, including left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and a metabolic shift toward increased glucose uptake. We conclude that Grx2-mediated reversible glutathionylation is critical in modulating mitochondrial ATP output in cardiac muscle, and disruption of this process is pathological. Studies were conducted on male C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and Grx2 whole body knock-out (Grx2−/−) mice aged 9–12 weeks that were backcrossed for over 10 generations into the C57BL/6 strain. Mice were fed ad libitum a standard diet (44.2% carbohydrate, 6.2% fat, 18.6% crude protein; diet T.2018, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). All experiments were performed according to the principles and guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care, and the study was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Ottawa. Mice were genotyped for Grx2 prior to experimentation. Body and heart weights along with femur lengths were measured. Serum hemoglobin levels were measured using a kit purchased from Sigma, and assays were conducted as described by the manufacturer. For time profile experiments, mice were aged either 6 or 10 weeks. For M-mode and pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography, mice were anesthetized (2.0% isoflurane, 80 ml/min 100% O2); anterior chests were shaved, and two-dimensional guided M-mode and pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography were performed using a VEVO 2100 system (Visual Sonics, Amsterdam) with a 30-MHz linear array transducer. Images and videos were analyzed using the VEVO 2100 analysis software. Small animal PET FDG imaging was conducted with the InveonTM DPET small animal scanner (Siemens, Knoxville, TN). Mice were scanned under anesthesia (2–2.5% isoflurane, 2–2.5 ml/min oxygen) in a fed state. A 60-min list-mode acquisition was started together with a 10–20-s tail vein injection of FDG (25.9 ± 6.94 MBq in 150 μl). List data were sorted into 26 dynamic frames (12 × 10, 3 × 60, and 11 × 300s) and reconstructed using OSEM3D with 10 iterations, 16 subsets, zoom of 2.5 with a 128 × 128 matrix, resulting in a 0.35-mm transaxial pixel size. Images were corrected for radioactive decay, random coincidences, and dead-time losses using the vendor software (IAW version 1.5). Blood glucose was measured prior to FDG injection with Advantage blood glucose strips (AccuChek, Roche Diagnostics). Myocardial time activity curves were compared using standard uptake values calculated by dividing the activity concentration in the region of interest (Bq/ml) by the activity concentration per body weight injected into the animal (Bq/g) (Siemens IRW software). Patlak kinetic analysis of reconstructed images was performed on the myocardium at 10–40 min as described previously with FlowQuant semi-automated software (63Thorn S.L. deKemp R.A. Dumouchel T. Klein R. Renaud J.M. Wells R.G. Gollob M.H. Beanlands R.S. DaSilva J.N. Repeatable noninvasive measurement of mouse myocardial glucose uptake with 18F-FDG: evaluation of tracer kinetics in a type 1 diabetes model.J. Nucl. Med. 2013; 54: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Regional rate of myocardial glucose uptake (rMGU) was determined for each animal using the Equation 1, rMGU=Ki×BG/LC(mmol/min/g)(Eq. 1) where Ki is the Patlak uptake rate constant; BG is the blood glucose concentration, and LC is the lumped constant equal to 0.67, which accounts for differences in the uptake and phosphorylation of FDG versus glucose. Hearts were placed in 10% formalin for 48 h and then in 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. Transverse sections were taken at the vertical midpoint of the heart (4 μm each), and deparaffinized sections were stained with Sirius Red, which stains fibrillar types 1 and 3 collagen. Analysis of the extent of fibrosis was determined using Zen software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) whereby thresholds were set for collagen-stained areas, and identified areas were expressed as a percentage of the total tissue area. Systolic blood pressure was determined using a BP-2000 Blood Pressure Analysis SystemTM (Visitech Systems; Apex, NC). This is a noninvasive computerized tail-cuff system. Mice (age of 10 weeks) were placed on the BP-200 platform (pre-warmed to 30 °C), and tails were passed through the tail cuffs. Mice were acclimated to the system daily for 5 days. After acclimation, blood pressure measurements were conducted between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. daily for 5 days. Each day, mice were further acclimatized for 10 min prior to the 20-min measurement period. Electron microscopic imaging was performed on fixed and stained sections of the left ventricle. For heart fixation, mice were fully anesthetized using isofluorane (∼5%, O2 at ∼1 liter/min). The left ventricle near the apex was punctured with a 25-gauge needle, and a small incision was made in right atrium for fluid efflux. Hearts were then perfused slowly with heparinized saline until the efflux was clear and then perfused with fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde + 2% formaldehyde in PBS). Hearts were excised, placed in fixative, and stored at 4 °C. A Leica Ultracut E ultramicrotome was used to section the tissue, and sections were counterstained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Images were collected using JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscopy at 60 kV. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (37Rogers G.W. Brand M.D. Petrosyan S. Ashok D. Elorza A.A. Ferrick D.A. Murphy A.N. High throughput microplate respiratory measurements using minimal quantities of isolated mitochondria.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e21746Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Hearts were excised and placed immediately in homogenizing buffer (HM: 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm pyruvate, 2 mm malate or 0.5 mm l-carnitine, 2 mm malate, pH 7.2). On the day of experiments, HM was supplemented with 1% (w/v) defatted BSA + 2 units of subtilisin A. Tissue was cut into small pieces and washed four times in HM. Pieces were minced and then homogenized using the Potter-Elvehjem method. Homogenates were placed in centrifugation tubes and spun at 18,000 × g for 9 min. Pellets were resuspended in fresh HM and centrifuged at 800 × g for 9 min. Supernatants were carefully transferred into new centrifugation tubes and spun at 10,000 × g for 9 min. The mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in a 100 μl of HM devoid of BSA and subtilisin A. Protein content was determined by a Bradford assay. Mitochondria were"

Under neurotoxic conditions, p35 undergoes proteolytic cleavage to liberate p25, which has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that p25 is generated following neuronal activity under physiological conditions in a GluN2B- and CaMKIIα-dependent manner. Moreover, we developed a knockin mouse model in which endogenous p35 is replaced with a calpain-resistant mutant p35 (Δp35KI) to prevent p25 generation. The Δp35KI mice exhibit impaired long-term depression and defective memory extinction, likely mediated through persistent GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser845. Finally, crossing the Δp35KI mice with the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) resulted in an amelioration of β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced synaptic depression and cognitive impairment. Together, these results reveal a physiological role of p25 production in synaptic plasticity and memory and provide new insights into the function of p25 in Aβ-associated neurotoxicity and AD-like pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2051198048,"In this Genomics Era, vast amounts of next-generation sequencing data have become publicly available for multiple genomes across hundreds of species. Analyses of these large-scale datasets can become cumbersome, especially when comparing nucleotide polymorphisms across many samples within a dataset and among different datasets or organisms. To facilitate the exploration of allelic variation and diversity, we have developed and deployed an in-house computer software to categorize and visualize these haplotypes. The SNPViz software enables users to analyze region-specific haplotypes from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets for different sequenced genomes. The examination of allelic variation and diversity of important soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] flowering time and maturity genes may provide additional insight into flowering time regulation and enhance researchers' ability to target soybean breeding for particular environments. For this study, we utilized two available soybean genomic datasets for a total of 72 soybean genotypes encompassing cultivars, landraces, and the wild species Glycine soja. The major soybean maturity genes E1, E2, E3, and E4 along with the Dt1 gene for plant growth architecture were analyzed in an effort to determine the number of major haplotypes for each gene, to evaluate the consistency of the haplotypes with characterized variant alleles, and to identify evidence of artificial selection. The results indicated classification of a small number of predominant haplogroups for each gene and important insights into possible allelic diversity for each gene within the context of known causative mutations. The software has both a stand-alone and web-based version and can be used to analyze other genes, examine additional soybean datasets, and view similar genome sequence and SNP datasets from other species."
https://openalex.org/W2093587509,"Background Substance misuse is associated with cognitive dysfunction. We used a stop signal task to examine deficits in cognitive control in individuals with opioid dependence (OD). We examined how response inhibition and post-error slowing are compromised and whether methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), abstinence duration, and psychiatric comorbidity are related to these measures in individuals with OD. Methods Two-hundred-and-sixty-four men with OD who were incarcerated at a detention center and abstinent for up to 2 months (n = 108) or at a correctional facility and abstinent for approximately 6 months (n = 156), 65 OD men under MMT at a psychiatric clinic, and 64 age and education matched healthy control (HC) participants were assessed. We computed the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) to index the capacity of response inhibition and post-error slowing (PES) to represent error-related behavioral adjustment, as in our previous work. We examined group effects with analyses of variance and covariance analyses, followed by planned comparisons. Specifically, we compared OD and HC participants to examine the effects of opioid dependence and MMT and compared OD sub-groups to examine the effects of abstinence duration and psychiatric comorbidity. Results The SSRT was significantly prolonged in OD but not MMT individuals, as compared to HC. The extent of post-error slowing diminished in OD and MMT, as compared to HC (trend; p = 0.061), and there was no difference between the OD and MMT groups. Individuals in longer abstinence were no less impaired in these measures. Furthermore, these results remained when psychiatric comorbidities including misuse of other substances were accounted for. Conclusions Methadone treatment appears to be associated with relatively intact cognitive control in opioid dependent individuals. MMT may facilitate public health by augmenting cognitive control and thereby mitigating risky behaviors in heroin addicts."

Some of the recognized LMTK2 effects may be cell-type and tissue specific. Thus far nothing is known about the role of LMTK2 in airway epithelial cells. The goals of this study were to determine the localization of LMTK2, whether it associates with and phosphorylates CFTR at residue Ser737 (CFTR-Ser737) and whether the LMTK2-mediated phosphorylation regulates CFTR endocytic trafficking in human airway epithelial cells. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of CFTR-Ser737 mediated by LMTK2 facilitates endocytosis and reduces the cell surface density of CFTR Cl− channels in human airway epithelial cells. Moreover, LMTK2 knockdown increases Cl− secretion mediated by the wild-type (WT) and rΔF508-CFTR. Thus, interfering with LMTK2 phosphorylation of ΔF508-CFTR-Ser737 may serve as a novel strategy to improve the cell surface stability of pharmacologically rescued ΔF508-CFTR in CF patients.

https://openalex.org/W2005146072,"The interaction of chemokines with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) facilitates the formation of localized chemokine gradients that provide directional signals for migrating cells. In this study, we set out to understand the structural basis and impact of the differing oligomerization propensities of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 and MCP-3/CCL7 on their ability to bind GAGs. These chemokines provide a unique comparison set because CCL2 oligomerizes and oligomerization is required for its full in vivo activity, whereas CCL7 functions as a monomer. To identify the GAG-binding determinants of CCL7, an unbiased hydroxyl radical footprinting approach was employed, followed by a focused mutagenesis study. Compared with the size of the previously defined GAG-binding epitope of CCL2, CCL7 has a larger binding site, consisting of multiple epitopes distributed along its surface. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies indicate that CCL7 is able to bind GAGs with an affinity similar to CCL2 but higher than the non-oligomerizing variant, CCL2(P8A), suggesting that, in contrast to CCL2, the large cluster of GAG-binding residues in CCL7 renders oligomerization unnecessary for high affinity binding. However, the affinity of CCL7 is more sensitive than CCL2 to the density of heparan sulfate on the SPR surfaces; this is likely due to the inability of CCL7 to oligomerize because CCL2(P8A) also binds significantly less tightly to low than high density heparan sulfate surfaces compared with CCL2. Together, the data suggest that CCL7 and CCL2 are non-redundant chemokines and that GAG chain density may provide a mechanism for regulating the accumulation of chemokines on cell surfaces."

The children participated between 2003 and 2008 in a neuropsychological assessment of cognitive ability including IQ tests taken by both the mother and the child. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between parental BMI and child IQ adjusted for a comprehensive set of potential confounders. Child IQ was assessed with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence--Revised (WPPSI-R).The crude association between maternal BMI and child IQ showed that BMI was adversely associated with child IQ with a reduction in IQ of -0.40 point for each one unit increase in BMI. This association was attenuated after adjustment for social factors and maternal IQ to a value of -0.27 (-0.50 to -0.03). After mutual adjustment for the father's BMI and all other factors except maternal IQ, the association between paternal BMI and child IQ yielded a regression coefficient of -0.26 (-0.59 to 0.07), which was comparable to that seen for maternal BMI (-0.20 (-0.44 to 0.04)).Although maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was inversely associated with the IQ of her child, the similar association with paternal BMI suggests that it is not a specific pregnancy related adiposity effect."
https://openalex.org/W1987055835,"Eosinophils are potent inflammatory cells with numerous immune functions, including antigen presentation and exacerbation of inflammatory responses through their capacity to release a range of largely preformed cytokines and lipid mediators. Thus, timely regulation of eosinophil activation and apoptosis is crucial to develop beneficial immune response and to avoid tissue damage and induce resolution of inflammation. Natural Killer (NK) cells have been reported to influence innate and adaptive immune responses by multiple mechanisms including cytotoxicity against other immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the interaction between NK cells and eosinophils. Co-culture experiments revealed that human NK cells could trigger autologous eosinophil activation, as shown by up-regulation of CD69 and down-regulation of CD62L, as well as degranulation, evidenced by increased CD63 surface expression, secretion of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN). Moreover, NK cells significantly and dose dependently increased eosinophil apoptosis as shown by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. Direct contact was necessary for eosinophil degranulation and apoptosis. Increased expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in cocultured eosinophils and inhibition of eosinophil CD63 expression by pharmacologic inhibitors suggest that MAPK and PI3K pathways are involved in NK cell-induced eosinophil degranulation. Finally, we showed that NK cells increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression by eosinophils in co-culture and that mitochondrial inhibitors (rotenone and antimycin) partially diminished NK cell-induced eosinophil apoptosis, suggesting the implication of mitochondrial ROS in NK cell-induced eosinophil apoptosis. Pan-caspase inhibitor (ZVAD-FMK) only slightly decreased eosinophil apoptosis in coculture. Altogether, our results suggest that NK cells regulate eosinophil functions by inducing their activation and their apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2059375716,"Cassava polyploid breeding has drastically improved our knowledge on increasing root yield and its significant tolerance to stresses. In polyploid cassava plants, increases in DNA content highly affect cell volumes and anatomical structures. However, the mechanism of this effect is poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to compare and validate the changes between cassava cultivar NZ199 diploid and autotetraploid at proteomic levels. The results showed that leaf proteome of cassava cultivar NZ199 diploid was clearly differentiated from its autotetraploid genotype using 2-DE combined MS technique. Sixty-five differential protein spots were seen in 2-DE image of autotetraploid genotype in comparison with that of diploid. Fifty-two proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, of which 47 were up-regulated and 5 were down-regulated in autotetraploid genotype compared with diploid genotype. The classified functions of 32 up-regulated proteins were associated with photosynthesis, defense system, hydrocyanic acid (HCN) metabolism, protein biosynthesis, chaperones, amino acid metabolism and signal transduction. The remarkable variation in photosynthetic activity, HCN content and resistance to salt stress between diploid and autotetraploid genotypes is closely linked with expression levels of proteomic profiles. The analysis of protein interaction networks indicated there are direct interactions between the 15 up-regulation proteins involved in the pathways described above. This work provides an insight into understanding the protein regulation mechanism of cassava polyploid genotype, and gives a clue to improve cassava polyploidy breeding in increasing photosynthesis and resistance efficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2018530161,"Background Anaplastic thyroid cancer is considered to be one of the most aggressive human malignancies, and the mean survival time after diagnosis is approximately six months, regardless of treatments. This study aimed to examine how EpCAM and its related molecules are involved in the characteristics of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Methodology/Principal Findings Two differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines (TPC-1 and FTC-133), and two anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (FRO, ACT-1) were analyzed for expression of CD44 standard isoform (CD44s), CD44 variant isoforms, and EpCAM, and human aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) enzymatic activity using flow cytometry. CD44s expression was higher in TPC-1 and FTC-133 than in the FRO and ACT-1, whereas ALDH1 activities were higher in FRO and ACT-1 than in TPC-1 and FTC-133. An inverse correlation between CD44s expression and ALDH1 activity was observed in all thyroid cancer cell lines. As for the expressions of CD44 variant isoforms, ACT-1 showed higher and FRO showed moderate CD44v6 expressions, whereas either TPC-1 or FTC-133 showed negative CD44v6 expression. EpCAM expressions in FRO and ACT-1 were higher than those in TPC-1 and FTC-133, and EpCAM expressions inversely correlated with those of CD44s. A positive correlation was observed between EpCAM expression and ALDH1 activity in thyroid cancer cell lines. In the RT-PCR analysis, the expression levels of EpCAM, caludin-7 and ALDH1 in FRO and ATC-1 cells were significantly higher than those in TPC-1 and FTC-133 cells. In clinical specimens of thyroid cancers, nuclear expression of EpCAM and high expression of CD44v6 were detected significantly more frequently in anaplastic carcinomas. Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests the possibility that EpCAM, together with CD44v6 and claudin-7 as well as ALDH1, may be involved in the development of the aggressive phenotype of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Our findings may suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2081367861,"The tumor invasive phenotype driven by seprase expression/activity has been widely examined in an array of malignant tumor cell types; however, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of this critical protease. Seprase (also named fibroblast activation protein-α, antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme, and dipeptidyl prolyl peptidase 5) is expressed at high levels by stromal fibroblast, endothelial, and tumor cells in a variety of invasive tumors but is undetectable in the majority of normal adult tissues. To examine the transcriptional regulation of the gene, we cloned the human seprase promoter and demonstrated that endogenous seprase expression and exogenous seprase promoter activity are high in invasive melanoma cells but not in non-invasive melanoma cells/primary melanocytes. In addition, we identified a crucial TGF-β-responsive cis-regulatory element in the proximal seprase promoter region that enabled robust transcriptional activation of the gene. Treatment of metastatic but not normal/non-invasive cells with TGF-β1 caused a rapid and profound up-regulation of endogenous seprase mRNA, which coincided with an abolishment of the negative regulator c-Ski, and an increase in binding of Smad3/4 to the seprase promoter in vivo. Blocking TGF-β signaling in invasive melanoma cells through overexpression of c-Ski, chemically using SB-431542, or with a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β significantly reduced seprase mRNA levels. Strikingly, RNAi of seprase in invasive cells greatly diminished their invasive potential in vitro as did blocking TGF-β signaling using SB-431542. Altogether, we found that seprase is transcriptionally up-regulated in invasive melanoma cells via the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway, supporting the roles of both TGF-β and seprase in tumor invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2038405214,"Cellular behavior is strongly influenced by the architecture and pattern of its interfacing extracellular matrix (ECM). For an artificial culture system which could eventually benefit the translation of scientific findings into therapeutic development, the system should capture the key characteristics of a physiological microenvironment. At the same time, it should also enable standardized, high throughput data acquisition. Since an ECM is composed of different fibrous proteins, studying cellular interaction with individual fibrils will be of physiological relevance. In this study, we employ near-field electrospinning to create ordered patterns of collagenous fibrils of gelatin, based on an acetic acid and ethyl acetate aqueous co-solvent system. Tunable conformations of micro-fibrils were directly deposited onto soft polymeric substrates in a single step. We observe that global topographical features of straight lines, beads-on-strings, and curls are dictated by solution conductivity; whereas the finer details such as the fiber cross-sectional profile are tuned by solution viscosity. Using these fibril constructs as cellular assays, we study EA.hy926 endothelial cells' response to ROCK inhibition, because of ROCK's key role in the regulation of cell shape. The fibril array was shown to modulate the cellular morphology towards a pre-capillary cord-like phenotype, which was otherwise not observed on a flat 2-D substrate. Further facilitated by quantitative analysis of morphological parameters, the fibril platform also provides better dissection in the cells' response to a H1152 ROCK inhibitor. In conclusion, the near-field electrospun fibril constructs provide a more physiologically-relevant platform compared to a featureless 2-D surface, and simultaneously permit statistical single-cell image cytometry using conventional microscopy systems. The patterning approach described here is also expected to form the basics for depositing other protein fibrils, seen among potential applications as culture platforms for drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W1971196177,"Proglucagon is expressed in pancreatic α cells, intestinal L cells, and some hypothalamic and brainstem neurons. Tissue-specific processing of proglucagon yields three major peptide hormones as follows: glucagon in the α cells and glucagon-like peptides (GLP)-1 and -2 in the L cells and neurons. Efficient sorting and packaging into the secretory granules of the regulated secretory pathway in each cell type are required for nutrient-regulated secretion of these proglucagon-derived peptides. Our previous work suggested that proglucagon is directed into granules by intrinsic sorting signals after initial processing to glicentin and major proglucagon fragment (McGirr, R., Guizzetti, L., and Dhanvantari, S. (2013) J. Endocrinol. 217, 229–240), leading to the hypothesis that sorting signals may be present in multiple domains. In the present study, we show that the α-helices within glucagon and GLP-1, but not GLP-2, act as sorting signals by efficiently directing a heterologous secretory protein to the regulated secretory pathway. Biophysical characterization of these peptides revealed that glucagon and GLP-1 each encode a nonamphipathic, dipolar α-helix, whereas the helix in GLP-2 is not dipolar. Surprisingly, glicentin and major proglucagon fragment were sorted with different efficiencies, thus providing evidence that proglucagon is first sorted to granules prior to processing. In contrast to many other prohormones in which sorting is directed by ordered prodomains, the sorting determinants of proglucagon lie within the ordered hormone domains of glucagon and GLP-1, illustrating that each prohormone has its own sorting “signature.” Proglucagon is expressed in pancreatic α cells, intestinal L cells, and some hypothalamic and brainstem neurons.

https://openalex.org/W1975603991,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event with a limited hope for recovery and represents an enormous public health issue. It is crucial to understand the disturbances in the metabolic network after SCI to identify injury mechanisms and opportunities for treatment intervention. Through plasma 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) screening, we identified 15 metabolites that made up an ""Eigen-metabolome"" capable of distinguishing rats with severe SCI from healthy control rats. Forty enzymes regulated these 15 metabolites in the metabolic network. We also found that 16 metabolites regulated by 130 enzymes in the metabolic network impacted neurobehavioral recovery. Using the Eigen-metabolome, we established a linear discrimination model to cluster rats with severe and mild SCI and control rats into separate groups and identify the interactive relationships between metabolic biomarkers in the global metabolic network. We identified 10 clusters in the global metabolic network and defined them as distinct metabolic disturbance domains of SCI. Metabolic paths such as retinal, glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid metabolism; NAD-NADPH conversion process, tyrosine metabolism, and cadaverine and putrescine metabolism were included. In summary, we presented a novel interdisciplinary method that integrates metabolomics and global metabolic network analysis to visualize metabolic network disturbances after SCI. Our study demonstrated the systems biological study paradigm that integration of 1H-NMR, metabolomics, and global metabolic network analysis is useful to visualize complex metabolic disturbances after severe SCI. Furthermore, our findings may provide a new quantitative injury severity evaluation model for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2000660748,"Cardiovascular events are important co-morbidities in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Tristetraprolin (TTP) regulates pro-inflammatory processes through mRNA destabilization and therefore TTP-deficient mice (TTP(-/-) mice) develop a chronic inflammation resembling human rheumatoid arthritis. We used this mouse model to evaluate molecular signaling pathways contributing to the enhanced atherosclerotic risk in chronic inflammatory diseases. In the aorta of TTP(-/-) mice we observed elevated mRNA expression of known TTP targets like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, as well as of other pro-atherosclerotic mediators, like Calgranulin A, Cathepsin S, and Osteopontin. Independent of cholesterol levels TTP(-/-) mice showed a significant reduction of acetylcholine-induced, nitric oxide-mediated vasorelaxation. The endothelial dysfunction in TTP(-/-) mice was associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), indicating an enhanced nitric oxide inactivation by RONS in the TTP(-/-) animals. The altered RONS generation correlates with increased expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) resulting from enhanced Nox2 mRNA stability. Although TNF-α is believed to be a central mediator of inflammation-driven atherosclerosis, genetic inactivation of TNF-α neither improved endothelial function nor normalized Nox2 expression or RONS production in TTP(-/-) animals. Systemic inflammation caused by TTP deficiency leads to endothelial dysfunction. This process is independent of cholesterol and not mediated by TNF-α solely. Thus, other mediators, which need to be identified, contribute to enhanced cardiovascular risk in chronic inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2013421886,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1)/endothelin A receptor (ETAR) signaling is important for osteosarcoma (OS) progression. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting ganglioside GD2 reportedly inhibit tumor cell viability independent of the immune system. A recent study suggests that ganglioside GD2 may play an important role in OS progression. In the present study, we for the first time explored the effects of anti-GD2 mAb alone or in combination with ETAR antagonist on OS cell invasiveness and viability. Human OS cell lines Saos-2, MG-63 and SJSA-1 were treated with control IgG (PK136 mAb, 50 µg/mL), anti-GD2 14G2a mAb (50 µg/mL), selective ETAR antagonist BQ123 (5 µM), or 14G2a (50 µg/mL)+BQ123 (5 µM). Cells with knockdown of ETAR (ETAR-shRNA) with or without 14G2a mAb treatment were also tested. Cells treated with selective phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 (50 µM) were used as a positive control. Our results showed that BQ123, ETAR-shRNA and 14G2a mAb individually decreased cell invasion and viability, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity, PI3k activity, and phosphorylation at serine 473 (ser473) of Akt in OS cells. 14G2a mAb in combination with BQ123 or ETAR-shRNA showed significantly stronger inhibitory effects compared with each individual treatment. In all three cell lines tested, 14G2a mAb in combination with BQ123 showed the strongest inhibitory effects. In conclusion, we provide the first in vitro evidence that anti-ganglioside GD2 14G2a mAb effectively inhibits cell invasiveness, MMP-2 expression and activity, and cell viability in human OS cells. ETAR antagonist BQ123 significantly enhances the inhibitory effects of 14G2a mAb, likely mainly through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. This study adds novel insights into OS treatment, which will serve as a solid basis for future in vivo studies on the effects of combined treatment of OS with anti-ganglioside GD2 mAbs and ETAR antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2055930365,"The identification of gene fusions promises to play an important role in personalized cancer treatment decisions. Many rare gene fusion events have been identified in fresh frozen solid tumors from common cancers employing next-generation sequencing technology. However the ability to detect transcripts from gene fusions in RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues, which exist in very large sample repositories for which disease outcome is known, is still limited due to the low complexity of FFPE libraries and the lack of appropriate bioinformatics methods. We sought to develop a bioinformatics method, named gFuse, to detect fusion transcripts in FFPE tumor tissues. An integrated, cohort based strategy has been used in gFuse to examine single-end 50 base pair (bp) reads generated from FFPE RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets employing two breast cancer cohorts of 136 and 76 patients. In total, 118 fusion events were detected transcriptome-wide at base-pair resolution across the 212 samples. We selected 77 candidate fusions based on their biological relevance to cancer and supported 61% of these using TaqMan assays. Direct sequencing of 19 of the fusion sequences identified by TaqMan confirmed them. Three unique fused gene pairs were recurrent across the 212 patients with 6, 3, 2 individuals harboring these fusions respectively. We show here that a high frequency of fusion transcripts detected at the whole transcriptome level correlates with poor outcome (P<0.0005) in human breast cancer patients. This study demonstrates the ability to detect fusion transcripts as biomarkers from archival FFPE tissues, and the potential prognostic value of the fusion transcripts detected."

https://openalex.org/W2079726463,"The high rainfall and low sea level during Early Holocene had a significant impact on the development and sustenance of dense forest and swamp-marsh cover along the southwest coast of India. This heavy rainfall flooded the coastal plains, forest flourishing in the abandoned river channels and other low-lying areas in midland.The coastline and other areas in lowland of southwestern India supply sufficient evidence of tree trunks of wet evergreen forests getting buried during the Holocene period under varying thickness of clay, silty-clay and even in sand sequences. This preserved subfossil log assemblage forms an excellent proxy for eco-geomorphological and palaeoclimate appraisal reported hitherto from Indian subcontinent, and complements the available palynological data. The bulk of the subfossil logs and partially carbonized wood remains have yielded age prior to the Holocene transgression of 6.5 k yrs BP, suggesting therein that flooding due to heavy rainfall drowned the forest cover, even extending to parts of the present shelf. These preserved logs represent a unique palaeoenvironmental database as they contain observable cellular structure. Some of them can even be compared to modern analogues. As these woods belong to the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, they form a valuable source of climate data that alleviates the lack of contemporaneous meteorological records. These palaeoforests along with pollen proxies depict the warmer environment in this region, which is consistent with a Mid Holocene Thermal Maximum often referred to as Holocene Climate Optimum. Thus, the subfossil logs of tropical evergreen forests constitute new indices of Asian palaeomonsoon, while their occurrence and preservation are attributed to eco-geomorphology and hydrological regimes associated with the intensified Asian Summer Monsoon, as recorded elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2327351872,"The KCNE3 β-subunit interacts with and regulates the voltage-dependent gating, kinetics, and pharmacology of a variety of Kv channels in neurons. Because a single neuron may express multiple KCNE3 partners, it is impossible to predict the overall functional relevance of the single transmembrane domain peptide on the pore-forming K(+) channel subunits with which it associates. In the inner ear, the role of KCNE3 is undefined, despite its association with Meniere disease and tinnitus. To gain insights on the functional significance of KCNE3 in auditory neurons, we examined the properties of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in Kcne3 null mutant neurons relative to their age-matched controls. We demonstrate that null deletion of Kcne3 abolishes characteristic wide variations in the resting membrane potentials of SGNs and yields age-dependent alterations in action potential and firing properties of neurons along the contour of the cochlear axis, in comparison with age-matched wild-type neurons. The properties of basal SGNs were markedly altered in Kcne3(-/-) mice compared with the wild-type controls; these include reduced action potential latency, amplitude, and increased firing frequency. Analyses of the underlying conductance demonstrate that null mutation of Kcne3 results in enhanced outward K(+) currents, which is sufficient to explain the ensuing membrane potential changes. Additionally, we have demonstrated that KCNE3 may regulate the activity of Kv4.2 channels in SGNs. Finally, there were developmentally mediated compensatory changes that occurred such that, by 8 weeks after birth, the electrical properties of the null mutant neurons were virtually indistinguishable from the wild-type neurons, suggesting that ion channel remodeling in auditory neurons progresses beyond hearing onset."
https://openalex.org/W2006276964,"The physiologic oxygen pressures inside the bone marrow environment are much lower than what is present in the peripheral circulation, ranging from 1–7%, compared to values as high as 10–13% in the arteries, lungs and liver. Thus, experiments done with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) using standard culture conditions may not accurately reflect the true hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment. However, since aging is associated with an increased generation of reactive oxygen species, experiments done under 21%O2 conditions may actually more closely resemble that of the aging bone marrow environment. Aromatic amino acids are known to be natural anti-oxidants. We have previously reported that aromatic amino acids are potent agonists for stimulating increases in intracellular calcium and phospho-c-Raf and in promoting BMMSC differentiation down the osteogenic pathway. Our previous experiments were performed under normoxic conditions. Thus, we next decided to compare a normoxic (21% O2) vs. a hypoxic environment (3% O2) alone or after treatment with aromatic amino acids. Reverse-phase protein arrays showed that 3% O2 itself up-regulated proliferative pathways. Aromatic amino acids had no additional effect on signaling pathways under these conditions. However, under 21%O2 conditions, aromatic amino acids could now significantly increase these proliferative pathways over this “normoxic” baseline. Pharmacologic studies are consistent with the aromatic amino acids activating the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor. The effects of aromatic amino acids on BMMSC function in the 21% O2 environment is consistent with a potential role for these amino acids in an aging environment as functional anti oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2164271814,"Along with the increasing need for living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), the issue of organ shortage has become a serious problem. Therefore, the use of organs from elderly donors has been increasing. While the short-term results of LDLT have greatly improved, problems affecting the long-term outcome of transplant patients remain unsolved. Furthermore, since contradictory data have been reported with regard to the relationship between donor age and LT/LDLT outcome, the question of whether the use of elderly donors influences the long-term outcome of a graft after LT/LDLT remains unsettled. To address whether hepatocyte telomere length reflects the outcome of LDLT, we analyzed the telomere lengths of hepatocytes in informative biopsy samples from 12 paired donors and recipients (grafts) of pediatric LDLT more than 5 years after adult-to-child LDLT because of primary biliary atresia, using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). The telomere lengths in the paired samples showed a robust relationship between the donor and grafted hepatocytes (r = 0.765, p = 0.0038), demonstrating the feasibility of our Q-FISH method for cell-specific evaluation. While 8 pairs showed no significant difference between the telomere lengths for the donor and the recipient, the other 4 pairs showed significantly shorter telomeres in the recipient than in the donor. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the donors in the latter group were older than those in the former (p = 0.001). Despite the small number of subjects, this pilot study indicates that donor age is a crucial factor affecting telomere length sustainability in hepatocytes after pediatric LDLT, and that the telomeres in grafted livers may be elongated somewhat longer when the grafts are immunologically well controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2040761513,Protons activate acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in the central nervous system (CNS) although the impact of such activation on brain outputs remains elusive. Progress elucidating the functional roles of ASIC1a in the CNS has been hindered by technical difficulties of achieving acidification with spatial and temporal precision. We have implemented a method to control optically the opening of ASIC1a in brain slices and also in awake animals. The light-driven H(+) pump ArchT was expressed in astrocytes of mouse cortex by injection of adenoviral vectors containing a strong and astrocyte-specific promoter. Illumination with amber light acidified the surrounding interstitium and led to activation of endogenous ASIC1a channels and firing of action potentials in neurons localized in close proximity to ArchT-expressing astrocytes. We conclude that this optogenetic method offers a minimally invasive approach that enables examining the biological consequences of ASIC1a currents in any structure of the CNS and in the modulation of animal behaviors.
https://openalex.org/W1966791322,"The ability to down-regulate leaf maximum net photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and dark respiration rate (Rdark) in response to shading is thought to be an important adaptation of trees to the wide range of light environments that they are exposed to across space and time. A simple, general rule that accurately described this down-regulation would improve carbon cycle models and enhance our understanding of how forest successional diversity is maintained. In this paper, we investigated the light response of Amax and Rdark for saplings of six temperate forest tree species in New Jersey, USA, and formulated a simple model of down-regulation that could be incorporated into carbon cycle models. We found that full-sun values of Amax and Rdark differed significantly among species, but the rate of down-regulation (proportional decrease in Amax or Rdark relative to the full-sun value) in response to shade was not significantly species- or taxon-specific. Shade leaves of sun-grown plants appear to follow the same pattern of down-regulation in response to shade as leaves of shade-grown plants. Given the light level above a leaf and one species-specific number (either the full-sun Amax or full-sun Rdark), we provide a formula that can accurately predict the leaf's Amax and Rdark. We further show that most of the down regulation of per unit area Rdark and Amax is caused by reductions in leaf mass per unit area (LMA): as light decreases, leaves get thinner, while per unit mass Amax and Rdark remain approximately constant."
https://openalex.org/W2109369482,"Bacteria use diverse signaling pathways to control gene expression in response to external stimuli. In Gram-negative bacteria, the binding of a nutrient is sensed by an outer membrane transporter. This signal is then transmitted to an antisigma factor and subsequently to the cytoplasm where an ECF sigma factor induces expression of genes related to the acquisition of this nutrient. The molecular interactions involved in this transmembrane signaling are poorly understood and structural data on this family of antisigma factor are rare. Here, we present the first structural study of the periplasmic domain of an antisigma factor and its interaction with the transporter. The study concerns the signaling in the heme acquisition system (Has) of Serratia marcescens. Our data support unprecedented partially disordered periplasmic domain of an anti-sigma factor HasS in contact with a membrane-mimicking environment. We solved the 3D structure of the signaling domain of HasR transporter and identified the residues at the HasS-HasR interface. Their conservation in several bacteria suggests wider significance of the proposed model for the understanding of bacterial transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1969799171,"To assess the possible existence of unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities and delineate the characterization of copy number alterations (CNAs) of acute myeloid leukemia-M5 (AML-M5), R-banding karyotype, oligonucelotide array CGH and FISH were performed in 24 patients with AML-M5. A total of 117 CNAs with size ranging from 0.004 to 146.263 Mb was recognized in 12 of 24 cases, involving all chromosomes other than chromosome 1, 4, X and Y. Cryptic CNAs with size less than 5 Mb accounted for 59.8% of all the CNAs. 12 recurrent chromosomal alterations were mapped. Seven out of them were described in the previous AML studies and five were new candidate AML-M5 associated CNAs, including gains of 3q26.2-qter and 13q31.3 as well as losses of 2q24.2, 8p12 and 14q32. Amplication of 3q26.2-qter was the sole large recurrent chromosomal anomaly and the pathogenic mechanism in AML-M5 was possibly different from the classical recurrent 3q21q26 abnormality in AML. As a tumor suppressor gene, FOXN3, was singled out from the small recurrent CNA of 14q32, however, it is proved that deletion of FOXN3 is a common marker of myeloid leukemia rather than a specific marker for AML-M5 subtype. Moreover, the concurrent amplication of MLL and deletion of CDKN2A were noted and it might be associated with AML-M5. The number of CNA did not show a significant association with clinico-biological parameters and CR number of the 22 patients received chemotherapy. This study provided the evidence that array CGH served as a complementary platform for routine cytogenetic analysis to identify those cryptic alterations in the patients with AML-M5. As a subtype of AML, AML-M5 carries both common recurrent CNAs and unique CNAs, which may harbor novel oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Clarifying the role of these genes will contribute to the understanding of leukemogenic network of AML-M5."
https://openalex.org/W1970322414,"Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify disease-associations for single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) from scattered genomic-locations. However, SNPs frequently reside on several different SNP-haplotypes, only some of which may be disease-associated. This circumstance lowers the observed odds-ratio for disease-association. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we develop a method to identify the two SNP-haplotypes, which combine to produce each person’s SNP-genotype over specified chromosomal segments. Two multiple sclerosis (MS)-associated genetic regions were modeled; DRB1 (a Class II molecule of the major histocompatibility complex) and MMEL1 (an endopeptidase that degrades both neuropeptides and β-amyloid). For each locus, we considered sets of eleven adjacent SNPs, surrounding the putative disease-associated gene and spanning ∼200 kb of DNA. The SNP-information was converted into an ordered-set of eleven-numbers (subject-vectors) based on whether a person had zero, one, or two copies of particular SNP-variant at each sequential SNP-location. SNP-strings were defined as those ordered-combinations of eleven-numbers (0 or 1), representing a haplotype, two of which combined to form the observed subject-vector. Subject-vectors were resolved using probabilistic methods. In both regions, only a small number of SNP-strings were present. We compared our method to the SHAPEIT-2 phasing-algorithm. When the SNP-information spanning 200 kb was used, SHAPEIT-2 was inaccurate. When the SHAPEIT-2 window was increased to 2,000 kb, the concordance between the two methods, in both of these eleven-SNP regions, was over 99%, suggesting that, in these regions, both methods were quite accurate. Nevertheless, correspondence was not uniformly high over the entire DNA-span but, rather, was characterized by alternating peaks and valleys of concordance. Moreover, in the valleys of poor-correspondence, SHAPEIT-2 was also inconsistent with itself, suggesting that the SNP-string method is more accurate across the entire region. Conclusions/Significance Accurate haplotype identification will enhance the detection of genetic-associations. The SNP-string method provides a simple means to accomplish this and can be extended to cover larger genomic regions, thereby improving a GWAS’s power, even for those published previously."

In human adrenal chromaffin cells, α6β4* nAChRs (the asterisk denotes the possible presence of additional subunits) are the predominant subtype whereas in rodents, the predominant nAChR is the α3β4* subtype. Here we present molecular and pharmacological evidence that chromaffin cells from monkey (Macaca mulatta) also express α6β4* receptors. PCR was used to show the presence of transcripts for α6 and β4 subunits and pharmacological characterization was performed using patch-clamp electrophysiology in combination with α-conotoxins that target the α6β4* subtype. Acetylcholine-evoked currents were sensitive to inhibition by BuIA[T5A,P6O] and MII[H9A,L15A]; α-conotoxins that inhibit α6-containing nAChRs. Two additional agonists were used to probe for the expression of α7 and β2-containing nAChRs. Cells with currents evoked by acetylcholine were relatively unresponsive to the α7-selctive agonist choline but responded to the agonist 5-I-A-85380.

Yet questions remain about spatiotemporal patterns of neural processes underlying attentional biases toward emotionally significant aspects of the world. One index of affectively biased attention is an emotional variant of an attentional blink (AB) paradigm, which reveals enhanced perceptual encoding for emotionally salient over neutral stimuli under conditions of limited executive attention. The present study took advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural activation related to emotional and neutral targets in an AB task. MEG data were collected while participants performed a rapid stimulus visual presentation task in which two target stimuli were embedded in a stream of distractor words. The first target (T1) was a number and the second (T2) either an emotionally salient or neutral word. Behavioural results replicated previous findings of greater accuracy for emotionally salient than neutral T2 words. MEG source analyses showed that activation in orbitofrontal cortex, characterized by greater power in the theta and alpha bands, and dorsolateral prefrontal activation were associated with successful perceptual encoding of emotionally salient relative to neutral words. These effects were observed between 250 and 550 ms, latencies associated with discrimination of perceived from unperceived stimuli. These data suggest that important nodes of both emotional salience and frontoparietal executive systems are associated with the emotional modulation of the attentional blink."
https://openalex.org/W1965739040,"Anatomical, histological, and ultrastructural studies of the European beaver stomach revealed several unique morphological features. The prominent attribute of its gross morphology was the cardiogastric gland (CGG), located near the oesophageal entrance. Light microscopy showed that the CGG was formed by invaginations of the mucosa into the submucosa, which contained densely packed proper gastric glands comprised primarily of parietal and chief cells. Mucous neck cells represented <0.1% of cells in the CGG gastric glands and 22-32% of cells in the proper gastric glands of the mucosa lining the stomach lumen. These data suggest that chief cells in the CGG develop from undifferentiated cells that migrate through the gastric gland neck rather than from mucous neck cells. Classical chief cell formation (i.e., arising from mucous neck cells) occurred in the mucosa lining the stomach lumen, however. The muscularis around the CGG consisted primarily of skeletal muscle tissue. The cardiac region was rudimentary while the fundus/corpus and pyloric regions were equally developed. Another unusual feature of the beaver stomach was the presence of specific mucus with a thickness up to 950 µm (in frozen, unfixed sections) that coated the mucosa. Our observations suggest that the formation of this mucus is complex and includes the secretory granule accumulation in the cytoplasm of pit cells, the granule aggregation inside cells, and the incorporation of degenerating cells into the mucus."

Adequate adherence to care was defined as a CD4 measurement at least every 6 months. Immune reconstitution (CD4≥200/mm3) and risk of death were studied using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.In a context of a decreasing incidence of PCP, 1259 HIV-infected patients had a PCP diagnosis, and 593 (47%) were PE patients of whom 161 (27%) have had a prior history of AIDS-defining clinical illness (prior ADI). Median time since enrolment was 8 years for PE patients; 74% had received cART. Median proportion of time with adequate adherence to care was 85% (IQR, 66-96) for all FHDH enrollees, but only 45% (IQR, 1-81) for PE patients during the 2 years before PCP. Median CD4 cell count (38/mm3) and HIV viral load (5.2 log10 copies/ml) at PCP diagnosis did not differ between PE patients and the reference group. Three year mortality rate of 25% was observed for PE prior ADI group, higher than in PE non-prior ADI group (8%) and the reference group (9%) (p<0.0001). In the PE prior ADI group, poor prognosis remained even after adjustment for virological control and immune reconstitution (HR, 2.4 [95%CI, 1.5-3.7]).Almost 50% of PCP diagnoses in HIV-infected patients occurred presently in patients already in care, mainly with a previous cART prescription but with waning adherence to care. Having repeated ADI is contributing to the risk of death beyond its impact on immune reconstitution and viral suppression: special efforts must be undertaken to maintain those patients in care."
https://openalex.org/W2075205811,"Scml2 is a member of the Polycomb group of proteins involved in epigenetic gene silencing. Human Scml2 is a part of a multisubunit protein complex, PRC1 (Polycomb repressive complex 1), which is responsible for maintenance of gene repression, prevention of chromatin remodeling, preservation of the “stemness” of the cell, and cell differentiation. Although the majority of PRC1 subunits have been recently characterized, the structure of Scml2 and its role in PRC1-mediated gene silencing remain unknown. In this work a conserved protein domain within human Scml2 has been identified, and its structure was determined by solution NMR spectroscopy. This module was named Scm-like embedded domain, or SLED. Evolutionarily, the SLED domain emerges in the first multicellular organisms, consistent with the role of Scml2 in cell differentiation. Furthermore, it is exclusively found within the Scm-like family of proteins, often accompanied by malignant brain tumor domain (MBT) and sterile α motif (SAM) domains. The domain adopts a novel α/β fold with no structural analogues found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The ability of the SLED to bind double-stranded DNA was also examined, and the isolated domain was shown to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Because PRC1 complexes localize to the promoters of a specific subset of developmental genes in vivo, the SLED domain of Scml2 may provide an important link connecting the PRC1 complexes to their target genes. Scml2 is a member of the Polycomb group of proteins involved in epigenetic gene silencing. Human Scml2 is a part of a multisubunit protein complex, PRC1 (Polycomb repressive complex 1), which is responsible for maintenance of gene repression, prevention of chromatin remodeling, preservation of the “stemness” of the cell, and cell differentiation. Although the majority of PRC1 subunits have been recently characterized, the structure of Scml2 and its role in PRC1-mediated gene silencing remain unknown. In this work a conserved protein domain within human Scml2 has been identified, and its structure was determined by solution NMR spectroscopy. This module was named Scm-like embedded domain, or SLED. Evolutionarily, the SLED domain emerges in the first multicellular organisms, consistent with the role of Scml2 in cell differentiation. Furthermore, it is exclusively found within the Scm-like family of proteins, often accompanied by malignant brain tumor domain (MBT) and sterile α motif (SAM) domains. The domain adopts a novel α/β fold with no structural analogues found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The ability of the SLED to bind double-stranded DNA was also examined, and the isolated domain was shown to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Because PRC1 complexes localize to the promoters of a specific subset of developmental genes in vivo, the SLED domain of Scml2 may provide an important link connecting the PRC1 complexes to their target genes.

Di Stefano B. Di Croce L. Polycomb complexes in stem cells and embryonic development.Development. 2013; 140: 2525-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). They are crucial for epigenetic gene silencing, maintenance of the pluripotent state of stem cells, and cell differentiation. PcG proteins form a few distinct multisubunit nuclear complexes, among which Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) are the best studied (2Gao Z. Zhang J. Bonasio R. Strino F. Sawai A.

Cell. 2012; 45: 344-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Both PRC1 and PRC2 covalently modify histones and work together to accomplish their goal: silencing of a group of developmental genes (3Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Occupying chromatin: Polycomb mechanisms for getting to genomic targets, stopping transcriptional traffic, and staying put.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 808-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The PRC2 complex acts as a lysine methyltransferase that methylates histone 3 at Lys-27 (H3K27). The PRC1 complex contains an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes methylated H3K27 and ubiquitinates Lys-119 of histone H2A (H2AK119). The resulting H3K27 and H2AK119 histone modifications are the hallmarks of chromatin compaction and gene silencing. However, the molecular mechanisms of PRC1 targeting to the subset of developmental genes and the mechanism of PRC1-mediated gene silencing are poorly understood (3Simon J.A. Kingston R.E.

PRC1 is a multisubunit protein complex that consists of three homologous RING domain-containing subunits: Ring1B, Ring1A, and PCGF, as well as the proteins Cbx and PHC (2Gao Z. Zhang J. Bonasio R.

The Ring1B/PCGF heterodimer endows the PRC1 complex with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas the Cbx subunit is responsible for H3K27 recognition. The roles of the Ring1A and the PHC subunits are unclear. Unlike PRC1 in Drosophila, human PRC1 has an additional level of complexity because every PRC1 subunit has numerous homologues that may constitute distinct PRC1-like complexes (2Gao Z. Zhang J.

Previous biochemical and functional studies have shown that Scml2 co-localizes with both PRC1 and PRC2 in vivo to the Polycomb-response elements of PcG target genes (4Wang L. Jahren N. Miller E.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 27769-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that Scml2 itself is not part of the PRC1 core, it is just as crucial for Hox gene silencing in Drosophila as any other subunit of PRC1 and PRC2. For example, mutations in the Scm gene of Drosophila result in severe developmental malformation and are lethal at embryonic stage (5Bornemann D. Miller E. Simon J. Expression and properties of wild-type and mutant forms of the Drosophila sex comb on midleg (SCM) repressor protein.Genetics. 1998; 150: 675-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human SCML2 gene, located in the short arm of the X chromosome, was identified in an initial effort to create a transcription map of the Xp22 region associated with multiple human genetic diseases (6Montini E. Buchner G. Spalluto C. Andolfi G. Caruso A. den Dunnen J.T. Trump D. Rocchi M. Ballabio A. Franco B. Identification of SCML2, a second human gene homologous to the Drosophila Sex comb on midleg (Scm): a new gene cluster on Xp22.Genomics. 1999; 58: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although Scml2 clearly plays an important role in PcG-mediated gene silencing, its function remains largely unknown. Structural characterization of Scml2 may provide vital clues to its function. Human Scml2 is a 700-amino acid protein that consists of two N-terminal malignant brain tumor domains (MBTs) and a C-terminal sterile α motif (SAM) domain. Additionally, an unidentified domain is located between the second MBT and the SAM domain as described below (see Fig. 1). The MBT domains are ∼100-amino acid modules that are often found in multiple copies arranged in MBT repeats. They are known to bind methylated lysine residues (10Maurer-Stroh S. Dickens N.J. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Eisenhaber F. Ponting C.P. The Tudor domain ‘Royal Family’: Tudor, plant Agenet, Chromo, PWWP and MBT domains.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 69-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), which suggests that Scm-like proteins may be able to recognize methylated histones. Indeed, a number of structures of MBT domains were solved in complexes with peptides containing methylated lysine residues (11Grimm C. Matos R. Ly-Hartig N. Steuerwald U. Lindner D. Rybin V.

Biol. 2012; 423: 702-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), including structures of two MBT domains from Scml2. The structures of MBT domains and biochemical analyses of their binding specificities revealed that they weakly interact with mono- and dimethylated lysine residues through a conserved site with affinities ranging from 30 μm to 1 mm (18Nady N. Krichevsky L. Zhong N. Duan S. Tempel W. Amaya M.F. Ravichandran M. Arrowsmith C.H. Histone recognition by human malignant brain tumor domains.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 423: 702-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most MBT domains are promiscuous binders that associate with mono- and dimethylated lysines regardless of their sequence context, whereas some have a preference for a specific methylated substrate (18Nady N. Krichevsky L. Zhong N. Duan S. Tempel W. Amaya M.F. Ravichandran M. Arrowsmith C.H. Histone recognition by human malignant brain tumor domains.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 423: 702-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in almost all cases, MBT repeats recognize only lower methylation states of the histone lysines. Thus, the MBT domains in Scml2 likely serve as “sensors” of the degree of histone methylation. The C terminus of Scml2 contains a SAM domain, which belongs to a group of small helical domains that can form head-to-tail homo-and hetero-dimers leading to SAM polymerization. Notably, the PHC1 subunit of PRC1 contains a SAM domain homologous to that of Scml2, and the two isolated domains were shown to form hetero-dimers (8Kyba M. Brock H.W. The SAM domain of polyhomeotic, RAE28, and Scm mediates specific interactions through conserved residues.Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Kim C.A. Sawaya M.R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 27769-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C-terminal SAM domain of Scml2 likely functions as an anchor that attaches Scml2 to the PRC1 complex. Interestingly, several recent studies show that Scml2 can recruit the PRC1 complex to DNA via its SAM domain. Moreover, overexpression of the SAM domain disrupts PcG repression, suggesting a central role for Scm-like proteins in the recruitment of Polycomb complexes (19Kassis J.A. Kennison J.A. Recruitment of Polycomb complexes: a role for SCM.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2581-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Scm-like proteins can recognize DNA in the first place remains unknown. In this work, I present the solution NMR structure of a previously unidentified DNA-binding domain within human Scml2 (residues 354–468). This domain is located between the N-terminal MBT domains and the C-terminal SAM domain of Scml2. From an evolutionary perspective, the domain emerges in multicellular organisms and is conserved from the simplest multicellular eukaryotes to humans. It is exclusively found within Scm-like proteins, and therefore, I named it Scm-like embedded domain, or SLED. The SLED domain adopts a novel protein fold with no close structural homologues in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Interestingly, the two previously identified lethal point mutations of the Scm gene in Drosophila map onto the SLED domain (5Bornemann D. Miller E. Simon J. Expression and properties of wild-type and mutant forms of the Drosophila sex comb on midleg (SCM) repressor protein.Genetics. 1998; 150: 675-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a key functional role during development. The results presented in this work suggest that, in addition to its ability to bind methylated histones, Scml2 can also directly recognize double-stranded DNA via its SLED domain. The direct interaction of Scml2 with DNA involving this newly discovered domain may provide an important step in PRC1 recognition of its target genes. The nucleotide sequence encoding the SLED domain of human Scml2 (amino acids 354–468) was codon-optimized for bacterial expression and synthesized in vitro by GenScript USA Inc. with NdeI and NotI restriction sites added at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene, respectively. The NdeI/NotI sites were then used to subclone the gene into a pET28b(+) vector (Novagen). Two point mutations of the SLED gene, N440A and C453Y, were created using site-directed mutagenesis. The accuracy of all resulting DNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ). The resulting plasmids were used to express the His6-tagged WT SLED and its N440A and C453Y mutants in Escherichia coli using the protocol described below. The bacteria were transformed with a SLED plasmid and grown in 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin at 37 °C overnight. Cells were then transferred into the M9 minimal medium. 15N-labeled NH4Cl (1 g/liter, CIL) was used as the sole source of nitrogen, and glucose (3 g/liter) was used as the source of carbon. The 15N/13C-double-labeled protein sample was prepared using 13C-labeled glucose (CIL). Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 1.0 absorbance units, induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 h at 20 °C, and harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. HisPur beads (Thermo) were used to purify His6-tagged protein from the clarified lysate followed by thrombin (GE Healthcare) cleavage for 3 h at 37 °C and size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare). The final NMR samples contained 0.16–1.0 mm protein, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% D2O. NMR spectra for the Scml2 SLED domain were collected at 15 °C on Agilent VNMRS 600 and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with cold probes. The backbone 15N, 13C, and 1H resonances of the Scml2 SLED domain were assigned using 1H-15N HSQC, HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, and HBHA(CO)NH experiments. The aliphatic side-chain resonances were assigned using 1H-13C HSQC, HC(C)H-TOCSY and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments. Aromatic side chains were assigned using aromatic 1H-13C HSQC and aromatic 13C NOESY experiments. 15N NOESY as well as aliphatic and aromatic 13C NOESY experiments (20Sattler M. Schleucher J.

A total of 100 structures of the Scml2 SLED domain were generated followed by water refinement of the lowest energy 20 structures using CNS (25Brunger A.T.

Multiple sequence alignments and visualization of the sequence conservation were performed using CLUSTAL W (29Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F.

The phylogenic tree of the SLED domains was created using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) server (30Letunic I. Bork P. Interactive Tree Of Life v2: online annotation and display of phylogenetic trees made easy.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: W475-W478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Chemical shift perturbation analysis was used to characterize Scml2 SLED-DNA binding. Specifically, 15N-labeled SLED domain was gradually titrated with unlabeled 11-bp double-stranded (ds) DNA. Complimentary oligonucleotides 5′-AGGAGCGGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCCGCTCCT-3′ were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)), heated to 98 °C for 10 min, and then annealed at room temperature to form the dsDNA. In a similar manner, two more double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared (dsGGGCGCGCCC and dsTTTATATAAA), and three resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides were tested in separate NMR titration series for their ability to bind SLED domain. 15N-1H HSQC spectra of the SLED domain were collected at each point of the titration using the 800-MHz NMR spectrometer to monitor changes in 1H and 15N resonance frequencies of the domain induced by dsDNA binding. The observed changes in 15N and 1H frequencies relative to peak position in the free state, Δωi = (ΔωiN2 + ΔωiH2)½, plotted versus dsDNA/SLED ratio, yielded NMR titration profiles for each amino acid residue. Cumulative changes in peak positions (calculated as a sum of Δωi over all amide resonances) as a function of dsDNA concentration were used to calculate the dissociation constants (Kd) for the complexes using a two-state binding model. The resulting curves were least squares-fit to the following equation y=Δωx−12{([P]−x+Kd)2+4xKd−([P]−x+Kd)}[P](Eq. 1) where [P] is the total protein concentration; x is DNA concentration; y is the corresponding change in peak position; Kd is the dissociation constant; and Δω is the frequency difference between free and DNA-bound protein. The per-residue Δωi frequency changes were used to map the DNA-binding site on the SLED domain structure. The titration data analysis was performed using SciDAVis. Detailed amino acid sequence analysis of the human Scml2 together with secondary structure prediction using the Jpred server (31Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. The Jpred 3 secondary structure prediction server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-W201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a folded domain embedded between the N-terminal MBT repeats and the C-terminal SAM domain. The domain spans residues 354–468 and has no sequence homology to any other domain with known spatial structure in the PDB. Sequence BLAST against human proteins identified five proteins containing this domain, Scml2, Scmh1, SFMBT1, SFMBT2, and SCML4. The domain architecture of these proteins is shown in Fig. 1A, where newly identified domains are aligned and shown in red, MBT domains are shown in blue, and SAM domains are in black. Notably, all five identified proteins are sex comb on midleg-like with the number of N-terminal MBT domains varying from four (for SFMBT1 and SFMBT2) to zero (for SCML4). Because the domain is found exclusively within the Scm-like family, typically located between MBT and SAM domains, I designate it Scm-like embedded domain, or SLED. A multiple sequence alignment of the five members of SLED-containing proteins is shown in Fig. 1B where absolutely conserved residues are shown in red, and cysteine residues are marked with an asterisk. The predicted secondary structure elements are shown above the Scml2 sequence. After identifying SLED-containing proteins in humans, I have searched for proteins with SLED domains in other species and have compared their domain architecture using SMART (27Schultz J. Milpetz F.

It is clear from Fig. 2 that SLED domains are present almost exclusively in the context of the C-terminal SAM domain (black circles) and the N-terminal MBT repeats (blue squares) across all multicellular species, which makes it a unique Scm-specific domain. Remarkably, the emergence of the SLED domain in evolution coincides with the development of multicellular eukaryotes because SLED-containing proteins are found exclusively in Metazoa (Fig. 2), consistent with the essential role of Scm-like proteins in cell differentiation. Note that, unlike SAM domains, MBT domains emerge simultaneously with SLEDs and are often found together, likely suggesting that the function of the SLED is closely related to that of the MBT domain. The solution structure of the SLED domain from human Scml2 (residues 354–468) was determined using NMR spectrosco"
https://openalex.org/W2045830450,"F-box proteins are substrate adaptors used by the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) complex, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). SCF-mediated ubiquitylation regulates proteolysis of hundreds of cellular proteins involved in key signaling and disease systems. However, our knowledge of the evolution of the F-box gene family in Euarchontoglires is limited. In the present study, 559 F-box genes and nine related pseudogenes were identified in eight genomes. Lineage-specific gene gain and loss events occurred during the evolution of Euarchontoglires, resulting in varying F-box gene numbers ranging from 66 to 81 among the eight species. Both tandem duplication and retrotransposition were found to have contributed to the increase of F-box gene number, whereas mutation in the F-box domain was the main mechanism responsible for reduction in the number of F-box genes, resulting in a balance of expansion and contraction in the F-box gene family. Thus, the Euarchontoglire F-box gene family evolved under a birth-and-death model. Signatures of positive selection were detected in substrate-recognizing domains of multiple F-box proteins, and adaptive changes played a role in evolution of the Euarchontoglire F-box gene family. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distributions were found to be highly non-random among different regions of F-box genes in 1092 human individuals, with domain regions having a significantly lower number of non-synonymous SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2157366613,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) based on extracellular recordings with microelectrodes provide means of observing the activities of neurons that orchestrate fundamental brain function, and are therefore powerful tools for exploring the function of the brain. Due to physical restrictions and risks for post-surgical complications, wired BMIs are not suitable for long-term studies in freely behaving animals. Wireless BMIs ideally solve these problems, but they call for low-complexity techniques for data compression that ensure maximum utilization of the wireless link and energy resources, as well as minimum heat dissipation in the surrounding tissues. In this paper, we analyze the performances of various system architectures that involve spike detection, spike alignment and spike compression. Performance is analyzed in terms of spike reconstruction and spike sorting performance after wireless transmission of the compressed spike waveforms. Compression is performed with transform coding, using five different compression bases, one of which we pay special attention to. That basis is a fixed basis derived, by singular value decomposition, from a large assembly of experimentally obtained spike waveforms, and therefore represents a generic basis specially suitable for compressing spike waveforms. Our results show that a compression factor of 99.8%, compared to transmitting the raw acquired data, can be achieved using the fixed generic compression basis without compromising performance in spike reconstruction and spike sorting. Besides illustrating the relative performances of various system architectures and compression bases, our findings show that compression of spikes with a fixed generic compression basis derived from spike data provides better performance than compression with downsampling or the Haar basis, given that no optimization procedures are implemented for compression coefficients, and the performance is similar to that obtained when the optimal SVD based basis is used."

https://openalex.org/W2074111954,"Mucin-producing bile duct tumors (MPBTs) are unusual, and we present our experience with nine surgically proven cases.Between November 2002 and November 2012, 9 patients with surgically proven MPBTs (including history of relevant hepatobiliary surgery in 6 patients) were encountered. Their clinical, imaging, and surgical findings were reviewed.The most common symptom is intermittent jaundice, which occurs in seven patients. The diagnostic specificity was 77.8% by preoperative Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). All the patients underwent ipsilateral hemihepatectomy or remnant hemihepatectomy, accompanied caudate lobectomy in one case and concomitant Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy in four cases. Postoperative course was uneventful. One patient, who had intra-abdominal recurrence 59 months after surgery, was received reoperation without recurrence at the last follow-up. The remaining eight patients were alive without disease recurrence.Based on our follow up of 9 cases that were surgically treated for MPBTs, we conclude that ipsilateral hemihepatectomy is a safe surgical procedure with an observed recurrence risk of 11.1% and all long-term survival."
