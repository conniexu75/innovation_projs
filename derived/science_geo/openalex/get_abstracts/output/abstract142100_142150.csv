https://openalex.org/W2030729823,"Recent studies have shown that the angiopoietin-Tie2 system is a predominant regulator of vascular integrity. In this study, we investigated the effect of two known angiogenic stimuli, hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), on these molecules. VEGF induced both a time- and concentration-dependent increase in angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) mRNA expression in bovine microvascular endothelial cells. This up-regulation was derived primarily from an increased transcription rate as evidenced by nuclear run-on assay and mRNA decay study. The increased Ang2 expression upon VEGF treatment was almost totally abolished by inhibition of tyrosine kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase and partially by suppression of protein kinase C. Hypoxia also directly increased Ang2 mRNA expression. In contrast, Ang1 and Tie2 responded to neither of these stimuli. The enhanced Ang2 expression following VEGF stimulation and hypoxia was accompanied by <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis as detected by immunoprecipitation. In a mouse model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization, Ang2 mRNA was up-regulated in the ischemic inner retinal layer, and remarkable expression was observed in neovascular vessels. These data suggest that both hypoxia- and VEGF-induced neovascularization might be facilitated by selective induction of Ang2, which deteriorates the integrity of preexisting vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2133950971,"We characterized the interaction ofAcanthamoeba actophorin, a member of ADF/cofilin family, with filaments of amoeba and rabbit skeletal muscle actin. The affinity is about 10 times higher for muscle actin filaments (K d = 0.5 μm) than amoeba actin filaments (K d = 5 μm) even though the affinity for muscle and amoeba Mg-ADP-actin monomers (K d = 0.1 μm) is the same (Blanchoin, L., and Pollard, T. D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25106–25111). Actophorin binds slowly (k + = 0.03 μm−1 s−1) to and dissociates from amoeba actin filaments in a simple bimolecular reaction, but binding to muscle actin filaments is cooperative. Actophorin severs filaments in a concentration-dependent fashion. Phosphate or BeF3 bound to ADP-actin filaments inhibit actophorin binding. Actophorin increases the rate of phosphate release from actin filaments more than 10-fold. The time course of the interaction of actophorin with filaments measured by quenching of the fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin or fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine-actophorin is complicated, because severing, depolymerization, and repolymerization follows binding. The 50-fold higher affinity of actophorin for Mg-ADP-actin monomers (K d = 0.1 μm) than ADP-actin filaments provides the thermodynamic basis for driving disassembly of filaments that have hydrolyzed ATP and dissociated γ-phosphate.

Actin filaments, in conjunction with other cytoskeletal proteins, are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of eukaryotic cells. Phagocytosis, cytokinesis, cell motility, and muscle contraction all depend on structures assembled from actin. Although muscle contraction requires stable actin filaments for force generation, much actin-based motility involves active turnover of filaments. A variety of actin-binding proteins influence actin polymerization, steady-state dynamics of monomers and filaments, and the three-dimensional organization of the filamentous meshwork. At the leading edge of motile cells, the Arp2/3 complex of actin-related proteins is thought to initiate polymerization of a network of actin filaments (1Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc.

This requires the filaments to depolymerize much more rapidly than pure actin filamentsin vitro. Proteins of the ADF/cofilin family are thought to promote recycling of actin (for review, see Refs. 5Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol.

A major point of disagreement is whether ADF/cofilin proteins enhance depolymerization by severing actin filaments, by increasing the rate of subunit dissociation from one or both ends, or by both severing and rapid subunit dissociation (reviewed in Ref. 11Maciver S.K.

To help resolve this controversy, we have done new experiments withAcanthamoeba actophorin, a member of the ADF/cofilin family. Because the interaction of ADF/cofilin proteins with actin involves a number of overlapping reactions with actin monomers and actin filaments, our strategy has been to divide the problem into a number of steps that we can examine in isolation before trying to formulate an overall mechanism. Ours is also the first systematic comparison of the interaction of any ADF/cofilin protein with cytoplasmic actin and muscle actin filaments, an important point, because some of the reactions differ for the two actins. Our first paper (21Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) included equilibrium and rate constants for actophorin binding ATP- and ADP-actin monomers, for the polymerization of actophorin-actin complexes, and for the antagonistic effects of actophorin and profilin (another small protein) on the exchange of nucleotide bound to actin monomers. Here, we characterize the kinetics and equilibrium binding of actophorin to actin filaments. Actophorin has a much higher affinity for muscle actin filaments than amoeba actin filaments. Binding to muscle actin filaments, but not amoeba actin filaments, is cooperative. Phosphate or BeF3 bound to ADP-actin filaments inhibits actophorin binding, so ATP hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation serve as a timer for binding. Reciprocally, actophorin increases the rate of phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis. An assay for the number of filament ends shows that actophorin severs actin filaments in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The 10-fold higher affinity of actophorin for ADP-actin monomers than for ADP-actin filaments provides the free energy change to drive depolymerization.

Purified actophorins were stored in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mmNaN3. Actophorin S88C was labeled with tetramethylrhodamine maleimide 5′ isomer and purified (21Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from Acanthamoeba (24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and monomeric Ca-ATP-actin was isolated by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography (25MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) at 4 °C in G buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT). Actin was labeled on Cys-374 to a stoichiometry of 0.8–1.0 with pyrene iodoacetamide (Ref. 26Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar; as modified by Pollard; see Ref. 24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mg-ATP G-actin was prepared on ice by addition of 0.2 mm EGTA and an 11-fold molar excess of MgCl2over actin and used within hours. Actin was polymerized by addition of 1:9 (v/v) 10× KME (500 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8). ADP-BeF3-actin filaments were prepared by polymerizing 20 μm Mg-ATP-actin in 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 150 μm BeCl2 at room temperature for 4 h (27Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of actophorin with pyrenyl-labeled actin filaments was followed by the change in fluorescence with excitation at 366 nm and emission at 387 nm (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Interaction of rhodamine-S88C-actophorin with unlabeled actin filaments was followed by the change in fluorescence anisotropy with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 574 nm (21Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Data were collected with a Alphascan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). Reactions were initiated by mixing actophorin and actin filaments manually, or for kinetics experiments with a hand-driven stopped-flow mixer (Model SFA-12, Hi-tech Scientific Ltd., Salisbury, United Kingdom). We used the 2amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl purine riboside and purine-nucleoside phosphorylase assay to measure the release of phosphate during spontaneous polymerization of actin alone or in presence of actophorin or phalloidin (28Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 29Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We first prepared the 1:1 complex Ca-ATP-actin monomers by treatment of Ca-ATP-actin monomers with AG 1-X4 Resin (Bio-Rad). Mg-ATP actin monomers were prepared on ice by addition of 0.2 mm EGTA and an 11-fold molar excess of MgCl2 over the 1:1 complex Ca-ATP-actin monomers and used within hours. Actin assembly and phosphate release were monitored in 400 μl samples after addition of 1:9 (v/v) 10× KME with a Microplate Spectrophotometer system, SECTRAmax 250 (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) using absorbance at 310 nm and 360 nm, respectively. The increase in absorbance at 360 nm induced by actin polymerization was used as a blank and subtracted from the absorbance change due to phosphate release. The assay was carried out in two steps. First, actophorin was reacted with preformed 2 μm unlabeled actin filaments for a given time at 25 °C. Then the reaction mixture was diluted to 0.66 μm polymerized actin in KME buffer, and 5 μm pyrenyl-actin monomers were added to initiate growth from the ends of the filaments. Under these conditions, the rate of spontaneous polymerization is much slower than elongation from the added filaments. The number concentration of actin filaments (N) was calculated from the initial rate of polymerization according to Equation 1,Rate=k+[A][N]−k−[N]Equation 1 where k + is the association rate constant (10 μm−1 s−1),k − is the dissociation rate constant (1 s−1), and [A] is the concentration of actin monomers. Under the conditions of this assay, the initial rate was directly proportional to the concentration of untreated actin filaments. Kinetic data were fit to exponentials with Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Binding data were fit with Equation 2,r=rcf+(rcb−rcf)[(Kd+[C]+[A])−(Kd+[C]+[A])2−(4[C][A])2]Equation 2 where r is the observed anisotropy,r cf is the anisotropy of free actophorin,r cb is the anisotropy of actophorin bound to actin filaments, [C] is the total concentration of actophorin, [A] is the total concentration of actin filaments, and K d is the dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex. We used KINSIM (30Barshop A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) to simulate the time course of reactions of actophorin with actin filaments. Interaction of actin filaments with ADF/cofilin proteins, including Acanthamoeba actophorin, is complicated by several overlapping reactions, including filament binding (31Yonezawa N. Nishida E.

Biochem. 1998; 256: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and depolymerization of the filament (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 19Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To study these reactions, we used two fluorescence assays: the fluorescence intensity of pyrenyl-labeled actin and fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine-labeled S88C actophorin. Pyrenyl fluorescence of polymerized actin is about 20-fold higher than actin monomers (26Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and is quenched by binding of some ADF/cofilin proteins, including actophorin (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). A complication is that actophorin can change the fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin filaments by three different mechanisms: (i) binding, (ii) conformational change, or (iii) depolymerization. With proper experimental design, these reactions can be separated in time. Fluorescence anisotropy is sensitive only to the size of the diffusing species, so binding of rhodamine-actophorin to an actin filament increases anisotropy more than binding to an actin monomer. The anisotropy of rhodamine actophorin is 0.14 when free and 0.21 when bound to an actin monomer (21Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas the polarization anisotropy of rhodamine-phalloidin immobilized on an actin filament is about 0.30. 2E. M. De La Cruz and T. D. Pollard, unpublished observation. Mixing rhodamine-actophorin with an excess of unlabeled actin filaments results in a biphasic change in fluorescence anisotropy (Fig.1 A). The first phase is an exponential increase from 0.14 ± 0.005 to a maximum of 0.235 ± 0.005. The rate and amplitude of this phase depend on the concentration of actin filaments. The rate constant for the initial increase in fluorescence anisotropy is in the range of 0.03 μm−1 s−1, the same as measured more accurately (due to less noisy data) by quenching of the fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin (Fig. 2). The second phase is a slow exponential decrease in anisotropy with a rate constant of 0.012 ± 0.002 s−1, independent of the concentration of actin filaments. Our interpretation, elaborated upon under “Discussion,” is that the first phase is due to binding of rhodamine-actophorin to actin filaments, whereas the second phase results from severing and depolymerization of filaments.Figure 2Fluorescence assay of the time course of the interaction of unlabeled actophorin with an excess of pyrene-labeled actin filaments. Conditions were as follows: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 3 mm NaN3 at 25 °C.

A mixture of 2 μm of pyrenyl-actin filaments and 0.4 μm of actophorin was preincubated for 5 min and then mixed with 20 μm unlabeled actin filaments to initiate dissociation of actophorin from the pyrenyl-actin filaments.C, time course of the change in fluorescence following mixing 0.6 μm wild type actophorin with 6 μm muscle pyrenyl-actin filaments: dotted line, in presence of 0.2 mm ADP; noisy line, in presence of 0.2 mm ATP.

A plot of the maximum amplitude versus the concentration of filamentous actin gives a saturation curve that fits Equation 2. At saturating concentrations of actin filaments the anisotropy is 0.235, higher than rhodamine-actophorin bound to actin monomers (21Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) but lower than expected for an actin filament. The apparent dissociation equilibrium constant from this analysis depends on the source of the actin. The affinity of actophorin for rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments (K d = 0.49 μm) is 10-fold higher than for Acanthamoeba actin filaments (K d = 5.6 μm). Some ADF/cofilin proteins quench the fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin filaments. However, this is far from a simple bimolecular reaction, so the results depend on many variables, including the source of the actin (Fig. 2 B), the presence of the γ-phosphate of ATP bound to actin (see Fig. 4), the ratio of the reactants (Figs. 2 and 3), and the presence of ATP or ADP in the buffer (Fig. 2 C). These complications arise from major differences in the actin, including different affinities and degree of binding cooperativity, but also from reactions that follow binding, including severing, depolymerization, and repolymerization.Figure 3Fluorescence assay of the time course of interaction of pyrene-labeled actin filaments with an excess of unlabeled actophorin. Conditions were as follows: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 3 mm NaN3 at 25 °C.A, time course of the change in fluorescence following mixing of 2 μm pyrenyl-amoeba-actin filaments with various concentrations of actophorin: 15, 20, 30, and 40 μm from the top to bottom curve,respectively. B, time course of the change in fluorescence following mixing of 2 μm pyrenyl-muscle-actin filaments with various concentrations of actophorin: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 μm from the top to bottom curve,respectively. Inset shows the early time course.Smooth curves are the best fit using model 1. C, dependence of k obs of the fluorescence change on the concentration of actophorin. In the absence of phosphate: open circles, muscle actin; closed squares, amoeba actin; and with 68 mm phosphate: closed circles, muscle actin. The solid lines are manual fits to the data points. The data point at zero actophorin comes from Fig. 2 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reaction of actophorin with an excess of pyrenyl-actin filaments in ATP is biphasic: the fluorescence falls rapidly to a value intermediate between that of polymerized and monomeric actin, followed by a slow recovery (Fig. 2, A and C), similar to the two phase change in fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine-actophorin. Reaction of an excess of actophorin with pyrenyl-actin causes a monotonic decrease in fluorescence to the level of monomeric actin (Fig. 3, A and B). With excess pyrenyl-actin filaments the rapid initial phase is an exponential decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 2 A, inset) at a rate that depends on the concentration of actin filaments (Fig.2 B). Like Carlier et al. (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), we interpret this decrease in fluorescence to be due to binding of actophorin to actin filaments. Plots of the observed rate constant versusconcentration of Acanthamoeba actin filaments are linear with a slope (association rate constant, k +1) of 0.029 ± 0.003 μm−1 s−1and a y-intercept (dissociation rate constant,k −1) of 0.11 ± 0.005 s−1. The ratio of these rate constants gives a K d of 3.8 μm for actophorin binding amoeba actin filaments. For muscle actin, the slope (k +1) is 0.008 ± 0.0005 μm−1 s−1 and they-intercept is near zero, too small to estimate accurately by extrapolation. To measure the rate constant for actophorin dissociation from muscle actin filaments, we carried out a chase experiment (Fig. 2 B, inset). We bound actophorin to pyrenyl-actin filaments and then competed it off by adding an excess of unlabeled actin filaments. The pyrene fluorescence increased during the chase with a rate constant of 0.0050 ± 0.0005 s−1, independent of concentration of unlabeled actin filaments. Unlabeled actin filaments chase ADF-1 from NBD-labeled actin filaments at a rate of 0.035 s−1 (19Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We interpret this to be the rate of dissociation of actophorin from the pyrenyl-actin filaments. For muscle actin, the K d calculated from the rate constants is 0.6 μm. Both of these equilibrium constants derived from kinetics agree well with the values from fluorescence anisotropy. After samples with an excess of pyrenyl-actin filaments reached a minimum fluorescence, the fluorescence recovered slowly in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2, A and C). The fluorescence increased exponentially with a rate constant of 0.015 ± 0.001 s−1 for amoeba actin (Fig. 2 A) and 0.0030 ± 0.0005 s−1 for muscle actin (Fig. 2 C). The fluorescence did not recover when the buffer contained ADP rather than ATP (Fig. 2 C). When an excess of unlabeled actophorin was mixed with amoeba pyrenyl-actin filaments (Fig. 3 A) or muscle pyrenyl-actin filaments (Fig. 3 B), the fluorescence decreased to the level of monomeric actin and did not recover even in ATP. With amoeba pyrenyl-actin filaments (Fig. 3 A), the time courses fit single exponentials, and the dependence of thek obs on the concentration of actophorin was linear, as expected for a simple bimolecular reaction (Fig.3 C). The slope and intercept give the same rate constants as the experiment with excess filaments (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the time course of the reaction of an excess of unlabeled actophorin with muscle pyrenyl-actin filaments does not fit a single exponential (Fig. 3 B). An initial lag of a few seconds was followed by a progressively faster decrease in fluorescence to baseline level. The lag was most pronounced at low concentrations of actophorin. Both the duration of the lag and the rate of the subsequent decline in fluorescence depend on the actophorin concentration. In contrast to experiments with excess pyrenyl-actin filaments (Fig. 2), the dependence of k obs for the decline in fluorescent after the lag phase on actophorin was not linear (Fig.3 C). As elaborated upon under “Discussion,” these features suggest that binding of actophorin to muscle actin filaments is cooperative. Maciver et al. (14Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) found that inorganic phosphate inhibits the ability of actophorin to reduce the low shear viscosity of actin filaments but did not establish whether this was due to inhibition of binding or some subsequent reaction, such as severing or depolymerization.

The enoyl-ACP reductase fromMycobacterium tuberculosis, known as InhA, is a member of an unusual FAS-II system that prefers longer chain fatty acyl substrates for the purpose of synthesizing mycolic acids, a major component of mycobacterial cell walls. The crystal structure of InhA in complex with NAD+ and a C16 fatty acyl substrate,trans-2-hexadecenoyl-(N-acetylcysteamine)-thioester, reveals that the substrate binds in a general “U-shaped” conformation, with the trans double bond positioned directly adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. The side chain of Tyr158 directly interacts with the thioester carbonyl oxygen of the C16 fatty acyl substrate and therefore could help stabilize the enolate intermediate, proposed to form during substrate catalysis. Hydrophobic residues, primarily from the substrate binding loop (residues 196–219), engulf the fatty acyl chain portion of the substrate. The substrate binding loop of InhA is longer than that of other enoyl-ACP reductases and creates a deeper substrate binding crevice, consistent with the ability of InhA to recognize longer chain fatty acyl substrates.

Mammals, birds, and yeast produce fatty acids via a FAS-I system, a biosynthetic pathway in which each enzymatic activity resides on the single polypeptide chain of a very large multifunctional enzyme (1Smith S.

Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, most plants and bacteria utilize a FAS-II system in which each of the enzymatic activities corresponds to individual polypeptides (4Fulco A.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 133-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Kater M.M. Koningstein G.M. Nijkamp H.J.J. Stuitje A.R. Plant Mol.

The best characterized FAS-II system is that ofEscherichia coli, which includes β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (FabB, FabF, and FabH), a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG), β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrases (FabA and FabZ), and an enoyl-ACP reductase (currently known as FabI and formerly known as EnvM). TheE. coli FAS-II system initializes fatty acid biosynthesis by condensing acetyl and malonyl substrates, and then it continues the process by elongating the resulting product through the consecutive addition of C2 units, until the fatty acyl chain reaches a length of about 16 carbons. Some bacteria, such as mycobacteria, possess both a FAS-I and a FAS-II system (7Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar). The mycobacterial FAS-I system displays a bimodal distribution of products centered on C16 and C24–C26 (7Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kikuchi S. Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This FAS-II system prefers C16 as a starting substrate (7Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar) and can extend up to C56 (9Qureshi N. Sathyamoorthy N. Takayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the mycobacterial FAS-II system utilizes the products of the FAS-I system as primers to extend fatty acyl chain lengths even further. The longer chain products of the FAS-II system are the precursors of mycolic acids. Mycolic acids are long chain α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids, which are a major component of mycobacterial cell walls (10Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 11Lee R.E. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 215: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Isoniazid, a drug used as a first-line antibiotic for the treatment ofMycobacterium tuberculosis infections for the past 40 years, is known to inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis (12Winder F.G.

More recently, isoniazid was shown to prevent radiolabel from being incorporated into the chain extension of C24–C26 fatty acyl substrates (16Lacave C. Quemard A. Laneelle G. Biochim. Biophys.

Using a genetic approach to isolate the isoniazid target, a single open reading frame was identified (referred to as inhA) in which transformation of the wild-type gene carried on a multicopy plasmid or allelic exchange with a single amino acid substitution mutant (Ser94 to Ala) was sufficient to confer isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium smegmatis(21Banerjee A.

Further analysis revealed that InhA catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of the trans double bond between positions C2 and C3 of fatty acyl substrates (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, InhA prefers fatty acyl substrates of C16 or greater, consistent with its being a member of the mycobacterial FAS-II system (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The connection between isoniazid action and InhA inhibition is somewhat complicated. Isoniazid is a pro-drug that must be converted, via a mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase (KatG), into an activated form of the drug (29Johnson K. King D.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem.

The activated form of isoniazid (suspected to be an isonicotinic-acyl radical) becomes covalently attached to the nicotinamide ring of the NADH bound within the active site of InhA, creating an NADH adduct that acts as a very tightly bound inhibitor (36Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In contrast, the S94A mutation of InhA, which is resistant to the effects of isoniazid, has a decreased affinity for NADH (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R.

The World Health Organization has estimated that one-third of the world's population, nearly 2 billion people, is infected with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis kills more adults now than all other infectious diseases combined, and it is the leading cause of death in HIV-positive individuals. Data from the World Health Organization-sponsored Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance indicates that 36% of tuberculosis patients are infected with a strain that is resistant to traditional antibiotics (isoniazid or rifampicin). Even though mutations within theinhA gene are known to facilitate isoniazid resistance (21Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. deLisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R.

Microbiol. 1997; 35: 719-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), InhA remains a good candidate for drug design. Several reasons for this are as follows: (i) the vast majority of the mutations found in isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates are associated with the isoniazid activator (the KatG catalase-peroxidase) (38Heym B. Honore N. Truffot-Pernot C. Banerjee A. Schurra C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Van Embden J.D.A. Grosset J.H. Cole S.T. Lancet. 1994; 344: 293-298Abstract PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 39Rouse D.A. Li Z.

Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); and (iii) the longer substrate chain length specificity of InhA distinguishes it from the enoyl-ACP reductases from other sources, such as the enoyl-ACP reductase component of the human FAS-I system. To facilitate the drug design process and increase our understanding of the mechanism of an enoyl-ACP reductase reaction, full characterization of the active site of InhA is now available. In an initial report, the crystal structure of InhA in complex with NADH was determined at 2.5-Å resolution (37Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which revealed the putative location of the fatty acyl substrate binding pocket, lying adjacent to the bound NADH (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We describe here the crystal structure of InhA in complex with NAD+ and a C16 fatty acyl substrate (trans-2-hexadecenoyl-(N-acetylcysteamine)-thioester). The substrate contains a fatty acyl chain of 16 carbons, with atrans double bond between positions C2 and C3 (trans-2-hexadecenoyl moiety), which is attached through a thioester linkage to a small portion of the phosphopantetheine arm of the acyl carrier (N-acetylcysteamine moiety). The chemical formula is CH3-(CH2)12-CH=CH-CO-S-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH3. This compound is not a natural biological substrate of InhA; however, it and long chain fatty acyl derivatives of coenzyme A are functional substrates in vitro. Trans-2-hexadecenoyl-(N-acetylcysteamine)-thioester was prepared in two stages. In the first step,trans-2-hexadecenoic acid was activated by reaction with 1 equivalent of ethyl chloroformate and 1 equivalent of diisopropylethylamine in tert-butyl methyl ether. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight and then filtered and concentrated, giving the mixed anhydride as an oil. In the second step, the thioester was formed by the coupling ofN-acetylcysteamine with the mixed anhydride. To the oil was added a solution of N-acetylcysteamine in ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 0.3 m aqueous sodium bicarbonate (1:1:1 v/v/v). After the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at room temperature, the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation. The product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using hexane, ethyl acetate, and acetic acid (75:25:1 v/v/v) as the eluting agent. The product was obtained in 37% overall yield and the structure was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Expression of theM. tuberculosis inhA gene within an E. coli host, purification of the resulting soluble InhA protein, and production of hexagonal crystals (space group P6222) containing InhA in complex with NADH have been reported previously (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 37Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Monoclinic crystals (space group C2) of the ternary complex (InhA, NAD+, and C16 fatty acyl substrate) were produced under new conditions, using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The drop was created by combining an equal amount of well solution (10% polyethylene glycol-4000, 6% Me2SO, 100 mmammonium acetate, and 100 mm ADA, pH 6.8) with a concentrated protein mixture. The protein mixture was produced by first solubilizing the C16 fatty acyl substrate in Me2SO (600 μm stock solution) and then slowly adding 1 ml of stock solution at room temperature to 100 ml of a dilute solution of InhA (0.1 mg/ml = 3 μm) in the presence of 600 μm NAD+. The final molar ratio of the mixture was 1:200:2 for InhA, NAD+, and C16 fatty acyl substrates, respectively, and the final concentration of Me2SO was 1% (v/v). The mixture was concentrated at 4 °C with an Amicon Centricon-10 until the concentration of InhA reached 10 mg/ml. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.8-Å resolution at room temperature using a MacScience DIP2030 image plate detector with double-focusing mirrors coupled to a Rigaku x-ray generator utilizing a copper rotating anode (CuKα wavelength = 1.54 Å). A 0.0075-mm nickel filter was placed in line before the mirrors, and the diameter of the x-ray beam collimator was 0.5 mm. The detector was placed 230 mm from the crystal with no offset in the 2θ angle. Each frame of data was exposed for 15 min and consisted of a 1.5° rotation of the crystal. The data from two crystals (size 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm) were processed and merged using the DENZO/Scalepack software package (43Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). A single subunit of InhA (protein coordinates only) derived from the hexagonal crystal form (Protein Data Bank entry 1eny) was used as a search model with the molecular replacement technique. Six subunits were found in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic crystal form, corresponding to a solvent content of 53%. Four of the subunits form a homotetramer based on noncrystallographic (local) 2-fold symmetry axes, and the remaining two subunits form a second homotetramer based on a combination of both noncrystallographic (local) and crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axes. Subsequent to rigid body refinement (R factor = 30.2%,R free = 38.3%), noncrystallographic (NCS) restraints were applied to both the atomic positions and individual temperature factors. After simulated annealing refinement (R factor = 25.6%, R free = 36.0%), the NAD+ and C16 fatty acyl substrate could be identified in a difference Fourier (Fo-Fc) electron density map, confirming the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. Subsequent to conventional positional refinement in the presence of NAD+ and the C16 fatty acyl substrate (R factor = 23.4%, R free = 35.6%), several rounds of conventional positional refinement were performed during the addition of 682 ordered water molecules (R factor = 21.7%, R free = 34.4%).

The quaternary structure of InhA was investigated by determining the molecular weight of InhA in aqueous solution using analytical size-exclusion chromatography. A prepacked Pharmacia Superdex-200 HR-10/30 column (separation range 10–600 kDa) was equilibrated in 150 mmNaCl and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The flow rate was set at 0.25 ml/min and controlled by a BioCAD SPRINT system from PerSeptive Biosystems (Cambridge, MA). The column was calibrated by individually applying a ∼5 mg/ml solution of each standard protein obtained from a Pharmacia gel-filtration calibration kit to the column and then calculating a standard line by plotting the resulting elution volumesversus known molecular mass information. An ∼5 mg/ml solution of InhA was applied to the column, and the molecular mass of InhA was estimated by comparing the value of its column elution volume with the standard line. InhA is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of enzymes (45Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 46Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The main characteristic of this family is a polypeptide backbone topology in which each subunit consists of a single domain with a central core that contains a Rossmann fold supporting an NADH binding site. Within InhA, several α-helices and β-strands of the Rossmann fold extend beyond the NADH binding site, creating a deep crevice for the fatty acyl substrate (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 37Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Part of this extension, referred to here as the “substrate binding loop” (residues 196–219), consists of two perpendicular α-helices that form one side of the fatty acyl substrate binding crevice (Fig.1). Analytical size-exclusion chromatography demonstrates that InhA is a homotetramer in aqueous solution. The crystal structure of InhA revealed that the homotetramer is a molecule possessing internal 222 symmetry. Three perpendicular two-fold symmetry axes intersect in the center of the molecule, creating a molecule where each subunit is related to every other subunit by one of the perpendicular 2-fold symmetry axes (Fig. 1 B). According to the DSSP program (47Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) (and the color code of Fig. 1 B), the amount of buried surface area between subunit 1 (green) and subunit 2 (purple) is 1550 Å2 (or ∼12% of a single subunit), between subunit 1 and subunit 3 (cyan) is 700 Å2 (or ∼5% of a single subunit), and between subunit 1 and subunit 4 (magenta) is 1500 Å2 (or ∼12% of a single subunit). Therefore, the total buried surface area for any given subunit is 3750 Å2 (or ∼29%), indicating that a fairly large portion of each subunit of the homotetramer is involved in intramolecular contacts. Furthermore, the organization of the InhA homotetramer is identical to that of the homotetramers found in the crystal structures of two other enoyl-ACP reductases, namely E. coli FabI (1.6 Å r.m.s. deviation in α-carbon position over 848 residues) (48Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and B. napus ENR (a 1.6-Å r.m.s. deviation in α-carbon position over 632 residues) (49Rafferty J.B. Simon J.W. Baldock C.

Within the orientation of Fig. 1 A, the bound NAD+ sits on top of the shelf created by the Rossmann fold, and the C16 fatty acyl substrate sits on top of the NAD+and is held in place by the substrate binding loop. The InhA-bound C16 fatty acyl substrate folds into a general “U-shaped” conformation (Fig. 2). This conformation is not unusual for protein-bound fatty acids. It has been seen before in the crystal structure of human muscle fatty acid binding protein in complex with several different long chain fatty acids (50Young C.M. Scapin G. Kromminga A. Patel S.B. Veerkamp J.H. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1994; 2: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The fatty acyl substrate binding crevice of InhA has an oval-shaped cavity with the approximate dimensions 16 × 13 × 7 Å. One side of the cavity is completely open and exposed to solvent (Fig. 2,B and C, major portal on right side), whereas the other side contains a small opening (Fig. 2, Band C, minor portal on upper left side). TheN-acetylcysteamine portion of the substrate faces the major portal, which is consistent with the requirement that this region of the natural substrate should face outward, toward the solvent, when attached to the acyl carrier protein. The substrate binding crevice of InhA must accommodate fatty acyl substrates that are longer than C16 in order to produce the precursors of mycolic acids (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Jacobs W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The major and minor portals may provide some assistance with substrate binding. For example, the ω-end of the fatty acyl substrate (position C16) faces the major portal, which could allow chain extensions beyond C16 (of natural substrates) to interact with the acyl carrier protein. Alternatively, the upper edge of the U-shaped turn (positions C8–C10) faces the minor portal, which could permit the fatty acyl chain to thread out through the minor portal and then loop back in, so that the ω-end of the fatty acyl chain is still anchored inside the binding crevice. The trans double bond, between positions C2 and C3 of the fatty acyl chain, faces the closed end of the substrate binding crevice (Fig. 2 B, lower left) and is located directly adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. A comparison of the position of the nicotinamide ring between the binary complex (InhA and NADH) (37Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and the ternary complex (InhA, NAD+, and C16 fatty acyl substrate) shows no significant difference (only an 0.7-Å r.m.s. deviation over 9 atoms), indicating that NAD+ is an appropriate model for NADH at this resolution. Furthermore, the C3 position of the bound fatty acyl chain is closer (4.8Å) than the C2 position (5.1Å) to the C4 position of the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. These distances are consist"

Busija D. Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in many cerebral functions, particularly in the newborn (2Chemtob S. Li D.Y. Abran D. Hardy P. Peri K. Varma D. Acta Paediatrica. 1996; 85: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PGE2 also influences mitogenesis (3Baylink T.M. Mohan S. Fitzsimmons R.J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), promotes growth and metastasis of tumors (4Yano T. Tano Y. Uchida M. Murakami A. Hagiwara K. Otani S. Ichikawa T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1757-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and stimulates gene transcription (5Simonson M.S. Herman W.H. Dunn M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To date, the biological actions of PGE2 have been attributed to result from its interaction with plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors termed EP, which include EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 subtypes (6Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the nuclear membrane contains high levels of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 and of PGE2 (7Spencer A. Woods J. Arakawa T. Singer I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Possible intracellular sites of action for prostanoids are also suggested by other data. For example, a transporter that mediates the influx of prostanoid has been identified (8Kanai N. Run L. Satriano J. Yi B. Wolkoff A. Schuster V. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cytosolic phospholipase A2 undergoes a calcium-dependent translocation to the nuclear envelope (9Schievella A. Regier M. Smith W. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and cyclooxygenase-2 has been shown to translocate to the nucleus in response to certain growth factors (10Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S. DuBois R. Jetton T. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that prostanoids may exert some of their effects via intracellular EP receptors, to have a direct nuclear action as recently proposed by Goetzl et al. (11Goetzl E. An S. Smith W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and Morita et al. (12Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D. Smith W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It has generally been assumed that the signal transduction cascades are initiated at the plasma membrane and not the nuclear membranes. However, recent studies have disclosed that the nuclear envelope plays a major role in signal transduction cascades (13Malviya A. Rogue P. Cell. 1998; 92: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Nicotera P. McConkey D. Jones D. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In fact, a novel nuclear lipid metabolism that is a part of unique nuclear signaling cascade termed NEST (nuclear envelope signal transduction) has been hypothesized (15Baldassare J.J Jarpe M. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and adenylate cyclase (17Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Morel J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29546-29552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown to be localized at the nucleus. The nuclear membranes also have distinct inositide cycles (18Divencha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1993; 74: 405-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and receptors for 1,4,5-triphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (13Malviya A. Rogue P. Cell. 1998; 92: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Altogether these data raise the possibility of the presence of nuclear prostanoid receptors. This inference has recently been suggested for EP1 (19Bhattacharya M. Peri K. Almazan G. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Shichi S. Durocher D. Abramovitz M. Hou X. Varma D. Chemtob S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15792-15797Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but whether or not this single observation is specific for this receptor or applies to other prostanoid receptors, especially of the widely distributed EP3 and EP4 subtypes, is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the possible expression of nuclear EP3 and EP4 receptors using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, porcine microvascular endothelial cells, newborn pig brain, and adult rat liver. We selected these tissues because many high affinity PGE2 binding sites have been reported in the plasma membranes of pig brain (20Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and rat liver (21Virgolini I. Muller C. Herman M. Schutz W. Sinzinger H. Prostaglandins. 1988; 36: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We focused on EP3 receptors that are most ubiquitous of the four EP subtypes (6Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar) and also examined localization of EP4 receptors. Our data provide novel evidence for the existence of EP3 and EP4 receptors in the nuclear envelope and reveal that these receptors are functional, and their actions appear to involve pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins.

The following products were purchased: PGE2, 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, ON); [3H]PGE2 (182 Ci/mmol),45Ca2+ (2 mCi/49.5 μg of Ca), and [α-32P] (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Mississauga, ON); all other chemicals were from Sigma. Newborn pigs (1–3 days old) were killed with intracardiac pentobarbital under halothane anesthesia, and tissues of interest were removed. Adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (250–300 g) were decapitated and had livers removed. HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary cultures of porcine cerebral endothelial cells from brain microvessels (20Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. Br. J.

All steps were performed at 4 °C using solutions containing 1.1 mmacetylsalicylic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Nuclei were isolated from adult rat liver (23Booz G. Conra K. Hess A. Singer H. Baker K. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and newborn porcine brain cortex (24Rubin B. Fox T. Bridges R. Brain Res. 1986; 383: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was isolated as described (25Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The purity of cellular fractions was ascertained by determining 5′-nucleotidase using a Sigma diagnostic kit as a marker for plasma membrane (23Booz G. Conra K. Hess A. Singer H. Baker K. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and glucose-6-phosphatase was assayed as a marker for ER (26Noordlie R. Arion W. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 619-625Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Proteins were determined by the Bio-Rad assay. 5′-Nucleotidase activity (units/mg protein) was 240 ± 15.4 and 5.3 ± 1.3 in plasma and nuclear membrane fractions, respectively, suggesting that the nuclear membranes were relatively free of contamination by plasma membranes. Glucose-6-phosphatase (an ER marker) specific activity (mmol PO4 released/mg of protein) was 25.2 ± 2.3 in ER and 22.8 ± 3.1 in nuclear membrane fractions since the outer nuclear membrane is contiguous with the ER (27Dale B. DeFelice L. Kyozuka K. Santella L. Tosti E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 255: 119-124Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Saturation isotherms of specific binding of [3H]PGE2 to membrane fractions from newborn porcine brain cortex and displacement of [3H]PGE2 by receptor isoform-specific ligands on brain cortex and rat liver was performed essentially as previously reported (20Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Receptor densities (B max) and affinity constants (KD) were determined using Prism Graphpad program (San Diego, CA). Western blotting of EP3α and EP4 receptors was conducted as described (28Peri K. Hardy P. Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24615-24620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) on newborn brain nuclear and plasma membrane fractions. After immunoblotting using EP3α- or EP4-specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies (29Zhao C. Fujimoto N. Shichi H. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 11: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (1:1000), immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per manufacturer instructions. The full-length cDNA fragments corresponding to human EP3α (30Adam M. Boie Y. Rushmore T. Muller G. Bastien L. McKee K. Metters K. Abramovitz M.

HEK 293 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer instructions; Geneticin (1 mg/ml) -resistant clones were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium containing Geneticin (0.2 mg/ml). The immunolocalization of EP receptors in HEK 293 and porcine cerebrovascular endothelial cells was performed by indirect immunofluorescence (32Figueiredo B.C. Almazan G. Ma Y. Tetzlaff W. Miller F. Cuello A. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 17: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in acetone-methanol (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C and incubated for 1 h with specific rabbit anti-EP3α or anti-EP4 receptor antibodies (29Zhao C. Fujimoto N. Shichi H. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 11: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 5% goat serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing, samples were incubated for 1 h with Texas Red-conjugated IgG (BioCan, Mississauga, ON) diluted 1:50 in the above buffer. To detect plasma membrane immunolocalization, permeabilization of cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 was limited to 15 min (to improve preservation of membranes) before incubation with primary antibodies and subsequent steps. As a negative control, either the primary antibody was omitted or primary antibody with its cognate peptide (29Zhao C. Fujimoto N. Shichi H. J. Ocul. Pharmacol.

Res. 1996; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) and nuclei were stained with DAPI, or Sytox Green according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Pre-embedding immunogold staining was done as described in detail previously (33Pickel V. Chan J. Aoki C. Cuello A. Immunohistochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1993Google Scholar,34Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Priestly J. Cuello A. Immunohistochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1993Google Scholar). Porcine brain endothelial cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer, washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated with anti-EP3α or anti-EP4 receptor antibodies (1:10) overnight at 4 °C in PBS; this limited permeabilization of cells is required for pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy for adequate ultrastructural preservation. The immunogold reaction (33Pickel V. Chan J. Aoki C. Cuello A. Immunohistochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1993Google Scholar) was performed overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 1 nm of gold (1:50) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the reaction was intensified using an Intense Silver Enhancement kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After osmification in 1% osmium tetroxide and Epon embedding, ultrathin sections were observed using a transmission electron microscope (Philips 410 LS, Netherlands). Nuclei were isolated from endothelial cells (35Greenberg M. Ziff E. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), and aliquots (100 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 μmEP3 agonist, M&B 28,767, for 60 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 40 μl (per reaction tube) of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, RNase guard (111 units), and DNase (10 units). RNA was extracted as described previously (28Peri K. Hardy P. Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24615-24620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For the isolation of total cytoplasmic RNA, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of test agents for 1 h and washed with ice-cold PBS. Nuclear and total RNA were applied to a nylon membrane using a vacuum filtration apparatus (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).32P-Labeled cDNA probes for porcine iNOS (37Adachi H. Iida S. Oguchi S. Ohsima H. Suzuki H. Nagasaki K. Kawasaki H. Sugimura T. Esumi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and mouse β-actin (Ambion) were prepared using an oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); unincorporated nucleotides were removed by G-25 column chromatography. Membranes were hybridized to the radiolabeled probes and washed (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The bands were visualized and quantified by Phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The uptake of45Ca2+ in isolated nuclei was determined as described previously (14Nicotera P. McConkey D. Jones D. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were resuspended in buffer A (125 mm KCl, 2 mmK2HPO4, 25 mm Hepes, 4 mm MgCl2, and 400 nmCaCl2, pH 7.0). 45Ca2+ (2 μCi/ml) was added, and samples were incubated in the presence or absence of test agents at 37 °C for different time periods. The reaction was terminated with ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0), filtered under vacuum on glass fiber filters (GF/B, Whatman). The radioactivity on filters was counted on a beta-counter (Beckman LS 7500). The 45Ca2+transient was defined as the radioactivity at a given time minus the radioactivity at time zero. Effects of test agents on calcium transients were measured by fura-2/AM fluorometry as described (14Nicotera P. McConkey D. Jones D. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Lahaie I. Hardy P. Hou X. Hassessian H. Asselin P. Lachapelle P. Almazan G. Varma D. Morrow J. Jackson Roberts L. Chemtob S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1406-1416PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Isolated liver nuclei were resuspended in buffer A and preloaded with 7.5 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were washed and stimulated (∼2 × 106 nuclei/ml) with various test agents. The intranuclear calcium concentration was measured with a spectrofluorometer (LS 50, Perkin Elmer, Beaconsfield, UK) and fluorescent signal calibrated (22Lahaie I. Hardy P. Hou X. Hassessian H. Asselin P. Lachapelle P. Almazan G. Varma D. Morrow J. Jackson Roberts L. Chemtob S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1406-1416PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of PTX-sensitive G proteins in nuclear Ca2+ transients, isolated rat liver nuclei were treated with PTX as described (38Takei Y. Takahashi K. Kanaho Y. Katada T. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Prior to treatment, the toxin was preactivated by incubating at 37 °C for 10 min in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm ATP. The isolated nuclei were incubated with preactivated PTX (20 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 20 min in buffer A containing 1 mm NAD and 50 μm GDP. The treated nuclei were washed with buffer A and then the effects of prostaglandin analogs on intranuclear calcium levels were measured by fura-2/AM fluorometry as above. The maximal specific binding of [3H]PGE2 to newborn pig brain plasma membrane, ER, and nuclear membrane fractions was comparable (TableI); in adult rat liver, theB max for [3H]PGE2 on plasma and nuclear membranes was also similar. The affinity constant (KD) of PGE2 binding did not significantly differ between tissues and membrane fractions. Subtypes of PGE2 receptors were studied by displacement of bound [3H]PGE2 with PGE2, AH6809 (EP1 receptor antagonist), butaprost (EP2agonist), M&B 28,767 (EP3 subtype agonist), and AH23848B (EP4 antagonist) (6Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Neonatal porcine brain plasma and nuclear membranes contained mostly EP3 receptors (nearly 100 and 45%, respectively); on nuclear membranes, the balance of EP receptors was equally divided among EP1, EP2, and EP4 (Fig. 1, aand b). In adult liver plasma membranes, all four EP receptors were detected in equal proportions (25%); in liver nuclear membranes, EP3 was most abundant (40%), and EP1, EP2, and EP4 consisted 15, 20, and 30% of EP receptors, respectively (Fig. 1, c andd). [3H]PGE2 displacement data and the availability of specific anti-EP3α and anti-EP4 receptor antibodies (29Zhao C. Fujimoto N. Shichi H. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 11: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) led us to focus our investigation on the cellular localization of EP3α and EP4 receptors, and the remaining studies concentrated on these two receptor subtypes.Table IMaximum specific binding of [ 3H]PGE2 (Bmax) on cell fractionsTissuePlasma membranesEndoplasmic reticulumNuclear membranesBrainB max14.8 ± 212.2 ± 3.113.2 ± 2K D8.8 ± 1.57 ± 2.88 ± 1.2LiverB max30.2 ± 4.3ND25.7 ± 3.8K D6.2 ± 3.7ND7.1 ± 2.2Values (B max in fmol/mg protein,K D in nm) are mean ± S.E. of three experiments, in duplicate.

Immunoblot analysis revealed immunoreactive bands in plasma and nuclear fractions of similar molecular masses (EP3α, 60 kDa; EP4, 63 kDa) (Fig.2). Because cerebral microvessels contain a number of high affinity PGE2 binding sites (20Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), primary cultures of newborn pig brain microvascular endothelial cells were used to study the intracellular distribution of EP3α and EP4 receptors by confocal microscopy. No fluorescence was detected in the absence of the primary antibodies (Fig.3 a). Immunoreactivity for both receptor subtypes was detected in the plasma membrane (Figs.3 b and 4 a), in the cytoplasm, and at the nucleus (Figs. 3 c and 4 b). EP3α specific fluorescence in the nuclear envelope appeared as a perinuclear halo (Fig. 3 c); the latter was more prominent than that of EP4 receptors (Fig.4 b). The cells were stained with DiOC6 (3Baylink T.M. Mohan S. Fitzsimmons R.J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to identify intracellular membranes, mainly ER (Figs. 3 d and 4 c). Merging the images from EP3α or EP4 specific red immunofluorescence with DiOC6 (3Baylink T.M. Mohan S. Fitzsimmons R.J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) green staining revealed that EP receptors colocalized on intracellular membranes as indicated by the brightyellow-orange fluorescence (Fig. 3 e and4 d); however, the stains did not fully converge, suggesting distinct sites particularly evident in the perinuclear region. Cells were also stained with a nuclear stain, Sytox Green (Fig.3 g). A transverse section (Z-section) of this image superimposed with that of the EP3α immunoreative staining (Fig. 3 h) in the same cell revealed that the immunoreactivity was perinuclear and not intranuclear (Fig.3 i); similar results were obtained using the EP4antibody (data not shown). No immunofluorescence was detected when the antibodies were preincubated with their cognate peptides (Figs.3 f and 4 e). EP3α and EP4 immunoreactivity in co-localization with DiOC6 (3Baylink T.M. Mohan S. Fitzsimmons R.J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) staining apparently in the nucleoli of a few endothelial cells (Figs. 3, c–e and 4, b–d) was not consistently observed (Fig. 3 h) and remains unexplained at this point.Figure 4Confocal microscopy of porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells immunofluorescently stained for EP4 receptors.

Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D. Ungrin M. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G. Metters K. Abramovitz M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar); ectopically expressed EP receptors in HEK 293 cells bind PGE2 and are functional (39Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D. Ungrin M. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G. Metters K. Abramovitz M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 40Neuschafer-Rube F. Hanecke K. Blaschke V. Jungermann K. Puschel G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity for EP3α and EP4receptors was seen on the plasma membrane (Fig.5, c and g) and perinuclear area, which are in proximity to each other in the transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5d, h), which are relatively small and contain limited cytoplasm compared with endothelial cells. As expected, no immunofluorescence was detected in the wild-type cells (Fig.5 a) or after preincubation of the antibodies with their cognate peptide epitopes (Fig. 5 f and j). Thus far, indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a perinuclear localization of EP3α and EP4receptors. To distinguish the nuclear envelope, immunoelectron microscopy of porcine cerebrovascular endothelial cells was performed and confirmed that EP3α and EP4immunoreactivity was indeed at the nuclear envelope (Fig.6, c and f). As expected, these receptors were detected on plasma membranes (Fig. 6 b and e) and Golgi vesicles (Fig. 6 d). No immunogold staining was observed in the absence of the primary antibodies (Fig. 6 a) or in the nucleoli of cells (data not shown). EP3α and EP4 nuclear envelope immunogold staining was detected in the majority of cells observed (95% of cells, over 100 cells observed in each case). Recent studies have shown that endogenous PGE2 has a stimulatory effect on inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) (41Minghetti L. Nicolini A. Polazzi E. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Levi G. Glia. 1997; 19: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42Di Rosa M. Lalenti A. Lanaro A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1996; 54: 229-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We tested whether the stimulation of nuclear EP receptors by prostaglandin analogs may affect iNOS transcription, as determined by dot hybridization of RNA studies. Stimulation of intact nuclei isolated from primary cultures of porcine brain endothelial cells with EP3 receptor agonist M&B 28,767 (0.1 μm) increased transcription of iNOS (Fig.7 a) to a greater extent than after stimulation of whole cells. The nuclear envelope contains distinct nuclear calcium pools that play crucial roles in major nuclear functions including gene transcription (13Malviya A. Rogue P. Cell. 1998; 92: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amplitude and duration of calcium signals have been shown to control differential activation of transcription factors (43Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ can activate iNOS independent of protein kinases C and A (44Takagi H. Toda N. Hawkins R.D. Nitric Oxide: Roles in Neuronal Communication and Neurotoxicity. Japan Scientific Societies Press, CRC Press, Tokyo1994: 44Google Scholar). We tested whether stimulation of nuclear EP3 receptors with prostaglandin analogs could affect calcium concentrations in isolated nuclei of liver; stimulation of EP4 receptors could not be performed because of lack of availability of specific agonists. Application of M&B 28,767 (1 μm, an EP3-selective agonist) to intact isolated nuclei caused rapid nuclear uptake of 45Ca2+ (Fig.7 b). In addition, this EP3 agonist produced a dose-dependent increase in rat liver nuclear calcium as determined by fura-2/AM, a fluorescent dye which localizes in the nuclear envelope space (45Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 c); M&B 28,767 (1 μm) was nearly as effective as the nonselective EP agonist 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (1 μm). We determined whether the nuclear calcium uptake evoked by the EP3 agonist M&B 28,767 was dependent on G proteins. EP3 couples to Gi or Go (46Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), which are known to affect Ca2+ mobilization (46Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 47Barsony J. Marx S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1188-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); such G proteins are detected in rat liver nuclei (38Takei Y. Takahashi K. Kanaho Y. Katada T. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because PTX causes these G proteins to lose their ability to associate with receptors, we tested the effects of PTX on M&B 28,767-induced Ca2+transients. Pretreatment of isolated nuclei with PTX markedly attenuated the stimulatory effect of M&B 28,767 (1 μm) on intranuclear calcium levels, suggesting the involvement of a PTX-sensitive G protein in mediating the effects of nuclear EP3 receptors (Fig. 7 d). In contrast, M&B 28,767 did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation (data not shown). These findings are consistent with coupling of nuclear EP3receptors to G proteins which may directly control Ca2+channels independently of second messengers, as mostly reported for Gi (47Barsony J. Marx S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1188-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 48Hescheler J. Rosenthal W. Hinsch K.D. Wulfern M. Trautwein W. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 613-624Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data presented provides the first clear evidence for the presence of the G protein-coupled receptors, EP3α and EP4 at nuclear membranes of native tissues as well as primary and transfected cells. Furthermore, these receptors seem to be functional as revealed by increased iNOS transcription and nuclear calcium by EP3 agonist, M&B 28,767, which also appears to involve PTX-sensitive G proteins. The plasma and nuclear membrane EP3α as well as EP4 receptors appear to be related because they had similar molecular weights, binding kinetics, ligand binding properties, and immunoreactivity. Also, the comparable distribution of ectopically expressed EP3α and EP4 receptors in HEK 293 cells suggested that the plasma and nuclear membrane EP receptors may be alike. Radioligand binding studies have identified the presence of two other classes of G protein-coupled receptors at the nuclear membrane, the muscarinic acetylcholine (49Lind G. Cavanagh H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 2943-2952PubMed Google Scholar) and angiotensin II receptors, AT1 (23Booz G. Conra K. Hess A. Singer H. Baker K. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); but the AT1 receptor can be detected in the nucleus only after stimulation by angiotensin II (50Lu D. Yang H. Shaw G. Raizada M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other prostanoids, namely PGD2, its metabolite PGJ2, and PGI2can activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) that are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, but PPARs are not responsive to PGE2 (51Kliewer S. Lenhard J. Willson T. Patel I. Morris D. Lehmann J. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 52Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the presence of EP1 receptors at the nuclear membranes has recently been suggested (19Bhattacharya M. Peri K. Almazan G. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Shichi S. Durocher D. Abramovitz M. Hou X. Varma D. Chemtob S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15792-15797Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) albeit its mechanism of action is not clear. In the newborn brain and cerebral microvasculature, PGE2receptors and associated functions at the plasma membrane are down-regulated (2Chemtob S. Li D.Y. Abran D. Hardy P. Peri K. Varma D. Acta Paediatrica. 1996; 85: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Li D.Y. Varma D. Chemtob S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PGE2 plays a role in neuroprotection by acting on EP2 and perhaps EP4 (53Doke A. Hardy P. Peri K. Molotchnikoff S. Varma D. Lachapelle P. Roy M.-S. Chemtob S. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 205ACrossref Google Scholar). PGE2 also increases the expression of nitric-oxide synthase via stimulation of EP3 receptors in the neonate (54Dumont I. Peri K. Abran D. Hardy P. Molotchnikoff S. Varma D. Chemtob S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1812-R1821PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the perinuclear cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (7Spencer A. Woods J. Arakawa T. Singer I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) can produce prostanoids that can act at the nuclear level (11Goetzl E. An S. Smith W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 12Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D. Smith W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and modulate transcription of genes, as had been speculated for iNOS (41Minghetti L. Nicolini A. Polazzi E. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Levi G. Glia. 1997; 19: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present discovery of nuclear EP3 and EP4 receptors proposes new avenues for the intracellular actions of prostanoids, which may also explain certain effects of PGE2 especially when plasma membrane EP receptors are barely detectable. Further studies are needed to clarify the detailed signal transduction mechanisms involved in this action of prostaglandins via nuclear EP receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2105470231,"A novel human gene (PLU-1) has been identified which shows a highly restricted expression in normal adult tissues but which is consistently expressed in breast cancers. A fragment of the PLU-1 cDNA was identified by differentially screening a fetal brain library with cDNAs prepared from ce-1 cells (a human mammary epithelial cell line overexpressing c-ErbB2) treated or untreated with the antibody 4D5, which inhibits c-ErbB2 phosphorylation. Clones covering the full cDNA sequence of 6.4 kilobases were isolated from a breast cancer cDNA library. Although expression of PLU-1 in ce-1 cells is regulated by signaling from c-ErbB2, the gene is expressed in all the breast cancer cell lines examined, in cells cultured from primary breast cancers, and in the invasive and in situ components of primary breast cancers. Translation of the open reading frame predicts a protein of 1544 amino acids, which contains three PHD/LAP motifs, a specific DNA-binding domain found in aDrosophila protein (dri) and novel domains showing extensive homology with other human and non human gene products. Transient transfection of cell lines with MYC-tagged PLU-1 showed the protein to be localized in the nucleus and associated with discrete foci. The presence of the dri motif and PHD/LAP fingers together with the clear nuclear localization and consistent expression in breast cancers, suggest a role for PLU-1 in regulating gene expression in breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2092156970,"Nucleolin is a very abundant eukaryotic protein that localizes to the nucleolus, where the rDNA undergoes transcription, replication, and recombination and where rRNA processing occurs. The top (non-template) strand of the rDNA is very guanine-rich and has considerable potential to form structures stabilized by G-G pairing. We have assayed binding of endogenous and recombinant nucleolin to synthetic oligonucleotides in which G-rich regions have formed intermolecular G-G pairs to produce either two-stranded G2 or four-stranded G4 DNA. We report that nucleolin binds G-G-paired DNA with very high affinity; the dissociation constant for interaction with G4 DNA is K D = 1 nm. Two separate domains of nucleolin can interact with G-G-paired DNA, the four RNA binding domains and the C-terminal Arg-Gly-Gly repeats. Both domains bind G4 DNA with high specificity and recognize G4 DNA structure independent of sequence context. The high affinity of the nucleolin/G4 DNA interaction identifies G-G-paired structures as natural binding targets of nucleolin in the nucleolus. The ability of two independent domains of nucleolin to bind G-G-paired structures suggests that nucleolin can function as an architectural factor in rDNA transcription, replication, or recombination.

Transcription and processing of rRNA occur within a specialized subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. In cells that are actively transcribing the rDNA, nucleoli appear to be composed of three compartments: the fibrillar center, which contains DNA that is not being transcribed; the dense fibrillar component, where rDNA transcription occurs; and the peripheral granular component, where pre-rRNA processing and pre-ribosome assembly take place (1Puvion-Dutilleul F.

The presence of nucleolin in the peripheral granular component is consistent with the participation of nucleolin in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (19Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P.

The fact that nucleolin is abundant within the dense fibrillar component suggests that nucleolin also functions in other processes, including transcription, replication, or recombination of the rDNA. Nonetheless, conserved and specific interactions of nucleolin with the duplex rDNA have not been reported.The rDNA transcription unit includes the regions that template mature 18, 5.8, and 28 S RNAs and external and internal transcribed spacer regions (Fig. 1 A). In all eukaryotes, the entire transcribed region of the rDNA is very rich in the base guanine (34.2% in humans) within the spacers, as well as within the regions that template the mature rRNAs. The G-richness is restricted to a single strand, the non-template strand, and most guanines are within runs that contain three or more consecutive Gs (Fig. 1 B).Single-stranded DNAs that contain runs of three or more consecutive guanine residues readily self-associate in vitro to form structures stabilized by G-G pairing (25Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 26Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 27Williamson J.R.

Science. 1994; 265: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In these structures, guanines interact via Hoogsteen bonding to form planar rings called G quartets (Fig. 2 A), and the G quartets stack upon each other to stabilize higher order structures (Fig. 2 B). That guanine-guanine interactions could occur readily in solution was first established nearly 40 years ago (32Gellert M. Lipsett M.N. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 2014-2018Crossref Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Although G-G-paired DNA has not been directly observed in vivo, G-G-paired structures form rapidly and spontaneouslyin vitro and are very stable once formed. Because of its sequence, the G-rich strand of the rDNA has considerable potential to form G-G-paired structures (Fig. 2 A). Formation of such structures may be stimulated by the unwinding and localized denaturation that accompanies rDNA transcription.Figure 2Formation of G-G-paired DNA. A, top view of G quartet shows four guanine residues forming a planar array stabilized by Hoogsteen bonding. B, G4 DNA and G2 DNA.

Brackets denote the G-runs, which are accessible in the single-stranded (ss) ETS-1 oligonucleotide but protected in G4 DNA (G4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observations presented above have led us to investigate the interaction of nucleolin with G-G-paired DNA. Here we report that mammalian nucleolin binds tightly and specifically to both four-stranded G4 DNA and two-stranded G2 DNA. The dissociation constant for binding is KD = 1 nm, which represents a remarkably high affinity for interaction of a eukaryotic protein with nucleic acid. Mutational analysis shows that two separable domains of nucleolin can bind G4 DNA, one comprised of the four RBDs (RBD-1,2,3,4) and the other comprised of the C-terminal Arg-Gly-Gly repeats (RGG9). These results suggest that G-G-paired DNA is a natural binding target of nucleolin within the nucleolus. Nucleolin may, therefore, be an architectural factor that functions to organize the G-rich non-template strand of the rDNA during transcription, replication, or recombination.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the abundant nucleolar protein, nucleolin, binds G-G-paired DNA with very high affinity (KD= 1 nm). Nucleolin can bind to both four-stranded G4 DNA and two-stranded G2 DNA, and nucleolin recognizes G-G-paired structures independent of sequence context. The remarkably high binding affinities suggest that G-G-paired structures are binding targets of nucleolin in vivo. The observation that nucleolin binds G-G-paired structures independent of sequence context shows that this protein will be able to bind G-G-paired structures wherever they might form within the G-rich rDNA.Dynamic Formation of G-G-paired DNA in the NucleolusMost nuclear DNA is double-stranded, and complementary base pairing will normally protect duplex DNA from forming G-G-paired structures. However, duplex DNA becomes transiently single-stranded during three critical and dynamic processes: transcription, replication, and recombination. Cells have developed sophisticated mechanisms to prevent DNA from adopting alternative structures, including a variety of proteins that bind to transiently exposed single-stranded regions. Nonetheless, these mechanisms are not foolproof. For example, there is considerable evidence that triplet repeat expansion results from formation of non-Watson-Crick structures during replication (see Ref.40Gacy A.M. Goellner G.M. Spiro C. Chen X. Gupta G. Bradbury E.M. Dyer R.B. Mikesell M.J. Yao J.Z. Johnson A.J. Richter A. Melancon S.B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 583-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and references therein).The sequence composition and the strand asymmetry of the rDNA provide it with considerable potential to form G-G-paired structures. The rDNA is G-rich on the top (non-template) strand, not only within the region transcribed into pre-rRNA but also within the spacers (Fig. 1). During active transcription, pol I molecules pack at extremely high density on the rDNA repeats; electron micrographic analysis shows that the spacing between pol I complexes is only 100 base pairs (6Osheim Y. Mougey E.B. Windle J. Anderson M. O'Reilly M. Miller O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transcription at this level requires that a considerable fraction of the rDNA duplex be denatured. We hypothesize that G-G-paired structures form within the G-rich top strand of the rDNA during transcription or when the duplex is transiently denatured during replication or recombination. G-G-paired structures are very stable once formed (26Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and would not be predicted to dissociate spontaneously in vivo.Other experiments provide further support for the notion of a dynamic process of formation and unwinding of G-G-paired structures within the active rDNA. We have recently shown that G-G-paired DNA is the preferred substrate of two eukaryotic helicases, the human BLM helicase, which is deficient in Bloom's syndrome (41Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27587-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase (42Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 19078-19084Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Both these helicases are members of the highly conserved RecQ helicase family. Moreover, S. cerevisiae Sgs1p localizes predominantly to the nucleolus (43Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Science. 1997; 277: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 44Sinclair D.A. Mills K. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar), where it could function to maintain the structure of the G-rich rDNA. The human functional homolog of Sgs1p in S. cerevisiae appears to be the WRN helicase (deficient in Werner's syndrome). Like Sgs1p, WRN is a RecQ family helicase that is predominantly nucleolar in localization (45Marciniak R.A. Lombard D.B. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6887-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 46Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Unwinding activity mapped to the conserved helicase core domain of Sgs1p (42Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 19078-19084Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that preferential activity on G-G-paired substrates may be a general property of helicases in this family. It is therefore very likely that WRN will also prove to be active on G-G-paired rDNA substrates.Nucleolin as an Architectural Factor in rDNA Transcription, Replication, or RecombinationTwo separable domains within nucleolin can bind G-G-paired structures, one comprised of the RBDs 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the other comprised of the C-terminal RGG9domain. The presence of two independent G-G DNA binding domains would contribute to the ability of nucleolin to organize G-G-paired regions. Nucleolin may thus be an architectural factor, in effect forming a scaffolding for the structured G-rich strand. The presence of long acidic runs in the N terminus of nucleolin is consistent with its function in transcription, but nucleolin is a complex molecule with multiple distinct domains, and it may have multiple functions. We have identified nucleolin as one component of a heterodimeric protein, LR1, induced specifically in B cells activated for immunoglobulin heavy chain switch recombination (14Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The rDNA repeats must undergo active recombination to maintain homogeneity of this gene family, and one function of nucleolin may be to stimulate or regulate recombination of the rDNA.Nucleolin in the NucleolusNucleolin is abundant in the peripheral granular component of the nucleolus, where rRNA processing occurs, and also in the central dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus, where rDNA transcription occurs (for review, see Ref. 4Jordan G. Nature. 1987; 329: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Reported functions of nucleolin in rRNA processing (21Bouvet P. Jain C. Belasco J.B. Amalric F. Erard M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and ribosome assembly (24Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Ghaffari S.H. Venkatarama Rao S.V. Dumbar T.S. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9167-9173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with its presence in the nucleolar peripheral granular component. Function in rDNA transcription, replication, and/or recombination is consistent with the observed localization of nucleolin within the nucleolar central dense fibrillar component. The N terminus of nucleolin contains long acidic regions of as many as 38 aspartate and glutamate residues in an uninterrupted stretch, which could function as acid blobs (15Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) to activate transcription by pol I. The N terminus of nucleolin also contains sites for the mitosis-specific cdc2 kinase (38Belenguer P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Labbe J. Doree M. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3607-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and casein kinase II (36Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,37Belenguer P. Baldin V. Mathieu C. Prats H. Bensaid M. Bouche G. Amalric F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6625-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both of these kinases phosphorylate histone H1, and they could analogously regulate nucleolin in response to cell cycle-dependent controls.Many proteins have been identified which contain RBDs and RGG motifs, but the mutational analysis of nucleolin makes it unlikely that high affinity binding to G-G-paired DNA is a common property of all RBD/RGG proteins. Most RBD-containing proteins contain only two or three RBDs, and deletion of two of the RBDs of nucleolin to produce Nuc-1,2, Nuc-2,3, or Nuc-3,4 greatly diminished binding affinity (Fig. 7). Similarly, whereas many proteins contain RGG motifs, nucleolin is unusual in that it contains nine repeats of the RGG motif, and deletion analysis showed that Nuc-RGG4 does not bind G4 DNA.The broad nucleolar distribution of nucleolin has led to considerable interest regarding its mode of localization within the nucleolus. The two domains of nucleolin that bind G-G-paired DNA (RBD-1,2,3,4 and RGG9) are also essential for nucleolar localization (48Heine M.A. Rankin M.L. DiMario P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1189-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 49Schmidt-Zachermann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806PubMed Google Scholar, 50Créancier L. Prats H. Zanibellato C. Amalric F. Bugler B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal acidic region is dispensable. The ability to interact with G-G-paired nucleic acids may, therefore, be essential to localization or retention of nucleolin within the nucleolus. Transcription and processing of rRNA occur within a specialized subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. In cells that are actively transcribing the rDNA, nucleoli appear to be composed of three compartments: the fibrillar center, which contains DNA that is not being transcribed; the dense fibrillar component, where rDNA transcription occurs; and the peripheral granular component, where pre-rRNA processing and pre-ribosome assembly take place (1Puvion-Dutilleul F.

Nonetheless, conserved and specific interactions of nucleolin with the duplex rDNA have not been reported. The rDNA transcription unit includes the regions that template mature 18, 5.8, and 28 S RNAs and external and internal transcribed spacer regions (Fig. 1 A). In all eukaryotes, the entire transcribed region of the rDNA is very rich in the base guanine (34.2% in humans) within the spacers, as well as within the regions that template the mature rRNAs. The G-richness is restricted to a single strand, the non-template strand, and most guanines are within runs that contain three or more consecutive Gs (Fig. 1 B). Single-stranded DNAs that contain runs of three or more consecutive guanine residues readily self-associate in vitro to form structures stabilized by G-G pairing (25Sen D. Gilbert W.

Changes in the total tissue chemistry were most pronounced during the period from birth to 20 years of age, when the -[GlcAβ,3GalNAc6]- disaccharide content increased from approximately 50% to 85% of the total disaccharide content and there was a concomitant decrease in the content of the 4-sulfated disaccharide. In general, the disaccharide content of the deeper layers of immature cartilage were richer in the 4-sulfated residue than the upper regions of the tissue.

The newly synthesized chondroitin sulfate chains had a similar composition to the endogenous chains and also underwent the same age and zonal changes. The monoclonal antisera 3B3(+) and 2B6(+) were used to immunolocalize the unsaturated 6- and 4-sulfated residues generated at the reducing termini of the chondroitin sulfate chains by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase, and these analyses indicated that the sulfation pattern at this position did not necessarily reflect the internal disaccharide composition of the chains. In summary, the sulfation pattern of chondroitin sulfate disaccharides from human normal articular cartilage varies with the age of the specimen, the position (topography) on the joint surface, and the zone of cartilage analyzed. Furthermore, these changes in composition are a consequence of both extracellular, post-translational processing of the core protein of aggrecan and changes in the sulfotransferase activity of the chondrocyte.

In summary, the sulfation pattern of chondroitin sulfate disaccharides from human normal articular cartilage varies with the age of the specimen, the position (topography) on the joint surface, and the zone of cartilage analyzed. Furthermore, these changes in composition are a consequence of both extracellular, post-translational processing of the core protein of aggrecan and changes in the sulfotransferase activity of the chondrocyte. Proteoglycans are major components of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage and provide the tissue with many of its characteristic physicochemical properties, including its ability to generate an osmotic swelling pressure, which enables it to withstand a wide range of compressive loads (1Maroudas A. Adult Articular Cartilage. 2nd Ed. Pitman, Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom1979Google Scholar). Proteoglycans are also known to directly influence chondrocyte activity, either through cell-matrix interactions or by binding specific growth factors in the extracellular matrix, thereby modifying their temporal and spatial effects. Many of these biological interactions are properties of the glycosaminoglycan chains, which are covalently attached to the protein cores of individual proteoglycan molecules. In articular cartilage, the glycosaminoglycans are mainly chondroitin and keratan sulfate chains, as well as a small proportion of dermatan sulfate chains, and they exert their action by virtue of the high electronegative charge and spatial arrangement of their constituent sulfate groups. Aggrecan, the major type of proteoglycan found in articular cartilage, consists of a protein core to which are attached many chondroitin sulfate chains that are predominantly 4- or 6-sulfated (2Hascall V.C. Sajdera S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4920-4930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aging of human articular cartilage is accompanied by many changes in the structure of aggrecan and the multimolecular aggregate that it forms with hyaluronan and link protein. These molecular changes are a consequence of biosynthetic and catabolic events regulated by many cellular and extracellular events. The extent to which these mechanisms are expressed within articular cartilage is, therefore, not uniform, and factors such as species, site (which joint), zone (through the tissue depth), and region (topographical distribution) all dictate specific qualitative and quantitative changes in proteoglycan. However, it is the age of the individual that appears to have the most profound effect on the composition of cartilage (3Bayliss M.T. Ali S.Y. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1981; 11: 56-58Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 4Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hardingham T.E.

Joint diseases occur most frequently in the older age group, and it is important that the changes associated with joint pathology are identified and distinguished from normal, age-related events. Although age-related changes in the proportion of 4- and 6-sulfated disaccharides have been described in human articular cartilage, these have been carried out on a relatively small number of specimens from a mixture of joints and no attempt has been made to separate changes coincident with maturation from those associated with subsequent aging (4Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Murata K. Bjelle A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 5: 109-116Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Murata K.

Acta. 1976; 428: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, the topographical and zonal variations in sulfation pattern have not been defined, and there are no data concerning the relative contribution of the biosynthetic and degradative pathways. The need for a better understanding of the sulfation pattern of human aggrecan is prompted by two published observations. The first of these concerns the generally accepted view that osteoarthritic chondrocytes synthesize proteoglycans with an “immature” composition (9Mankin H.J. Lippiello L. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1970; 52A: 424-434Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar), in keeping with the hypermetabolic activity of the tissue and the hypertrophic response of the cells. This conclusion was based on analysis of the cartilage remaining on resected hip joints, which had an increased content of 4-sulfated disaccharide. However, the study took no account of the anatomical, morphological, or age patterns described above and made no attempt to differentiate between anabolic and catabolic events. The concept of a chondroblastic phenotype in osteoarthritis may be appealing in relation to tissue repair, but there is little direct evidence to support it. Clarification of these experimental findings is urgently required, not just to determine their place in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, but also because measurements of 4- and 6-sulfated disaccharides in joint fluids are now being published as “markers” of proteoglycan metabolism without reference to the normal, macro- or micro-heterogeneity of these structures (10, 11). The second of these observations is more recent and concerns the identification, using monoclonal antibodies, of atypical structures in the chondroitin sulfate chains of animal and human osteoarthritic cartilage (12Caterson B. Mahmoodian F. Sorrell J.M. Hardingham T.E. Bayliss M.T. Carney S.L. Ratcliffe A. Muir H. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 411-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Slater R.R. Bayliss M.T. Lachiewicz P.F.

Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies concerned do not recognize the regular repeating structure of chondroitin sulfate chains, but appear to be specific for selected (as yet uncharacterized) sequences of sulfation both within the chains and at the non-reducing terminal site of the chains, which are found infrequently. Although more recent studies have raised doubts about the validity of this interpretation (15Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), there is no doubt that in osteoarthritis abnormalities in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate chains are related to attempts at matrix remodeling and repair, and it is an interesting possibility that these abnormal glycosaminoglycan chains may contain special properties, such as an increased affinity for growth factors or other cytokines that may facilitate matrix repair by the chondrocytes. The studies described in this report address these questions and provide an analysis of normal human articular cartilage, which will enable investigations of diseased tissue to be interpreted more effectively. Intact knee joints were obtained from amputations or massive replacements at operation for bone tumors not involving the joint space. Fresh specimens (within 1 h of operation) were dissected using sterile techniques, and full-thickness cartilage was removed from the femoral and tibial articular surfaces as described below. Full-thickness cartilage was removed from all of the femoral condyle and diced into 1–2 mm2 pieces. The tissue was thoroughly mixed to ensure that a representative sample could be taken, and then triplicate aliquots of approximately 50 mg wet weight were analyzed. A single full-depth plug of cartilage including the underlying subchondral bone was taken from the sites indicated in Fig. 2 with a sterile cork borer (3 mm diameter). After removing the bone, the cartilage plug was sectioned from the surface on a cryostat at 50 μm, and every four sections were pooled to give 200-μm zones of tissue. The glycosaminoglycan chains of articular cartilage explants were radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate; the exact conditions of the culture depended on the subsequent analysis. When the rate of [35S]sulfate into cartilage explants was determined, tissue was cultured in the absence of serum, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, buffered with HEPES and containing 20 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate for 4 h (16Brocklehurst R. Bayliss M.T. Maroudas A. Coysh H.L. Freeman M.A.R. Revell P.A. Ali S.Y. J. Bone Joint. 1985; 66A: 95-106Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of cartilage for the purpose of analyzing the newly synthesized disaccharides of chondroitin sulfate chains or for investigating the structure of newly synthesized aggrecan, involved culturing tissue in Ham's F-12 medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate for 8 h. Aggrecan (A1 fraction) was purified from 4 m guanidine HCl extracts of cartilage of various ages (newborn, 9, 24, and 47 years) by associative CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (17Bayliss M.T. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A1 fractions of purified aggrecan (newborn, 9, 24, and 47 years) were dissociated in 8 m urea and subjected to electrophoresis in large pore, agarose/polyacrylamide gels, and the outer lanes were stained with toluidine blue to identify the aggrecan subpopulations (18Carney S.L. Billingham M.E.J. Caterson B. Ratcliffe A. Bayliss M.T. Hardingham T.E. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Bayliss M.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Individual subpopulations of aggrecan were cut from the gel with a scalpel, and the slices were extracted with 4 m guanidine HCl prior to their analysis by capillary zone electrophoresis after chondroitin ABC lyase digestion (see below). Large pore gels were also used to fractionate crude extracts of different zones of a 9- and a 60-year-old specimen, which had been cultured in the presence of [35S]sulfate. These gels were either stained with toluidine blue to localize the endogenous aggrecan or subjected to autoradiography to identify the newly synthesized molecules. Autoradiography was carried out by drying the toluidine-stained gels on Gel Bond and exposing them for various periods of time (up to 1 week) to x-ray film (Kodak, X-Omat) at room temperature. The same technique was also used to identify newly synthesized aggrecan in crude cartilage extracts (2.5, 5, 9, 15, 17, 26, and 65 years) of individual 20-μm sections of radiolabeled ([35S]sulfate) full-depth pieces of tissue. In some cases (newborn, 5-, 10-, 21-, 31-, 38-, 46-, and 65-year-old cartilage), the gels were subjected to Western blotting (Hybond N+) and the following polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies were used to localize specific structural components after digesting the blots with chondroitin ABC lyase (25 milliunits) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.4 for 3 h at room temperature: HG1, polyclonal antiserum recognizing the G1 domain of human aggrecan (20Dudhia J.

Chondroitin disaccharides were separated on a 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, United Kingdom (UK)) connected to a DS4000 chromatography work station (Drew Scientific, London, UK). The uncoated capillary was initially washed for 2 min with 100 mm NaOH and then conditioned for 5 min with 40 mm phosphate, 40 mm SDS, 10 mmborate adjusted to pH 9.0. The disaccharides released from chondroitin sulfate chains with chondroitin ABC lyase were introduced into the capillary using hydrodynamic loading for 2 s (approximately 8 nl). A voltage of 15 kV was applied for 15 min, and the disaccharides were migrated past the detector window by the resultant electro-endo-osmotic flow. Detection was by UV absorbance at 232 nm. Peak identity was achieved by comparison of migration time with authentic reference standards (Δdi-0S, 1The abbreviations used are: Δdi-0S, Δdi-6S, and Δdi-4S, unsaturated 0-sulfated, 6-sulfated, and 4-sulfated disaccharides, respectively, released from chondroitin sulphate by the action of chondroitin ABC lyase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatographyΔdi-6S, Δdi-4S) and by overspiking into chondroitin ABC lyase digests. Digest stability was determined by conducting repeat injections at hourly intervals over a 24-h period. The disaccharides released from chondroitin sulfate chains with chondroitin ABC lyase were separated on a 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems) connected to a DS4000 chromatography workstation (Drew Scientific). The analysis was conducted at pH 9.0 to monitor nonsulfated and monosulfated disaccharides. The uncoated capillary (72 cm × 50 μm internal diameter, path length to UV window = 50 cm) was initially washed for 2 min with 100 mm NaOH and the sample introduced hydrodynamically for 2 s (8 μl), over which time the capillary eluent was monitored for UV absorbance at 232 nm. Disaccharides were eluted with 40 mm phosphate, 40 mm SDS, 10 mm borate adjusted to pH 9.0 for 5 min. The concentrations of Δdi-6S, Δdi-4S, and Δdi-0S were summed and expressed as a proportion of the total disaccharide composition. Recovery of the unsaturated chondroitin disaccharides was investigated by the use of papain. A batch of samples were initially subjected to a simple chondroitin ABC lyase digestion. After digestion, the tissue was removed, rinsed in water, dried on paper, and then subjected to papain digestion. Once the material had been digested, the papain was denatured by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. The sample was then treated with chondroitin ABC lyase overnight. An aliquot of supernatant was removed and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. No peaks were detected for Δdi-0S, Δdi-6S, or Δdi-4S, leading us to conclude that complete digestion of disaccharides is achieved with chondroitin ABC lyase treatment alone. Radiolabeled cartilage was digested with papain in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 2.4 mm EDTA, and 10 mm cysteine, pH 5.8, at 65 °C for 24 h. Samples were then dialyzed into 0.1m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and concentrated in a Centricon ultrafiltration device containing a membrane withM r 10,000 exclusion. Concentration was achieved by centrifugation at 4600 × g for 40–45 min. Following digestion of the samples with 25 milliunits of chondroitin ABC lyase, they were mixed with four volumes of cold ethanol and stored overnight at 4 °C. After removal of a small pellet containing the enzyme and any undigested material, the supernatants were eluted from a Partisil 5-PAC column equilibrated in Tris borate buffer as described previously (23Morales T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Δdi-6S and Δdi-4S disaccharides released from endogenous chondroitin sulfate chains were monitored by their UV absorbance at 232 nm, and the radiolabeled ([35S]sulfate) Δdi-6S and Δdi-4S disaccharides were analyzed using an in-line monitor (Berthold HPLC radioactivity monitor; LB 506 C-1) and their proportions were calculated relative to each other. Full-depth blocks (1 mm × 2 mm) pieces of articular cartilage including the subchondral bone were taken from the femoral condyle with a scalpel and snap-frozen inn-hexane that was prechilled in a CO2/ethanol slurry. Cryosections (7 μm) of the cartilage, mounted on glass microscope slides, were digested at room temperature for 30 min with 25 milliunits of chondroitin ABC lyase, and the terminal disaccharides remaining on the chondroitin sulfate chains were localized with the monoclonal antibodies 3B3 (6-sulfated) and 2B6 (4-sulfated) and reaction products were detected using a gold-enhancement-of-silver kit marketed by Amersham International Ltd. The specificity of the immunostaining was determined by digesting the tissue sections with chondroitin ACII lyase, which removes the final disaccharide remaining associated with the core protein of the proteoglycan after it is treated with chondroitin ABC lyase. This procedure completely abolished all of the 3B3(+) and 2B6(+) immunoreactivity. The unsaturated disaccharides of chondroitin sulfate released from full-thickness slices of normal human cartilage by chondroitin ABC lyase were mainly the monosulfated and nonsulfated disaccharides Δdi-6S, Δdi-4S, and Δdi-0S. Disulfated and higher sulfated products were also identified, but they only accounted for a small proportion of the total disaccharide pool (<1%). The Δdi-6S content of cartilage increased with age up to 20 years of age, whereas the Δdi-4S decreased immediately after birth, up to 20 years of age (Fig. 1). During subsequent aging (20–85 years), there was little change in the overall 6- or 4-sulfation. In contrast, the content of Δdi-0S was relatively constant throughout life (2–5%), as was the proportion of higher sulfated products (results not shown). The schematic shown in Fig. 2 illustrates the different areas of the knee joint selected for analysis. Although all areas of cartilage expressed age-related changes, there was considerable variation in the Δdi-6S:Δdi-4S molar ratio of full-thickness cartilage and the value obtained depended on the region of the joint surface sampled (results not shown). These topographical differences in composition were more obvious in tissue obtained from immature joints, but they were also evident in mature specimens. The extent to which these variations reflected changes in the thickness of cartilage and, therefore, zonal changes in composition, was investigated by sectioning cartilage from the articular surface through the tissue depth and analyzing consecutive 200-μm layers. As an example of the site-dependent variability in composition, the results obtained for the posterior tip of the lateral femoral condyle from knee joints of four different ages, are shown in Fig.3. It is apparent that Δdi-6S and Δdi-4S concentrations are not evenly distributed in different zones. In immature (9-year-old) cartilage, chondroitin sulfate chains in the upper half of the tissue were Δdi-6S-rich, whereas the lower half of the tissue contained chains that were predominantly Δdi-4-sulfated. Furthermore, the concentration of Δdi-6S increased from the mid-zones of the tissue toward the articular surface and the highest concentration of this disaccharide was located in the upper quartile of the tissue (800–1200 μm). The decreased content of 6-sulfation observed at the surface of cartilage was a consistent finding at all ages. By 14 years of age, the thickness of cartilage at this site had decreased by 50% to approximately 3 mm and there was a concomitant loss of the deeper, Δdi4-S-rich region observed in the younger specimen, except for the zones directly adjacent to the subchondral bone. The remainder of the tissue retained a Δdi-6S:Δdi-4S ratio that was similar to the distribution measured in the upper half of the 9-year-old specimen. By 43 years of age, the cartilage at this site had reduced in thickness even further and the Δdi-6S content of the middle and deep zones of the tissue had increased by 10–30%; the composition of the surface layers remained unchanged. These trends continued with advancing age until, at 60 years of age, the cartilage was only 1.25 mm thick and all zones had a Δdi-6S content of approximately 85%, with the exception of the 200-μm surface layer of the tissue. When this detailed analysis of disaccharide composition was extended to the other eleven areas of the joint, age-related variations were observed at all of these sites (Fig. 4). In addition, at both ages, there was a topographical variation in the zonal distribution of chondroitin sulfation. This was more pronounced in immature cartilage, where cartilage thickness in different areas of the joint was also most variable, but the same phenomenon was also evident at different sites on the adult knee joint. The content of the 0-sulfated disaccharides generated by chondroitinase ABC digestion of chondroitin sulfate was also measured for the specimens described above. Although this disaccharide comprised only a small proportion of the total disaccharide pool, it also exhibited zonally related changes. These were mainly confined to the articular surface where they were present at a higher concentration compared with the remainder of the cartilage (results not shown). The rates of [35S]sulfate incorporation into full-depth cartilage pieces (i.e. glycosaminoglycan synthesis) confirmed that the biosynthetic activity of the chondrocyte was higher during the years just prior to and during puberty (Fig.5). This anabolic response decreased between 20 and 30 years of age and, although there was a transient increase in activity, at an age usually associated with the time of menopause in women (40–60 years), the rates of synthesis remained fairly constant during adult life. In order to determine the extent to which the aging and zonal changes described in the previous section were a consequence of anabolic or catabolic events, cartilage explants were radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate and the disaccharide composition of the endogenous and newly synthesized chondroitin sulfate chains were compared. The results indicated that, at all ages, chondroitin sulfate chains from both pools have a similar disaccharide composition. Furthermore, when the same analysis was applied to different zones of cartilage, the Δdi-6S and Δdi-4S content of endogenous and newly synthesized chains had a similar composition (Fig. 6, a–c) at all ages.Figure 6The zonal distribution of Δdi-6S (●, ○) and Δdi-4S (▴, ▵) through the depth of articular cartilage at the posterior tip of the femoral condyle (site 5), in specimens aged 14 years (a), 30 years (b), and 60 years (c). Full-thickness plugs of fresh cartilage were incubated for 8 h in the presence of 100 μCi of [35S]sulfate and then sectioned at 50 μm from the articular surface pooling every four sections to give zones equivalent to 200 μm. The disaccharides released from the endogenous glycosaminoglycan chains, by the action of chondroitin ABC lyase, were determined by capillary electrophoresis using an UV monitor. Radiolabeled disaccharides were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography, and the fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting, The closed symbols indicate the distribution of disaccharides released from endogenous chondroitin sulfate chains and open symbols those released from newly synthesized ([35S]sulfate-labeled) molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified aggrecan preparations were fractionated by electrophoresis in large-pore, agarose/polyacrylamide gels (Fig.7). All of the toluidine blue-stained bands were immunoreactive with a polyclonal antiserum raised against the G1 domain of human aggrecan (Fig. 8). Whereas extracts of newborn cartilage (4 h old) contained only one major aggrecan species (band 1a), which migrated at a slower rate than band 1b in the preparations from the 9-, 24-, and 47-year-old specimens, with advancing age, bands 2 and 3 accounted for a higher proportion of the total aggrecan pool. The “free G1” domain, a normal turnover product of aggrecan that accumulates in cartilage during aging, was also identified as a diffuse, slower migrating, immunoreactive band in the gels. The presence of keratan sulfate in each aggrecan species was also confirmed by immunoreactivity with the monoclonal antibody MZ15.Figure 8Agarose/polyacrylamide gel fractionation of cartilage extracts of different ages, Western blotted, and immunolocalized with a range of polyclonal and monoclonal antisera. In each case the antisera recognized was: G1 domain of human aggrecan (lane 1), keratan sulfate (MZ15,lane 2), or unsaturated reducing termini of chondroitin sulfate chains remaining after chondroitin ABC lyase digestion of the blot Δdi-6S (3B3, lane 3) and Δdi-4S (2B6, lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The individual bands 1a, 1b, 2, and 3 from each specimen shown in Fig.7 were extracted from the gels and re-electrophoresed (results not shown) to ensure that they were homogeneous, before releasing the sulfated disaccharides from the constituent chondroitin sulfate chains with chondroitinase ABC. As expected, an age-related increase in the concentration of Δdi-6S and in the ratio of Δdi-6S:Δdi-4S was measured, in keeping with the total tissue analysis, but this was generally higher than that obtained after digesting intact tissue samples (Table I). This finding may indicate that the proteoglycans remaining in the tissue residue after extraction (10–15% of the total glucuronate), presumably those that are intimately associated with the collagenous network, are Δdi-4S-rich. There was very little difference in the disaccharide composition of bands 1b, 2, and 3 at any one age. Furthermore, at each age there was also very little difference in the composition of each band indicating that, if they arise primarily by extracellular cleavage of the core protein, then the 6- and 4-sulfated disaccharides are very evenly distributed on the protein core of aggrecan at all ages.Table IThe disaccharide composition of the toluidine blue staining bands fractionated by agarose/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shown in Fig. 7AgeΔdi-6SΔdi-4SΔdi-6S:Δdi-4S%%4 hBand 1a59.140.91.449 yrBand 1b60.539.51.53Band 261.638.41.60Band 360.939.11.5624 yrBand 1b81.718.34.46Band 284.615.45.50Band 386.813.26.5847 yrBand 1b94.65.417.35Band"
https://openalex.org/W2045499828,"We recently identified and cloned intersectin, a protein containing two Eps15 homology (EH) domains and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Using a newly developed intersectin antibody, we demonstrate that endogenous COS-7 cell intersectin localizes to clathrin-coated pits, and transfection studies suggest that the EH domains may direct this localization. Through alternative splicing in a stop codon, a long form of intersectin is generated with a C-terminal extension containing Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH), and C2 domains. Western blots reveal that the long form of intersectin is expressed specifically in neurons, whereas the short isoform is expressed at lower levels in glia and other nonneuronal cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons reveals that intersectin is found at the plasma membrane where it is co-localized with clathrin. Ibp2, a protein identified based on its interactions with the EH domains of intersectin, binds to clathrin through the N terminus of the heavy chain, suggesting a mechanism for the localization of intersectin at clathrin-coated pits. Ibp2 also binds to the clathrin adaptor AP2, and antibodies against intersectin co-immunoprecipitate clathrin, AP2, and dynamin from brain extracts. These data suggest that the long and short forms of intersectin are components of the endocytic machinery in neurons and nonneuronal cells. We recently identified and cloned intersectin, a protein containing two Eps15 homology (EH) domains and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Using a newly developed intersectin antibody, we demonstrate that endogenous COS-7 cell intersectin localizes to clathrin-coated pits, and transfection studies suggest that the EH domains may direct this localization. Through alternative splicing in a stop codon, a long form of intersectin is generated with a C-terminal extension containing Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH), and C2 domains. Western blots reveal that the long form of intersectin is expressed specifically in neurons, whereas the short isoform is expressed at lower levels in glia and other nonneuronal cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons reveals that intersectin is found at the plasma membrane where it is co-localized with clathrin.

In fact, overexpression of the SH3 domains of amphiphysins I and II leads to a functional block in endocytosis in a number of different systems (26Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H.

A link between EH and SH3 domain-mediated protein-protein interactions has been revealed with the identification and cloning of Xenopus laevis intersectin, a protein containing two N-terminal EH domains, a central helix forming region that has a high probability of forming coiled-coil interactions, and five C-terminal SH3 domains (3Yamabhai M.

Intersectin is homologous to Dap160, a Drosophila protein with two EH domains and four SH3 domains that was identified based on its affinity for dynamin (30Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Through this unique combination of protein-protein interaction modules, intersectin has the potential to form macromolecular complexes between EH domain- and SH3 domain-binding proteins. A human form of intersectin has also been recently identified through genomic analysis of chromosome 21 (31Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, those authors determined that intersectin undergoes alternative splicing in the stop codon leading to a short form (intersectin-s), which has the same domain structure as the Xenopus protein, and a long form (intersectin-l) that contains a C-terminal extension withDbl Homology (DH), PleckstrinHomology (PH), and C2 domains (31Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we have generated an antibody against the EH domains of frog intersectin which we have used to characterize the expression and localization of the antigenically related mammalian protein. Western blots reveal that intersectin-s is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell lines, including in COS-7 cells, where it localizes to clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane. Transfection studies suggest that the EH domains may mediate this localization. Intersectin-l is expressed predominately in neurons where it is also co-localized with clathrin. We previously identified two related proteins that bind to the EH domains of intersectin: intersectin-binding protein (Ibp)1, the mouse homologue of epsin (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and Ibp2 (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Ibp2 binds to clathrin and AP2, suggesting that it may be involved in the localization of intersectin at clathrin-coated pits. In fact, clathrin, AP2, and dynamin were found to co-immunoprecipitate with intersectin. Taken together, these data suggest that both the short and long alternatively spliced forms of intersectin are components of the molecular machinery for endocytosis in nonneuronal cells and neurons. To generate an intersectin antibody, a full-length intersectin cDNA clone from X. laevis (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol.

The PCR product, encoding amino acids 11 to 306 of intersectin, including both EH domains (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). The resulting GST (GST-EHa/b) and His6(His6-EHa/b) fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (19David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 32McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Two rabbits (2173, 2174) were injected with approximately 50 μg of GST-EHa/b using Titermax adjuvant (CytRx Corp.) with standard protocols. Antibody production was monitored by Western blots against His6-EHa/b, and antibodies were affinity purified using strips of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the same fusion protein (33Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For preabsorption experiments, 2173 serum was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mmNaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either GST or His6-EHa/b immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A polyclonal antibody against clathrin (34Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody AC1-M11 against α-adaptin (35Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Dr. Margaret Robinson (Cambridge University). A monoclonal antibody against clathrin was produced from the hybridoma X22 (ATCC) and was also kindly supplied by Dr. Mark McNiven (Mayo Clinic). A monoclonal antibody against dynamin (HUDY-1) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Albany, NY). A cDNA construct encoding hemagglutinin-tagged full-length intersectin was prepared by PCR using an intersectin cDNA template with Pfu DNA polymerase and the following primers (F stands for forward and R stands for reverse): intersectinFa (5′-GATCCATGGCTCAGTTTGGAACTCCG); intersectinFb (5′-CATGGCTCAGTTTGGAACTCCG); intersectinRa (5′-GATCCCAGTTGTTAAAGCTGTAGGGT); and intersectinRb (5′-CCAGTTGTTAAAGCTGTAGGGT). One PCR reaction was performed with the primer pair intersectinFa with intersectinRb, and a second reaction used intersectinFb with intersectinRa. The two reaction products were mixed, and the double-stranded DNA was denatured and allowed to re-anneal; one-fourth of the re-annealed molecules contain sticky ends that are compatible for ligation to a BamHI cleaved vector. The re-annealed mixtures were ligated into the pCGN-Hygro mammalian expression vector which carries a BamHI site in-frame with the epitope tag. Constructs encoding the EH domains (amino acids 11–306) were prepared in an identical manner using the following primers: EHFa (5′-GATCCAATTTGGACATCTGGGCCATA); EHFb (5′-CAATTTGGACATCTGGGCCATA); EHRa (5′-GATCCAGATGGGGGAATATACTCTGG); and EHRb (5′-CAGATGGGGGAATATACTCTGG). The constructs were verified by sequence analysis and transfected into COS-7 using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were platted into tissue culture wells containing 22-mm coverslips previously coated with poly-l-lysine. To coat the coverslips, poly-l-lysine stock (Sigma) was diluted 1:100 in 0.15 m boric acid, pH 8.4, filter sterilized, and incubated over coverslips for 30 min. After incubation, coverslips were washed extensively with sterile water and once with COS-7 cell medium. Plasma membranes were prepared from the cells (either transfected or nontransfected) essentially as described (37Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were maintained for 1 h at 4 °C and were then washed and sonicated in 12 ml of buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 s using a 1/2-inch tapered horn 1 cm above the coverslip at setting 5.0 (Sonics Materials Vibra Cell). The cells were then washed three times in buffer A and fixed in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, and 3% paraformaldehyde). Following fixation, coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline before being processed for immunofluorescence analysis. Postnuclear supernatants from different tissues and cell lines were prepared and processed for Western blots as described (22Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Rat medial septal neurons were prepared as described (38Mazzoni I.E. Kenigsberg R.L. Brain Res. 1996; 707: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as were glial cells from rat hippocampus (39Gosslin K. Banker G.A. Banker G.A. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1990: 251-282Google Scholar). To examine the subcellular distribution of intersectin in neurons, dissociated cell cultures were prepared from the CA3 and dentate regions of hippocampi from P1 rat pups as described (40Baranes D. Lederfein D. Huang Y.-Y. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 813-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture from 1–7 days before processing for immunofluorescence analysis. Images were captured with a Zeiss scanning laser confocal microscope 410. A GST fusion protein, encoding the C-terminal 511 amino acids of Ibp2 (GST-Ibp2), was prepared by PCR from an Ibp2 cDNA template (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L.

The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-Ibp2 was expressed and purified as described previously (32McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

GST-Ibp2 was used in binding assays with a Triton X-100 soluble rat brain extract as described (22Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation analysis, rat brain synaptosomes were resuspended to a protein concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 128 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 11 mm glucose) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Synaptosomal membranes were then pelleted, resuspended in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 50 mm Na-fluoride, 10 μg/ml PMSF), and disrupted by sonication. The samples were spun in a microcentrifuge at maximal velocity, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-intersectin antisera (2173, 2174), pre-coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed in buffer D, and proteins were recovered with SDS gel sample buffer. cDNA clones encoding Ibp2 (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G.

The beads were subsequently pelleted by microcentrifugation and washed three times in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel sample buffer and prepared for Western blot analysis using streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. We have recently identified and cloned X. laevis intersectin, a novel protein composed of multiple EH and SH3 domains, protein modules implicated in endocytosis (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G.

To explore the subcellular localization of mammalian intersectin, we raised two rabbit polyclonal antisera (2173, 2174) against the tandem EH domains of the frog protein because the primary structures of this region are highly related (i.e. 87% identical). We then used the 2173 antibody for immunofluorescence analysis of plasma membranes prepared from COS-7 cells using a procedure that leads to membranes rich in clathrin-coated pits (37Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Moore M.S. Mahaffey D.T. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In double-labeling experiments, antiserum 2173 yielded a bright, punctate staining pattern that was virtually identical to the pattern seen for clathrin (Fig.1 A). The specificity of the staining was confirmed by pre-absorption experiments. Both untreated and GST preabsorbed antisera yielded bright, punctate staining, whereas staining was virtually undetectable using antiserum preabsorbed against the EH domains (Fig. 1 B). Affinity purified antibodies demonstrated an identical immunofluorescence pattern as untreated antiserum (data not shown). To begin to explore the mechanism of intersectin targeting, we performed immunofluorescence analysis on plasma membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with recombinant full-length intersectin. At the level of exposure used for Fig.2 A (∼300 msec integration using a Sony CCD video camera), membranes from transfected cells, which represent approximately 10% of the clathrin-positive membranes, were strongly positive with antibody 2173. Endogenous intersectin, which is weakly detectable in the nontransfected cells at this level of exposure (Fig. 2 A), is readily detectable upon longer exposures (∼3 s integration; see Fig. 1). Interestingly, a similar staining pattern was observed in COS-7 cells transfected with a construct encoding the two EH domains of intersectin (amino acids 11 to 306) (Fig.2 A). By Western blot, both constructs were seen to be highly overexpressed (data not shown). At higher magnification, double-labeling immunofluorescence revealed nearly complete co-localization of both full-length intersectin and its EH domains with clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that intersectin is localized to clathrin-coated pits, possibly through its EH domains, although a role for the SH3 domains in membrane targeting cannot be ruled out. To further explore the expression of intersectin, we used affinity purified antibody 2173 for Western blots of a crude rat brain extract. Two bands of immunoreactivity were evident (Fig.3 A), 190 kDa (intersectin-l) and 145 kDa (intersectin-s) in size. The molecular masses of these bands are in good agreement with the predicted molecular masses of the long (195, 576 Da) and short (137, 711 Da) isoforms of human intersectin, alternatively spliced variants identified through genomic analysis of chromosome 21 (31Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of these bands, we performed in vitro binding assays using a fusion protein encoding a region of the intersectin-binding protein, Ibp2, which contains the NPF repeats that interact with the EH domains of intersectin (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Both the 190 and the 145 kDa species bind to the fusion protein, suggesting that they are intersectin-l and intersectin-s, respectively (Fig. 3 b). This result is further strengthened by the observation that both species also bind specifically to a GST fusion protein encoding the peptide sequence NPFL (data not shown). Western blot analysis of extracts from a wide variety of tissues and cell lines demonstrates that intersectin-l is expressed predominately in the brain, whereas intersectin-s is ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 4). Interestingly, intersectin-l is expressed in neurons and is not detected in glia (Fig.3 A). Intersectin-s is expressed in glia, and the low levels of intersectin-s seen in neuronal cultures is likely because of glia contamination of the neurons (Fig. 3 A, Ref. 38Mazzoni I.E. Kenigsberg R.L. Brain Res. 1996; 707: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also of interest, the pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, expresses intersectin-s (Fig. 4), whereas intersectin-l was only weakly detectable, even after NGF-induced differentiation (data not shown).Figure 4Tissue distribution of the intersectin isoforms. Crude postnuclear supernatants were prepared from a variety of tissues and cell lines and processed for Western blots with antibody 2173.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the subcellular localization of intersectin, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of hippocampal neurons in culture using confocal microscopy (45Baranes D.

Intersectin immunoreactivity appeared as small spots, 0.5–1.0 μm in diameter, which were located within cell bodies in Golgi-like structures, at the plasma membrane and throughout the length of axons and dendrites (Fig.5, upper left and bottom panels). These intersectin punctae corresponded to regions enriched in clathrin (Fig. 5), although not all intersectin positive punctae were positive for clathrin (note the red staining in the top right panel). Through its EH domains, intersectin binds through the NPF tripeptide with Ibp1 and Ibp2 (3Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ibp1 and Ibp2 also contain the peptide sequences LVDLD and LVNLD, respectively, which resemble clathrin-binding motifs (18McPherson P.S. Cell.

Murein hydrolases of staphylococcal phages φ11, 80α, 187, Twort, and φPVL harbor a central domain that displays sequence homology to knownN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl amidases; however, their precise cleavage sites on the staphylococcal peptidoglycan have thus far not been determined. Here we examined the properties of the φ11 enzyme to hydrolyze either the staphylococcal cell wall or purified cell wall anchor structures attached to surface protein. Our results show that the φ11 enzyme has d-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase as well asN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl amidase activity. Analysis of a deletion mutant lacking the amidase-homologous sequence, φ11(Δ181–381), revealed that the d-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase activity is contained within the N-terminal 180 amino acid residues of the polypeptide chain. Sequences similar to this N-terminal domain are found in the murein hydrolases of staphylococcal phages but not in those of phages that infect other Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria or Bacillus.

Sequences similar to this N-terminal domain are found in the murein hydrolases of staphylococcal phages but not in those of phages that infect other Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria or Bacillus. The cell wall envelope of Gram-positive bacteria is a macromolecular, exoskeletal organelle that is assembled and turned over at designated sites (1$$Google Scholar). The cell wall functions not only to protect bacteria from osmotic lysis but also serves as a surface organelle that allows Gram-positive pathogens to interact with their environment, most notably the infected tissues of the host (2Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Molec. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mode of action of antibiotics and to identify new targets of antibacterial therapy, Staphylococcus aureus has been employed as a model organism to study the physiology of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria for almost 50 years (3Dawson I.M.

The peptidoglycan of S. aureus consists of a repeating disaccharide, N-acetylmuramic acid-(β1–4)-N-acetylglucosamine (MurNAc 1The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; CH3CN, acetonitrile; CID, collisionally induced dissociation; Cws, cell wall sorting signal; DNFB, dinitrofluorobenzene; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; rpHPLC, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, Seb, staphylococcal enterotoxin B; Atl, autolysins; d-iGln, d-isoglutaminyl; PPG, polypropylene glycol GlcNAc, N-acetylhexosamine-GlcNAc) (4Ghuysen J.M.

Thed-lactyl moiety of N-acetylmuramic acid is amide-linked to the short peptide component of peptidoglycan (8Ghuysen J.M. Tipper D.J. Birge C.H. Strominger J.L.

Wall peptides are cross-linked with other peptides attached to neighboring glycan strands, thereby generating a three-dimensional network that surrounds the staphylococcal cell (11Tipper D.J. Berman M.F. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. J. Biol.

During cell wall synthesis the peptidoglycan precursor molecule, lipid II (C55-PP-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(NH2-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala-COOH)-GlcNAc; C55-PP is unde- caprenyl pyrophosphate), is incorporated into the peptidoglycan network via transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions (14Higashi Y.

Whereas transglycosylation leads to the polymerization of the glycan strands, the transpeptidation reaction results in the cross-linking of the peptide backbone of the cell wall (18Nakagawa J. Tamaki S. Tomioka S. Matsuhashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13937-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this reaction, the terminal d-Ala of the pentapeptide precursor (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(NH2-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala-COOH) is removed and the carboxyl of d-Ala at position four is linked to the free amino of the pentaglycine cross-bridge within cell wall peptides of neighboring peptidoglycan strands (19Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the structure of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan and the cleavage sites of muralytic enzymes. Several investigators employed biochemical techniques to isolate and characterize staphylococcal murein hydrolases, leading to the identification of N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, d-Ala-Gly endopeptidase, as well as Gly-Gly endopeptidase activities (6Ghuysen J.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strominger J.L. Ghuysen J.M. Science. 1967; 156: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Shockman G.D. Höltje J.-V.

The isolation of staphylococcal transposon variants that are defective in autolysis has permitted the assignment of specific functions to individual genes as well as sequence comparison between murein hydrolases from many different bacterial species (24Oshida T. Sugai M. Komatsuzawa H. Hong Y.M. Suginaka H. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 25Wang X. Wilkinson B.J. Jayaswal R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Murein hydrolases can be grouped into two separate classes of enzymes. The first group is the autolysins, for example S. aureus N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase (Atl),N-acetylglucosaminidase (Atl) (24Oshida T. Sugai M. Komatsuzawa H. Hong Y.M. Suginaka H. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), as well as the presumed Gly-Gly endopeptidase (LytM) (26Ramadurai L. Jayaswal R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Autolysins are secreted from the bacterial cytoplasm by N-terminal signal peptides and degrade the cell wall peptidoglycan at specific sites during physiological growth and/or during stationary phase. Bacteriophage-encoded murein hydrolases, also called endolysins, are exported by holins, small polypeptides that are inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacterial host (27Young R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endolysins function to completely hydrolyze the cell wall peptidoglycan as a means to release bacteriophage particles from the bacterial cytoplasm. The gene encoding the murein hydrolase of staphylococcal phage φ11 has been sequenced (25Wang X. Wilkinson B.J. Jayaswal R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison revealed that this endolysin has a modular organization consisting of an N-terminal, a central, and a C-terminal domain. The central domain of the φ11 enzyme displays sequence similarity with knownN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases, whereas the C-terminal domain is homologous to the cell wall targeting signal of lysostaphin, a staphylolytic bacteriocin secreted byStaphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus(23Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 28Baba T. Schneewind O.

Commun. 1965; 19: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Targeting signals are thought to function as binding domains that direct muralytic enzymes to specific receptors on the bacterial surface (28Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4789-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of φ11 murein hydrolase displays sequence similarity to endolysins of other aureophages (φ187, φ11, 80α, Twort, and φPVL); however, a specific murein hydrolase function has thus far not been assigned to this domain (Fig. 1 C). Surface proteins of S. aureus are covalently attached to the peptidoglycan by a mechanism requiring a C-terminal sorting signal and conserved LPXTG motif (31Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 32Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). After export from the cytoplasm via an N-terminal signal peptide, the sorting signal is cleaved between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif. The carboxyl of threonine is linked to the amino group of the pentaglycine cross-bridge in the staphylococcal cell wall (33Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 34Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Our previous work sought to characterize the cell wall anchor structure of staphylococcal surface proteins after their solubilization with murein hydrolases (32Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 35Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When the peptidoglycan is cut with lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase (29Browder H.P. Zygmunt W.A. Young J.R. Tavoramina P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Sloan G.L. Smith E.C. Lancaster J.H. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), purified surface protein migrates uniformly on SDS-PAGE (32Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The solubilized polypeptides have two or three glycine residues linked to the carboxyl of threonine (34Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In contrast, when solubilized withN-acetylmuramidase orN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase, surface proteins migrate as a spectrum of fragments on SDS-PAGE with increasing mass (35Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29135-29142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This can be explained as surface protein linked to peptidoglycan with different amounts of cross-linked cell wall subunits. We have used purified recombinant φ11 murein hydrolase to solubilize staphylococcal surface proteins from the bacterial cell wall (36Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When analyzed on SDS-PAGE, surface protein migrated as two distinct species, closely resembling the uniform migration of lysostaphin-released species but not the heterogeneous pattern observed forN-acetylmuramidase- orN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase-solubilized surface protein. This was a surprising result, because the φ11 murein hydrolase is known to display sequence homology with knownN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases. Characterization of the φ11 murein hydrolase-released cell wall anchor structures of surface proteins revealed the presence of linked cell wall tetrapeptide (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(surface protein-Gly5)-d-Ala-COOH) and disaccharide-tetrapeptide (MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(surface protein-Gly5)-d-Ala-COOH)-GlcNAc) (36Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the φ11 murein hydrolase may cleave the peptidoglycan at two sites, the amide bond betweenN-acetylmuramyl and l-Ala and the peptide bond between d-Ala and Gly. We show here that the φ11 murein hydrolase displays d-Ala-Gly endopeptidase as well asN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of φ11 murein hydrolase functions as a d-Ala-Gly endopeptidase. Staphylococcal strain OS2 has been previously described (31Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and was used as a host for the recombinant plasmid pHTT4 encoding the recombinant surface protein Seb-MH6-Cws (36Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (38Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) was used as a host for the expression of the 6His-tagged φ11 and φ11(Δ181–381) enzymes. The coding sequence of the 6His-tagged φ11 amidase was contained on plasmid pHTT2 (36Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The truncated mutant protein, φ11(Δ181–381), was generated by the ligation of DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal 180 amino acids and C-terminal 100 amino acids of the full-length φ11 protein. DNA encoding the C-terminal domain of the φ11 hydrolase was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pHTT2 DNA using the primers LA-Kpn (28Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4789-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and φ11-Bam6His (AAGGATCCCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGACTGATTTCTCCCCATAAGTC) (36Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the N-terminal domain was polymerase chain reactionamplified from pHTT2 DNA using the primers φ11-Nde (AACATATGCAAGCAAAATTAACTAAAAAT) (36Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were digested withBamHI and KpnI or NdeI andKpnI and subsequently cloned in a three-way ligation into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the vector pET9a (38Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) to generate pWil54. Tryptic soy broth was purchased from Difco. Mutanolysin and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher unless otherwise noted. The purification of Seb-MH6-Cws surface protein from cell walls of S. aureus OS2 harboring the plasmid pHTT4 was carried out as described previously (35Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29135-29142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, sedimented cells were washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and were broken with a Bead-Beater instrument (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Walls were sedimented by ultracentrifugation and suspended in 50–70 ml of wash buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100). The suspension was stirred for 3–12 h at 4 °C, and cell walls were sedimented by centrifugation for 15 min at 32,500 ×g. The walls were washed three times in 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0, followed by a single wash with water prior to digestion with either mutanolysin, φ11, or φ11(Δ181–381) enzymes (see below). Digestion of cell walls with mutanolysin was carried out in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, as described previously (35Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29135-29142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Digestion of cell walls with φ11 or φ11(Δ181–381) was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl with approximately 1 mg of enzyme per liter of staphylococcal culture from which the walls were isolated. Buffers throughout the procedure were supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and 1 μm pepstatin to prevent proteolysis of the Seb-MH6-Cws protein. Solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws protein was fast protein liquid chromatography purified by affinity chromatography on nickel resin as described previously (35Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29135-29142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring either pHTT2 and pLysS (38Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) or pWil54 were grown overnight in LB medium containing either chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol alone, respectively. The culture was diluted 1:50 into fresh medium and grown with shaking at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.2 whereupon the expression of T7 polymerase was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested after 4 h by centrifugation at 8,000 × g. Preliminary experiments revealed that both full-length and truncated φ11 enzymes were contained in inclusion bodies, and subsequent purification steps were therefore carried out under denaturing conditions. The E. coli cell sediments were suspended in 50 ml of buffer A (6m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0); cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 14,000 pounds/square inch, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min. Enzymes were fast protein liquid chromatography purified from the supernatant over a 1-ml bed volume column of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The column was pre-equilibrated with buffer Q1 (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 0.01 mTris-HCl, pH 7.3) and, after loading with sample, was washed with an additional 10 ml of buffer Q1. The column was washed with 15 ml of 30% Q1 and 70% Q2 (8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.2). Protein was eluted from the column in a pH-dependent manner by a step gradient to 100% Q2 buffer. The purified enzymes, in approximately 5 ml of Q2 buffer, were folded by dialysis against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (50% glycerol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) for 4–6 h at 4 °C without stirring and again against fresh dialysis buffer overnight with slow stirring. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation, and the concentration of soluble enzyme was measured by a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad) against a standard of bovine serum albumin. Enzyme preparations were stored at −20 °C and used directly from stock for all assays. Crude cell walls used for Morgan-Elson and DNFB assays (see below) were prepared from a culture of S. aureus OS2 grown to post-log phase in tryptic soy broth. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 8,000 × g, suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and broken with glass beads in a Bead-Beater instrument (5 pulses of 3 min each interspersed with 5 min cooling on ice). Crude cell walls were sedimented by ultra-centrifugation (100,000 × gfor 30 min) and suspended in 20 ml of a 1% SDS solution and boiled for 30 min. Crude walls were sedimented by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g and washed five times with water. Highly purified staphylococcal peptidoglycan employed for Edman degradation and mass analysis of φ11 and φ11(Δ181–381)-solubilized muropeptides was prepared essentially as described by de Jonge et al. (39de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. aureus OS2 cells were grown to mid-log phase in tryptic soy broth, and culture was chilled to 4 °C on ice. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in a solution of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and boiled for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 30,000 ×g and washed six times with water. The cells were broken with 0.2-mm glass beads in a Bead-Beater instrument as described above. Glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 200 × gfor 5 min. Broken cell walls were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. Walls were treated with α-amylase (Sigma, 100 μg/ml), DNase (Sigma, 10 μg/ml), and RNase A (Qiagen, 50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and protein was removed from the peptidoglycan by the addition of trypsin (Sigma, 100 μg/ml) and incubating the walls overnight at 37 °C. Walls were collected by centrifugation, washed two times with water, once with 8 m LiCl, once with 100 mm EDTA, twice more with water, and finally with acetone. Walls were suspended in water and stored at −20 °C. Preparation of C-terminal anchor peptides from Seb-MH6-Cws was carried out as described previously (35Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29135-29142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified Seb-MH6-Cws was methanol/chloroform-precipitated, dried under vacuum in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant), and suspended in 1–3 ml of 70% formic acid. Five mg of cyanogen bromide was added, and the cleavage reaction was incubated for 16–18 h at room temperature in the dark. The cleaved peptides were dried under vacuum, washed twice with water, and suspended in 1–2 ml of buffer A. Samples were loaded onto a column packed with 1 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A. The Column was washed with 10 ml of each buffer A, buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and buffer C (same as buffer B, but pH 6.3). Peptides were eluted with 2 ml of buffer D (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5m acetic acid, pH 4.3) and subjected to rpHPLC on C18 column (2 × 250 mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific). Separation was carried out at 40 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient starting 10 min after injection from 99% H2O (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 60% H2O and 40% CH3CN in 35 min followed by a steeper gradient to 99% CH3CN in 5 min. Elution of peptides was monitored at 215 nm, and 1-min fractions were collected. Dried HPLC fractions containing the peptides of interest were suspended in CH3CN:water:trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:0.1), typically 50 μl per 1.5 absorbance units at 215 nm. MALDI-MS spectra were obtained on a reflectron time-of-flight instrument (Perspective Biosystems Voyager RP) in the linear mode. Samples (0.5 μl) were co-spotted with 0.5 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 10 mg/ml in CH3CN:water:trifluoroacetic acid (70:30:0.1)). All samples were externally calibrated to a standard of bovine insulin. For the analysis of muropeptides removed from surface protein by digestion with the φ11 enzyme, anchor peptides were solubilized with mutanolysin and, after purification, were redigested with the φ11 murein hydrolase at a concentration of 400 μg/ml overnight at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of 10%. Samples were placed on ice to precipitate the φ11 enzyme, which was separated from the soluble muropeptides by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Trifluoroacetic acid-soluble compounds (muropeptides) were desalted over a C18 cartridge (Analtech) and dried under vacuum. Dried muropeptides were suspended in 200 μl of water. To the peptides, 200 μl of 0.5 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, was added followed by the immediate addition of 1–3 mg of solid sodium borohydride. Reduction of muropeptides was previously shown to be essential for effective separation by rpHPLC (40Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 20% phosphoric acid. The purification and rpHPLC analysis of muropeptides generated by the digestion of intact peptidoglycan with the φ11 and φ11(Δ181–381) enzymes was carried out using highly purified peptidoglycan as a substrate. Approximately 2 mg of pure staphylococcal peptidoglycan (see above) was digested with approximately 400–500 μg of enzyme in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for 4 h at 37 °C. Enzyme was precipitated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 10% and centrifugation after 15 min on ice. Removal of linked teichoic acids from the soluble muropeptides was achieved by heating the soluble muropeptides to 60 °C for 14 h. Muropeptides were desalted over a C18 cartridge and dried. The muropeptides were resuspended and reduced with sodium borohydride as described for the anchor muropeptides. Separation of muropeptides by rpHPLC was carried out using a C18 column and a method devised for E. coli wall peptides (40Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) that was later modified for the separation of S. aureus muropeptides (39de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C18 column employed for the separation of muropeptides from anchor peptides (2 × 250 mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific) contained a slightly different resin than the C18 column employed for the separation of muropeptides from purified peptidoglycan (2 × 250 mm, C18 Aquasil, Keystone Scientific), resulting in a discrepancy in the retention times observed between the two experiments. A linear gradient was started immediately after injection of 5% (v/v) methanol in 100 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 2.5) to 30% (v/v) methanol in 100 mm NaH2PO4(pH 2.8) in 100 min. Azide was not added to the start buffer, and base-line drift was accounted for by subtracting the chromatogram of a blank run. Eluted muropeptides were monitored at 206 nm, and positive fractions were desalted using a C18 cartridge and dried under vacuum prior to analysis by ESI-MS or Edman degradation. Crude staphylococcal cell walls were resuspended in water (20 mg wet weight/ml) to make a stock solution. Into each reaction tube, 400 μl of wall stock was mixed with 500 μl of 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5 (or pH 6.0 for mutanolysin reaction), and 100 μl of NaCl to give an initialA 600 of 1.1. Lysostaphin (10 μg/ml), φ11 enzyme (100 μg/ml), φ11(Δ181–301) (100 μg/ml), or mutanolysin (50 units/ml) were added, and the crude cell walls were digested overnight to an A 600 <0.1. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 ×g, and soluble material was transferred to another Eppendorf tube. For the measurement of soluble N-acetylhexosamines by a modified Morgan-Elson reaction (22Ghuysen J.-M. Tipp"

A variety of angiogenesis inhibitors that antagonize the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have recently been identified. However, the mechanism by which these diverse angiogenesis inhibitors exert their common effects remains largely unknown. Caveolin-1 and -2 are known to be highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells both in vitro andin vivo. Here, we examine the potential role of caveolins in the angiogenic response. For this purpose, we used the well established human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, ECV 304. Treatment of ECV 304 cells with known angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, bFGF, or hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor), resulted in a dramatic reduction in the expression of caveolin-1. This down-regulation event was selective for caveolin-1, as caveolin-2 levels remained constant under these conditions of growth factor stimulation. VEGF-induced down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression also resulted in the morphological loss of cell surface caveolae organelles as seen by transmission electron microscopy. A variety of well characterized angiogenesis inhibitors (including angiostatin, fumagillin, 2-methoxy estradiol, transforming growth factor-β, and thalidomide) effectively blocked VEGF-induced down-regulation of caveolin-1 as seen by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. However, treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors alone did not significantly affect the expression of caveolin-1. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase and a known angiogenesis inhibitor, also blocked the observed VEGF-induced down-regulation of caveolin-1. Furthermore, we show that caveolin-1 can function as a negative regulator of VEGF-R (KDR) signal transduction in vivo. Thus, down-regulation of caveolin-1 may be an important step along the pathway toward endothelial cell proliferation.

Angiogenesis is the development of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels (1Bussolino F. Mantovani A. Persico G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the adult, angiogenesis is primarily associated with pathological conditions such as tumor formation and wound healing (2Saphir A. J. Natl.

Med. 1995; 73: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Several different angiogenic activators have been described thus far (2Saphir A. J. Natl.

These include, but are not limited to, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic FGF; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-R, VEGF receptor; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; also known as scatter factor) (9Rosen E.M. Lamszus K. Laterra J. Polverini P.J. Rubin J.S. Goldberg I.D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). These growth factors bind and activate specific receptor tyrosine kinases within endothelial cells that are coupled to a variety of signal transduction pathways, most notably the Ras-p42/44 MAP kinase pathway (10Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 11Jones M.K. Sarfeh I.J. Tarnawski A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Angiogenesis inhibitors may be stored as inactive precursors within larger proteins and released upon appropriate proteolytic processing (12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D.

Others are chemically synthesized compounds, such as 2-methoxyestradiol (an endogenous estrogen metabolite) and thalidomide (27Fotsis T. Zhang Y. Pepper M.S. Adlercreutz H. Montesano R. Nawroth P.P.

Here, we examine the effects of both angiogenesis activators and inhibitors on the expression of caveolin-1, a caveolae marker protein that is known to be abundantly expressed in normal endothelial cells in the adult (31Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). We find that angiogenesis activators and inhibitors differentially regulate the expression of caveolin-1. As caveolin-1 is thought to play a role as a negative regulator of signal transduction (31Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), down-regulation of caveolin-1 by angiogenic growth factors may be important for endothelial cell proliferation and subsequent angiogenesis. Monoclonal antibodies directed against caveolin-1 (clone 2297) and caveolin-2 (clone 65) were the gift of Drs. John R. Glenney, Jr. and Roberto Campos-Gonzalez (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) (32Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The cDNA for the human VEGF-R (KDR) was as described previously (34Terman B.I. Carrion M.E. Kovacs E. Rasmussen B.A. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1677-1683PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for mutationally activated MEK-1 is included as a positive control in the PathDetect Elk-1 trans-reporting system (Stratagene, Inc.). Human endothelial cells (ECV 304; CRL-1998) were grown in medium-199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (normal growth medium). Endothelial cells were seeded at a density of ∼1.0 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates. After incubation in normal growth medium overnight, the medium was replaced by medium-199 containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Expression of caveolin-1 and -2 was examined by Western blot analysis. Cells were solubilized with sample buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol in double distilled water. After boiling for 4 min, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5–15% gradient gels), transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western blot analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence. Prior to loading, the protein concentration of the samples was measured with the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Briefly, cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and stained with specific anti-peptide IgG directed against the unique N terminus of caveolin-1 (pAb N-20, directed against human caveolin-1 residues 2–21; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.)

Bound primary antibodies were detected using rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The immunostained cells were mounted in the presence of Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent.

Finally, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured as we described previously (38Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G.

These cells express both caveolin-1 and -2, but fail to express caveolin-3, a muscle-specific caveolin protein (data not shown). To evaluate the potential role of caveolins in angiogenesis, we studied the effect of angiogenesis activators (VEGF and bFGF) on caveolin expression in ECV 304 cells. In addition, we evaluated the effect of another growth factor (HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; scatter factor) that is known to activate the MET receptor tyrosine kinase and promote angiogenesis (9Rosen E.M. Lamszus K. Laterra J. Polverini P.J. Rubin J.S. Goldberg I.D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the effects of these growth factors on caveolin expression. Treatment with VEGF, bFGF, or HGF all dramatically down-regulated the expression of the caveolin-1 protein (top panels). In striking contrast, the levels of the caveolin-2 protein remained essentially unaffected (bottom panels). As all three growth factors yielded similar results, we decide to focus our efforts on the effects of VEGF, a well characterized stimulator of angiogenesis. We next determined the time and concentration dependence of the effects of VEGF. Interestingly, VEGF-induced down-regulation of caveolin-1 appeared after only 8 h of treatment, exerting its maximal effects at 24 h (Fig.2 A). VEGF induced the down-regulation of caveolin-1 at a minimal concentration of 3 ng/ml, and the effect became maximal at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, caveolin-2 levels remained unaffected at every time and dose investigated. Angiogenesis inhibitors exert their effects by antagonizing the effects of endothelial growth factors, such as VEGF. However, their mechanism of action remains largely unknown. Fig. 3 A shows the effects of a variety of well studied angiogenesis inhibitors (angiostatin, fumagillin, 2-methoxyestradiol, TGF-β, and thalidomide) in combination with VEGF. In all cases examined, these angiogenesis inhibitors selectively blocked the ability of VEGF to induce the down-regulation of caveolin-1. Caveolin-2 levels are shown for comparison. The effects of these inhibitors were also analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3 B). In untreated cells, caveolin-1 staining was abundant and localized primarily to the periphery of the cell. Growth factor stimulation using VEGF clearly down-regulated caveolin-1 immunostaining; similarly, we find that VEGF also induced the down-regulation of morphologically detectable caveolae as seen by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3 C). Again, this down-regulation of caveolin-1 and caveolae organelles was prevented by treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, such as angiostatin and thalidomide (Fig. 3, B andC). Because caveolin-1 levels are down-regulated in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and can be restored to normal levels by inhibiting the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade, we next evaluated the effects of a well characterized MEK inhibitor, PD 98059. PD 98059 also blocked the ability of VEGF to down-regulate caveolin-1 expression, as seen by Western blotting (Fig.3 A) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3 B). Thus, inhibition of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade by PD 98059 is sufficient to block growth factor-induced down-regulation of caveolin-1. Interestingly, several recent reports indicate that PD 98059 can function as an angiogenesis inhibitor (10Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J.

Interestingly, in most cases, the angiogenesis inhibitors alone had little or no effect on caveolin-1 levels, with one exception. In the case of fumagillin, caveolin-1 levels were slightly down-regulated. We do not yet know the significance of this observation. Importantly, these results indicate that the angiogenesis inhibitors exert their effects on caveolin-1 expression primarily in response to endothelial growth factors stimulation via VEGF. Caveolae have also been implicated in signaling through the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway. Morphological studies have directly shown that ERK-1/2 is concentrated in plasma membrane caveolae in vivo using immunoelectron microscopy (45Liu P. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented suggesting that other components of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade are localized within caveolae membranes. These include receptor tyrosine kinases (EGF-R; PDGF-R; Ins-R) (35Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Recently, we examined the functional role of caveolins in regulating signaling along the MAP kinase cascade (39Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Co-expression with caveolin-1 dramatically inhibited signaling from EGF-R, Raf, MEK-1, and ERK-2 to the nucleus in vivo (39Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Using a variety of caveolin-1 deletion mutants, we mapped this in vivo inhibitory activity to caveolin-1 residues 32–95. In addition, peptides derived from this region of caveolin-1 (i.e. the caveolin-scaffolding domain) also inhibited thein vitro kinase activity of purified MEK-1 and ERK-2 (39Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin-1 can inhibit signal transduction from the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade both in vitro and in vivo by acting as a natural endogenous inhibitor of both MEK and ERK. To assess whether caveolin-1 expression or angiogenesis inhibitors can negatively regulate signaling from the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (VEGF-R) along the MAP kinase cascade, we next used an establishedin vivo signal transduction assay that measures activation of the nuclear transcription factor, Elk-1. It is well known that transient overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases is sufficient to cause receptor dimerization and signal transduction. Fig.5, A and B, shows that co-expression of VEGF-R with caveolin-1 in either Chinese hamster ovary cells or ECV 304 cells significantly inhibits VEGF-R-induced signaling, as compared with empty vector alone (pCB7). Similarly, we find that co-expression of activated MEK-1 with caveolin-1 in ECV 304 cells dramatically inhibits MEK-induced activation of Elk-1 (Fig.5 C). Treatment of ECV 304 cells with either the well characterized MEK inhibitor, PD98059, or thalidomide substantially reduced VEGF-R induced signaling, suggesting that thalidomide affects VEGF-R induced angiogenesis, at least in part, through inhibiting the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, treatment with angiostatin or fumagillin had little or no effect on VEGF-R-induced activation of Elk-1, suggesting that their effects are independent of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade. These observations are consistent with a recent report that demonstrated that the actions of angiostatin are independent of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade (50Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Ito N. Anand-Apte B. Soker S. Zetter B. O'Reilly M. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5579-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Our current observations with angiogenesis activators and inhibitors may be related to the ability of caveolin-1 to positively regulate contact inhibition and growth arrest in normal cells (51Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (51Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) that caveolin-1 expression levels are down-regulated in rapidly dividing NIH 3T3 cells and are dramatically up-regulated at confluency. These results suggest that up-regulation of caveolin-1 expression levels may be important to mediate normal contact inhibition and to negatively regulate the activation state of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade and other signaling pathways (51Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In support of these findings, it has been shown that caveolins are most abundantly expressed in terminally differentiated cells such as endothelial cells, adipocytes, and muscle cells and are dramatically up-regulated during adipogenesis and myotube formation (33Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Thus, down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression and caveolae organelles may be a prerequisite for endothelial cell proliferation and, therefore, angiogenesis."

In a mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DBX complemented the function of Ded1p, an essential DEAD box RNA helicase. HCV core protein inhibited the growth of DBX-complemented mutant yeast but not Ded1p-expressing yeast. HCV core protein also inhibited the in vitro translation of capped but not uncapped RNA.

The viral RNA is not capped, and translation occurs via an internal ribosome entry site at the 5′ end of the viral RNA (11Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R.

The mechanism of translation of uncapped viral RNA therefore differs from that used by virtually all cellular mRNAs that are capped at their 5′ ends. The HCV polyprotein is cleaved by both host cell and viral proteases into several smaller polypeptides (7Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Ohkoshi S. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl.

The core protein forms the nucleocapsid of the mature virion, and E1 and E2 are present in the viral envelope. A small polypeptide called P7 is also generated as a result of cleavage at the E2-NS2 junction, but its function is not clear. Four major nonstructural proteins called NS2, NS3, NS4, and NS5 are also generated, two of which, NS4 and NS5, are further processed into smaller polypeptides called NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Most of the nonstructural proteins have enzymatic activities that are critical for viral replication.After cells are infected with a virus, viral proteins can interact with host cell proteins and influence cell physiology. In previous studies, HCV core protein has been shown to bind to lymphotoxin-β receptor and other tumor necrosis factor receptor family members (14Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhu N. Khoshanan A. Schneider R. Matsumoto M. Dennert G.

We now show that HCV core protein binds to a cellular RNA helicase and, in experimental systems, inhibits capped RNA translation. This provides a novel mechanism by which HCV may inhibit mRNA translation in infected cells or recruit a cellular protein to enhance its own replication.DISCUSSIONHCV core protein binds to the human DEAD box protein DBX. DBX rescues the lethal phenotype of ded1-deletion, demonstrating that it can function as a RNA helicase for capped mRNA, replacing the essential yeast DEAD box RNA helicase Ded1p. Our findings that HCV core protein prevents DBX from rescuing ded1-deletion yeast and that it inhibits the translation of capped RNA in vitrostrongly suggest that it may inhibit cellular mRNA translationin vivo. These results, however, cannot establish if translation inhibition occurs as a result of HCV core protein inhibiting DBX RNA helicase activity per se or by an interaction that results in “trapping” DBX at a location near the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where in cannot function properly. Inhibition of host cell mRNA translation could theoretically provide viral RNA molecules with enhanced access to ribosomes and the rest of the protein synthesis machinery of the cell, a phenomenon shared by several different viruses (29Knipe D.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field's Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 273-299Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that high levels of expression of HCV structural and nonstructural proteins is toxic to mammalian cells (30Moradpour D. Kary P. Rice C.M. Blum H.E. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear if this toxicity results from inhibition of host cell translation. Because the development of a robust cell culture system to study HCV has remained elusive, it would be extremely difficult to directly investigate the effects of HCV infection on host cell mRNA translation. Despite these methodological constraints limiting the ability to directly test the hypothesis, our discovery that HCV core binds to DBX and inhibits capped RNA translation in experimental assays suggests that it can similarly inhibit mRNA translation in infected human cells.DEAD box RNA helicases unwind capped mRNA (20Chuang R.-Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.-H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and inhibition of their function should decrease translation of cellular mRNA. Inhibition of DBX function by HCV core protein may only partially inhibit host mRNA translation in mammalian cells because they contain other putative RNA helicases (31Gee S.L. Conboy J.G. Gene. 1994; 140: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, the translation of HCV RNA, which is not capped, utilizes internal ribosome entry sites (11Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A.

Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can be unwound by its own RNA helicase, which is part of the HCV NS3 protein (32Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z.

Caron P.R. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and may proceed without DBX. This hypothetical mechanism is reminiscent of that used by poliovirus, which inhibits translation factor eIF-4F (34Rose J.K. Trachsel H. Leong D. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also has RNA with internal ribosome entry sites (36Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). In cells, eIF-4F exists as a complex with eIF-4B, which has RNA binding activity, and eIF-4A, which is also a DEAD box RNA helicase (37Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). HCV and poliovirus infection may both therefore cause a decrease in the unwinding of capped mRNA in host cells.In addition to inhibiting capped mRNA translation in infected host cells, the interaction between HCV core protein and DBX may play other possible roles, including the recruitment of DBX to participate in HCV replication itself. Recruitment of host cells proteins into virions to enhance viral replication has been demonstrated in other systems. For example, the principal structural protein of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 binds to cyclophilins and recruits cyclophilin A into viral particles, which appears to be necessary for efficient viral replication (38Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 18: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 39Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, recruitment of DBX into HCV particles by binding to core protein may enhance viral replication. This could theoretically occur by DBX altering viral genomic RNA structure in viral particles in newly infected cells. Testing of this hypothesis is limited at the present time because of the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HCV.HCV core protein has also been shown to bind to lymphotoxin-β receptor and other tumor necrosis factor receptor family members (14Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Zhu N. Khoshanan A. Schneider R. Matsumoto M. Dennert G. Ware C. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as ribonucleoprotein K (16Hsieh T.-Y. Matsumoto M. Chou H.-C. Schneider R. Hwang S.B. Lee A.S. Lai M.M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17651-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In our yeast two-hybrid screen, we did not isolate clones for these proteins, possibly because of subtle differences in our bait construct and the different cDNA library we used. The demonstration that other proteins interact with HCV core protein suggests that its expression in cells may have myriad consequences. Other groups (40Ray R.B. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10983-10986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 41Kim D.W. Suzuki R. Harada T. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have also reported that HCV core protein represses transcription from the p53 promoter and other eukaryotic promoters. The overall effect of HCV core protein on cell physiology under natural conditions of infection is, however, difficult to assess at the present time because of lack of a cell culture system for HCV.Finally, it should be noted that the best current treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C are effective in only a minority of patients (42Liang T.J. N. Eng. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1549-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). If interactions between HCV and host cell proteins alter cell survival or enhance viral replication, they could be rational targets for antiviral drug design. Regardless of the physiological significance, the tight binding of any polypeptide to a structural or nonstructural protein of HCV may potentially interfere with viral replication. The identification of polypeptides such as DBX that bind to HCV proteins therefore has implications for the design of compounds which may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reactionwas discovered by cDNA cloning in 1989 and shown to cause chronic liver disease (1Choo Q.-L.

Science. 1989; 244: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). Approximately 4 million Americans and 150 million individuals worldwide are infected with HCV and at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (3Alter M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1995; 15: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 4Mansell C.J. Locarnini S.A. Semin. Liver Dis. 1995; 15: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Mamiya N. Worman H.J.

Because development of a robust cell culture system for HCV infection has remained elusive (6National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1S-156SPubMed Google Scholar), extremely little is known about HCV-host cell interactions and how they influence cell physiology or viral replication. HCV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus and a member of theFlaviviridae family (1Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M.

Once HCV infects cells, the positive, single-stranded RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein of 3010 to 3033 amino acids, depending upon the strain (7Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M.

The viral RNA is not capped, and translation occurs via an internal ribosome entry site at the 5′ end of the viral RNA (11Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of translation of uncapped viral RNA therefore differs from that used by virtually all cellular mRNAs that are capped at their 5′ ends. The HCV polyprotein is cleaved by both host cell and viral proteases into several smaller polypeptides (7Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Ohkoshi S. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 8Choo Q.-L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby R. Barr P.J.

Virol. 1993; 74: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The major structural proteins are a core protein and two envelope proteins called E1 and E2. The core protein forms the nucleocapsid of the mature virion, and E1 and E2 are present in the viral envelope. A small polypeptide called P7 is also generated as a result of cleavage at the E2-NS2 junction, but its function is not clear. Four major nonstructural proteins called NS2, NS3, NS4, and NS5 are also generated, two of which, NS4 and NS5, are further processed into smaller polypeptides called NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Most of the nonstructural proteins have enzymatic activities that are critical for viral replication. After cells are infected with a virus, viral proteins can interact with host cell proteins and influence cell physiology. In previous studies, HCV core protein has been shown to bind to lymphotoxin-β receptor and other tumor necrosis factor receptor family members (14Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhu N. Khoshanan A. Schneider R. Matsumoto M. Dennert G. Ware C. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated form of HCV core protein also interacts with ribonucleoprotein K in the nucleus (16Hsieh T.-Y. Matsumoto M. Chou H.-C. Schneider R. Hwang S.B. Lee A.S. Lai M.M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17651-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We now show that HCV core protein binds to a cellular RNA helicase and, in experimental systems, inhibits capped RNA translation. This provides a novel mechanism by which HCV may inhibit mRNA translation in infected cells or recruit a cellular protein to enhance its own replication. DISCUSSIONHCV core protein binds to the human DEAD box protein DBX. DBX rescues the lethal phenotype of ded1-deletion, demonstrating that it can function as a RNA helicase for capped mRNA, replacing the essential yeast DEAD box RNA helicase Ded1p. Our findings that HCV core protein prevents DBX from rescuing ded1-deletion yeast and that it inhibits the translation of capped RNA in vitrostrongly suggest that it may inhibit cellular mRNA translationin vivo. These results, however, cannot establish if translation inhibition occurs as a result of HCV core protein inhibiting DBX RNA helicase activity per se or by an interaction that results in “trapping” DBX at a location near the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where in cannot function properly. Inhibition of host cell mRNA translation could theoretically provide viral RNA molecules with enhanced access to ribosomes and the rest of the protein synthesis machinery of the cell, a phenomenon shared by several different viruses (29Knipe D.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field's Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 273-299Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that high levels of expression of HCV structural and nonstructural proteins is toxic to mammalian cells (30Moradpour D. Kary P. Rice C.M. Blum H.E. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear if this toxicity results from inhibition of host cell translation. Because the development of a robust cell culture system to study HCV has remained elusive, it would be extremely difficult to directly investigate the effects of HCV infection on host cell mRNA translation. Despite these methodological constraints limiting the ability to directly test the hypothesis, our discovery that HCV core binds to DBX and inhibits capped RNA translation in experimental assays suggests that it can similarly inhibit mRNA translation in infected human cells.DEAD box RNA helicases unwind capped mRNA (20Chuang R.-Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.-H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and inhibition of their function should decrease translation of cellular mRNA. Inhibition of DBX function by HCV core protein may only partially inhibit host mRNA translation in mammalian cells because they contain other putative RNA helicases (31Gee S.L. Conboy J.G.

This hypothetical mechanism is reminiscent of that used by poliovirus, which inhibits translation factor eIF-4F (34Rose J.K. Trachsel H. Leong D. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

HCV core protein has also been shown to bind to lymphotoxin-β receptor and other tumor necrosis factor receptor family members (14Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17651-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In our yeast two-hybrid screen, we did not isolate clones for these proteins, possibly because of subtle differences in our bait construct and the different cDNA library we used. The demonstration that other proteins interact with HCV core protein suggests that its expression in cells may have myriad consequences. Other groups (40Ray R.B. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10983-10986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 41Kim D.W. Suzuki R. Harada T. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have also reported that HCV core protein represses transcription from the p53 promoter and other eukaryotic promoters. The overall effect of HCV core protein on cell physiology under natural conditions of infection is, however, difficult to assess at the present time because of lack of a cell culture system for HCV. Finally, it should be noted that the best current treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C are effective in only a minority of patients (42Liang T.J. N. Eng. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1549-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). If interactions between HCV and host cell proteins alter cell survival or enhance viral replication, they could be rational targets for antiviral drug design. Regardless of the physiological significance, the tight binding of any polypeptide to a structural or nonstructural protein of HCV may potentially interfere with viral replication. The identification of polypeptides such as DBX that bind to HCV proteins therefore has implications for the design of compounds which may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

We show that in the presence of the physiological sulfhydryl glutathione nitric oxide modifies the two cysteine residues contained in the DNA binding module of c-Jun in a selective and distinct way. Although nitric oxide induced the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge between cysteine residues in the leucine zipper site of c-Jun monomers, this same radical directed the covalent incorporation of stoichiometric amounts of glutathione to a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding site of the protein. We found that covalent dimerization of c-Jun apparently did not affect its DNA binding activity, whereas the formation of a mixed disulfide with glutathione correlated well with the inhibition of transcription factor binding to DNA. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that nitric oxide-inducedS-glutathionylation and inhibition of c-Jun involves the formation of S-nitrosoglutathione. In conclusion, our results support the reversible formation of a mixed disulfide between glutathione and c-Jun as a potential mechanism by which nitrosative stress may be transduced into a functional response at the level of transcription.

Accumulating evidence suggests that NO may play a role in the redox control of transcription by modulating the DNA binding activity of transcriptional activators such as OxyR (6Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), nuclear factor-κB (7Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and c-Myb (8Brendeford E.M. Andersson K.B. Gabrielsen O.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) through S-nitrosylation of redox-sensitive thiols. Furthermore, NO has been reported to inhibit DNA binding of the transcription factor AP-1 in cerebellar granular cells (9Tabuchi A. Sano K. Oh E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and to be involved in the post-transcriptional attenuation of AP-1 during NO-induced neuronal cell death (10Tabuchi A. Oh E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Of interest, interferon γ was shown to induce a down-regulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity in human brain-derived cells. This phenomenon is associated with the development of neuroinflammatory diseases and was found to be due to cytokine-mediated induction of NO synthase in these cells (11Conant K. Ahmed U. Schwartz J.P. Major E.O. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 88: 39-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding by NO remain to be established. A recent study with purified c-Jun and c-Fos, which constitute the transcriptional activator AP-1, indicates that NO inhibits the DNA binding activity of AP-1 by modifying cysteine residues in the DNA-binding site of these proteins through as yet unknown mechanisms (12Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings fit well with previous studies on truncated Fos and Jun constructs which mapped redox regulation of AP-1 to a single conserved cysteine residue located in the basic DNA-binding site of c-Fos and c-Jun (13Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 14Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of this critical cysteine residue by chemical-reducing agents such as DTT and 2-mercaptoethanol or by the DNA repair enzyme Ref-1 has been shown to convert the inactive and presumably oxidized form of c-Fos and c-Jun into an active state that is permissive for DNA binding (13Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 15Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In vitro, oxidation of c-Jun and concomitant inhibition of its DNA binding activity occur rapidly when the concentration of the reducing agent in the incubation medium (e.g. DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol) falls below 0.2 mm (16Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The conclusion that NO inhibits AP-1 DNA binding by specifically reacting with cysteine residues in c-Jun and c-Fos, however, was reached from the observation that NO concentrations >0.1 mm inactivate the transcription factor in the presence of low concentrations (0.1 mm) of the dithiol DTT (12Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Given the high capacity of NO to decrease thiol levels byS-nitrosylation and oxidation (17DeMaster E.G. Quast B.J. Redfern B. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), this raises the question if the observed effects of NO on Jun/Fos DNA binding are in fact directly related to a protein modification by NO such asS-nitrosylation or can be attributed to the oxidation of the transcription factor as described by Curran and co-workers (13Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 16Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as a consequence of NO-induced thiol depletion. To address this issue, we analyzed purified recombinant c-Jun DNA binding domains for NO-induced thiol modifications and concomitant changes in DNA binding activity. In our in vitro system, special emphasis was given to the role of the reduced sulfhydryl compound GSH, which is present in concentrations of 1–10 mm in mammalian cells (18Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5547) Google Scholar). GSH not only protects oxidant-sensitive protein thiols against oxidative damage (19Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar, 20Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) but also critically determines the biological activity of NO (21Scharfstein J.S. Keaney J.F. Slivka A. Welch G.N. Vita J.A.

We show here that in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of GSH, NO inhibits c-Jun DNA binding in vitro by specifically targeting the formation of a mixed disulfide with GSH to a conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding site of the transcription factor. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that GSNO, which is formed by the reaction of NO with GSH, may mediate the NO-dependent S-glutathionylation of c-Jun. GSH (free acid, SigmaUltra) and GSSG (free acid, SigmaUltra) were purchased from Sigma and Aldrich. DEA/NO and GSNO were from Alexis Biochemicals. Yeast glutathione reductase (120 units/mg) was provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Stock solutions of [3H]GSH were prepared at a final concentration of 20 mm by the addition of 10 volumes of a freshly prepared solution of 22 mm unlabeled GSH (free acid, SigmaUltra) in H2O to 1 volume of tritium-labeled glutathione ([3H]GSH, 45–50 Ci/mmol, ∼0.02 mm, NEN Life Science Products) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Throughout the text, this preparation of the radiolabeled thiol will be referred to as [3H]GSH. As determined by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis (24Reed D. Babson J. Beatty P. Brodie A. Ellis W. Potter D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar) and in agreement with the specifications provided by the manufacturer, the purity of [3H]GSH was ≥98%. The only detectable contamination was GSSG (≤2%). The insert coding for the DNA binding domain of human c-Jun, corresponding to amino acids 223–327 of the translated sequence with the GenBankTM accession number J04111, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into theBamHI-HindIII site of the expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). The obtained hexahistidine fusion protein, which encodes for one cysteine in the basic DNA-binding site (amino acid 269) and a second cysteine in the leucine zipper (amino acid 320) of c-Jun, was designated as CC-Jun. Cysteine 269 to serine (SC-Jun) and cysteine 320 to serine (CS-Jun) mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis and cloned into theBamHI-HindIII site of the expression vector pQE-30. The obtained c-Jun plasmids were transformed into competentEscherichia coli (M15[pRep4], Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Recombinant clones were verified by restriction analysis and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography as described (16Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The obtained protein preparation was dialyzed excessively against a 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and concentrated up to ∼0.5 mm using Vivapore 20 concentrators (Vivascience). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Purity of the proteins was estimated to be >95% as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS gels. c-Jun DNA binding domains (10 μm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (buffer A), and 3 mm GSH in the absence and presence of DEA/NO or GSNO. Reactions were stopped by the addition of iodoacetamide (50 mm) and incubation for further 30 min at room temperature. Samples (4 μg of protein) were subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE on discontinuous Tris/glycine slab gels (7 × 8 cm), which contained acrylamide and bisacrylamide at final concentrations of 16 and 0.1% (w/v), respectively (25Hardison R. Chalkley R. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue R-250 and analyzed by densitometry. c-Jun DNA binding domains (10 μm) were incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml at 37 °C in buffer A containing 3 mm [3H]GSH (∼3 × 106 cpm) in the absence and presence of DEA/NO or GSNO. For some experiments, incubations were performed in the presence of [3H]GSNO, which was prepared from [3H]GSH by nitrosation with acidified nitrite (26Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), or in the presence of 1 mm NADPH and 0.6 units of yeast glutathione reductase. To isolate the glutathionylated protein by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.9 ml of 10% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and incubation on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. Subsequent to washing the precipitated protein three times with 0.9 ml of 10% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, the protein pellet was dissolved by treatment with 0.1 ml of 0.5n NaOH for 20 min at 70 °C and assayed for incorporation of [3H]GSH by liquid scintillation counting. Results were corrected for protein recovery (68 ± 7%, mean ± S.E.,n = 6) and blank values (≤0.1 mol of radiolabeled GSH per mol of protein), which were determined as non-DTT-releasable radiolabel by treating the [3H]GSH-protein adduct for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 mm DTT prior to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. To study the reversibility of GSNO-induced c-Jun glutathionylation, c-Jun DNA binding domains (10 μm CC-Jun) were incubated in a final volume of 0.8 ml for 1 h at 37 °C in buffer A containing 3 mm [3H]GSH (∼3 × 107 cpm per ml) and 1 mm GSNO prior to isolation of the S-glutathionylated protein by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 columns (NAP-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and stoichiometric (0.8–1.1 mol of [3H]GSH per mol of protein) incorporation of [3H]GSH was verified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described above. To study dethiolation of c-Jun, the [3H]GSH-labeled protein was incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml at 37 °C in buffer A in the absence and presence of 3 mm [3H]GSH (∼3 × 107cpm per ml) or 10 mm DTT. After 1 h, samples were analyzed for [3H]GSH incorporation as described above. GSH-induced dethiolation was expressed in percent of the radioactivity that was released from the [3H]GSH-labeled protein by 10 mm DTT. c-Jun DNA binding domains (10 μm) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A, which contained 3 mm GSH, in the absence and presence of DEA/NO or GSNO. For the determination of DNA binding activity by EMSA, 2-μl aliquots of the preincubation mixture were diluted into a final volume of 18 μl of buffer A, which additionally contained 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and where indicated 1 mm DTT. Finally, 2 μl of the 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-GGG CTT GAT GAG TCA GCC GGA CC-3′) were added, and the samples were incubated for further 30 min prior to electrophoresis at 200 V on pre-electrophoresed 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels with 22 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA as running buffer. Gels were dried, visualized by autoradiography, and analyzed by densitometry. To investigate the reversibility of GSNO-induced c-Jun inactivation, c-Jun DNA binding domains (10 μm CC-Jun) were incubated in a final volume of 0.8 ml for 1 h at 37 °C in buffer A containing 3 mm GSH and 1 mm GSNO prior to isolation of the S-glutathionylated protein by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 columns. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and aliquots (2 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 1 mm GSNO with increasing concentrations of GSH or 1 mm DTT in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer A containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. Samples were cooled to room temperature, subjected to electrophoresis on non-denaturing gels, and the gels analyzed by autoradiography as described above. DNA binding activity of CC-Jun was quantified by densitometry and expressed as percent of maximal DNA binding of the DTT-reactivated reduced protein which was determined in the presence of 1 mm DTT. Nitrite concentrations were determined photometrically by the Griess reaction (27Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). GSNO concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.75 mm−1 cm−1(28Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). GSSG concentrations were determined by a coupled assay as glutathione reductase-dependent oxidation of NADPH (29Sies H. Summer K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (0.1–0.7 ml) were assayed for GSSG in a final volume of 1 ml of a 20 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 0.05–0.2 mm NADPH by addition of 0.6 units of yeast glutathione reductase (120 units/ml) and monitoring the absorbance decrease at 340 nm. NADPH consumption was quantified using an extinction coefficient of 6.34 mm−1 cm−1. To study the effect of a GSH-regenerating system on NO-induced oxidation of GSH to GSSG, GSH (3 mm) was co-incubated with DEA/NO (1 mm) and CC-Jun (10 μm) in 0.5 ml of buffer A for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 6 units/ml glutathione reductase and 1 mm NADPH. Subsequently, the reductase was removed by rapid filtration through microfilters (cut-off, 10 kDa), and aliquots of the filtrate were assayed for GSSG as described above. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. with the number (n) of experiments in parenthesis. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the experimental data by the Hill equation. Statistical analysis of data was performed by Student′s t test and linear regression analysis. Incubations of wild type c-Jun DNA binding domains (CC-Jun) in the presence of 3 mm GSH and increasing concentrations of the NO donor DEA/NO resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA binding activity of the protein (Fig. 1). Concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm of the NO donor inhibited CC-Jun DNA binding to 94 ± 4, 70 ± 8, 44 ± 3, and 13 ± 3% (n = 4–9) of untreated controls, respectively. DNA binding activity was restored by DTT, suggesting that the modification of a cysteine residue may be involved in the NO-mediated inhibition of CC-Jun. The homodimeric c-Jun DNA binding domain contains two pairs of cysteine residues, one located in its basic DNA-binding site (Cys-269) and one located in the leucine zipper-like subunit interface (Cys-320). To assign the inhibitory effect of NO to one of these two pairs of cysteine residues, we compared the effects of NO on the DNA binding activity of wild type and mutant c-Jun constructs. As shown in Fig.2, NO clearly inhibited DNA binding activity of CC-Jun (87 ± 3% inhibition, n = 9), whereas DNA binding of the mutant with a cysteine to serine mutation in the DNA-binding site (SC-Jun) was not significantly affected (8 ± 10% inhibition, n = 5). On the other hand, mutation of the cysteine in the leucine zipper domain of the c-Jun DNA binding domain (CS-Jun) did not attenuate the inhibitory effect of DEA/NO (76 ± 11% inhibition, n = 5). These data, therefore, render it likely that NO-mediated inhibition of c-Jun DNA binding involves the modification of a single cysteine residue (Cys-269) in the DNA-binding site of the protein. The formation of disulfide bonds between subunits of the AP-1 transcription factor, which is composed by Jun/Jun homodimers or heterodimers between Jun and Fos proteins, was suggested as one potential mechanism by which NO might inhibit AP-1 DNA binding activity (12Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, NO released from 1 mm of the NO donor DEA/NO in the presence of 3 mm GSH in fact induced an SDS-resistant dimerization of wild type c-Jun DNA-binding subunits (CC-Jun). Under these conditions, >70% of CC-Jun were converted into covalently linked dimers as determined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The reversibility of this effect by DTT suggests the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge between one or both of the two cysteines located in the DNA binding module of c-Jun monomers. A comparison of cysteine to serine mutants shows that SC-Jun but not CS-Jun was converted into disulfide-linked dimers demonstrating that NO specifically targets disulfide formation to cysteine 320 in the leucine zipper domain of c-Jun. Since this cysteine residue is apparently not involved in the NO-mediated loss of c-Jun function (see Fig. 2), these data make intermolecular disulfide formation a highly unlikely mechanism for the inhibition of the transcription factor by NO. An alternative mechanism by which protein thiols may transduce oxidative stress into a post-translational modification and functional response is the formation of a mixed disulfide with GSH (30Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar,31Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To investigate if this mechanism may be involved in the NO-induced inhibition of c-Jun, we exposed purified c-Jun DNA binding domains to 1 mm of the NO donor DEA/NO in the presence of 3 mm3H-labeled GSH, and we isolated the covalent [3H]GSH-protein adduct by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. As shown in Fig.4 A, DEA/NO induced a time-dependent incorporation of the radiolabel with an apparent half-time of ∼5 min and a maximal incorporation of 0.8–0.9 mol of [3H]GSH per mol of CC-Jun (closed symbols). Control incubations in the absence of DEA/NO (open symbols) did not yield any significant amounts of protein bound [3H]GSH. DTT-labile incorporation of the radiolabel (see “Experimental Procedures”) suggests binding of [3H]GSH to the protein via a disulfide bond. Fig. 4 B shows the dependence of [3H]GSH incorporation on the concentration of DEA/NO. At concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm, DEA/NO induced binding of 0.05 ± 0.02, 0.28 ± 0.11, 0.62 ± 0.06, and 0.81 ± 0.08 mol of [3H]GSH (n = 3–6) per mol of protein, respectively. Half-maximal mixed disulfide formation was estimated to occur at DEA/NO concentrations of ∼300 μm. According to a recently published mathematical model (32Schmidt K. Desch W. Klatt P. Kukovetz W.R. Mayer B. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the steady state concentration of NO under these conditions, i.e. 300 μm DEA/NO at 37 °C and pH 7.4, reaches a peak level of approximately 20 μm at ∼0.6 min and drops exponentially to submicromolar concentrations within 25 min. As shown in Fig. 4 C, GSH incorporation into CC-Jun was almost completely abolished by a cysteine 269 to serine mutation (0.13 ± 0.05 mol [3H]GSH/mol SC-Jun,n = 5), whereas a cysteine 320 to serine mutation virtually did not affect the degree of S-thiolation (0.87 ± 0.01 mol [3H]GSH/mol CS-Jun,n = 3). These data, therefore, demonstrate that NO specifically targets the formation of a mixed disulfide to a single cysteine residue in the DNA-binding site of c-Jun (Cys-269). The finding that this cysteine residue is involved in the NO-induced inhibition of CC-Jun (see Fig. 2) suggests that NO-inducedS-glutathionylation mediates the inhibitory effect of NO. This was confirmed by linear regression analysis of data from DNA binding (Fig. 1) and [3H]GSH incorporation (Fig.4 B) experiments, which yields a highly significant (p = 0.01) inverse linear correlation between relative DNA binding activity of CC-Jun and DEA/NO-mediatedS-glutathionylation of the protein (intercept, 1.00; slope, −1.01; r = 0.99). Various mechanisms have been suggested to account for the formation of a mixed disulfide between GSH and protein thiols (33Thomas J.A. Chai Y.-C. Jung C.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GSSG may directly S-thiolate proteins via a thiol/disulfide exchange mechanism. Dependent on the protein examined half-maximal glutathionylation was observed at GSH/GSSG ratios ranging from 27 to 10−5 (34Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). NO was reported to oxidize GSH to GSSG under anaerobic conditions, at low GSH/NO ratios, or via a secondary reaction of GSNO with GSH (22Singh S.P. Wishnok J.S. Keshive M. Deen W.M. Tannenbaum S.R.

In our experimental system, GSSG concentrations were 15 ± 4 μm(n = 6) under control conditions, i.e. in the presence of 3 mm GSH and absence of an NO donor (TableI). During a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, DEA/NO at concentrations of up to 500 μmoxidized less than 3% of the total amount of GSH (3 mm at t = 0) to GSSG. At a concentration of 1 mm, DEA/NO converted ∼16% of GSH into GSSG, which results in a decrease of the GSH/GSSG ratio to values <10. These data raise the possibility that an NO-induced shift in the GSH/GSSG ratio may mediate c-Jun mixed disulfide formation. To address this issue, we analyzed CC-Jun for NO-induced [3H]GSH incorporation under conditions where GSSG was recycled continuously to GSH by glutathione reductase (Fig.5). In the presence of the GSH-regenerating system, NO-dependent GSSG formation was almost completely suppressed (20 ± 11 μm,n = 3) as compared with controls (241 ± 13 μm, n = 3). This ∼10-fold decrease in GSSG, which resulted in a >15-fold increase of the GSH/GSSG ratio from <10 to ∼130, did not significantly (p > 0.5) affect mixed disulfide formation (0.76 ± 0.04, n = 3versus 0.81 ± 0.08, n = 5). Thus, these data argue against the involvement of GSSG in the NO-inducedS-glutathionylation of c-Jun.Table INitrite, GSSG, and GSNO formation in incubations of GSH with DEA/NOConditionNitriteGSSGGSNOμmControl<115 ± 4<1DEA/NO 109 ± 315 ± 54 ± 1100119 ± 1017 ± 249 ± 1500585 ± 3339 ± 2257 ± 1310001043 ± 91241 ± 13464 ± 24GSH (3 mm) was incubated in the absence (control) and presence of increasing concentrations of DEA/NO at 37 °C in a 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40.

After 60 min, aliquots were assayed for nitrite, GSSG, and GSNO as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean values ± S.E. of 3–6 experiments.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15801-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, NO reacts with oxygen to yield the nitrosating species N2O3. In the presence of an excess of GSH, hydrolysis of N2O3 to nitrite is competitive with the rate of its reaction with GSH to GSNO (35Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol.

The members of the NF-κB family in mammalian cells include the proto-oncogene c-Rel, p50/p105 (NFκB1), p65 (RelA), p52/p100 (NFκB2), and RelB. All of these proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (5Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 6Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In most cells, Rel family members form hetero- and homodimers with distinct specificities in various combinations. A common feature of the regulation of the NF-κB family is their sequestration in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes with a class of inhibitory molecules known as IκBs (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 7Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Treatment of cells with a variety of inducers such as phorbol esters, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) results in dissociation of the cytoplasmic complexes and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (8Siebenlist U.

The dissociation of NF-κB·IκB complexes is known to be triggered by the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB proteins (10Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D.

This exposes the nuclear localization sequence in the remaining NF-κB heterodimer, leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of NF-κB to DNA regulatory elements of the target genes. The p65 subunit is a major component of NF-κB complexes and is responsible for trans-activation (13Ruben S.M. Dillon P.J. Schreck R. Henkel T. Chen C.-H. Maher M. Baeuerle P.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Here we report the identification, cloning, and characterization of a novel RelA-binding protein, called RAI for “RelA-associated inhibitor.” The RAI cDNA encodes a protein with high structural homology to the C-terminal 200 amino acid segments of 53BP2, containing four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain that are known to be involved in specific protein-protein interactions. We confirmed the interaction between p65 and RAI in vitro using the bacterially expressed fusion proteins and in vivo using immunoprecipitation/Western blot assay. We demonstrate that RAI inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription through interfering with its DNA binding activity of NF-κB.DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to identify novel proteins capable of interacting with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a protein named RAI in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We confirmed the interaction in vitro using GST pull-down assay and in vivo using immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays (Figs. 1and 3). Amino acid sequence analyses of RAI revealed that it resembles 53BP2 in that they both contain four ankyrin repeats and an SH3, as noted earlier, with 52% amino acid identity with 53BP2 at their C termini. However, RAI could not bind to p53 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Table I). The RAI, when overexpressed, located predominantly in the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 5 B) and inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression, whereas the p53-dependent gene expression was essentially unaffected (Fig. 6). The direct interaction between RAI and p65 most likely contributes to the inhibition of NF-κB activity through interfering with its NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 7). Thus, RAI is a novel NF-κB-binding protein with a specific repression activity of transcription.The co-localization of both p65 and RAI in the transfected cells as visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5, J andK) supported the interaction of both proteins in vivo (Fig. 3). The presence of ankyrin repeats and the SH3 domain in the C-terminal region of RAI may contribute to its nuclear localization. As it was recently reported, the ankyrin domains of diverse proteins such as IκB-α and 53BP2 contain functional nuclear import signal (25Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Haainak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal of RAI was also able to localize in the nucleus (Fig. 5 D). However, it is still an open question as to whether the endogenous RAI shows the same subcellular distribution as the fusion protein used in this study.All four independent RAI clones isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen contained the C terminus of RAI including the ankyrin repeats, and the SH3 domain suggested that the C-terminal region of RAI is responsible for physical interaction with p65. Although the C terminus of RAI is highly homologous with that of 53BP2, some amino acid residues of 53BP2 that were shown to be involved in binding to p53 (23Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,24Thukral S.K. Blain G.C. Chang K.K.H. Fields S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8315-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) differ from RAI. The fact that RAI failed to bind p53 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table I) and that RAI showed no significant effect on p53-dependent gene expression (Fig. 6 B) suggested that this region might contain an important determinant for specific interaction.The tissue distribution of RAI gene expression was highly restricted with high expression levels in heart, placenta, and prostate while p65 expression is observed in most of the tissues examined (data not shown). Two RAI messages of different sizes were detected (Fig. 4). DNA sequencing of the two cDNAs isolated from plaque hybridization revealed the same ORF but the 5′ sequences differ in length. It is likely that RAI generates two transcripts with different 5′-untranslated regions, probably by alternative splicing. DNA data base search revealed that the partial RAI gene is localized in the 19q13.2-q13.3 region which contains the three DNA repair genes XRCC1, ERCC2 (excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair group 2), and ERCC1 (26Lamerdin J.E. Stilwagen S.A. Ramirez M.H. Stubbs L. Carrano A.V. Genomics. 1996; 34: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The locus of RAI is also near the locus of IκB-β which is localized in 19q13.1 (27Okamoto T. Ono T. Hori M. Yang J.-P. Tetsuka T. Kawabe T. Sonta S. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 82: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These pieces of information suggested that RAI might have been generated from IκB-β, or vice versa, and acquired tissue-specific expression during evolution. We do not currently know the biological implication of restricted expression of RAI.It is noted that RAI was a second frequently isolated p65-binding gene in our yeast two-hybrid screen. The nuclear localization of RAI differs from that of IκB family members in that most of them are cytoplasmic proteins (7Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Brown K. Franzoso G. Baldi L. Carlson L. Mills L. Lin Y.C. Gerstberger S. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting their different regulation mechanisms despite structural similarity in their C termini. At least seven mammalian IκB molecules have been identified with distinct and overlapping inhibitory specificities (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 30Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A.

Cell. 1991; 64: 961-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Although little is known about how NF-κB selectively bind various IκB proteins, it is hypothesized that cell-specific controls regulate interactions of the various IκB and NF-κB (32Beg A.A. Baldwin A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 33Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). All the IκB proteins contains several consecutive ankyrin repeats which are essential for interaction with NF-κB. RAI contains four consecutive ankyrin repeats at its C terminus, however, no PEST-like region (34.Rogers, S., Wells, R., and Rechsteiner, M. (1986) 234,Science 364–368.Google Scholar) responsible for the degradation of IκB proteins was observed for RAI. It is proposed that the cytoplasmic/nuclear partitioning of NF-κB is delicately balanced by the concentrations of these proteins and by its relative affinities to IκB family proteins (35Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Such multiplicity of regulatory molecules may render different cell types with distinct susceptibilities to various signals leading to the NF-κB activation cascade (32Beg A.A. Baldwin A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 36Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Taken together, our findings provide evidence of a novel NF-κB inhibitor RAI with functional similarity to IκB proteins. It is known that p65 directly interacts with other proteins other than the IκB family, including p202 (37Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), CREB-binding protein/p300 (38Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), Stat 6 (39Shen C.-H. Stavnezer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3395-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TAFII105 (40Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which either suppress or activate NF-κB. It is possible that a variety of proteins interacting with NF-κB are involved in a coordinate regulation of its activity and in either tissue-specific or nonspecific manner. Our results suggested that RAI might play an alternative role in controlling NF-κB activation by directly binding to p65 most probably in the nucleus. The mechanism and the biological significance of the inhibition of NF-κB activity by RAI should be further explored. It is intriguing to speculate that these different inhibitory molecules may control the regulation of NF-κB by binding in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The restricted RAI tissue distribution may provide evidence for tissue-specific regulation of NF-κB.

DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to identify novel proteins capable of interacting with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a protein named RAI in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We confirmed the interaction in vitro using GST pull-down assay and in vivo using immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays (Figs. 1and 3). Amino acid sequence analyses of RAI revealed that it resembles 53BP2 in that they both contain four ankyrin repeats and an SH3, as noted earlier, with 52% amino acid identity with 53BP2 at their C termini. However, RAI could not bind to p53 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Table I). The RAI, when overexpressed, located predominantly in the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 5 B) and inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression, whereas the p53-dependent gene expression was essentially unaffected (Fig. 6). The direct interaction between RAI and p65 most likely contributes to the inhibition of NF-κB activity through interfering with its NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 7). Thus, RAI is a novel NF-κB-binding protein with a specific repression activity of transcription.The co-localization of both p65 and RAI in the transfected cells as visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5, J andK) supported the interaction of both proteins in vivo (Fig. 3). The presence of ankyrin repeats and the SH3 domain in the C-terminal region of RAI may contribute to its nuclear localization. As it was recently reported, the ankyrin domains of diverse proteins such as IκB-α and 53BP2 contain functional nuclear import signal (25Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Haainak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal of RAI was also able to localize in the nucleus (Fig. 5 D). However, it is still an open question as to whether the endogenous RAI shows the same subcellular distribution as the fusion protein used in this study.All four independent RAI clones isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen contained the C terminus of RAI including the ankyrin repeats, and the SH3 domain suggested that the C-terminal region of RAI is responsible for physical interaction with p65. Although the C terminus of RAI is highly homologous with that of 53BP2, some amino acid residues of 53BP2 that were shown to be involved in binding to p53 (23Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,24Thukral S.K. Blain G.C. Chang K.K.H. Fields S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8315-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) differ from RAI. The fact that RAI failed to bind p53 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table I) and that RAI showed no significant effect on p53-dependent gene expression (Fig. 6 B) suggested that this region might contain an important determinant for specific interaction.The tissue distribution of RAI gene expression was highly restricted with high expression levels in heart, placenta, and prostate while p65 expression is observed in most of the tissues examined (data not shown). Two RAI messages of different sizes were detected (Fig. 4). DNA sequencing of the two cDNAs isolated from plaque hybridization revealed the same ORF but the 5′ sequences differ in length. It is likely that RAI generates two transcripts with different 5′-untranslated regions, probably by alternative splicing. DNA data base search revealed that the partial RAI gene is localized in the 19q13.2-q13.3 region which contains the three DNA repair genes XRCC1, ERCC2 (excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair group 2), and ERCC1 (26Lamerdin J.E. Stilwagen S.A. Ramirez M.H. Stubbs L. Carrano A.V. Genomics. 1996; 34: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The locus of RAI is also near the locus of IκB-β which is localized in 19q13.1 (27Okamoto T. Ono T. Hori M. Yang J.-P. Tetsuka T. Kawabe T. Sonta S. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 82: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These pieces of information suggested that RAI might have been generated from IκB-β, or vice versa, and acquired tissue-specific expression during evolution. We do not currently know the biological implication of restricted expression of RAI.It is noted that RAI was a second frequently isolated p65-binding gene in our yeast two-hybrid screen. The nuclear localization of RAI differs from that of IκB family members in that most of them are cytoplasmic proteins (7Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Brown K. Franzoso G. Baldi L. Carlson L. Mills L. Lin Y.C. Gerstberger S. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting their different regulation mechanisms despite structural similarity in their C termini. At least seven mammalian IκB molecules have been identified with distinct and overlapping inhibitory specificities (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 30Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A.

Cell. 1991; 64: 961-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Although little is known about how NF-κB selectively bind various IκB proteins, it is hypothesized that cell-specific controls regulate interactions of the various IκB and NF-κB (32Beg A.A. Baldwin A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 33Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). All the IκB proteins contains several consecutive ankyrin repeats which are essential for interaction with NF-κB. RAI contains four consecutive ankyrin repeats at its C terminus, however, no PEST-like region (34.Rogers, S., Wells, R., and Rechsteiner, M. (1986) 234,Science 364–368.Google Scholar) responsible for the degradation of IκB proteins was observed for RAI. It is proposed that the cytoplasmic/nuclear partitioning of NF-κB is delicately balanced by the concentrations of these proteins and by its relative affinities to IκB family proteins (35Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Such multiplicity of regulatory molecules may render different cell types with distinct susceptibilities to various signals leading to the NF-κB activation cascade (32Beg A.A. Baldwin A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 36Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Taken together, our findings provide evidence of a novel NF-κB inhibitor RAI with functional similarity to IκB proteins. It is known that p65 directly interacts with other proteins other than the IκB family, including p202 (37Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), CREB-binding protein/p300 (38Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which either suppress or activate NF-κB. It is possible that a variety of proteins interacting with NF-κB are involved in a coordinate regulation of its activity and in either tissue-specific or nonspecific manner. Our results suggested that RAI might play an alternative role in controlling NF-κB activation by directly binding to p65 most probably in the nucleus. The mechanism and the biological significance of the inhibition of NF-κB activity by RAI should be further explored. It is intriguing to speculate that these different inhibitory molecules may control the regulation of NF-κB by binding in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The restricted RAI tissue distribution may provide evidence for tissue-specific regulation of NF-κB.

Antibodies raised against peptide sequences within MUC2 revealed that virtually all of this mucin occurs in the insoluble glycoprotein complex. In addition, reduction released a 120-kDa C-terminal MUC2 fragment, showing that proteolytic cleavage in this domain may occur and leave the fragment attached to the complex via disulfide bonds. The variable number tandem repeat region and the irregular repeat domain were isolated after trypsin digestion and shown to have molecular weights of 930,000 and 180,000, respectively, suggesting a molecular weight for the entire MUC2 monomer of approximately 1.5 million. Gel chromatography and agarose gel electrophoresis revealed several populations of MUC2 subunits, and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that these have molecular weights on the order of 2 million, 4 million, and 5 million, corresponding to monomers, dimers, and trimers, respectively. Agarose gel electrophoresis of subunits from individuals expressing both a “long” and a “short” MUC2 allele revealed a larger number of populations, consistent with the presence of short and long monomers and oligomers arising from permutations of the two types of monomers.

The mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is protected by a visco-elastic mucus gel formed by high molecular mass (0.5–25 × 106) glycoproteins referred to as mucins. The protein backbones of mucins are heavily substituted with O-linked oligosaccharides attached to serine and/or threonine residues, and these amino acids are, together with proline, typically enriched within so-called mucin domains. Several mucin domains may occur in a single mucin subunit and these regions are flanked by less heavily glycosylated segments of the protein core. Large secreted mucins from the respiratory tract, stomach, and endocervix have been shown to be linear oligomers formed by subunits joined via disulfide bonds (1Carlstedt I. Sheehan J.K. Ciba Found. Symp. 1984; 109: 157-172PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sheehan J.K. Oates K. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the macromolecular architecture of intestinal mucins. The mucin genes MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5B, and MUC6 are expressed in normal human colon (3Gum J.R. Byrd J.C.

MUC2 is believed to be the dominating mucus-forming species in this tissue and is, so far, the only “large” mucin of which the cDNA has been fully sequenced (8Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoprotein contains two mucin domains, which differ in length and are separated by a cysteine-containing region (Fig. 1 A). The longer domain, which is referred to as the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) 1The abbreviations used are: VNTR, variable number tandem repeat; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl region is composed largely of tandemly repeated 23 amino acid peptide units, which vary in number between alleles and are rich in threonine and proline (9Toribara N.

The shorter mucin domain comprises a 347-amino acid-long irregular repeat rich in threonine, serine, and proline. The regions flanking the mucin domains each show a high degree of similarity to the N- and C-terminal cysteine-containing d-domains of the prepro-von Willebrand factor (8Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has therefore been suggested that MUC2 is processed and oligomerized in a fashion similar to this protein. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that dimerization occurs before O-glycosylation and the formation of larger structures (11Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Van Klinken B.J. Einerhand A.W.C. Büller H.A. Dekker J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The temporal relationship between further oligomerization and O-glycosylation is not clear, but data from Sheehan et al. (13Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Howard M. Carlstedt I. Corfield A.P. Paraskeva C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggest that there is a slow assembly of what appear to be fully glycosylated units. Other investigators have identified biosynthetic intermediates that have been interpreted as being O-glycosylated monomers and dimers (14Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the presence of an O-glycosylated monomer population is in apparent conflict with dimerization precedingO-glycosylation. The rat Muc2 homologue has been partially cloned and sequenced (15Xu G. Huan L.-J. Khatri I.A. Wang D. Bennick A. Fahim R.E.F. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5401-5407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shows significant homology to human MUC2, both in the N and C termini (16Ohmori H. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Tsuda T. Gum J.R.

Thiol reduction of rat and human small intestinal mucins gives rise to a 118-kDa glycoprotein, previously referred to as the “link” protein (18Fahim R.E.F. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Mantle M. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, cDNA analysis has shown that this structure is, in fact, part of the MUC2/Muc2 gene (17Xu G. Huan L.-J. Khatri I.A. Sajjan U.S. McCool D. Wang D. Jones C. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the finding is explained by proteolytic cleavage within the C-terminal domain of MUC2/Muc2. Proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal region of rat Muc2 has recently been reported (20Khatri I.A. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mucins isolated from rat small intestine are assembled into a complex that cannot be solubilized by breaking noncovalent bonds; however, reduction of disulfide bonds brings the complex into solution. Two high molecular mass glycopeptides (650 and 335 kDa, respectively) were isolated after reduction and trypsin digestion of the insoluble glycoprotein complex from rat small intestine (21Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J.K. Fransson L.-Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger of these glycopeptides apparently corresponds to a large mucin domain from rat Muc2 (22Hansson G.C. Baeckström D. Carlstedt I. Klinga-Levan K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the human colon, most of the mucins also appear as a glycoprotein complex that is insoluble in guanidinium chloride (23Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Hovenberg H.W. Lindell G. Nordman H. Wickström C.

Here, we have isolated the insoluble glycoprotein complex from human colon and shown that it contains virtually all the MUC2 mucin in this tissue. Reduction of the complex revealed oligomeric forms of the MUC2 monomer that are insensitive to reduction and, in some samples, proteolytic cleavage was found to occur in the C-terminal part of the apoprotein. Preliminary communications have already been published (24Herrmann A. Lindell G. Mårtensson S. Nordman H. Carlstedt I. 4th International Workshop on Carcinoma-associated Mucins, Cambridge. Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London1996: 133Google Scholar,25Herrmann A. Lindell G. Nordman H. Carlstedt I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 535SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diisopropylphosphofluoridate was from Fluka, dithiothreitol was from Merck, and N-ethylmaleimide and trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4., type XIII, treated withl-(1-tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone) were from Sigma. Guanidinium chloride (practical grade) was obtained from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) and was treated with activated charcoal and filtered through an Amicon PM-10 membrane before use. Synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin were purchased from Scandinavian Peptide Synthesis AB (Köping, Sweden). Sephacryl S-500 HR was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from Millipore, the ECL Western detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Ultrapure agarose was from Life Technologies, Inc. Digoxigenin-3-O-succinyl-ε-amido-caproic acid hydrazide and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibodies were bought from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Bovine serum albumin (fraction V, pH 7.0) was from Serva. Density was determined by weighing aliquots. Total sialic acid was measured according to Davies et al. (26Davies J.R. Hovenberg H.W. Lindén C.-J. Howard R. Richardson P.S. Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with a further modification to allow alkali treatment (0.5 m NaOH for 5 min) of the samples on-line. Carbohydrate was determined by slot-blotting aliquots onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by staining with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (27Thornton D.J. Holmes D.F. Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or as periodate oxidisable structures with the Roche Molecular Biochemicals digoxigenin glycan detection system (28Devine P.L. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 160-162PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, samples were coated onto multiwell assay plates overnight at 4 °C, and reactivity was expressed as absorbance at 405 nm. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptides with sequences present in the MUC2 mucin (8Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to raise polyclonal anti-MUC2 antibodies in rabbits. The following peptides were used: CPKDRPIYEEDLKK (LUM2-2 antiserum), located in the D3 domain, NGLQPVRVEDPDGC (LUM2-3 antiserum), located N-terminal to the D4 domain, and CIIKRPDNQHVILKPGDFK (LUM2-4 antiserum), located C-terminal to the D4 domain. Rabbits were injected intracutaneously with 350 μg of peptide conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant. A booster dose (250 μg of peptide conjugate in Freund's incomplete adjuvant) was given after 3 weeks, and the animals were bled 2–3 weeks thereafter. The specificities of the antisera were investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. Samples (100 μl) were coated onto multiwell assay plates overnight at 4 °C followed by blocking (200 μl) with PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were incubated for 1 h with the LUM2-2, LUM2-3, or LUM2-4 antiserum (1:1000) in blocking solution. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (swine anti-rabbit 1:2000 in blocking solution) was added to the wells (1 h at room temperature) and reactivity was detected as absorbance at 405 nm after 1 h of incubation with nitrophenylphosphate (2 mg/ml in 1m diethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2) Tissue sections (4 μm) of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human colonic and small intestinal tissue on Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) were dewaxed, rehydrated, and treated with 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6, at 100 °C in a microwave oven for 2 min. Sections were then treated with 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in water for 30 min at room temperature to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, washed with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline), and blocked with goat serum (1:5) in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. After treatment with the LUM2-2 (1:1000), LUM2-3 (1:1000), or LUM2-4 (1:1000) anti-serum diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h followed by the StreptABComplex/HRP Duet kit (Dako), bound antibodies were visualized using DAB (0.6 mg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Sections were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin. Tissue specimens of human colon with a macroscopically normal appearance, resected during cancer surgery, were frozen and stored at −20 °C until use. The tissue samples were sprinkled with PBS containing 1 mm diisopropylphosphofluoridate and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and thawed on ice, and the mucosa was removed using a microscope slide. This material is referred to as “mucosal scrapings.” Mucus secretions (“reservoir washings” and “reservoir urine”) were obtained from patients with artificial urinary bladders constructed from proximal colonic tissue (29Månsson W. Davidsson T. Colleen S. J. Urol. 1990; 144: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reservoir washings were obtained by irrigating such “neobladders” twice daily with a total of 150 ml of PBS during the first 10 days postoperatively, when the ureters were catheterized and the colonic mucosa exposed to a minimal amount of urine. The samples were transferred to a vessel containing 0.1% w/v NaN3(final concentration) and kept frozen until use. The material was thawed and the gel phase obtained by centrifugation (Beckman J2-MC centrifuge; JA 10 rotor; 5000 rpm; 10 °C; 60 min). Reservoir urine samples were obtained from the urine of patients with established neobladders. Sodium azide was added as above, and samples were stored at 4 °C until centrifugation (Beckman J2-MC centrifuge; JA 20 rotor; 18,000 rpm; 60 min) was performed to recover the mucus gel. Mucosal scrapings and the gel phase from reservoir washings and reservoir urine were gently dispersed with a Dounce homogenizer in 6m guanidinium chloride, 1 mmdiisopropylphosphofluoridate, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and left stirring at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation (Beckman J2-MC centrifuge; JA 20 rotor; 18,000 rpm; 4 °C; 60 min), the soluble material was removed, and the pellets were re-extracted twice, as described above. The final extraction residues (insoluble glycoprotein complex) were solubilized by reduction in 6 mguanidinium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight and then alkylated with 25 mmiodoacetamide in the same buffer. After centrifugation (Beckman J2-MC centrifuge; JA 20 rotor; 18,000 rpm; 4 °C; 60 min), the supernatant was retained. The soluble phases (sols) obtained after the initial centrifugation to recover the mucus gel from the reservoir washings and reservoir urine were concentrated over a PM-10 membrane (Amicon). All fractions (sols, material solubilized with guanidinium chloride during extractions and material obtained after reduction/alkylation of the insoluble glycoprotein complexes) were dialyzed against 6m guanidinium chloride and subjected to isopycnic density gradient centrifugation in 4 m guanidinium chloride/CsCl (Beckman Optima L70 ultracentrifuge (15 °C for 90 h in a 50.2 Ti rotor at 36,000 rpm, starting density 1.37 g/ml or a 70.1Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 65 h). Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and analyzed for density, absorbance at 280 nm, sialic acid (with and without pre-treatment with 0.5 m NaOH), PAS reactivity, and reactivity against the LUM2-2, LUM2-3, and LUM2-4 antisera. Low density material reacting with the LUM2-4 antiserum, partially separated from the major mucin band in the density gradients, was pooled (see Fig. 3 D, peak II) and subjected to gel chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500HR column (1.6 × 50 cm) eluted with 4 m guanidinium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were analyzed for sialic acid, as well as reactivity against the LUM2-2, LUM2-3, and LUM2-4 antisera, and those reacting with the LUM2-4 antibody were pooled, dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and dissolved in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 3% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA and 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Samples (50 and 1.25 μg) were treated with 2% mercaptoethanol (v/v) for 4 min at 100 °C and electrophoresed on a 4–10% gradient polyacrylamide gel (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting for 2 h using a semi-dry blotter (Sartorius). After blotting, the membrane was cut into halves, one of which was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 45% methanol, whereas the other was incubated with the LUM2-4 antiserum as described for agarose gel electrophoresis. The Coomassie-stained band from the 50 μg sample corresponding to that revealed by the LUM2-4 antiserum was cut out and subjected to Edman degradation using a pulsed liquid-phase sequencer model 457A (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 120A analyzer for on-line detection of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. Mucin subunits were pooled after density gradient centrifugation (see Fig. 3 D, peak I) and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-500HR column (1.6 × 50 cm) eluted with 4 m guanidinium chloride buffer at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were analyzed for sialic acid and reactivity against the LUM2-2, LUM2-3, and LUM2-4 antisera. In order to obtain mucin subfractions for further analyses, the procedure was repeated 10 times, and material was pooled as indicated in Fig.7 A (sub-I, sub-II, and sub-III) and concentrated over a PM-10 filter (Amicon). In order to remove material that may have detached from the column matrix and would interfere with further analyses, the samples were finally subjected to density gradient centrifugation in CsCl/4 m guanidinium chloride (70.1 Ti rotor), and the mucin band was recovered. Mucin subunits were dialyzed into 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA, and prior to electrophoresis, 10% (v/v) of a solution containing glycerol 30% (v/v), 1 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue in 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8, was added. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed in a Bio-Rad DNA subcell for 18 h at 30 V and room temperature using 1.0% (w/v) agarose gels (15 × 15 cm) prepared in 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS (31Thornton D.J. Howard M. Devine P.L. Sheehan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were blotted onto nitro-cellulose membranes for 6 h at 40 mbar with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech LKB VacuGene XL vacuum blotter using 0.6 m NaCl, 0.06 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0. After blotting, membranes were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (blocking solution) for 1 h and incubated with the LUM2-2, LUM2-3, or LUM2-4 antiserum (1:1000) diluted in blocking solution for 1 h. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000 in blocking solution) for 1 h followed by the ECL Western detection kit. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. Mucin subunits (see Fig. 3 D, peak I) were dialyzed against 0.1 mNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, treated with trypsin (50 μg) overnight at 37 °C, dialyzed against 4 m guanidinium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and subjected to gel chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500HR column (1.6 × 50 cm) eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed for sialic acid. The material was pooled into two fractions, referred to as glycopeptides A and B (see Fig. 5), and subjected to density gradient centrifugation in CsCl/4 m guanidinium chloride as described for the mucin subunits in order to ensure complete removal of peptide material and contaminants from the column matrix. Finally, the two glycopeptide populations were dialyzed against water and freeze-dried. A larger pool of material was obtained using a column (2.6 × 93 cm) eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.27 ml/min. Amino acid analysis was carried out on approximately 2.5 μg of glycopeptides A and B according to Ref. 32Ou K. Wilkins M.R. Yan J.X. Gooley A.A. Fung Y. Sheumack D. Williams K.L. J. Chromatography. 1996; 723: 219-225Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholarwith modified gas-phase hydrolysis conditions. Samples were manually hydrolyzed in a vessel with 500 μl of 5.7 m HCl and a crystal of phenol at 110 °C for 24 h. The protein hydrolysate was dissolved in 250 mm borate buffer (pH 8.5), and analyzed with a GBC automated Aminomate HPLC system (GBC Scientific, Australia). Amino acids were derivatized with Fmoc and separated on a reversed-phase column (ODS-Hypersil, 5-μm packing, 150 × 4.6 mm internal diameter, Keystone Scientific) at 38 °C. Amino acid Fmoc derivatives were detected by fluorescence (LC1250 fluoro-detector system; excitation wavelength, 270 nm; emission wavelength, 316 nm), and peak analysis was controlled by the WinChrom chromatography data system (GBC), version 1.2. Monosaccharide analysis was carried out on mucin aliquots from the same solution (2.5 μg/5 μl) as described above. Sialic acids were hydrolyzed from the mucin in 0.1 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 40 min in plastic screw-cap Eppendorf centrifuge tubes. Neutral and amino sugars were determined after hydrolysis in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h and 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 4 h, respectively. The hydrolysates were dried under vacuum, dissolved in 50 μl of water and analyzed by high pressure anion exchange chromatography (Dionex, CarboPac PA1 column, 4 × 250 mm) combined with pulsed amperometric detection (Dionex DX 500). Neutral and amino sugars were separated isocratically at 1 ml/min in 12 mmNaOH, and N-acetyl neuraminic acid was eluted using a gradient of 0–200 mm sodium acetate in 250 mmNaOH over 15 min. No N-glycolyl neuraminic acid was detected even at a concentration of sodium acetate greater than 200 mm. Quantitation was performed using internal standards (2-deoxyglucose for the neutral and amino sugars; lactobionic acid for the sialic acids) with reference to the appropriate response factors. Reduced mucin subunits obtained from the insoluble glycoprotein complex of reservoir urine after density gradient centrifugation (see Fig. 3 D, peak I), were dialyzed against and then diluted with 6 m guanidinium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The intensity of light scattered at angles between 20° and 90° was determined with a Malvern 4600 SM system equipped with a 25 mW HeNe laser. The data were plotted in accordance with Zimm (33Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1099-1116Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), and a refractive index increment of 0.104 ml/g was used (34Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The subunits were studied at 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 μg/ml. Mucin subunits obtained by density gradient centrifugation of the reduced insoluble glycoprotein complex from reservoir urine (see Fig. 3 D, peak I), subunit subfractions (I, II, and III) obtained after gel chromatography (see Fig. 7 A), and glycopeptides A and B (see Fig. 5) were dialyzed against 6 m ultrapure guanidinium chloride. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using six-channel charcoal filled Epon centerpieces. Sedimentation distributions were, when possible, studied at several concentrations using absorption optics at 230 nm. The weight-average molecular weight of the entire distribution was determined by extrapolating the point-average value of M* to the bottom of the cell (35Creeth J.M. Harding S.E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1982; 7: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the obtained values were then, when possible, extrapolated to zero concentration. Partial specific volumes of 0.66 and 0.65 ml/mg were used for subunits and high molecular mass glycopeptides, respectively (36Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DNA-containing fractions obtained after density gradient centrifugation of the guanidinium chloride soluble material from the mucosal scrapings were pooled, desalted, and subjected to digestion with the restriction enzyme HinfI. The digest was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with 32P-labeled SMUC41 probe as described previously (10Vinall L.E. Hill A.S. Pigny P. Pratt W.S. Toribara N. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Swallow D.M. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The LUM2-2, LUM2-3, and LUM2-4 antisera were raised against three different sequences present in the C- and N-terminal regions of MUC2 (Fig.1 A). Each antiserum reacted only with the peptide used for immunization (Fig. 1 B), and no reactivity with the peptides used to raise the other antibodies was observed (results not shown). All antisera reacted with mucin subunits obtained after density gradient centrifugation (Fig.1 C). In human colon, staining with the LUM2-3 antiserum was seen over the goblet cells in the surface mucosa and along the entire length of the crypt (Fig.2 A). Surrounding tissues were not stained; however, reactivity was seen over secreted material at the luminal surface of the mucosa. The LUM2-2 and LUM2-4 antibodies showed similar results (data not shown). Also in the small intestine, the LUM2-3 antibody stained the goblet cells over the surface mucosa and along the crypts, whereas the enterocytes showed no reactivity (Fig.2 B). Again, the other two antibodies provided similar results (data not shown). Repeated extractions of human colonic mucins with 6 m guanidinium chloride fractionated them into those that were soluble in this solvent and those that resisted extraction. Density gradient centrifugation of the guanidinium chloride soluble fraction (results not shown) showed that little material was present at a density expected for mucins, although some sialic acid-containing and PAS-reactive material banding at a density 1.29–1.38 g/ml was detected. However, this material did not react, or reacted only weakly, with the three MUC2 antisera. The sol fractions from the reservoir urine and reservoir washings also contained little MUC2. Densit"
https://openalex.org/W2080862490,"hsp110 is one of major heat shock proteins of eukaryotic cells and is a diverged relative of the hsp70 family. It has been previously shown that hsp110 maintains heat-denatured luciferase in a soluble, folding competent state and also confers cellular heat resistance in vivo. In the present study the functional domains of hsp110 that are responsible for its chaperoning activity are identified by targeted deletion mutagenesis using the DnaK structure as the model. The chaperoning activity of mutants is assessed based on their ability to solubilize heat-denatured luciferase as well as to refold luciferase in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. It is shown that these functions require only an internal region of hsp110 that includes the predicted peptide binding domain and two immediately adjacent C-terminal domains. It is also shown that although hsp110 binds ATP, binding can be blocked by its C-terminal region. hsp110 is one of major heat shock proteins of eukaryotic cells and is a diverged relative of the hsp70 family.

The unifying mechanism for their action is based on their chaperoning activity, i.e. their ability to recognize and bind to peptide segments that are not normally exposed to the aqueous environment because they are normally buried in the interior of the protein or are hidden by interactions with other proteins (4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 5Hartl F.U.

Multiple members of hsp70 family occur within individual organisms, and it is believed that these different hsp70s perform differing roles. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been shown that different hsp70 family members are required for specific functions,e.g. transport across membranes or translation, and that one member may not be interchanged for another (7Craig E.A.

This division of labor occurs despite the very high degree of amino acid sequence identity between these hsp70 family members, usually better than 60%. Based on strong inducibility, quantity, and presence in many cell types, hsp110 has also been recognized for the last two decades as a major heat shock protein, specifically in mammalian cells (10Subjeck J.R.

Surprisingly, the cloning of hsp110 family members has indicated that this family does not represent a genetically unique stress protein group, as previously seen with other heat shock protein families such as hsp90 or 28, but that they are clearly related to the hsp70 family (14Lee-Yoon D.

However, the hsp110 family is a distinct subset of the hsp70 family which, in addition to their significantly increased mass compared with the hsp70s, differ in their significant sequence divergence from the archetypical hsp70s (14Lee-Yoon D.

In light of the differential functions of S. cerevisiae hsp70s, the appearance of the highly diverged hsp110 family, which exists in parallel with the hsp70s in the cytoplasm and nucleus in diverse organisms, argues strongly for related but differential functions and properties for these two major stress protein groups. Initial studies have shown that hsp110 has certain functional properties that are shared with hsp70, i.e. i) the overexpression of hsp110 has been shown to confer cellular heat resistance, and ii) hsp110 has been shown to have the ability to prevent protein aggregation and keep denatured protein in a folding-competent state; however, with apparently greater capacity compared with hsc70 (24Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To further analyze the functional properties of hsp110 and how it may differ from the hsp70 family, a mutational investigation of hsp110 has been undertaken. By sequence alignment and prediction of secondary structure, we have constructed several targeted deletion mutants. We describe here the properties of these mutants and test their ability to exhibit chaperoning functions. All plasmid constructs were made to produce 6-histidine-tagged proteins. For the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the following primers were synthesized. Each primer sequence contained proper restriction enzyme recognition sequences, which are underlined and whose name is indicated in parenthesis. Primers, A, B, C, and D are 5′ (or forward primers for PCR) and primers, i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi are 3′ (or backward primers for PCR). Primer A (BamHI), 5′-GCTAGAGGATCCTGTGCATTGCAGTGTGCAATT-3′; primer B (BamHI), 5′-GACGACGGATCCTCTGTCGAGGCAGACATGGA-3′; primer C (XbaI), 5′-CCGGCCTCTAGAATGTCGGTGGTGGGACTAGAC-3′; primer D (SstI), 5′-AGCTCATGAGCTCTAACAGC-3′; primer i (HindIII), 5′-CAGCGCAAGCTTACTAGTCCAGGTCCATATTGA-3′; primer ii (HindIII), 5′-CCGGAGAAGCTTACAGAATTGCACACTGCAA-3′; primer iii (HindIII), 5′-CGACAGAAGCTTAAGACCCGTCGTCTTCCTC-3′; primer iv (BamHI), 5′-ACAGAAGGATCCGTCGTCTTCCTCTGTTGG-3′; primer v (HindIII), 5′-TCAATGAAGCTTACATGTTAAGAAGGTCTCT-3′; primer vi (HindIII), 5′-GAATTTAAGCTTACTCATATGGTCCACACAG-3′. For the constructions of BLH (375–858), LH (508–858), and BLH′ (375–655), PCR was performed with primer pairs of primer A and primer i, primer B and primer i, and primer A and primer vi, respectively. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the digested fragment was ligated to pRSETA vector (Invitrogen), which was also digested with the same restriction enzymes used for the digestion of the PCR products. For the construction of ΔL (Δ510–608), PCR was performed with the pair of primers, primer C and primer iv, and the resulting fragment was ligated with pRSETA vector. Another PCR was performed with primer pair primer B and primer i and cloned into the vector in which the first PCR fragment was ligated. For AB (1–510) and ABL (1–614), PCR using pairs of primers primer D and primer iii and primer D and primer v was performed, and the PCR products were digested with SstI and HindIII. pRSETC-hsp110 plasmid that was described previously (24Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was digested withSstI and HindIII, and fragments containing the N-terminal portion of hsp110 sequences was isolated and ligated with the PCR fragments. The results of these procedures is that constructs BLH, LH, AB, and ABL contain N-terminal fusion of six histidines, enterokinase recognition sequences, and additional Asp-Arg-Trp-Gly-Ser for BLH and BLH′, Asp-Arg-Trp for LH, Asp-Arg-Trp-Ile-Arg-Pro-Arg-Asp-Leu-Gln-Pro-Ala for AB and ABL. The construct ΔL contains N-terminal fusion of six histidines and Gln-Met-Ser. The constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3) cells. E. colitransformed with the constructs BLH and LH were cultured at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.6, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, andE. coli were further cultured for 5 h. Cells containing all other constructs were cultured in a same way, except that the expression was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and at 30 °C. Cells were lysed by lysozyme treatment and sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was centrifuged at 42,000 rpm for 2 h, and soluble fraction was used for purification. The proteins were purified using nickel nitriloacetic acid-agarose columns (Quiagen, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instruction. The columns were extensively washed with wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, O.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol, and recombinant proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 500 mmimidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed for 48 h against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were concentrated using Slide-A-Lyzer concentrating solution (Pierce). Proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each mutant was visibly pure as indicated by Coomassie-stained gels, except ABL, which contained a small amount of a truncated form of this mutant, as shown by Western blot analysis. This mutant was not further purified. 0.15 μm luciferase (Sigma) and various test proteins were incubated in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 43 °C for 30 min, and the protein aggregation was monitored by the increase of optical density at 320 nm. At the end of the heating, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min, and soluble and pellet fractions were separated, run on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western analysis with anti-luciferase antibody (Promega). For luciferase refolding assay, luciferase together with various test proteins were heated in refolding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) at 43 °C for 30 min. The heated luciferase was diluted 100-fold into 60% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) containing refolding buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. For the measurement of activity, luciferase solution was further diluted 5-fold in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μl was added to 100 μl of luciferase assay solution (Promega); the activity was measured with Lumat LB9501 (Berthoid). ATP binding assay was essentially the same as previously reported, with minor modification (25Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1947-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ATP-agarose (Sigma) was washed and stored in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol) as a 1:1 slurry. One 10-cm dish of confluent CHO cells are lysed in 600 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, and soluble proteins are collected after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. 120 μl of lysate was incubated with 200 μl of ATP-agarose beads for 16 h at 4 °C. For ATP competition, 10 mm ATP was added to the mixture of lysate and ATP-agarose. The ATP-agarose beads were washed 2 times with buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl and 3 mm MgCl2, 2 times with buffer B containing 5 mm GTP, and 2 times with buffer B. ATP-agarose-bound proteins were eluted by incubation in buffer B containing 10 mm ATP and 3 mm MgCl2 for 4 h at 4 °C. The eluted proteins were boiled in SDS-gel-loading buffer (1% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and bromphenol blue) for 10 min. The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with anti-hsp110 or anti-hsp70 antibody (StressGen). In case of E. coliexpressing recombinant hsp110 or ATP binding domain, the cells were cultured, and recombinant proteins are expressed in the same way as for protein purification. The cells were lysed by sonication in buffer B containing protease mixture and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm for 2 h, and soluble fractions were used for ATP-agarose binding assay. 500 μg of total proteins was used for this assay. ATP-agarose was washed 5 times with buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl and 3 mm MgCl2 and 2 times with buffer B. ATP-agarose-bound proteins were eluted and analyzed as described above. In order that we might construct targeted mutations of the hsp 110 cDNA, we built a model of hsp110 based upon its sequence similarity with the DnaK family of stress proteins. The model (Fig. 1) is shown diagrammatically and is compared with a similar diagram of DnaK, based upon its x-ray structure determination (26Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Residues 1–394 of hsp110 (designated as domainA in Fig. 2) show 34% identity in amino acid sequence to the same region of DnaK. This region in DnaK is responsible for ATP binding. From amino acid 394 to amino acid 509, hsp110 is predicted to exhibit seven β strands (the β sheet domain, or B in Fig. 2). This region demonstrates some sequence similarity to, and structurally aligns with, the corresponding region of the DnaK. It is this region of DnaK that represents its “peptide binding domain” and consists of eight major β strands arranged as a β sandwich. The following 98 amino acids of hsp110 are composed of a number of negatively charged residues that computer analysis fails to predict as having any obvious secondary structure. This region is therefore referred to as the loop domain (residues 510–608, or domain L). Finally, distal to the loop domain, the C-terminal residues of hsp110 are predicted to form a series of α helices (residues 608–858, or domain H). Although there is little sequence identity in this region between hsp110 and DnaK (or hsc70), DnaK shows three large helices, which make up a helix-turn-helix structure. Fig. 1 correspondingly arranges the α helices of hsp110. It is in this region that the hsp110 family members exhibit a high degree of sequence homology among themselves, which is an identifying feature for this family (14Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, a small degree of sequence similarity can be found between hsp110 and DnaK families in certain of these helices, specifically αB and αC. In DnaK, the β sandwich serves as the peptide binding site, whereas the helix-turn-helix structure, poised above the β sandwich, is thought to regulate entry and/or exit of the peptide substrate (26Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on these similarities between the predicted structural elements of hsp110 and the actual structure of DnaK, we have constructed various deletion mutants. These mutants were constructed to include the specific amino acids residues defined above and to also include a small number of additional amino acids on either side of the domain to both increase the likelihood of correct folding of the domain and account for small errors in the computer predictions. Fig. 2 A shows a schematic diagram of these deletion mutants. The mutants were expressed and purified from E. coli, and their mobilities were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). When the recombinant full-length hsp110 is run on SDS-PAGE, its mobility (from which the N-terminal fusion peptide is subtracted) is essentially identical to that of native hsp110, determined by Western analysis of CHO lysate using an anti-hsp110 antibody. However, the calculated molecular mass of hsp110, based on the amino acid composition, is more than 10 kDa smaller than the molecular mass determined from SDS-PAGE mobility (Table I). This sort of discrepancy is unusual although not rare. To determine whether the mobility retardation is caused by overall sequence or by specific region (s) of hsp110, calculated molecular weights and mobilities of the different deletion mutants were compared. It is apparent from Fig. 2 Bthat the acidic loop region, which was also noted for its unusual amino acid composition, predicted flexibility, and lack of secondary structure, is solely responsible for this retardation. This also explains why mutant ABL (614 amino acids) exhibited slower mobility than mutant ΔL (757 amino acids), i.e. full-length hsp110, which lacks the loop domain.Table ISize comparison of hsp110 and various mutantsBy amino acid compositionEstimate on SDS-PAGEDifferencekDaABLH (wild type)10111211BLH597516LH446218AB61574ΔL87825ABL728513BLH′355015A47416N-terminal-fused amino acids are included in calculation by amino acid composition. The DNASTAR program was used for calculation. Open table in a new tab N-terminal-fused amino acids are included in calculation by amino acid composition. The DNASTAR program was used for calculation. Two assays were employed to identify the functional domains of hsp110 required for chaperoning activity. These are 1) the ability of the mutants to prevent protein aggregation induced by heat treatment, which is assessed by the suppression of the increase in light scattering obtained upon heat treatment as well as the solubility of the reporter protein, firefly luciferase, and 2) the ability to sustain denatured luciferase in a folding competent state, which is assessed by measuring the ability of the denatured luciferase to refold (i.e. recover activity) upon the addition of folding chaperones present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. First, as seen in Fig. 3, the ability of the different mutants to prevent heat-induced aggregation is presented. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, mutant BLH (i.e. containing only the β sheet peptide binding domain (B), loop (L), and α helical domain (H)) is able to prevent the aggregation of heat-denatured luciferase as equally well as does wild type hsp110. However, mutant LH does not prevent luciferase aggregation. This indicates that domain B containing amino acids from 375 to 507 (β-sheet domain) contains the substrate binding domain, in agreement with the predictions of the sequence alignment and secondary structure. To address whether β-sheet domain alone is sufficient for this chaperoning activity, mutant AB (ATP binding and β sheet-peptide binding domains) was examined. In the presence of mutant AB, heat denaturation of luciferase resulted in a change in optical density that was 3-fold greater than that observed with luciferase alone (i.e. 300%, not plotted in Fig. 3 A), in which case luciferase is found almost entirely in the pellet fraction (Fig.3 B). This indicates that mutant AB is not capable of preventing aggregation and, further, that it itself aggregates. Although it was determined above that BLH is totally effective in “holding” denatured luciferase and that B is required, the additional involvement of L and/or H was still a possibility. We therefore examined mutants ABL and BLH′ (H′ containing only the first major α helix of the complete H domain). Mutant ABL is inactive (even at a 2× molar concentration), but mutant BLH′ is active, even though its efficiency is 50% that of wild type hsp110 or mutant BLH. Thus, the C-terminal boundary of an “effective” peptide binding domain resides between amino acids 614 and 655, which defines the first part of the “cap” domain. This data further indicates that the complete holding ability of the protein requires additional C-terminal sequence components in the cap. Finally, to examine the role of the loop domain in this holding activity, mutant ΔL was next examined. It is observed that ΔL (containing full-length hsp110, excluding L) was also capable of inhibiting the aggregation of heat-denatured luciferase. In addition to luciferase, we have also tested the ability of BLH, LH, and BLH′ to inhibit the heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase using Coomassie Blue staining to measure the amount of citrate synthase in the supernatant and pellet. These results were essentially identical to those observed using luciferase. Taken together, the predicted β-sheet domain and α-helical cap domain are necessary and sufficient for the total ability of hsp110 to prevent aggregation and, further, that the significant component of this holding activity requires only the first major α helix of cap. The loop domain and ATP binding domain are dispensable for this function. Second, we examined the ability of the various mutants to provide a folding competent substrate. To examine this question, luciferase was incubated with each mutant at 43 °C for 30 min, following which rabbit reticulocyte lysate was added. The solution was further incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, a sufficient time to enable maximal refolding with wild type hsp110 (approximately 70% of the activity of unheated luciferase, designated 100% in Fig. 3 C for the comparison of mutants). As shown in Fig. 3 C, it is seen that when the luciferase is sustained by the mutant in a soluble form in aggregation assays in Figs. 3, A and B, it was found to be refoldable (i.e. recover activity). It is also seen in this figure that the mutants ΔL and BLH′, although holding luciferase in a folding-competent state, do so less efficiently than does wild type hsp110 (about one-half as efficient at equal concentration). Doubling the concentration of ΔL and BLH′ improved the recovery of luciferase activity. In case of BLH′, efficiency was increased to a level equivalent to that of the wild type protein. However, in case of ΔL, recovery of activity was still significantly less than wild type hsp110 or BLH′. Last, it is also seen that the ATP binding domain (A) is neither required for folding or holding of luciferase in these studies, as discussed above. Thus, the β-sheet domain, loop domain, and parts of the α-helical domain (specifically αB) are the minimal components required for hsp110 to function as a molecular chaperone that can hold substrate in a folding-competent state. Sequence analysis has indicated that hsp110 exhibits an ATP binding domain, and moreover, the domain shares significant sequence homology to hsp70. Because hsp70 binds ATP and ATP is required for its chaperoning function, the ATP binding ability of hsp110 was examined using ATP-agarose. CHO cell lysates were incubated with ATP-agarose beads, and bound proteins eluted with free ATP. The eluted proteins were then run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis with anti-hsp110 or anti-hsp70 antibody (Fig. 4 A). It is seen that hsp70 is a very good ATP-agarose binder (as has been long recognized), but that hsp110 is not. Free ATP competition during the ATP-agarose incubation shows the specificity of this assay. Because hsp110 has all the known consensus sequences for ATP binding, the possibility of the structural blocking of the ATP binding site in hsp110 was examined by using the mutant containing only the ATP binding domain (A). TheE. coli lysates expressing recombinant full-length hsp110 or the ATP binding domain alone were subjected to the same assay as the CHO cell lysate just described. The proteins bound to ATP-agarose were then analyzed with anti-oligohistidine antibody on a Western blot. The recombinant, full-length hsp110 still did not bind ATP-agarose. However, it is seen that the ATP binding domain (A) mutant was able to bind ATP-agarose. This indicates that the ATP binding domain of hsp110 is functional, but that its ability to bind ATP is masked by some part of its more C-terminal regions. It has been long recognized that the major heat shock proteins (hsps) of mammalian cells are observed at 28, 70, 90, and 110 kDa (10Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Schlesinger M. Ashburner M. Tissieres A.

During oxidative and photo phosphorylation ATP is synthesized by a H+-transporting F0F1-ATP synthase. In mitochondria, chloroplasts, and eubacteria, the enzyme consists of an H+-transporting transmembrane domain, termed F0, and a catalytic domain bound at the membrane surface, termed F1. Each sector is composed of multiple subunits that vary somewhat between species (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and a ring-like organization of the c oligomer in F0 was recently elucidated by cross-linking approaches (12Jones P.C.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Low resolution electron microscopic and atomic force microscopic images also suggest a ring-like arrangement of the coligomer with subunits a and b lying at the periphery of the ring (14Birkenhäger R.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The placement of subunits aand b at the outside of the ring is supported by cross-linking studies (13Fillingame R.H.

To couple H+ transport to rotary catalysis in F1, H+-flux through F0 is proposed to drive rotation of the coligomeric ring relative to the stationary subunits a andb at the periphery of the complex (9Duncan T.M.

In such a model, subunit b is proposed to play the role of a stator, holding the α3β3 subunits of F1fixed to the stationary F0 subunits as thec 12-γε subunits rotate as a unit. The γ and ε subunits are known to project below the α3β3 complex as a stalk making contact with the surface of the c-oligomer in F0 (21Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Watts S.D. Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. Capaldi R.A.

Recent electron micrographs now indicate a second stalk at the periphery of the F1F0 interface, which is presumed to represent a dimer of b 2 subunits extending from F0 to F1 (7Walker J.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 2308-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Böttcher B. Schwarz L. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Little is known about the structure of subunit b. Subunit b is an amphipathic protein of 156 residues. The N-terminal 33-residue segment is highly hydrophobic and the presumed membrane anchor (26Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Indeed, residues in this N-terminal segment were readily labeled with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine, a lipid soluble, photoactivatable carbene precursor (27Hoppe J. Brunner J. Jørgensen B.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5610-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The remainder of the protein is quite hydrophilic and thought to extend from the membrane surface to bind F1. The cytoplasmic domain lacking residues 1–24, termed b sol, has been expressed and in purified, soluble form shown to bind to F1 (28Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain has an elongated shape with high α-helical content and associates to form a homodimer in solution. Dimerization appears to be a necessary prerequisite for F1 binding (29Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The soluble domain binds to subunit δ of F1 in solution (31Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and interactions between subunit b and subunits δ and α at the top of the F1 molecule have been demonstrated in F1F0 (32Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To reach the top of the F1 molecule, subunit b is estimated to extend 110 Å from the surface of the membrane (32Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It may be possible to solve the structure of the individual domains of subunit b by NMR methods as a means of circumventing solubility problems inherent in approaches with detergent solubilization of the whole subunit. The aqueous solution structures of subunit ε and portions of subunit δ are already in hand (33Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 4: 198-201Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the structure of subunit c in chloroform/methanol/H2O solvent agrees well with predictions made from the biochemical and genetic experiments on the protein in situ (2Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further, subunit cretains its function after passage through chloroform/methanol/H2O solvent when reconstituted into liposomes with subunits a and b (35Dmitriev O.Y. Altendorf K. Fillingame R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 223: 478-483Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on its hydrophobicity, the membrane anchoring segment of subunitb was expected to be soluble in the chloroform/methanol/H2O mixture used in studies of subunitc. We report here on the structure of the membrane anchoring segment of subunit b in chloroform/methanol/H2O solvent and its possible relevance to the structural organization of the native subunit b dimer in F0. A 34-residue peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the E. coli subunit b was synthesized at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center on an Applied Biosystems Synergy 432A instrument using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The C-terminal carboxyl was amidinated. The peptide was purified from the crude synthesis mixture by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Dynamax C-4 column eluted with a linear 55–72% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The identity of the purified peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. The final product was judged to be ≥99% pure based on analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. Samples for NMR were 2 mmpeptide in either CDCl3:CD3OH:H2O (4:4:1 by volume) or CDCl3:CD3OD:D2O (4:4:1 by volume) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The pH of the solution was measured with a glass electrode and adjusted to pH 6.0 without correction for the deuterium isotope effect. DQF-COSY, 1The abbreviations used are: DQF-COSY, double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; PCR, polymerase chain reaction TOCSY, and NOESY experiments were performed on a DMX-600 spectrometer (Brueker) with a triple axis gradient capability. Double pulse field gradient echo solvent suppression (36Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. (A). 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) was used for recording TOCSY and NOESY in protic solvent. Magic angle gradients (37Warren W.S. Richter W. Andreotti A.H. Farmer B.T. Science. 1993; 262: 2005-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) were used for coherence pathway selection and water suppression in DQF-COSY experiments. TOCSY used the DIPSI-2 spin-lock sequence (38Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) and a mixing time of 75 ms. A mixing time of 160 or 80 ms was used in NOESY experiments. Data was collected using 640 (NOESY, TOCSY) or 800 (DQF-COSY) increments int 1. Time domain data was also extended int 1 by linear prediction. Squared sine apodization and zero filling to 2,048 points was applied in each dimension before Fourier transformation. Spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix 95.0 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., Palo Alto, CA) on a Silicon Graphics O2 computer. Coupling constants (3 J Hα, HN) were calculated from DQF-COSY and NOESY spectra essentially as described (39Titman J.J. Keeler J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 640-646Google Scholar). The structure was calculated from 275 NOE-derived inter- and intra-residue distance constraints and 20 angle constraints derived from coupling constants. Distance calibration and structure calculation was performed with the DYANA software package (40Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) by simulated annealing. The MOLMOL program (41Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) was used for visual analysis of the structure and for preparing molecular graphics figures. A two stage PCR-based mutagenesis procedure was used with plasmid pNOC for the introduction of single cysteine residues between residues 2 and 20 of subunit b (12Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers corresponding to 21–25 base sequence of the sense strand were designed with a single codon changed to Cys. These were combined with the antisense primer (bases 2523–2548) 2The nucleotide numbering system is from the sequence given by Walker et al. (26Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). to generate the first PCR product or mega-primer. The purified mega-primer was then combined with a second primer, coding bases 1844–1860 of the sense strand, in a second PCR reaction. The product was then digested withSnaB1 and AvaI and subcloned into these restriction sites of plasmid pNOC, and the product was verified by DNA sequencing. A chromosomal ΔuncBEFH deleted strain, JWP109 (17Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was transformed with pNOC and its mutant derivatives. Plasmid complementation of the ΔuncBEFH deletion was tested by growth of transformant cells on succinate minimal medium (17Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were prepared, and cross-linking analysis was carried out as described previously (17Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for Western blotting. Rabbit antiserum to subunit b was a generous gift of D. S. Perlin and A. E. Senior (42Perlin D.S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peptideb 1–34 is quite hydrophobic and it proved to be very soluble in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/H2O (4:4:1 by volume). The DQF-COSY spectrum of b 1–34 in this solvent mixture demonstrated a good dispersion of HNand Hα chemical shifts (Fig.1). The distribution of chemical shifts of the HN and Hα protons is typical for a protein containing α-helical and coiled segments (43Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Proton chemical shifts were assigned by standard procedures (44Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Main chain chemical shifts assignments for all residues were complete with the exception of Asn-2, where HN was not observed. Most of the side chains protons have been assigned except for a few aliphatic side chains where complete assignment was not possible due to spectral overlap and chemical shift degeneracy. A table of chemical shift assignments has been deposited in the BMRB data bank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu). NOE analysis revealed a pattern of sequential and medium range NOEs, which is characteristic of an α-helix (Fig.2 A). No long range NOEs were observed (Table I), indicating that the peptide does not form tertiary folds. The Hα-HN cross-peaks of the residues 12–21 and 25 were still readily observable by DQF-COSY in completely deuterated solvent in an experiment where data was collected from 6 to 14 h after dissolving the peptide. These regions of the peptide must therefore have a particularly stable hydrogen bonded secondary structure.Figure 2Summary of NOEs observed in the NOESY spectrum of the b 1–34 peptide.

Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Of the initial collection of 200 calculated structures, 180 had a similar overall folding pattern. In the 20 remaining structures there was no apparent clustering of structures into an alternative fold. The 10 lowest energy structures were energy minimized using AMBER forcefield as implemented in DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The atomic coordinates of the 10 final structures have been deposited as entry 1b9U at the Protein Data Bank, Rutgers, New Jersey. The best fit superposition of the 10 final structures is shown in Fig. 3. Mean pairwise root mean square deviation between individual structures for residues 3–33 was 0.4 ± 0.1 Å and 0.9 ± 0.1 Å for the backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. There were no distance constraint violations exceeding 0.2 Å. The distribution of angles in a Ramachandran plot were 74% in the “most favored” region, with 23% in the “additionally allowed” and 3% in “generously allowed” regions. The definitions of the Ramachandran plot regions are those used in DYANA. Statistics on the structure calculation are presented in Table I and Fig. 2 B. The b 1–34 peptide forms a well defined α-helix from residues 4–22, which is interrupted by a bend region from residues 23–26 with resumption of the α-helix from residue 27 to the C terminus. A large stretch of the initial α-helical segment is unusually stable as judged by the very slow HN exchange in deuterated solvent. The uninterrupted stretch of hydrophobic side chains from residues 11 to 20 may stabilize the hydrogen bonded secondary structure in either a lipid bilayer or a membrane-mimetic solvent by forming a nonpolar sheath around the protein backbone. Sequential proline residues at positions 27 and 28, which would break the (i,i + 4) pattern of hydrogen bonding in an α-helix, correlate with the position of the bend in the structure. This region is well ordered in solution despite the absence of hydrogen bonds. Such a rigid conformation probably results from the combination of restricted torsional mobility of the backbone of the two proline residues and spatial constraints imposed by the bulky side chains of residues 22–26. The α-helical structure resumes at residue 27 with both Pro-27 and Pro-28 in the α-helical conformation with ψ angles of about −35°. As Richardson and Richardson (45Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Fasman G. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, NY1989: 1-98Crossref Google Scholar) have indicated, a proline in this conformation is actually favored as the first residue of an α-helix and is not uncommon in the second position as well. The α-helix from residues 27 to 33 may be part of a more extended α-helical segment of the cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domains of subunit b forms a functionally important homodimer in F0, which suggests a possible proximity of transmembrane segments as well. Single Cys residues were introduced from position 2–20 of a cysteine-free subunitb (bC21S) to test this possibility by cross-linking. The bC21S mutant was shown to be functionally equivalent to wild type (12Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Each of the single Cys mutants grew on a succinate carbon source, indicating a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. Most mutants grew similarly to wild type (1.5–2-mm colony diameter after 3 days at 37 °C) with the exception of bI7C (0.5 mm), bG9C (0.8 mm), andbI12C (1 mm). Membrane vesicles from each mutant were analyzed for b-b homodimer formation by disulfide bridge formation following treatment with Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)2 (Fig.4). Relatively intense high yieldb-b dimers were observed for the bN2C,bT6C and bQ10C substitutions. Less intense dimer formation was observed with Cys substitutions at residues 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18. The periodicity of high yield cross-linking seen in Fig. 4 mimics that expected for one face of an α-helix. The less intense cross-linking seen over consecutive stretches of residues suggest that the helices may be relatively mobile in the membrane. Intersubunit distance restraints derived from the cross-linking pattern were used to envision the orientation of the membrane domains of the two b subunits in the native F0 complex. Two minimized meanb 1–34 structures were docked to each other using distance constraints from the cross-linking data. The distances between the α-carbons of residues 2, 6, and 10 of two differentb subunits were constrained to 4–8 Å, the distance usually found for natural disulfide bridges in proteins (45Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Fasman G. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, NY1989: 1-98Crossref Google Scholar). The distances between αcarbons of residues forming lower yield cross-links were constrained to 4–11 Å. Backbone angles of residues 3 to 33 were restrained to the values in the mean structure, and side chain angles left unrestrained. A dimer structure was calculated using molecular dynamics and energy minimization with DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The fit of the cross-linking distance constraints to the model are shown in Table II. The modeling indicates that the membrane anchoring segments of the two bsubunits are positioned at a 23° angle to each other with interacting helical faces making Van der Waals contact at the side chains of residues 6 and 10 (Fig. 5).Table IICross-linking distance constraints used in modeling the b1–34dimerResidue pairaPrime designates residue of second subunit in dimer.Distance contraint rangeFinal distanceÅ2–2′4–88.13–3′4–114.54–4′4–1110.96–6′4–85.28–8′4–1111.69–9′4–1110.610–10′4–85.211–11′4–1110.513–13′4–1110.414–14′4–117.617–17′4–1110.318–18′4–1111.1a Prime designates residue of second subunit in dimer. Open table in a new tab Before this work, Girvin et al. (11Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) used solution NMR to solve the structure of F0 subunit c dissolved in chloroform/methanol/H2O (4:4:1) solvent. Importantly, subunit c folds in a helical hairpin, as it is predicted to fold in the membrane, with a number of side chains interacting in accord with the predictions of genetic and biochemical studies of F0 in situ. The solvent mixture used may be a good membrane mimetic, because it can organize heterogeneously around polar and apolar surfaces of amphipathic proteins. We have shown previously that purified subunit c, prepared in chloroform/methanol/H2O solvent, can be reconstituted with subunits a and b to form an F0 with normal proton translocating function (35Dmitriev O.Y. Altendorf K. Fillingame R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 223: 478-483Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The experiment indicated that the protein was not denatured by the solvent treatment. We have attempted similar experiments here in reconstituting peptideb 1–34 with purified subunits a andc and were unable to reconstitute proton-translocating activity. This negative result is in agreement with earlier observations that partial removal of small segments of the C-terminal domain of the subunit b disrupted the assembly of an active F0 complex (46Steffens K. Schneider E. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 262: 5866-5869Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 47Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the transmembrane region of subunit bderived here by NMR analysis of the protein in chloroform/methanol/H2O solvent fits well with features of the protein expected in a native lipid bilayer. The N-terminal α-helical segment (residues 4–22) is followed by hinge region from residues 23–26 before resumption of the α-helix. Because an α-helix of 20 amino acids is required to traverse the fatty acyl hydrocarbon interior of a phospholipid bilayer, we expect the initial N-terminal helix to be the hydrocarbon spanning region of the protein. This would place Asn-2 at the periplasmic hydrocarbon/polar interface and the hinge region (residues 23–26) at the cytoplasmic hydrocarbon/polar interface of the phospholipid bilayer. The distance between α-carbons of Asn-2 and Trp-26 is 34 Å in the structure, which is close to the distance of 32 Å predicted between fatty acyl carbonyls in opposing leaflets of a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer determined by x-ray and neutron diffraction (48Wiener M.C. White S. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 434-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 49Yau W.-M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The positioning of these residues near the glycerol moiety of the phospholipid was previously indicated by labeling studies with a photoactivatable phospholipid analog (50Hoppe J. Montecucco C. Friedl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2882-2885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trp and Tyr residues are preferentially found at the hydrocarbon/polar interface of the lipid bilayer in transmembrane proteins of known structure (49Yau W.-M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 51von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 52Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 53Wallin E. Tsukihara T. Yoshikawa S. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 1995; 6: 808-815Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Tyr-24 and Trp-26 residues in theb 1–34 structure would also be predicted to organize in the interfacial region. In the case of the Trp-26 side chain, the aromatic rings lie parallel to the predicted surface of the lipid bilayer but in a region of the protein devoid of other protein contacts (Fig. 3). Trp-26 can be replaced with either an acidic or a basic residue without impairing function (54Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 764-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it may lie in a region with a few protein-protein contacts. The orientation of the indole ring might be expected to reorient in a phospholipid bilayer in a more perpendicular manner to optimize hydrogen bonding between the indole NH and fatty acyl carbonyl groups (55Schiffer M. Chang C.-H. Stevens F.J.

The two copies of subunit b present in the F0are now thought to be adjacent to each other and the interactions between cytoplasmic domains believed critical in F1 binding function (28Dunn S.D. J.

The cross-linking experiments presented here indicate that the transmembrane domains are also close enough in the membrane to dimerize. A possible model for helical-helical interaction within the membrane is presented based upon the NMR model and distance constraints from the cross-linking results (Fig. 5). The model is of interest in that the transmembrane helices cross at an angle that is typical for helix-helix packing in polytopic membrane proteins of known structure (56Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). If this model represents the packing in F0, then the role of the hinge region may be to redirect the C-terminal helix at an angle more perpendicular to the membrane as it emerges into the cytoplasmic. Proper positioning may be critical in facilitating dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain. The model is also of interest in that it suggests a possible aromatic cluster that may be important in fostering helix-helix interactions between subunits. The aromatic ring interactions of Phe-14-Phe-17′, where 17′ designates the second subunit, and Phe-17′-Phe-17 is in accord with the stabilizing geometries and distances described by Burley and Petsko (57Burley S.K.

In contrast to the interaction of PPARα with the coactivator protein, p300, association of the receptor with NCoR did not require any part of the PPARα ligand binding domain. NCoR was found to suppress PPARα-dependent transcriptional activation in the context of a PPARα·retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimeric complex bound to a peroxisome proliferator-responsive element in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This repression was reversed agonists of either receptor demonstrating a functional interaction between NCoR and PPARα·RXRα heterodimeric complexes in mammalian cells.

These results identify key elements of a general mechanism for the serpentine receptor switch. Serpentine receptors serve as ligand-activated molecular switches, relaying signals from extracellular ligands to heterotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. These receptors catalyze ligand-dependent exchange of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on the α subunit of the heterotrimer, causing dissociation of α·GTP from the βγ dimer; α·GTP and free βγ subsequently activate effector enzymes and ion channels (1Clapham D.E.

More than 1,000 serpentine receptors of mammals share with their counterparts in yeast and plants a conserved three-dimensional architecture, comprising seven α-helices in a transmembrane bundle (3Gether U.

The switch mechanism is also conserved, as indicated by the abilities of mammalian receptors to activate G protein trimers in yeast (7Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K.

The switch clearly resides in the seven-helix bundle: swapping of extra- or intracellular loops preserves the ability of ligands to activate G proteins while transferring specificity of ligand binding or G protein activation, respectively, from one receptor to another (10Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fong T.M. Yu H. Strader C.D. J. Biol.

A static model of the three-dimensional structure of the helix bundle is beginning to take shape. A low resolution (6 Å) electron cryomicroscopic structure of rhodopsin (14Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the retinal light receptor, reveals relative positions and tilts of seven transmembrane helices in the plane of the membrane. Based on many mutations, the rhodopsin structure, and an analysis of the primary structures of more than 500 rhodopsin-like serpentine receptors, Baldwin and co-workers (15Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) constructed an α-carbon template of the helix bundle, hereafter termed the Baldwin model. In this model, transmembrane helices I-VII bundle together in clockwise order as viewed from the cytoplasm. The probable arrangement of helices and the positions of specific amino acids in the model are inferred from patterns of conserved hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in many receptors. The Baldwin model specifies which helix corresponds to which density in the electron projection map, approximate orientations of cognate amino acids around the helical axes, and the cytoplasmic and extracellular limits of each transmembrane sequence (16Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). How does the switch work? It is difficult to infer a conserved switch mechanism from the functional effects of site-directed mutations reported in a large number of different receptors, because relatively few positions have been mutated in any one receptor (17Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 18van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we undertook a systematic genetic analysis of a single serpentine receptor, with the goal of identifying functionally important residues and sites of helix-helix interactions that relay the ligand signal to G protein activation. We selected functional receptors after random saturation mutagenesis of the four transmembrane helices (III, V, VI, and VII) most consistently implicated in ligand binding or G protein activation by various serpentine receptors (3Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 4Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R.

This comprehensive approach determines the relative importance of side chains in each α-helix by identifying those that cannot be altered in mutated receptors selected for maintenance of function. The results suggest a hypothesis to explain the conserved switch mechanism of serpentine receptors. To construct mutagenized C5a receptors, we engineered restriction endonuclease sites (which did not alter the amino acid sequence) into the C5a receptor gene at the approximate boundaries of helices III (SphI andPstI), V (BssHII), VI (BglII andXhoI), or VII (HindIII). A NcoI site at the start methionine introduced an aspartic acid in place of an asparagine at amino acid position 2. To ensure efficient library construction and eliminate the possibility of contamination by wild-type receptor DNA, for each helix library we created a subcloning vector that contained a piece of nonreceptor DNA substituted between the flanking restriction sites. For example, in the Helix III subcloning vector, a 383-base pair fragment of Gα12digested with SphI and PstI was subcloned into the C5a receptor DNA containing silent SphI andPstI sites. The following oligonucleotides were used (Genemed, S. San Francisco, CA; underlines denote bases doped with 20% nonwild-type nucleotides): Helix III, 5′-CCCGCATGCTCTATTCTACCATCTCTAATTCTACTAAACATGTACGCTTCTATTCTACTACTAGCTACTATTTCTGCAGAA-3′; Helix V, 5′-TTTGCGCGCTGTTGCTATTGTTAGACTAGTTCTAGGTTTCCTATGGCCTCTACTAACTCTAACTATTTGTTACACTTTCATTCTGCTCCGGAGC-3′; Helix VI (two oligonucleotides); 5′-ATAAGATCTACCAAAACACTCAAAGTTGTTGTTGCAGTTGTTGCAAGCTTCTTTATCTTCTGGTTA-3′, and 5′-AAACTCGAGAAAAGACATCATTATCCCCGTCACCTGGTATGGTAACCAGAAGAT-3′; Helix VII, 5′-CCAAAGCTTGATTCTCTATCTGTTTCTTTTGCTTACATTAATTGTTGTATTAATCCAATTATTTACGTTGTGGCCGGCCA-3′. Oligonucleotides encoding Helices III, V, or VII were mutually primed via extended palindromic sequences at their 3′ termini (19Hill D.E. Oliphant A.R. Struhl K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Matteucci M.D. Heyneker H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the complementary strand synthesized using Klenow DNA polymerase. The products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the C5a receptor gene in pBS-SK Bluescript vector. Because of technical difficulties in synthesizing doped oligonucleotides greater than 100 base pairs, we annealed two oligonucleotides encoding either the N- or C-terminal half of helix VI via a 12-base pair overlap at their 3′ termini, synthesized the complementary strand using Klenow polymerase, and subcloned theBglII and XhoI digested products into the C5a receptor gene in pBS-SK Bluescript vector. After determining the complexity and the quality of the library (by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping), we subcloned NcoI and FseI fragments of each mutated helix library into the yeast shuttle vector, p1303ADE2 (derived from p1303, Cadus Pharmaceuticals, New Jersey). The number of recombinants obtained equaled or exceeded the initial size of the mutated helix library. Strain BY1142, engineered by standard yeast strategies, has the genotype far1Δ1442 tbt1–1 FUS1-HIS3 can1 ste14:: trp1::LYS2 ste3Δ1156 gpa1(41)-Gαi2 lys2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2. BY1142 expresses a yeast/human Gα chimera in which the N-terminal 41 residues of yeast GPA1 (a region predicted to interact with Gβγ based on the crystal structure of the Giheterotrimer (21Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar)) replaces the first 33 residues of human Gαi2. A SacI restriction site introduces a point mutation that substitutes leucine for valine at position 34 of Gαi2. The chimera is designed for optimal ability to sequester yeast Gβγ and release it upon receptor activation, thereby triggering the mating response pathway. Expression of the FUS1/HIS3 reporter enzyme, stimulated by the mating response pathway, allows BY1142 cells (his3) to grow in histidine-deficient medium. The far1 deletion blocks cell cycle arrest that is induced by pheromone. The tbt1–1 mutation increases transformation efficiency by electroporation and ste14, a carboxymethylase deletion, reduces basal signaling of the pheromone response pathway. Inclusion of an ADE2 gene in the C5a receptor plasmid, p1303 (p1303ADE2, PGK-hC5aRADE2 REP3 2 μm-ori AmpR f1ori), allowed us easily to infer from the color of a colony whether its growth on histidine-deficient medium depends on the C5a receptor (red colonies lack ADE2 and, by implication, the receptor plasmid). A separate plasmid, p1297 (ADH1-mfα1-hC5aURA3 REP3 2μm-ori AmpR f1ori, Cadus Pharmaceuticals), allowed autocrine expression of the C5a ligand as an α-factor prepro/C5a ligand fusion protein; autocrine expression was necessary because C5a cannot traverse the yeast cell wall. Using electroporation, we cotransformed BY1142 yeast cells with plasmid libraries of mutated C5a receptors and the C5a ligand plasmid, p1297. Colonies bearing functioning receptors were selected by replica-plating on histidine-deficient medium containing 1 mm3-aminotriazole (AT) 1The abbreviations used are: AT, 3-aminotriazole(Sigma). We recovered the plasmids encoding functioning C5a receptors and confirmed the phenotypes by retransforming each candidate C5a receptor plasmid and the C5a ligand plasmid (or without C5a ligand, to assess constitutive signaling) into the parental yeast strain, BY1142. Growth after 3 days at 30 °C in the presence of different concentrations of AT (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm) served to quantitate the relative intensities of signals mediated by mutant receptors. Each mutant receptor was tested at least twice and the results were averaged. In each case, the wild-type C5a receptor expressed in parallel yeast served as a positive control. The results of ten independent transformations of wild-type C5a receptor were growth at 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2, and 5 mm AT. The mutant receptor sequences were obtained by DNA sequencing with Thermosequenase cycle sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We studied the human chemoattractant C5a receptor, a member of the rhodopsin family of serpentine receptors. This receptor activates Gi and mediates chemotaxis of neutrophils toward the C5a ligand, a 74-residue polypeptide (22Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Boyar W. Toth M.J. Wennogle L. Gonnella N.C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To select functioning receptors from populations of mutant receptors we took advantage of the G protein-mediated response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to mating pheromones (24Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 25Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We constructed a yeast strain, BY1142, in which activation of the C5a receptor induces expression of the HIS3 gene, thereby allowing cells with functioning receptors to survive and proliferate in growth medium lacking histidine. In this selection procedure, the relative intensities of signals mediated by mutant receptors can be quantitated by assessing growth in the presence of different concentrations of AT, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product (27Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Expression of both C5a and the C5a receptor allows BY1142 cells to grow in selective medium lacking histidine and containing up to 5 mm AT (Fig.1). Helix by helix, we subjected stretches of amino acid sequence to random saturation mutagenesis, for a total of 93 positions in helices III, V, VI and VII. Quality of the libraries was assessed in two ways. First, DNA sequencing of 15–20 independent recombinants from each library before pooling revealed oligonucleotide mutagenesis rates between 19–22%, resulting in amino substitution rates of 36–42% (TableI). Second, we determined the substitution rate at the third nucleotide position of degenerate codons for amino acid positions at which few substitutions were observed in functioning receptors (see below). The observed substitution rate of 17% closely matches the predicted rate of 20%, demonstrating that little or no bias occurred in the randomization of the libraries.Table ICharacteristics of mutated C5a receptorsLibrariesSelected receptorsHelixSize (×10−3)AA scannedAAΔ avgTotalAAΔ avgConstitutiveTruncated%%III200218.0 (38)304.4 (21)50V1,0002510.5 (42)404.7 (19)00VI50249.9 (38)258.1 (31)169VII1,000217.6 (36)283.2 (15)00Size, number of individual recombinants in each helix library; AA, amino acids; AAΔ, amino acid substitution rate; avg, average per scanned transmembrane segment.

We then selected recombinants from four separate libraries of mutant receptors, each library containing mutations in a single helix, for ability to support growth of BY1142 cells in the absence of histidine. At an average mutation rate of 8–10 amino acid substitutions per helix, fewer than one in 103 BY1142 cells transformed with a mutated C5a receptor survived the selection. 2T. J. Baranski and H. R. Bourne, unpublished data. In the four scanned helices, the yeast selection identified 121 functioning mutant receptors (at least 25 from each helix library, Figs.2, 3,4, and 5), providing a data set of 523 amino acid substitutions (summarized in Table I). The receptor helices tolerate an average of 4.3 amino acid substitutions per mutated helix. We assume that most amino acid substitutions occur at less important parts of the receptor switch; some mutations, however, may compensate for functional defects caused by other mutations in the same helix.Figure 3Functioning C5a receptors selected from a library containing random substitutions in helix V.

For this analysis, we defined side chain character as preserved if we observed at that position no more than one amino acid substitution or if all substitutions at that position involved closely related amino acids (log odds score of 1.0 or greater in the PAM 250 scoring matrix (28Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Spring, MD1978: 345-353Google Scholar)). Single amino acid substitutions were included to allow for the rare mutation that might have occurred at a critical position, but only in the setting of other compensatory substitutions. For example, the Tyr-222 position is conserved in 91% of serpentine receptors (15Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and is preserved in 39 of the 40 mutated receptors in our study. The single Y222H substitution obtained in Arg-42 occurs in the setting of substitutions in the two neighboring residues, C221S and T223N (Fig. 3). Hydrophobicity is considered preserved at positions where only hydrophobic amino acids with free energy transferoctanol of >0.1 kcal/mol (29Fauchere J.-L. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 18: 369-375Google Scholar) are observed. The functioning mutant receptors preserve side chain character at 25 of the 93 positions mutated (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Thirty of the 93 mutated positions preserve their hydrophobic character in functioning receptors; this group includes 11 of the 25 positions at which side chain character was preserved (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). We expected that in functioning mutant receptors the side chains that face other helices would tolerate fewer mutations than side chains that face the surrounding lipid, because association of transmembrane helices with one another depends upon preservation of complementary shapes that maximize van der Waals interactions (30MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Moreover, the established role of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing the tertiary structure of soluble proteins (31Chothia C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 537-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 32Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar) suggests that hydrophobicity should be preserved at positions that point toward other helices. The results of our analysis meet both expectations; the patterns of preserved side chain character and hydrophobicity strongly confirm the helix orientations specified in the Baldwin model. In helical wheel plots based on the Baldwin model, both sets of residues (character-preserving and preserved hydrophobics) point toward other helices or toward the center of the helix bundle, rather than toward the surrounding lipid (Fig. 6). The argument is circular, however, because the Baldwin model itself (15Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar,16Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) is based on patterns of side chain character and hydrophobicity conserved through evolution. Nonetheless, the patterns observed in mutant receptors constitute experimental validation of the model. A quite different approach, based on substituting cysteines at many positions in helices of the D2-dopamine receptor, also furnishes a comprehensive confirmation of the helix orientations specified by the Baldwin model. In these experiments, cysteines that proved accessible to a water-soluble chemical probe were located on the inner faces of the four helices tested (III, IV, VI, and VII) (33Fu D. Ballesteros J.A.

In contrast to regions of the transmembrane helices involved in helix-helix interactions, hydrophobicity is not strictly preserved at positions predicted by the Baldwin model to face the surrounding lipid. 12 of the 29 mutated positions that tolerate substitution of a polar residue are predicted to contact the lipid. This striking tolerance of polar side chains in lipid-contacting faces of transmembrane helices confirms a previous analysis of random mutations in three transmembrane helices of a bacterial diacylglycerol kinase (37Wen J. Chen X. Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assess the reliability of the mutation and selection procedures for identifying side chains important for receptor function, we tested the effect of a single amino acid substitution at many of the preserved positions (Table II). Fourteen of 17 such point mutations tested do impair receptor function (0 or + growthversus +++ for the unmutated C5a receptor; see Fig. 2legend), indicating functional importance of the corresponding preserved residue. Three of the 17 preserved positions tolerate amino acid substitution; side chains at these positions are presumably important in a context of multiple additional mutations but are not necessary for function in an otherwise wild-type receptor.Table IISite-directed point mutations of key residues identified by random saturation mutagenesisIIIVVIVII+C5a−C5a+C5a−C5a+C5a−C5a+C5a−C5aWild type+++0L112A00A203V00S266A+0D282A00S123A++++0R206H00V260A+0V286A00L126A00L207A+0F251A+++++V286L00T129A+0L207I+0K242A+++0S287A00I130A+0Y222A00N296A00I124N, L127Q+++++++I124N+++++L127Q+++++Yeast strain BY1142 was cotransformed with a plasmid encoding a C5a receptor carrying the indicated mutation and with a plasmid encoding either vector alone (−C5a) or an α-factor prepro/C5a ligand fusion protein (+C5a).

The first clues to specific roles of preserved residues came from comparing positions preserved in the functioning mutant C5a receptors with positions deemed evolutionarily important among serpentine receptors. We applied an evolutionary trace analysis method (38Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) to 62 serpentine receptors closely related to the human C5a receptor. The evolutionary trace method assesses patterns of sequence conservation in alignments of genes for related proteins and maps the conserved positions onto a shared backbone structure. The method successfully identified contact surfaces in SH2 and SH3 domains (38Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and Gα surfaces that interact with βγ and the serpentine receptors (39Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7507-7511Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 3A more complete analysis of the evolutionary trace in lineages of serpentine receptors is in preparation, O. Lichtarge, H. R. Bourne, and F. E. Cohen. Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 indicate the top ranked positions (labeled Evol. Conserved). As expected, the evolutionary trace approach identifies many of the same residues found in these helices by Baldwin's analysis of 199 unique serpentine receptor sequences (16Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The latter analysis identified 16 positions at which residues are conserved in at least 60% of the receptors (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5); 12 of these positions appear in the evolutionary trace. Fig. 7 compares the evolutionary trace to the pattern of preserved residues in mutant functioning C5a receptors, as mapped onto the α-carbon template of the Baldwin model (15Baldwin J.M.

In this study, we have succeeded in the isolation of a novel CA from the mouse kidney by use of the signal sequence trap method. It is a 337-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 37.5 kDa, consisting of a putative amino-terminal signal sequence, a CA domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short hydrophilic carboxyl terminus, which we designated CA XIV. 1The designation CA XIV for the cloned protein and Car14 for the mouse gene has been approved by the Specialist Advisor for Carbonic Anhydrases with the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature).1The designation CA XIV for the cloned protein and Car14 for the mouse gene has been approved by the Specialist Advisor for Carbonic Anhydrases with the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature). The CA domain of CA XIV is highly homologous with those of known CAs, especially extracellular CAs including CA XII, IX, VI, and IV. The expression study of an epitope-tagged protein has suggested that CA XIV is located on the plasma membrane. When expressed in COS-7 cells, CA XIV exhibits CA activity that is predominantly associated with the membrane fraction. By Northern blot analysis, the gene expression of CA XIV is most abundant in the kidney and heart, followed by the skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and liver. In situ hybridization has revealed that, in the kidney, the gene is expressed intensely in the proximal convoluted tubule, which is the major segment for bicarbonate reabsorption and also in the outer border of the inner stripe of the outer medulla.

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) 2The abbreviations used are: CA, carbonic anhydrase; RPTP, receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase; 3′-RACE, rapid amplification of 3′-cDNA ends; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C(EC 4.2.1.1) is a zinc-binding metalloproteinase that catalyzes reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2+H2O⇄H++HCO3−). CAs are produced in a variety of tissues where they participate in a broad range of physiological processes such as acid-base balance, carbon dioxide, and ion transport, respiration, body fluid generation, bone resorption, ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis, and lipogenesis (1Tashian R.E. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 321-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In mammals, CAs organize a family of 9 isoenzymes (CA I-VII, IX, and XII) with defined CA activity, 3 CA-related proteins (CA VIII, X, and XI), and 2 subtypes of receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP β and γ) (3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These proteins share a well conserved CA or CA-like domain and differ in tissue distribution and subcellular localization (1Tashian R.E. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 321-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). CA II is expressed in almost all tissues, whereas expression of others are restricted (CA VI and CA VII in the salivary gland; RPTP β in the brain) (4Fernley R.T. Wright R.D. Coghlan J.P.

Subcellularly, they are cytosolic (CA I, II, III, and VII), membrane-bound (CA IV, IX, and XII, RPTP β and γ), mitochondrial (CA V), or secreted (CA VI). The CA-like domain of RPTP β does not have CA activity, but provides a binding site for a cell surface signal transducing molecule, contactin (9Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R.

In the kidney, carbon dioxide metabolism and acid-base balance are regulated by two CA isoenzymes, CA II and CA IV (2Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar). CA II catalyzes hydration of carbon dioxide in the cytoplasm, and CA IV catalyzes the reverse reaction on the plasma membrane. Thus, CA II and CA IV, together, enhance the net proton secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption (10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar). Functional importance of CAs has been investigated also in pathologic conditions. For instance, CA II and CA IV are up-regulated in the kidney in metabolic acidosis (11Tsuruoka S. Kittelberger A.M. Schwartz G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F259-F267PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CA II gene mutations cause a hereditary disease characterized by renal tubular acidosis, osteopetrosis, and cerebral calcification (12Sly W.S. Whyte M.P. Sundaram V. Tashian R.E.

Here we describe the molecular cloning, sequence analysis, enzyme activity, and distribution of a novel membrane-bound CA, designated CA XIV. The whole kidney and other tissues were obtained from 8-week-old male BALB/c mice. Total RNA extraction was carried out as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using PolyATract (Promega, Madison, WI). Signal sequence trap was performed as described (13Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 14Tashiro K.

The second strand was synthesized with a specific primer containing polydeoxythymidine (dT) and an EcoRI restriction site and ligated with a SacI adaptor. The cDNA fragments of 300–700 base pairs in size were isolated by an agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into the EcoRI andSacI sites of pcDL-SRα-Tac(3′) vector (21Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to generate a fusion protein with interleukin-2 receptor α chain (or Tac antigen) lacking its own signal sequence (22Nikaido T. Shimizu A. Ishida N. Sabe H. Teshigawara K. Maeda M. Uchiyama T. Yodoi J. Honjo T. Nature. 1984; 311: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid library thus obtained was transfected into COS-7 cells by the lipofection method using Transfectam (Sepracor, Marlborough, MA). The fusion proteins containing artificial amino-terminal signal sequences were sorted to the cell surface, retained on the plasma membrane by a transmembrane domain of Tac antigen, and detected by cell-surface immunostaining with anti-Tac antibody (23Uchiyama T. Broder S. Waldmann T.A. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1393-1397PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise, they remained intracellularly and were not recognized by the antibody. The 3′-RACE experiment was performed using Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Inc., Mountain View, CA) (24Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from the mouse kidney was reverse transcribed by oligo(dT)15 priming using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. After synthesis of the second-strand cDNA by the method of Gubler and Hoffman (25Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene. 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar) and ligation with the marathon cDNA adaptor, polymerase chain reaction was carried out using a 5′-gene-specific primer (5′-TGGAAAATCAAGTCCCTGGAAGTC-3′) (nucleotides −147 to −124, Fig. 1) and an adaptor primer (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′). The 3′-RACE product was subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) for sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain-termination method using Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit FS and 373B DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Phylogenetic tree of CAs and CA-related proteins was constructed by comparing the amino acid sequences of their CA or CA-like domains using the alignment algorithm of GeneWorks software (Oxford Molecular Group Inc., Campbell, CA), which is based on the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (26Nei M. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. Columbia University Press, New York1987: 293-298Google Scholar). All parameters were set as default values. The proteins analyzed were mouse CA XIV (amino acid positions 18–278), human CA I (2–261, from GenBankTM accession number X05014), CA II (2–259,Y00339), CA III (2–259, M29458), CA IV (19–285, M83670), CA V (37–296, L19297), CA VI (19–278, M57892), CA VII (3–262, M76423), CA IX (137–390, X66839), CA XII (28–289, AF037335/AF051882), RPTP β and γ (34-300, M93426 and 56-321, L09247), and CA VIII (25-289, from SwissProt accession number P35219). A full-length mouse CA XIV cDNA (nucleotides −12 to 1150) was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: sense, 5′-TGTGGGGATAATATGTTGTTCTTCG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGGTCCCTGGTGTATAGAGAGGG-3′. The nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The cDNA was ligated into theEcoRI restriction site of an expression vector pCXN2, a derivative of pCAGGS (27Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells using Transfectam. Cells were harvested 72 h later and homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 7.5) and 1 mm benzamidine (Sigma). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and separated into the membrane fraction and cytosolic fraction. CA activity was measured essentially as described by Sundaram et al. (28Sundaram V. Rumbolo P. Grubb J. Strisciuglio P. Sly W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 38: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-resistant CA activity was determined by measuring samples preincubated with 0.2% SDS before assay (29Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. CA activity was calculated by the following formula: CA activity (units/mg) = (T 0/T − 1)/C; where T 0 represents the reaction time for buffer alone (s); T, sample reaction time (s); C, protein content (mg). The reaction times were measured in triplicate, and the mean values were used to calculate CA activities. Northern blot analysis was performed as described with [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA insert of clone G31C5 (nucleotides −265 to 282) (15Mori K. Ogawa Y. Tamura N. Ebihara K. Aoki T. Muro S. Ozaki S. Tanaka I. Tashiro K. Nakao K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The blot was used to expose BAS-III imaging plate (Fuji, Kanagawa, Japan) for 40 h. Sense and antisense [35S]CTP-labeled cRNAs were generated from a partial cDNA fragment of the 3′-RACE product (nucleotides −147 to 698) using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega Corp.). In situhybridization analysis was performed as described previously (15Mori K. Ogawa Y. Tamura N. Ebihara K. Aoki T. Muro S. Ozaki S. Tanaka I. Tashiro K. Nakao K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Shigemoto R. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F823-F828PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 10-μm cryosections of the mouse kidney were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, fixed with paraformaldehyde, acetylated, and hybridized with the cRNA probes. Slides were washed, dehydrated, and apposed to Hyperfilm β-max films (Amersham Int., Buckinghamshire, UK) for 10 days, or dipped into autoradiographic emulsion (NTB-2, Eastman Kodak) and exposed for 10 weeks and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. 5,000 clones from the mouse kidney cDNA library were screened by the signal sequence trap method, and 25 positives were isolated. A positive clone G31C5 with a 555-base pair insert encoded a novel 94-amino acid polypeptide. To obtain the full-length cDNA, 3′-RACE was performed, and a 1.6-kilobase fragment was obtained and sequenced. The full-length cDNA encoded a novel CA-like protein with 337 amino acid residues, which had a calculated molecular mass of 37.5 kDa (Fig.1). Hydropathy analysis (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) predicted that the protein consists of a signal sequence, a CA domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short hydrophilic carboxyl terminus, which we designated CA XIV. CA XIV possessed an N-glycosylation motif in its CA domain and several potential phosphorylation sites by protein kinases A and C in the carboxyl terminus (33Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When clone G31C5 was expressed in COS-7 cells as an epitope-tagged protein, it was sorted to the cell surface and detected by cell surface immunostaining (see “Experimental Procedures”). These findings suggest that CA XIV is located on the plasma membrane with its CA domain facing extracellular space. The amino acid sequence of the CA domain of CA XIV was highly homologous with those of other members of the CA family (Fig.2). The amino acid identities were 43% for human CA IX and XII, 38% for CA VI and VII, 35% for CA I, II, III, and IV, 32% for CA V and VIII, and 31% for RPTP β and γ (3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The homologies were especially high in the putative CA active site residues including 3 conserved zinc-binding histidine residues (Fig. 1) (3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 34Tashian R.E. BioEssays. 1989; 10: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). When CA XIV was compared with CA VII, which is considered the common ancestor of the CA family (3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), as many as 30 of 36 active site residues were identical. These findings imply that CA XIV possesses CA activity (3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Homology search using TBLASTN algorithm (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of partial cDNA fragments of the putative human counterpart for CA XIV in the data bases, which are >80% identical to mouse CA XIV at the amino acid level, e.g. expressed sequence tag clones with GenBankTM accession numbersH82563, R87427, and AA401879. The structural conservation beyond species may suggest the physiological importance of CA XIV. To examine the evolutional history of CA XIV among the CA family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 2). The tree consisted of three clusters (3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The first cluster included intracellular CAs (CA I-III, V, and VII), and the third cluster included RPTP β and γ. CA XIV was most closely related to CA XII, followed by CA IX, VI, and IV, forming the second cluster. As shown in this study, CA XIV likely localizes on the plasma membrane, whereas CA IX is a membrane-bound protein that exists on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus (6Pastorek J. Pastorekova S. Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Zelnik V. Opavsky R. Zat'ovicova M. Liao S. Portetelle D. Stanbridge E.J. Zavada J. Burny A. Kettmann R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2877-2888PubMed Google Scholar), CA VI is a secreted type of CA (4Fernley R.T. Wright R.D. Coghlan J.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2815-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and CA IV is a CA attached to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage (36Okuyama T. Sato S. Zhu X.L. Waheed A. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 37Fleming R.E. Crouch E.C. Ruzicka C.A. Sly W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L627-L635PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the second cluster may be categorized as extracellular CAs. Consistent with their subcellular localization, CA IV, VI, IX, XII, and XIV possessed putative signal sequences in their amino termini (Fig. 2). To examine whether CA XIV has CA activity, the full-length cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells. The homogenate of mock-transfected cells exhibited low CA activity, which may be attributed to endogenous CAs (TableI). Transfection with the CA XIV cDNA resulted in an increase in CA activity by 5.2-fold. The membrane fraction of the homogenate possessed 2.1-fold higher activity than the whole homogenate. After the SDS treatment, which inactivates soluble CAs (29Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the CA activity decreased only by 27%. These findings indicate that CA XIV is located predominantly in the membrane fraction.Table ICA activity of CA XIV cDNA-expressing COS-7 cellsCA activityunits/mgMock-transfected3.8CA XIV-transfected19.6SDS-treated14.3Membrane-fraction40.4 Open table in a new tab Tissue distribution of CA XIV gene expression was investigated by Northern blot analysis (Fig.3). The CA XIV mRNA was 1.8 kilobases in size and was expressed most abundantly in the kidney and heart, followed by the skeletal muscle, liver, brain, and lung. No CA XIV transcript was detected in the intestine and spleen. The tissue distribution of CA XIV mRNA is very similar to that of CA IV mRNA, which is expressed in the colon, lung, brain, kidney, and heart but not in the intestine and spleen (37Fleming R.E. Crouch E.C. Ruzicka C.A. Sly W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L627-L635PubMed Google Scholar). The intrarenal localization of CA XIV was determined by in situ hybridization analysis with the antisense and sense cRNA probes (Fig.4). At autoradiograph with the antisense probe, strong hybridizing signals were observed in the cortex. At photomicrograph, these signals were confined to the proximal convoluted tubule, which is known as the most important segment for bicarbonate reabsorption in the nephron (10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar). At autoradiograph, moderate signals were also seen in the outer border of the inner stripe of the outer medulla. In view of shape, position, number, and comparison with previous reports using histochemical methods (38Dobyan D.C. Magill L.S. Friedman P.A. Hebert S.C. Bulger R.E. Anat. Rec. 1982; 204: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Ridderstrale Y. Wistrand P.J. Tashian R.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these signals most likely correspond to the initial portion of long loop of the thin descending limb of Henle. Physiological roles of CAs in the thin descending limb of Henle still remain to be elucidated (10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar, 40Schwartz M.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Kidney Int. 1974; 6: 193-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Identification of specific inhibitors for CA XIV may facilitate our understanding concerning such issues (2Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar). No specific signals were seen in sections hybridized with the sense probe (not shown). In the kidney, two CA isoenzymes, CA II and CA IV, have been well characterized (10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar). CA II is a cytosolic isoenzyme localized in the intercalated cells of the distal tubule and collecting duct, and the thin descending limb of Henle (41Spicer S.S. Stoward P.J. Tashian R.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 820-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 42Brown D. Kumpulainen T. Roth J. Orci L. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F110-F118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, CA IV is a membrane-bound isoenzyme localized in the proximal convoluted tubule and the thick ascending limb of Henle (43Brown D. Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, the intrarenal localization of CA XIV is distinct from those of CA II and CA IV, suggesting its unique function in the kidney. CA XIV resembles CA IV in that it has a putative signal sequence in its amino terminus, is membrane-bound, and likely locates on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the tissue distribution of CA XIV is also very similar to that of CA IV. However, CA XIV and CA IV differ in two points. First, the intrarenal localizations of CA XIV and CA IV differ. Although they both localize in the proximal convoluted tubule, CA XIV likely localizes also in the thin descending limb of Henle, whereas CA IV localizes in the thick ascending limb of Henle. Second, CA XIV is presumed to locate on the plasma membrane by a transmembrane domain, whereas, in case of CA IV, the transmembrane domain in the extreme carboxyl terminus of the precursor protein is cleaved off, and the mature protein is bound to the plasma membrane by a GPI anchor (36Okuyama T. Sato S. Zhu X.L. Waheed A. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 37Fleming R.E. Crouch E.C. Ruzicka C.A. Sly W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L627-L635PubMed Google Scholar). The GPI-anchored form of CA IV is released from the membrane by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment (36Okuyama T. Sato S. Zhu X.L. Waheed A. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although CA IV was defined as a membrane-bound isoenzyme of CA (2Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 10Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's the Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 408-471Google Scholar), approximately half of the membrane-bound CA activity in the kidney still remains after PI-PLC treatment (29Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One interpretation for this finding is that some part of CA IV exists as a membrane-spanning form, which is PI-PLC insensitive (29Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet it is also possible that other membrane-bound CAs are present in the kidney. A novel CA described here, CA XIV, is one of such candidates. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel CA designated CA XIV. The primary structure and the expression studies suggest that CA XIV is a type I membrane protein localized on the plasma membrane. Because CA XIV mRNA is expressed abundantly in various tissues and CA XIV has enzyme activity, CA XIV may play important roles in carbon dioxide metabolism and acid-base balance in the kidney and other tissues."

These data substantiate the existence of a molecular pathway for co-regulation of some ς54 promoters in which IIANtr is a key protein intermediate. Pseudomonas putida cells harboring the catabolic TOL plasmid pWW0 degrade toluene, m-xylene, andp-xylene through a pathway encoded by two separate operons (1Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The upper operon encodes enzymes for the oxidation of the methyl group of toluene, whereas the lower operon determines activities for the fission of the aromatic ring leading to pyruvate and acetaldehyde (2Assinder S.J. Williams P.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1990; 31: 1-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upper operon is transcribed from the ς54-dependent promoter Pu, which is activated at a distance by the pWW0-borne regulator called XylR, of the NtrC family of proteins, in response to pathway substrates (1Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Like other enhancer binding proteins, XylR has the modular structure common to this type of activator (3Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XylR variants devoid of its N-terminal module (called the A domain), activate transcription fromPu (4Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in the absence of inducers. Besides XylR and the form of RNA polymerase containing ς54(ς54-RNAP), Pu activation also requires the integration host factor, which both favors a DNA geometry optimal for the interplay of the different factors (6de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9392-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and assists the binding of the RNA polymerase (8Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The comparison of Pu promoter activity in vitroand in vivo has revealed a paradox that determines the regulation of this promoter under real environmental conditions (9de Lorenzo V. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 365-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although Pu is active in vitro by just mixing purified and preactivated XylR (i.e. deleted of its N-terminal domain) with ς54-RNAP and integration host factor (5Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), promoter activity in vivo is down-regulated by various growth conditions (10Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Köhler T. Rekik M. Harayama S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Holtel A. Marqués S. Möhler I. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J.

In particular, the presence in the medium of carbon sources like glucose, gluconate, and α-ketogluconate inhibit Pu activity, whereas other compounds (citrate and fructose) do not seem to have any influence (11Holtel A. Marqués S. Möhler I. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this phenomenon is unknown. In enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, glucose repression is mediated mainly by the cAMP receptor protein (17Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the PTS 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; ORF, open reading frame; Sm, streptomycin; Km, kanamycin; kb, kilobase pair(s); IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; ORF, open reading frame; Sm, streptomycin; Km, kanamycin; kb, kilobase pair(s); IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (18Postma P.W. Lengeler J.N. Jacobson R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is a complex and very branched whole of phosphotransfer proteins that mediate the intake of certain carbohydrates (which vary widely among species) through a mechanism involving the simultaneous phosphorylation of the sugar and its transport (18Postma P.W. Lengeler J.N. Jacobson R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of adequate carbohydrates in the external medium that act as a drain of high energy phosphate determines the accumulation or the depletion of phosphorylated protein intermediates that have the ability to interact with and modify the activity of many other cell proteins. The PTS proteins have been traditionally classified as enzymes type I, HPr, and enzymes type II, the latter frequently involving a multiprotein array (18Postma P.W. Lengeler J.N. Jacobson R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As opposed to the situation in E. coli, cAMP appears to play no role in carbon repression in pseudomonads (19Collier D.N. Hager P.W. Phibbs Jr, P.V. Res. Microbiol. 1996; 147: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In fact, the known cAMP receptor protein analogue in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (called Vfr) is fully alien to carbon regulation (20Runyen-Janecky L.J. Sample A.K. Maleniak T.C. West H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Albus A.M. Pesci E.C. Runyen-Janecky L.J. West S.E. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3928-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other hand glucose, which inhibits Pu activity (11Holtel A. Marqués S. Möhler I. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is not transported in Pseudomonas through the PTS (22Vicente M. Canovas J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 908-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus making unlikely an involvement of the housekeeping PTS intermediates in the effect. Finally fructose, which is transported through the PTS system in Pseudomonas (23Sawyer M.H. Baumann P. Berman S.M. Canovas J.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 112: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) does not inhibitPu activity. The mechanism should therefore be different of those known for other systems subjected to catabolite control. An early clue on additional regulatory mechanisms for ς54-dependent promoters in vivowas revealed by the sequencing of the DNA region around the gene encoding the sigma factor (rpoN) in Klebsiella pneumoniae (24Merrick M.J. Coppard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and E. coli (25Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In both speciesrpoN is followed by four open reading frames later named ORF95, ptsN, ORF284, and ptsO (see Fig.1 A). Homologues of most of these genes have also been found adjacent to rpoN in various other Gram-negative species (26Kullik I. Fritsche S. Knobel H. Sanjuan J. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. J.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including P. aeruginosa (31Jin S. Ishimoto K. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and P. putida (32Köhler T. Fernández-Alvárez J. Harayama S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 115: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two of the most conserved ORFs, ptsN andptsO, encode proteins with a considerable sequence similarity with known intermediates of the PTS sugar transport system. In particular, ptsN appears to encode a IIA-type enzyme, whereas ptsO seems to be a variant HPr protein (25Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The corresponding proteins have been designated as IIANtr and NPr, respectively, on the basis of their hypothetical involvement in N metabolism (25Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This was initially suggested by the observation that disruption of the ptsN gene of K. pneumoniae(originally called ORF152) or the adjacent ORF95 increased to various degrees the activity of the ς54-dependent promoter PnifH (24Merrick M.J. Coppard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas the loss of ptsOgene reduced it significantly (33Merrick M.J. Taylor M. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Tikhonovich E. Nitrogen Fixation: Fundamentals and Applications. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1995Google Scholar). On the contrary, mutations in the equivalent ptsN (ORF2) gene P. aeruginosa did not affect the activity of the ς54-dependent promoters for pilae and flagellin genes (31Jin S. Ishimoto K. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, some (but not all) ς54-dependent promoters tested ofCaulobacter and Rhizobium become less active upon the loss of ptsN (29Janakiraman R.S. Brun Y.V. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5138-5147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein may also be involved in more general metabolic activities, because the E. coli ptsNmutant displayed certain incompatibilities between C and N sources, typically glucose and alanine (25Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition this mutation also suppressed a temperature-sensitive allele of the gene era, which encodes an essential GTPase of unknown function (25Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Taken together, the observations above suggest that ptsN and the accompanying genes of the cluster may play a role not only in expression of ς54-dependent promoters but also in their potential connection to N and C metabolism (34Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr, M.H. Jacobson G.R. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because such a connection with the central metabolism could account for the C source regulation observed in promoters such as Pu (11Holtel A. Marqués S. Möhler I. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to explore the issue systematically in a well defined genetic assay system. The data presented in this work show that theptsN gene of P. putida, formerly called ORF154 (32Köhler T. Fernández-Alvárez J. Harayama S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 115: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), participates in the inhibition of the Pu promoter of the TOL plasmid by glucose and that such inhibition involves a phosphorylation site of the ptsN-encoded IIA-type enzyme. P. putida MAD2 (4Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was used in all cases to examine Puactivity. This strain is a derivative of P. putida KT2442 bearing a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion along with thexylR allele named xylRΔA, all assembled within a tellurite resistance (Telr) mini-transposon vector. The loss of the N-terminal A domain of the protein makes XylR constitutively active in the absence of aromatic inducers (4Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in either rich LB medium or in synthetic mineral M9 medium (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To test carbon inhibition of promoter activity, the M9-CAA medium was amended with glucose, gluconate, or fructose at a final concentration of 10 mm. Overnight cultures of P. putida MAD2 or its derivatives were diluted to an A 600 of approximately 0.05 in fresh medium and regrown at 30 °C until the end of the exponential phase (A 600 of approximately 1.0). Samples were collected 30 min after this point, and promoter activity was measured by assaying the accumulation of β-galactosidase in cells permeabilized with chloroform and SDS as described by Miller (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Each enzymatic measurement was repeated at least twice, and deviations were less than 15%. The concentration of glucose and gluconate in culture supernatants were determined as described by Schleissner et al. (38Schleissner C. Reglero A. Luengo J.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When required, the culture medium was supplemented with streptomycin (Sm; 50 μg/ml), kanamycin (Km; 50 μg/ml), ampicillin (150 μg/ml), and potassium tellurite (80 μg/ml). Plasmids were generally maintained in E. coli DH5α andE. coli CC118 strains, although those containing conditional R6K replication origins were hosted in E. coli strain CC118λpir (39de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). DNA was manipulated following standard protocols (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For constructing pJM154 (a ptsN +broad host range plasmid), a 0.78-kb PstI fragment from pARG5.1 (spanning the corresponding chromosomal region of P. putida; Ref. 40Köhler T. Harayama S. Ramos J.L. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4326-4333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned in pNot18. This vector is a variant of pUC18 in which the entire α-lac segment and thePlac promoter of the plasmid are flanked by NotI sites (41Sánchez-Romero J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. de Lorenzo V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4040-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The result of this cloning step was plasmid pNot18–154, in which the promoterless ptsN sequence is transcribed through the Plac promoter of the α-lac segment. The corresponding 1.2-kb NotI portion of pNot18–154 was then excised and cloned in the single NotI site of pJPS9, a mobilizable derivative of the broad host range pPS10 replicon bearing an Sm resistance gene (41Sánchez-Romero J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. de Lorenzo V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4040-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When required, the resulting construction (pJM154) was mobilized into P. putida recipients through triparental matings with helper strain E. coli HB101 (RK2013) as described by de Lorenzo and Timmis (39de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). For the polymerase chain reaction, separate colonies of the strains under scrutiny were resuspended in 10 μl of H2O and boiled for 5 min. 1 μl of this material was diluted 100-fold and directly subjected to 25 cycles (1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) of amplification with Taq polymerase in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, and 50 pmol of the primers indicated in each case. DNA sequencing (kindly performed by E. Diaz) was carried out by applying a primer walking strategy along the insert of plasmid pDORF2 (see below) with fluorescent dNTPs. The sequence of the rpoN region has been deposited in the EMBL nucleotide sequence data bank under the reference PPU007699. Stepwise nonpolar knockouts of the four genes adjacent to rpoN were first generated in plasmids by directed insertions of a promoterless Km resistance cassette devoid of transcriptional termination signals. Such a cassette was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the sequence within coordinates 1920 to 2732 of pACYC177 (42Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting 0.8-kb DNA fragment was then recovered as a BamHI insert in pUC19 giving rise to plasmid pUCKm. Insertions in each of the ORFs were achieved as follows. A 3.2-kb SalI-ScaI fragment from plasmid pNTR1 (spanning rpoN and 1.5 kb downstream; Ref. 40Köhler T. Harayama S. Ramos J.L. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4326-4333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned in vector pBlueScript KS+digested with SmaI and SalI. To generate a Km insertion in ORF102, the resulting plasmid (pBSNtr) was digested withHindIII, and the overhanging ends were filled in with dNTPs using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and ligated to an equally filled in 0.8-kb segment of pUCKm bearing the promoterless kanamycin cassette mentioned above. The resulting plasmid (pBSN102) bears ORF102 truncated at its 46th codon. Similarly, disruption ofptsN required the digestion of pBSNtr with SmaI and its ligation to the blunt-ended kanamycin cassette of pUCKm. In the resulting plasmid (pBSN154) the Km resistance phenotype became apparent only when two cassettes were inserted in tandem, disruptingptsN at its 53th structural codon. To knockout ORF284, the 1.2-kb XmaI fragment from pARG5.1 was ligated to the 2.3-kbXmaI fragment of the pHP45Ω (43Prentki P. Kirch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pHP284 was digested with BamHI/BglII and ligated to the 0.8-kb BamHI fragment from pUCKm, giving rise to pHP284Km. In this plasmid, the 853 nucleotides following the 3rd structural codon of ORF283 have been replaced by the Kmrcassette. The 1.2-kb fragment resulting from partial digestion of pHP284Km with XmaI was then used to replace the corresponding XmaI fragment in plasmid pDORF2. This is a pNot19 derivative containing a 3.4-kbEcoRI/HindIII fragment from pARG5.1, spanningptsN, ORF284, ptsO and 1.5 kb further downstream. The exchange of XmaI segments between pHP284Km and pDORF2 rendered plasmid pDORFK. Disruption of ptsO was engineered by first cloning the 0.8-kb SalI fragment of pARG5.1 into pNot18 (41Sánchez-Romero J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. de Lorenzo V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4040-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) thereby originating plasmid pNot18-90. This one was digested with SmaI and ligated to the blunt-ended 0.8-kbBamHI segment of pUCKm encoding the promoterless Km cassette, thus yielding the plasmid pNot18-90Km, which encodes a NPr protein truncated at position 16 of its predicted amino acid sequence. To transfer the various insertions into the chromosome of P. putida MAD2, the SalI-BamHI fragments of each of the pBSNtr derivatives bearing Km insertions in ORF102 (pBSN102) and ptsN (pBSN154) as well as the NotI fragments from pDORFK (ORF284::Km) and pNot18-90Km (ptsO::Km) were cloned in pKNG101 (44Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), a mobilizable suicide vector bearing the positive counter selection marker sacB. The resulting plasmids pKNG102, pKNG154, pKNG284, and pKNG90 were transferred to P. putida MAD2 through triparental matings with helper strain E. coli HB101 (RK2013) as described above. Homologous recombination of the mutated ORFs in the Pseudomonas chromosome was made by first selecting cointegrates of the suicide plasmids on LB plates with Km, Sm, and potassium tellurite (potassium tellurite for counterselection of the donor and helper strains). Plates with approximately 1000 exconjugant colonies were kept for 1 week at 4 °C, pooled in 1 ml of 1% NaCl and then replated in LB with Km and 5% sucrose for selection of a second recombination event. The colonies grown in such a medium were then scored for sensitivity to Sm. Those with a phenotype Sms Kmr were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides spanning the first and last codon of each gene as follows. Disruption of ORF102 was verified with primers ORF102D (5′-ATGCAGAATTCTTTCAGTCAATATCAGTGGACAG-3′) and ORF102R (5′-CGGGATCCTCAGCGGGCAGCTGCACCTTGCAG-3′). TheptsN::Km knockout was confirmed with primers ORF154D (5′-ATGCAGAATTCTTTCACGACTTGAAACCATCCTGACC-3′) and ORF154R (5′-CGGGATCCTCAGTGCTCGTTCTGTACGTCCAG-3′). Disruption of ORF284 was verified with primers ORF284D (5′-GCGGATCCC GCCTGATCATCGTC-3′) and ORF284R (5′-ATCGCAAGCTTCTAGAGGTCGCGATG-3′). Finally, insertion of the Km gene in the ptsO coding sequence was authenticated with primers ORF90D (5′-GCGGATCCCGCCCGCGAAATC-3′) and ORF90R (5′-ATCGCAAGCTTCCTATTCGCCTTCGTCAAA-3′). The method developed by Kunkel et al. (45Kunkel T. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) was used to generate the H68A and H68D variants of ptsN. To this end, the SalI-BamHI fragment of pBSN102 described above was cloned in vector pGC2 (46Meyrs R.M. Lerman L.S. Maniatis T. Science. 1985; 229: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Extension in vitro of the single-stranded, uracyl-containing DNA from the resulting plasmid (pGC154) was primed independently with mutagenic oligonucleotides PTSNH68A (5′-GGCATCGCCATCCCAGCATGCCGGCTTGAAGGA-3′) for H68A substitution and PTSNH68D (5′-GGCATCGCCATTCCG GACTGCCGGCTTGAAGGA-3′) for the H68D mutant (the changed nucleotides are shown in bold, and the triplets corresponding to the new amino acid residues are underlined). These changes introduced new SphI and BspEI restriction sites, respectively, to facilitate the screening of the mutants. The resulting plasmids, pGC154-H68A and pGC154-H68D were used as templates for amplification with polymerase chain reaction of the new alleles with primers ORF154D and ORF154R, which incorporate newEcoRI and BamHI sites in the 5′ and 3′ ends of the resulting amplification products. This amplification step modified the N terminus of the mutant proteins from MI to MGILS. The resulting 0.45-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragments were cloned in the pVTR-B expression vector (47Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), originating plasmids pVTR154-H68A and pVTR154-H68D. Their NotI inserts containing the mutant alleles under the control of an inducible Ptrc promoter and the lacI q gene were cloned into the singleNotI site of pJPS9 vector (41Sánchez-Romero J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. de Lorenzo V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4040-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), creating plasmids pJMT/154-H68A and pJMT/154-H68D. An equivalent plasmid (pJMT/154) containing the wild type ptsN allele was also constructed and used as a control. Each of the three resulting plasmids were transferred to the wild type P. putida MAD2 or P. putida MAD2 ptsN::Km strains by triparental mating as described above. Western blot assays to detect theptsN product were made as described in Cases et al. (16Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To this end, equal amounts of wholePseudomonas cells (typically 108) were lysed in a sample buffer with 2% SDS and 5% β-mercapthoethanol and run in denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. These were subsequently blotted and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of a preadsorbed rabbit serum raised against a purified MalE-IIANtr fusion protein expressed inE. coli. The bands in the blots corresponding to the product of ptsN were developed with protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase and H2O2/diamino-benzidine as described in Cases et al. (16Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The rpoN gene of P. putida was reported by Köhler et al. (48Köhler T. Cayrol J.M. Ramos J.L. Harayama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to be followed by two ORFs that were called at that time ORF102 and ORF154 (32Köhler T. Fernández-Alvárez J. Harayama S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 115: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To visualize the complete organization of the region, we sequenced 1.35 kb of the DNA further downstream. The presence of two additional genes (ORF284 and ptsO) completed the overall picture of the locus in this bacterium (Fig. 1 B). BesidesrpoN itself, the region includes a gene cluster located 78 base pairs downstream and consisting of four adjacent cistrons. Distances from ORF102 to ptsN or from ORF284 toptsO are as small as 13 and 16 base pairs, respectively. TheptsN sequence overlaps by 1 base pair with that of ORF284. Such an organization resembles with relatively minor differences that found in E. coli (49Jones D.H. Franklin F.C. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and K. pneumoniae (33Merrick M.J. Taylor M. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Tikhonovich E.

In animal cells, mitochondria, as well as peroxisomes, oxidize fatty acids via β-oxidation, with long chain and very long chain fatty acids being preferentially oxidized by peroxisomes (1Lazarow P.B. de Duve C.

Peroxisomal β-oxidation process is carried out by two distinct groups of enzymes; the classical first group utilizes straight chain saturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, whereas the recently discovered second group acts on branched chain acyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T.

Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The third enzyme of this classical system, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (PTL) cleaves 3-ketoacyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA, and an acyl-CoA that is two carbon atoms shorter than the original molecule can re-enter the β-oxidation spiral (1Lazarow P.B. de Duve C.

In the second d-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation pathway, dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA esters to their corresponding trans-2-enoyl-CoAs is catalyzed by the branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase (2Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), with the recently identifiedd-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/d-3-hydroxyacl-CoA dehydrogenase (d-bifunctional enzyme (d-PBE)), converting enoyl-CoAs to 3-ketoacyl-CoAs via d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13748-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The third enzyme of this second system is designated as sterol carrier protein x (SCPx), which possesses 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity (5Mori T. Tsukumoto T. Mori H. Tashiro Y. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4338-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Of these two peroxisomal β-oxidation systems, the enzymes belonging to the classical group are markedly induced in the liver of rats and mice in conjunction with profound proliferation of peroxisomes by a group of structurally diverse agents designated as peroxisome proliferators (6Reddy J.K. Krishnakantha T.P. Science. 1975; 190: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). They exert their pleiotropic effects by activating a nuclear receptor called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (7Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). Sustained induction of PPARα-mediated peroxisome proliferation and transcriptional activation of classical β-oxidation system genes lead to the development of liver tumors in rats and mice (8Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is postulated that H2O2 overproduced by the induction of this β-oxidation system and cell proliferation contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in livers with peroxisome proliferation (8Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1702-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional implications of PPARα-regulated l-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation system, we recently generated mice deficient in AOX, the first enzyme of this inducible system, and found that they exhibit steatohepatitis and spontaneous peroxisome proliferation in liver cells (10Fan C.-Y.

These results suggested that straight chain acyl-CoAs and other putative substrates for classical AOX serve as natural ligands for PPARα, and this enzyme is indispensable for the physiological regulation of PPARα (10Fan C.-Y.

Here, we describe the generation of mice homozygous for a disruption of the l-PBE gene, which encodes the second enzyme of this β-oxidation spiral and report that these mice do not exhibit phenotypic alterations such as those found in AOX null mice, further confirming that disruption of this classical β-oxidation pathway distal to AOX does not affect the metabolism of natural ligands of PPARα.DISCUSSIONThe classical peroxisome proliferator-induciblel-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system that acts on long and very long straight chain acyl-CoAs, long chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs, and the CoA esters of prostaglandins consists of AOX, l-PBE, and PTL (2Reddy J.K.

The second noninducibled-3-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system that acts on branch chain acyl-CoAs also contains three enzymes namely, branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, d-PBE, and SCPx (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Marynen P. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove J. Leunissen J.A.M. Fahimi H.D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Straight chain acyl-CoAs are almost exclusively metabolized by classical AOX and not by d-hydroxy-specific branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, although the enzymes ofd-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation pathway reveal minor catalytic activity toward straight chain acyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Marynen P. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove J. Leunissen J.A.M. Fahimi H.D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P.

The gene targeting construct we used was designed to eliminate the entire exon 4, and the selectable gene cassette used to disrupt the l-PBE gene introduced nonsense mutation in all reading frames. Polymerase chain reaction as well as Southern blot analysis revealed that ES cells contained the correct targeted event, and Northern blot analysis revealed that liver froml-PBE−/− mice fed either a control diet or peroxisome proliferator-containing diet did not contain a detectable message corresponding to the l-PBE probe. Thel-PBE−/− mice displayed no authenticl-PBE protein on Western blot analysis; thel-PBE antibody we used was raised against ratl-PBE, and in mouse liver, it recognized a nonspecific protein band, designated protein x, the identity of which, however, remains to be determined (Fig. 1 D). By immunogold technique, this protein x was detected in mitochondria and not in peroxisomes ofl-PBE−/−mice, further confirming thel-PBE null mutation. It is also worth noting that this protein x was not induced in the livers of wild type andl-PBE−/− mice treated with peroxisome proliferators. Peroxisome of l-PBE−/− mice did not reveal any staining for l-PBE by immunogold procedure (Fig.3 C), and when these animals were treated with a peroxisome proliferator, the liver parenchymal cells failed to show any immunohistochemically detectable l-PBE protein (Fig. 2). These observations unequivocally establish the disruption ofl-PBE gene, and the absence of l-PBE mRNA and protein, therefore, establish the functional inactivation of this gene.The striking results observed in thesel-PBE−/− mice were the absence of hepatic steatosis and of spontaneous peroxisome proliferation such as that found in the livers of young AOX−/− mice (10Fan C.-Y.

These observations provide strong evidence that the classical AOX of thel-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation system is responsible for the metabolism of all putative ligands of PPARα and thatl-PBE enzyme immediately downstream of AOX is not essential for the successful completion of the l-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation. It would appear that once the long and very long straight chain acyl-CoAs, long chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs, and the CoA esters of prostaglandins are converted into their respective enoyl-CoAs by the classical AOX, these can be metabolized by d-PBE of the d-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system (Fig. 9) or even by the mitochondrial β-oxidations system. In essence, the AOX null and l-PBE null mouse models we generated convincingly prove that classical AOX is pivotal for the metabolic degradation of PPARα ligands and not the branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase of the second system. Further studies, however, are needed to rule out the possibility that straight chain enoyl-CoAs generated by classical AOX, if left unmetabolized, serve as PPARα ligands (10Fan C.-Y. Pan J. Usuda N.

J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). This issue can be explored by generating mice deficient in both l-PBE and d-PBE and characterizing their liver phenotype.Of further interest is that l-PBE−/− mice, when challenged with a peroxisome proliferator, exhibited somewhat blunted hepatic peroxisome proliferative response, although there were no significant differences in other immediate or early pleiotropic responses attributable to PPARα activation, with the single notable, but expected exception that l-PBE mRNA and protein are undetectable in l-PBE−/− mouse livers. Thus, the blunting of peroxisome proliferative response is attributed to the absence of l-PBE protein in l-PBE null animals. It is important to note that l-PBE, a 78-kilodalton protein, is massively induced in the livers of wild type mice exposed to peroxisome proliferators (22Reddy J.K. Kumar N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This protein, once called peroxisome proliferator-activated polypeptide (22Reddy J.K. Kumar N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), becomes the most abundant protein in the livers of peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and mice, contributing substantially to the morphological phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation. The l-PBE null mutation abolishes the inducibility of l-PBE in response to peroxisome proliferators, and this most likely accounts for the blunting of peroxisome proliferative response, because all other PPARα responsive genes in l-PBE−/−mice are up-regulated. Therefore, it is conceivable that changes in the levels of expression of l-PBE gene in nonrodent species in response to peroxisome proliferators may influence the morphological phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation, whereas other effects of these PPARα ligands in nonrodent species may be similar to those seen in rats and mice. It would be of great interest to investigate whetherl-PBE−/−mice develop liver tumors following chronic exposure to peroxisome proliferators, despite the subdued nature of peroxisome proliferative response, because all other PPARα-regulated genes are up-regulated. In animal cells, mitochondria, as well as peroxisomes, oxidize fatty acids via β-oxidation, with long chain and very long chain fatty acids being preferentially oxidized by peroxisomes (1Lazarow P.B. de Duve C.

Peroxisomal β-oxidation process is carried out by two distinct groups of enzymes; the classical first group utilizes straight chain saturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, whereas the recently discovered second group acts on branched chain acyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Marynen P. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove J. Leunissen J.A.M. Fahimi H.D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P.

In thel-hydroxy-specific classical β-oxidation spiral, dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA esters to their correspondingtrans-2-enoyl-CoAs is catalyzed by fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), 1The abbreviations used are: AOX, straight chain fatty acyl-CoA oxidase or palmitoyl-CoA oxidase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; l-PBE, enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (l-bifunctional enzyme); d-PBE, d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/d-3-hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase (d-bifunctional enzyme); PTL, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; CYP4A1 and CYP4A3, encode microsomal cytochrome P450 fatty acid ω-hydroxylases; SCPx, sterol carrier protein x or 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/sterol carrier protein 2; LCAD, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; VLCAD, very LCAD; CTL, catalase; ES, embryonic stem cells; kb, kilobase(s)1The abbreviations used are: AOX, straight chain fatty acyl-CoA oxidase or palmitoyl-CoA oxidase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; l-PBE, enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (l-bifunctional enzyme); d-PBE, d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/d-3-hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase (d-bifunctional enzyme); PTL, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; CYP4A1 and CYP4A3, encode microsomal cytochrome P450 fatty acid ω-hydroxylases; SCPx, sterol carrier protein x or 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/sterol carrier protein 2; LCAD, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; VLCAD, very LCAD; CTL, catalase; ES, embryonic stem cells; kb, kilobase(s) whereas the second and third reactions, hydration and dehydrogenation of enoyl-CoA esters to 3-ketoacyl-CoA, are carried out by a single enzyme, enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (l-bifunctional enzyme (l-PBE)) (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The third enzyme of this classical system, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (PTL) cleaves 3-ketoacyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA, and an acyl-CoA that is two carbon atoms shorter than the original molecule can re-enter the β-oxidation spiral (1Lazarow P.B. de Duve C.

Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In the second d-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation pathway, dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA esters to their corresponding trans-2-enoyl-CoAs is catalyzed by the branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase (2Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), with the recently identifiedd-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/d-3-hydroxyacl-CoA dehydrogenase (d-bifunctional enzyme (d-PBE)), converting enoyl-CoAs to 3-ketoacyl-CoAs via d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13748-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The third enzyme of this second system is designated as sterol carrier protein x (SCPx), which possesses 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity (5Mori T. Tsukumoto T. Mori H. Tashiro Y. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4338-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of these two peroxisomal β-oxidation systems, the enzymes belonging to the classical group are markedly induced in the liver of rats and mice in conjunction with profound proliferation of peroxisomes by a group of structurally diverse agents designated as peroxisome proliferators (6Reddy J.K. Krishnakantha T.P. Science. 1975; 190: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). They exert their pleiotropic effects by activating a nuclear receptor called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (7Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). Sustained induction of PPARα-mediated peroxisome proliferation and transcriptional activation of classical β-oxidation system genes lead to the development of liver tumors in rats and mice (8Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is postulated that H2O2 overproduced by the induction of this β-oxidation system and cell proliferation contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in livers with peroxisome proliferation (8Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1702-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional implications of PPARα-regulated l-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation system, we recently generated mice deficient in AOX, the first enzyme of this inducible system, and found that they exhibit steatohepatitis and spontaneous peroxisome proliferation in liver cells (10Fan C.-Y.

These results suggested that straight chain acyl-CoAs and other putative substrates for classical AOX serve as natural ligands for PPARα, and this enzyme is indispensable for the physiological regulation of PPARα (10Fan C.-Y.

Here, we describe the generation of mice homozygous for a disruption of the l-PBE gene, which encodes the second enzyme of this β-oxidation spiral and report that these mice do not exhibit phenotypic alterations such as those found in AOX null mice, further confirming that disruption of this classical β-oxidation pathway distal to AOX does not affect the metabolism of natural ligands of PPARα. DISCUSSIONThe classical peroxisome proliferator-induciblel-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system that acts on long and very long straight chain acyl-CoAs, long chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs, and the CoA esters of prostaglandins consists of AOX, l-PBE, and PTL (2Reddy J.K.

The second noninducibled-3-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system that acts on branch chain acyl-CoAs also contains three enzymes namely, branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, d-PBE, and SCPx (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Marynen P. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove J. Leunissen J.A.M. Fahimi H.D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Straight chain acyl-CoAs are almost exclusively metabolized by classical AOX and not by d-hydroxy-specific branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, although the enzymes ofd-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation pathway reveal minor catalytic activity toward straight chain acyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Marynen P. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove J. Leunissen J.A.M. Fahimi H.D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P.

The second noninducibled-3-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system that acts on branch chain acyl-CoAs also contains three enzymes namely, branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, d-PBE, and SCPx (3Hashimoto T.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Straight chain acyl-CoAs are almost exclusively metabolized by classical AOX and not by d-hydroxy-specific branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, although the enzymes ofd-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation pathway reveal minor catalytic activity toward straight chain acyl-CoAs (3Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Marynen P. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove J. Leunissen J.A.M. Fahimi H.D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P.

This assumption is supported by the observations in mice deficient in classical AOX as they exhibit sustained up-regulation of PPARα-induced genes along with spontaneous peroxisome proliferation in liver parenchymal cells, indicating that thisl-hydroxy-specific AOX is crucial for metabolically degrading biological ligands of PPARα (10Fan C.-Y.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 89: 4653-4657Google Scholar). Because this classical β-oxidation system degrades long and very long straight chain fatty acids, long chain dicarboxylic acids, and prostaglandins or their respective CoAs, it is reasonable to conclude that these and possibly other yet to be identified substrates ofl-hydroxy-specific AOX act as natural ligands of PPARα (10Fan C.-Y.

These AOX-deficient mice also highlight the fact that substrates of this classical AOX that function as PPARα ligands are not degraded by d-hydroxy-specific branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase.

These mutant mice will also be valuable in investigating the role of the enzymes of lipid metabolism in regulating the function of PPARα and possibly other receptors (10Fan C.-Y. Pan J. Usuda N.

There are several lines of evidence that support the view that the mice we generated in this study contain a null mutation in thel-PBE gene. The gene targeting construct we used was designed to eliminate the entire exon 4, and the selectable gene cassette used to disrupt the l-PBE gene introduced nonsense mutation in all reading frames. Polymerase chain reaction as well as Southern blot analysis revealed that ES cells contained the correct targeted event, and Northern blot analysis revealed that liver froml-PBE−/− mice fed either a control diet or peroxisome proliferator-containing diet did not contain a detectable message corresponding to the l-PBE probe. Thel-PBE−/− mice displayed no authenticl-PBE protein on Western blot analysis; thel-PBE antibody we used was raised against ratl-PBE, and in mouse liver, it recognized a nonspecific protein band, designated protein x, the identity of which, however, remains to be determined (Fig. 1 D). By immunogold technique, this protein x was detected in mitochondria and not in peroxisomes ofl-PBE−/−mice, further confirming thel-PBE null mutation. It is also worth noting that this protein x was not induced in the livers of wild type andl-PBE−/− mice treated with peroxisome proliferators. Peroxisome of l-PBE−/− mice did not reveal any staining for l-PBE by immunogold procedure (Fig.3 C), and when these animals were treated with a peroxisome proliferator, the liver parenchymal cells failed to show any immunohistochemically detectable l-PBE protein (Fig. 2). These observations unequivocally establish the disruption ofl-PBE gene, and the absence of l-PBE mRNA and protein, therefore, establish the functional inactivation of this gene. The striking results observed in thesel-PBE−/− mice were the absence of hepatic steatosis and of spontaneous peroxisome proliferation such as that found in the livers of young AOX−/− mice (10Fan C.-Y. Pan J. Usuda N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15639-15645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These observations provide strong evidence that the classical AOX of thel-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation system is responsible for the metabolism of all putative ligands of PPARα and thatl-PBE enzyme immediately downstream of AOX is not essential for the successful completion of the l-hydroxy-specific β-oxidation. It would appear that once the long and very long straight chain acyl-CoAs, long chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs, and the CoA esters of prostaglandins are converted into their respective enoyl-CoAs by the classical AOX, these can be metabolized by d-PBE of the d-hydroxy-specific peroxisomal β-oxidation system (Fig. 9) or even by the mitochondrial β-oxidations system. In essence, the AOX null and l-PBE null mouse models we generated convincingly prove that classical AOX is pivotal for the metabolic degradation of PPARα ligands and not the branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase of the second system. Further studies, however, are needed to rule out the possibility that straight chain enoyl-CoAs generated by classical AOX, if left unmetabolized, serve as PPARα ligands (10Fan C.-Y. Pan J. Usuda N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15639-15645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). This issue can be explored by generating mice deficient in both l-PBE and d-PBE and characterizing their liver phenotype. Of further interest is that l-PBE−/− mice, when challenged with a peroxisome proliferator, exhibited somewhat blunted hepatic peroxisome proliferative response, although there were no significant differences in other immediate or early pleiotropic responses attributable to PPARα activation, with the single notable, but expected exception that l-PBE mRNA and protein are undetectable in l-PBE−/− mouse livers. Thus, the blunting of peroxisome proliferative response is attributed to the absence of l-PBE protein in l-PBE null animals. It is important to note that l-PBE, a 78-kilodalton protein, is massively induced in the livers of wild type mice exposed to peroxisome proliferators (22Reddy J.K. Kumar N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This protein, once called peroxisome proliferator-activated polypeptide (22Reddy J.K. Kumar N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), becomes the most abundant protein in the livers of peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and mice, contributing substantially to the morphological phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation. The l-PBE null mutation abolishes the inducibility of l-PBE in response to peroxisome proliferators, and this most likely accounts for the blunting of peroxisome proliferative response, because all other PPARα responsive genes in l-PBE−/−mice are up-regulated. Therefore, it is conceivable that changes in the levels of expression of l-PBE gene in nonrodent species in response to peroxisome proliferators may influence the morphological phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation, whereas other effects of these PPARα ligands in nonrodent species may be similar to those seen in rats and mice. It would be of great interest to investigate whetherl-PBE−/−mice develop liver tumors following chronic exposure to peroxisome proliferators, despite the subdued nature of peroxisome proliferative response, because all other PPARα-regulated genes are up-regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2058776596,"Caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is responsible for the DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis. CAD is complexed with an inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) in non-apoptotic, growing cells. Here, we report that mouse WR19L and human Jurkat T lymphoma cells express two alternative forms of ICAD, ICAD-L and ICAD-S, at similar levels. CAD was predominantly associated with ICAD-L in these cell lines. When CAD was expressed alone in Sf9 cells, it was found in insoluble fractions. However, when CAD was co-expressed with ICAD-L and ICAD-S, it was recovered as a soluble protein complexed predominantly with ICAD-L. In vitro transcription and translation of CAD cDNA did not produce a functional protein. Addition of ICAD-L but not ICAD-S to the assay mixture resulted in the synthesis of functional CAD. These results indicated that ICAD-L but not ICAD-S works as a specific chaperone for CAD, facilitating its correct folding during synthesis. Recombinant CAD, as a complex with ICAD-L, was then produced in Sf9 cells. The complex was treated with caspase 3, and CAD was purified to homogeneity.

Apoptosis is a process by which cells can be eliminated in response to a wide range of stimuli, such as death factors (Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor, and TRAIL), anti-cancer drugs, γ or UV radiation, and factor deprivation (1Nagata S.

Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). This process is characterized morphologically by cell shrinkage accompanied by blebbing of the plasma membranes, and condensation and fragmentation of the nuclei (5Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar, 6Raff M. Nature. 1998; 396: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 7Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br.

Apoptosis is driven by members of the caspase family, which are cysteine proteases (10Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). At least 14 caspase family members have been identified, and they are divided into 3 subgroups based on their substrate specificity (11Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Different apoptotic stimuli appear to sequentially activate different sets of caspases, which ultimately cleave various cellular substrates to cause the morphological changes in cells and nuclei (6Raff M. Nature. 1998; 396: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis also depends on caspase activation. We and others have recently identified a caspase-activated DNase (CAD), 1The abbreviations used are: CAD, caspase-activated DNase; ICAD, inhibitor of CAD; DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; p-APMSF, p-amino-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection which is also called a caspase-activated nuclease or DNA fragmentation factor-40 (DFF-40) (13Enari M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAD is complexed with its inhibitor (ICAD), also called DFF-45, in growing, non-apoptotic cells. Mouse CAD is a basic protein consisting of 344 amino acids, while ICAD is an acidic protein with two recognition sites for caspase 3. When caspase 3 is activated by apoptotic stimuli, ICAD is cleaved, resulting in the release of CAD. This released CAD appears to cause DNA fragmentation in nuclei. Molecular cloning of mouse ICAD cDNA indicated that there are two forms of ICAD, designated ICAD-L and ICAD-S for the long and short forms, respectively. ICAD-L and ICAD-S are composed of 331 and 265 amino acids, respectively (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). They are translated from two different mRNAs produced by alternative splicing. 2K. Kawane, H. Fukuyama, H. Sakahira, and S. Nagata, unpublished results. Purification of the latent form of CAD from human HeLa cells indicated that the ICAD that is associated with CAD is ICAD-L (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). However, purification of mouse ICAD by following its activity led us to identify ICAD-S (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Thus, it was not clear whether both ICAD-L and ICAD-S proteins were expressed in mouse and human cells, and whether they had any functional differences. In this study, we showed that mouse and human lymphoma cell lines constitutively express both ICAD-L and ICAD-S at similar levels. Fractionation of the cell lysates from human Jurkat cells, and from Sf9 cells co-infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing ICAD and CAD indicated that CAD is complexed predominantly with ICAD-L. ICAD-L but not ICAD-S supported production of the functional CAD protein in vitro. These results indicated that ICAD-L but not ICAD-S has a chaperone-like function for CAD, and that it remains complexed with CAD. Recombinant CAD was produced in insect cells as a complex with ICAD-L, and was homogeneously purified after treatment with caspase 3. The purified CAD showed high DNase activity. Mouse T-cell lymphoma WR19L and human Jurkat cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were cultured at 27 °C in TNM-FH medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-human ICAD/DFF-45 (clone 6B8) and anti-FLAG (clone M2) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan) and Kodak (Rochester, NY), respectively. Affinity purified, anti-murine ICAD polyclonal antibody was custom prepared at MBL by immunizing rabbits with recombinant murine ICAD-L. Anti-murine CAD antiserum was custom prepared at the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan) by immunizing rabbits with a C-terminal peptide (RRKQPARKKRPARKR, amino acids 330–344). The antiserum was affinity purified using AF-amino Toyopearl beads (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) to which the peptide had been attached usingm-maleimidbenzol-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from DAKO (Denmark) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. The recombinant ICAD fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the histidine-tagged recombinant human caspase 3 was prepared inEscherichia coli as described previously (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The activities of CAD and ICAD were determined with mouse liver nuclei or plasmid DNA as described previously (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). For the ICAD assay, the S-100 fraction from Fas-activated mouse W4 cells (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar) or purified recombinant CAD produced by Sf9 cells (see below) was used as active CAD. Western blotting was performed as described previously (19Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 12.5 or 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Dai-ichi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham-Pharmacia, Arlington Heights, IL) at 100 V for 1 h. After treatment with 25% Block Ace (Dai-Nihon Pharmaceutical, Osaka Japan) or 5% skim milk, the filters were incubated with primary antibodies against human ICAD, mouse ICAD, mouse CAD, or FLAG-epitope. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Renaissance; NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). The in vitro transcription/translation was carried out using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI) as described previously (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). DNA fragments coding for FLAG-tagged mouse ICAD-L and ICAD-S (F-ICAD-L and F-ICAD-S) were described previously (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). These fragments and a fragment coding for mouse CAD were inserted into the pBlueBac III vector (Invitrogen), and high titer recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the MaxBac baculovirus expression system according to the manufacturer's instructions. To produce F-ICAD-L, F-ICAD-S, and the F-ICAD-L·CAD complex, Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5.0 with the recombinant baculovirus. The cells were incubated at 27 °C for 3 days before harvest. Cell lysates from the infected Sf9 cells were prepared essentially as described previously (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were disrupted by three cycles of freezing and thawing in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm p-APMSF (p-amino-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant fractions were used as S-30 fractions. The S-30 fractions were spun for 2 h at 100,000 × g to obtain the S-100 fraction. Glycerol was added to the S-30 and S-100 fractions at a final concentration of 10% (v/v). To purify the F-ICAD-L·CAD complex, the S-100 fraction from Sf9 cells co-infected with the F-ICAD-L and CAD baculoviruses was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with buffer B (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm p-APMSF) containing 50 mm NaCl, and eluted with a 50–350 mm linear NaCl gradient. The active fractions were applied to an SP-Sepharose FF column, and eluted with a 50–600 mm linear NaCl gradient. The ICAD·CAD complex, which eluted at 350–500 mm NaCl, was then applied to a HiTrap Heparin column, and eluted with a 150–700 mmlinear NaCl gradient. About 3 mg of F-ICAD-L·CAD complex was obtained from 1000 ml of Sf9 culture. About 2.5 mg of purified F-ICAD-L·CAD complex was treated at 25 °C for 36 h with 25 μg of recombinant caspase 3 in buffer B supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was applied to a HiTrap Heparin column (5 ml) equilibrated with buffer D (buffer B without glycerol) containing 300 mm NaCl, and eluted with a 300–1000 mm linear NaCl gradient. About 0.2 mg of active CAD was obtained. All purification steps were carried out using an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham-Pharmacia) at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using a kit from Pierce. Quantification of homogeneous preparations of recombinant proteins was carried out by measuringA 280 and using extinction coefficients calculated as described previously (20Gill S. von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). We previously identified two forms of mouse ICAD cDNAs coding for ICAD-L and ICAD-S (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). To examine whether ICAD-L and ICAD-S proteins are indeed expressed, cell lysates were prepared from mouse WR19L and human Jurkat cells, and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the polyclonal antibody against mouse ICAD detected two bands at apparentM r of 45,000 and 34,000. These two bands were not detected by rabbit non-immune serum. Sizes of the two proteins agreed with those detected in the lysates from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus carrying ICAD-L and ICAD-S, respectively. When the cell lysates were treated with caspase 3, both bands disappeared. These results indicated that the 45,000 and 34,000 bands represented ICAD-L and ICAD-S, respectively. ICAD-L appeared to be more abundant than ICAD-S in WR19L cells. The cell lysates from human Jurkat cells also showed two bands at M r of 45,000 and 34,000 in Western blotting using an anti-human ICAD/DFF-45 monoclonal antibody as the probe (Fig. 1 B). Both bands were cleaved by caspase 3. In Jurkat cells, ICAD-S appeared to be more abundant than ICAD-L. Mouse WR19L and human Jurkat cells carry a latent form of CAD (proCAD) that exists as a complex with ICAD, and can be activated by caspase 3 (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 16Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). When the S-100 fraction from Jurkat cells was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, proCAD was retained in the column, and eluted with 600 mmNaCl (Fig. 2 A). The S-100 fraction also contained the ICAD activity, which was recovered in the flow-through fractions (Fig. 2 B). To determine which form of ICAD, ICAD-L or ICAD-S, is associated with CAD, the flow-through and bound fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-ICAD antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the ICAD in the flow-through fraction was predominantly ICAD-S, while ICAD-L was predominant in the bound fractions. Re-chromatography of the bound fractions on SP-Sepharose showed co-elution of ICAD-L with the proCAD activity in a linear NaCl gradient. The ICAD activity in the flow-through fraction of SP-Sepharose was bound to a DEAE-Sepharose column, and co-eluted with ICAD-S in a linear NaCl gradient (data not shown). These results indicated that CAD is predominantly associated with ICAD-L. ICAD-S exists mainly in a free form. Similar data were obtained using the S-100 fraction from mouse WR19L cells (data not shown). To confirm the predominant association of CAD with ICAD-L, recombinant baculoviruses containing F-ICAD-L, F-ICAD-S, and CAD were constructed, and used to infect Sf9 cells. After culturing for 24 h, the cell lysates were spun at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant and precipitate fractions were designated as S-30 and P-30, respectively. As shown in Fig.3 A, the S-30 fraction from the parental Sf9 cells or the cells infected with F-ICAD-L, F-ICAD-S, or CAD baculovirus alone did not show CAD activity. However, when the cells were co-infected with baculoviruses containing CAD and F-ICADs, the CAD activity was detected in the S-30 fraction (Fig.3 A). The CAD activity in the S-30 fraction increased when the m.o.i. of the CAD baculovirus was increased. Proteins in the S-30 and P-30 fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody recognizing F-ICAD. As shown in Fig. 3 B, two bands of an equal intensity at M r of 45,000 and 34,000 were exclusively detected in the S-30 fraction, suggesting that both ICAD-L and ICAD-S are soluble proteins. In contrast, when Sf9 cells were infected with the CAD baculovirus alone, the CAD protein with M r of 40,000 was exclusively found in the P-30 fraction, suggesting that CAD formed aggregates. However, co-expression of CAD with ICADs in Sf9 cells resulted in soluble CAD (Fig. 3 C). At lower expression levels of CAD, all of the CAD was found in the S-30 fraction. When CAD was overexpressed, some of it was detected in the P-30 fraction. The expression levels of ICAD-S and ICAD-L, and their solubility, were not affected by the expression of CAD. These results suggest that the soluble and functional proCAD could be produced only in the presence of ICAD. To determine whether ICAD-L, ICAD-S, or both form a complex with CAD, the cell lysates from Sf9 cells infected with various dosages of CAD and ICAD baculovirus were loaded onto SP-Sepharose in 50 mm NaCl. The proCAD activity was retained on the column, and eluted with 600 mm NaCl (Fig.4 B). ICAD-L and ICAD-S in the cell lysates from Sf9 cells infected with ICAD-L and ICAD-S baculovirus were found in the flow-through fractions (Fig.4 A). When CAD was co-expressed with ICAD-L and ICAD-S, ICAD-L but not ICAD-S bound to the column, and co-eluted with CAD. At the highest concentration of CAD, all of the ICAD-L protein was found in the bound fractions, while only a small portion of the ICAD-S bound to the column. These results indicated that CAD predominantly associates and forms a complex with ICAD-L during its synthesis in Sf9 cells. Predominant association of ICAD-L with CAD during CAD synthesis suggested that ICAD-L, but not ICAD-S works as a chaperone to facilitate the correct folding of CAD during its synthesis. To examine this possibility, ICAD-L and ICAD-S were prepared in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins. At first, the inhibitory activity of ICAD was determined with the purified CAD (see below). As shown in Fig.5 A, both ICAD-L and ICAD-S efficiently inhibited CAD's DNase activity at a molar ratio of 5–10 for ICAD to CAD, suggesting that ICAD-L and ICAD-S have comparable ability to bind intact CAD. When CAD cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro, no functional CAD was produced (Fig.5 B), although CAD protein was synthesized (data not shown). The presence of ICAD-L in the reaction mixture stimulated synthesis of functional CAD in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, almost no functional CAD was produced in the presence of ICAD-S. To produce CAD in a large quantity, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses of CAD and ICAD-L at m.o.i. of 5.0, and the ICAD-L·CAD complex was purified from the cell lysates by successive column chromatographies of DEAE-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, and HiTrap Heparin column. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the purified ICAD·CAD complex showed bands of M r of 45,000 and 40,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which correspond to ICAD-L and CAD, respectively. Treatment of the ICAD·CAD complex specifically cleaved ICAD into fragments of M r18,000, 12,000, and 12,000. Although the cleaved ICAD-L fragments had some affinity to CAD, removal of glycerol from buffer reduced its affinity to CAD. Therefore, the ICAD-L·CAD complex after treatment with caspase 3 was loaded onto a heparin column, and the column was developed with a liner NaCl gradient in a buffer without glycerol. Under these conditions, CAD was eluted from the column later than the cleaved ICAD fragments. CAD, thus purified, was homogeneous (Fig.6 A), and it digested naked DNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). One nanogram of CAD efficiently digested 1 μg of DNA within 2 h in our assay conditions. Apoptosis induced by various stimuli is mediated by caspases, which cleave various cellular substrates to promote the apoptotic process (10Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). One of these substrates is ICAD, also known as DFF-45 (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 18Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Once ICAD/DFF-45 is cleaved by caspase-3, CAD (also known as caspase-activated nuclease or DFF-40) is released, is activated, and causes the characteristic fragmentation of chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units. Characterization of mouse ICAD cDNA indicated that there are two different ICAD mRNAs (ICAD-L and ICAD-S), which can be generated by alternative splicing. Although both forms of ICAD are expressed at similar levels, CAD was predominantly associated with ICAD-L in mouse and human cells. This was confirmed by expressing CAD and ICAD in Sf9 cells, from which CAD was recovered as a soluble protein preferentially complexed with ICAD-L. These results agree with previous reports that DFF (proCAD) is purified from human HeLa cells as a complex with DFF-45 (ICAD-L) (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). The expression of CAD alone in Sf9 cells caused aggregation of the protein, and ICAD-L but not ICAD-S supported production of functional CAD in a cell-free system, suggesting a chaperone-like activity for ICAD-L but not ICAD-S. It is likely that during synthesis of CAD on the ribosome, ICAD-L binds to the nascent chain of CAD and facilitates its correct folding. Mice deficient in the ICAD gene express CAD, but it does not cleave chromosomal DNA during apoptosis (21Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Kaer L.V. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which agrees with our results indicating an absolute requirement for ICAD to produce functional CAD. ICAD-L and -S are generated from a single gene with alternative splicing.2 Alternative splicing often gives rise to products with different functions. It has been reported that alternative splicing can also affect the folding property of a chaperone-like protein (22Smulders R. van Geel I. Gerards W. Bloemendal H. de Jong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13916-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin is a member of the small heat shock protein family, and has a chaperone-like activity in suppressing nonspecific aggregation of denatured proteins in vitro (23Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the subunits of α-crystallin (αA-subunits) has a minor product (αAins-crystallin) that carries an insertion of 23 amino acids, which is produced by alternative splicing. Both αA- and αAins-crystallin display similar heat-resistance, self-renaturation, and oligomerization properties, but αAins-crystallin has less chaperone-like activity than αA-crystallin. Similarly, both ICAD-L and ICAD-S are resistant to heat and easily renaturate (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). 3H. Sakahira and S. Nagata, unpublished results. Although they interacted with intact CAD with similar efficiency, only ICAD-L was associated with CAD in the cells, and supported production of functional CAD in vitro. ICAD-L is 66 amino acids longer than ICAD-S at the C terminus. This extra region of ICAD-L is probably responsible for its interaction with the nascent chain of CAD. In addition to facilitating folding of nascent polypeptides, chaperone-like proteins can enhance renaturation of their denatured target proteins (24Hartl F.U. Hlodan R. Langer T. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 25Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Whether or not ICAD-L has such a property remains to be studied. Previously, we have expressed CAD in COS cells and in reticulocyte lysates, and suggested that it has a DNase activity (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). However, since the preparation contained many other proteins, the possibility that CAD needs other co-factors to show its DNase activity was not formally ruled out. Here, we showed that the recombinant homogeneous CAD has the DNase activity with a high specific activity. If the functional CAD containing a nuclear localization signal is produced in cells, it will digest chromosomal DNA, and kills the cells. Cells have developed a device to avoid such a deleterious situation. That is, the correctly folded CAD is synthesized only in the presence of its inhibitor, ICAD-L. ICAD-L remains as a complex with CAD in the cells until it is cleaved by action of caspase 3. There is a precedent for such a heteromeric structure for a chaperone and its target protein. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which catalyzes a post-translational modification of collagen, consists of two distinct polypeptides forming an α2β2 heterotetramer (26Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The β-subunit has protein disulfide isomerase activity. The α-subunit forms highly insoluble aggregates without β-subunits (27Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28John D.C.A. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of β-subunits/protein disulfide isomerase, the α-subunit is correctly folded with intramolecular disulfide bonds, and becomes a soluble protein to form an α2β2heterotetramer. CAD is also rich in cysteine residues (14 residues in 344 amino acids), and correctly folded only in the presence of ICAD-L. To examine how ICAD-L promotes the correct folding of CAD, it would be necessary to analyze whether the cysteine residues of CAD are disulfide-bonded, and thus whether any free thiol is involved in the folding of the protein. ICAD-L but not ICAD-S was necessary to produce functional CAD, and ICAD-L can inhibit the CAD's DNase. However, we found that both ICAD-L and -S are expressed in various human and mouse cell lines. Why is ICAD-S expressed in living cells? The analyses of the CAD and ICAD gene promoters indicated that their expression is controlled by constitutive promoter as found in many housekeeping genes. 4K. Kawane and S. Nagata, unpublished observation. Since the expression level of CAD can be controlled by ICAD-L, it is possible that splicing for ICAD-L is prevalent in the tissues undergoing apoptosis at high frequency, to generate more CAD. Another possibility is that ICAD-S works as a dominant-negative form for the chaperone-like function of ICAD-L. Death signaling molecules such as caspases, Ced-4, and Bcl-x (29Boise L.H.

Similarly, if the amount of ICAD-S is increased, the complex formation between ICAD-L and CAD may be down-regulated. This may provide a fine-tuning mechanism for apoptotic DNA fragmentation.

Myosin-V copurifies with synaptic vesicles via its tail domain, which also is a substrate for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. We demonstrate here that myosin-V coimmunoprecipitates with CaM-kinase II from a Triton X-100-solubilized fraction of isolated nerve terminals. The purified proteins also coimmunoprecipitate from dilute solutions and bind in overlay experiments on Western blots. The binding region on myosin-V was mapped to its proximal and medial tail domains. Autophosphorylated CaM-kinase II binds to the tail domain of myosin-V with an apparentK d of 7.7 nm. Surprisingly, myosin-V activates CaM-kinase II activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner, without the need for additional CaM. The apparent activation constants for the autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase II were 10 and 26 nm, respectively, for myosin-V versus CaM. The maximum incorporation of 32P into CaM-kinase II activated by myosin-V was twice that for CaM, suggesting that myosin-V binding to CaM-kinase II entails alterations in kinetic and/or phosphorylation site parameters. These data suggest that myosin-V, a calmodulin-carrying myosin, binds to and delivers CaM to CaM-kinase II, a calmodulin-dependent enzyme.

These data suggest that myosin-V, a calmodulin-carrying myosin, binds to and delivers CaM to CaM-kinase II, a calmodulin-dependent enzyme. The primary intracellular receptor for Ca2+ in neuronal cells is calmodulin, which mediates the calcium signal by reversible, Ca2+-regulated binding to many target enzymes, which include the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar).

The native molecule thus has two mechanochemical head domains each bearing a well conserved ATP-binding site, an actin-binding site, and sequence homology with other known myosins. There are two notable structural features of this myosin. 1) A regulatory neck domain is composed of six tandem IQ motifs,which are consensus sequences for light chain binding (12Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Calmodulin is the major light chain (13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A.A.C. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1541-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and copurifies with BM-V at a stoichiometry of about 4 mol/mol of heavy chain (14Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E.

The actin-activated, MgATPase activity of BM-V is tightly and cooperatively regulated by Ca2+, presumably via its binding to calmodulin (15Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E.

Recently, light chains, homologous to the essential light chains of conventional myosins, have also been shown associated with BM-V. 2F. S. Espindola, D. M. Suter, R. E. Cheney, S. M. King, and M. S. Mooseker, manuscript in preparation. 2) A tail domain, having intercalated coiled-coil and globular segments, is structurally distinct from that of other classes of myosins and thought to be responsible for the specific intracellular interactions and/or locations of this myosin. Very little is known about its structure and properties, although we have shown it to be phosphorylated by the multifunctional, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (17Coelho M.V. Larson R.E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1993; 26: 465-472PubMed Google Scholar). No functional significance for this fact has yet been assigned. CaMKII is an abundant protein in brain with a broad substrate specificity. It associates with the actin cytoskeleton (18Ohta Y. Nishida E. Sakai H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as well as with synaptic vesicles (19Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.R. Gorelick F.S. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and postsynaptic densities (20Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and is involved in neuronal processes such as neurotransmitter synthesis and release, ion channel regulation, and long term potentiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and 21Schulman H. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1988; 22: 39-112PubMed Google Scholar). Its kinase activity is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin and autophosphorylation in a complex manner (see Ref. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In a cellular milieu, how CaMKII is regulated, what it phosphorylates, and when may be determined in part by the subcellular colocalization of the participating components, including calmodulin as well as specific substrates. A general role for the calmodulin-carrying, unconventional myosins in the subcellular localization of calmodulin has been suggested (22Porter J.A. Yu,M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. Montell C. Science. 1993; 262: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this paper we present biochemical evidence, which suggests that BM-V can bind to and deliver calmodulin to a calmodulin-requiring enzyme, CaMKII. We show that CaMKII coimmunoprecipitates with BM-V from a Triton X-100-soluble extract of synaptosomes. Furthermore, the purified proteins bind to each other in both immunoprecipitation and overlay experiments. We use the overlay technique to determine the binding affinity and to map the binding site(s) on the BM-V molecule. Finally, we show that both the autophosphorylating activity of CaMKII and substrate phosphorylation of BM-V are activated in this complex.

Commun. 1992; 104: 830-836Crossref Scopus (718) Google Scholar), followed by purification on HPLC to remove low molecular weight contaminants, as follows: 0.5 ml of calmodulin (0.2 mm in 26 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EGTA) from the Gopalakrishna and Anderson preparation was loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0–487 mm in 8 min; 487–503 mm in 4 min; 503–750 in 3 min). Calmodulin elutes at about 495 mm NaCl and is separated from a closely pre-eluting contaminant by judicial fraction collection and reapplication to the column. The final preparation of calmodulin is highly purified as judged by Coomassie Blue and silver staining on low molecular weight gels. CaMKII was purified from rat forebrains by calmodulin affinity chromatography as described by Goldenring et al. (26Goldenring J.R. Gonzalez B. McGuire Jr., J.S. DeLorenzo R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12632-12640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Rat forebrains in lots of 5 were rapidly removed and homogenized with an Omni high speed tissue grinder in 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.9, containing 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mmPefabloc, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine. All further steps were done at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was applied at a flow rate of 30 ml/h to a phosphocellulose column (60-ml bed volume) equilibrated in 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.9, containing 1 mm EDTA and 2.0 mm DTT. The column was washed with 5 volumes of equilibration buffer and eluted with the same buffer adjusted to pH 8. Eluting fractions were assayed for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation of 50–60-kDa polypeptides characteristic of CaMKII, or otherwise assayed by probing dot blots of the column fractions with a monoclonal antibody against the α-subunit of CaMKII. Fractions enriched in CaMKII were pooled, supplemented to 1 mm free Ca2+, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 3–5 ml of calmodulin-Sepharose 4B equilibrated in 50 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm DTT. The resin was loaded into a column and washed with 5 volumes of equilibration buffer alone and 2 volumes of equilibration buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, followed by elution with 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.5 mm EGTA. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation activity, or analyzed by dot blots for the α-subunit of CaMKII. Fractions enriched in CaMKII were pooled, assayed for total protein and stored at -20 °C in 30% sucrose. Molecular cloning techniques used were essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The subcloning of the head, neck, and complete tail domains of chicken BM-V in fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP; 42 kDa) in the pIH902 vector was described by Espreafico et al.(13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A.A.C. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1541-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The medial tail and globular tail domains were subcloned in fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST; 27.5 kDa) in the pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence corresponding to the proximal tail domain (nt2811–3440) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing restriction sites forEcoRI at their ends. The amplified fragment was digested with this enzyme and inserted into the EcoRI site of the pIH902 vector. The predicted molecular mass of this fusion protein is 65.2 kDa (aa 911–1122). The medial tail domain was derived from the 32a clone in pBS vector (13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A.A.C. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1541-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), digested with XmnI. The fragment of 962 base pairs (nucleotides 3425–4387) was purified and inserted into the SmaI site of the pGEX3 vector. The predicted molecular mass of the expressed fusion protein is 62.5 kDa (aa 1117–1435). The sequence encoding the globular tail was also derived from the 32a clone, digested with HpaI andEcoRV, resulting in a 1.2-kilobase pair fragment that was inserted into the SmaI site of the pGEX3 vector. The predicted molecular mass of this fusion protein is 70.4 kDa (aa 1440–1830). All of the fusion proteins mentioned above were expressed in Escherichia coli XL1Blue strain. The whole tail of BM-V was also subcloned and expressed using the pET vector, which resulted in its fusion at the N terminus with a 16-amino acid segment derived from the T7 vector. This construct was the same as that cloned in fusion with MBP in the pIH902 vector and was produced by cutting the 8c clone in pBS vector (13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A.A.C. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1541-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and ligating this fragment (nucleotides 2778–6599) into the EcoRI site of pET5a. This whole tail fragment encodes 102.4 kDa of BM-V (aa 899–1830) and was expressed using the pLysS strain of E. coli. The proteins mentioned above were expressed after induction by IPTG and were identified in SDS-PAGE by comparison of non-induced and induced bacterial lysate samples and by immunoblotting when appropriate. Antibodies were purified by affinity column chromatography as described by Espreafico et al.(13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A.A.C. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1541-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction from the affinity column did not recognize BM-V in Western blots and was therefore used as the “preadsorbed” serum control. Pansorbin cells were washed in 10 volumes of TBS/Tween (40 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20) by several cycles of centrifugation and resuspension. Aliquots of affinity-purified antibody or preadsorbed serum were incubated with the washed cells for 2 h at room temperature in the proportion of 2 mg of protein/ml of Pansorbin cells. The cells were then washed three times with 10 volumes of TBS/Tween. Protein samples in microcentrifuge tubes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 50 μl of the antibody-laden Pansorbin cells under gentle agitation. The cells were collected by a 60 s spin in a microcentrifuge (this first supernatant, referred to as “s” in the figures, was saved and analyzed together with the final immunoprecipitate, “p”) and washed by three centrifugation/resuspension cycles in TBS/Tween. Finally, the wash supernatant was carefully removed and the Pansorbin pellet dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge, and this supernatant (referred to as “p” in the figures) analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. Western blots of protein samples on reinforced nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm) were blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS/Tween for at least 2 h. The protein fractions to be used as probes were incubated with the Western blot under gentle agitation for 2–2.5 h. The filters were then washed with TBS/Tween with three quick changes, followed by four washes of 5 min each. Binding of the probing protein to polypeptides on the Western blot was detected in two ways: 1) by incubating the filter with probe-specific antibodies for 1 h and revelation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, or 2) if the protein probe was radioactive, by autoradiography of the dried blot. Reaction mixtures containing 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT were prepared in microcentrifuge tubes. CaMKII, BM-V, calmodulin, 100 μm free Ca2+, and 50 μmtrifluoperazine (TFP) were added as indicated in the figure legends. To obtain 100 μm free Ca2+, CaCl2was added based on the calculation of the buffering capacity of 1 mm EGTA by Fabiato (28Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The reaction, at 35 °C, was initiated and stopped in two ways depending on the experiment: 1) reactions containing all other ingredients were initiated by addition of ∼2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 10 μm and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and boiling, or 2) in experiments where the protein content was dilute, the reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μm free Ca2+ immediately after the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and stopped by addition of EGTA to 2 mm, followed immediately by precipitation of total protein by addition of 0.10 volume of sodium deoxycholate, 0.15% w/v, and of 0.15 volumes of ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and neutralized by ammonium vapor. Incorporation of 32P into polypeptides was visualized by autoradiography of dried gels after SDS-PAGE and quantified by either of two methods. (a) Appropriate bands corresponding to the α and β subunits of CaMKII were cut from the gel, solubilized in 0.5 ml of 30 volume H2O2 by heating at 80 °C for 2 h, and quantified by Cerenkov scintillation counting in 5 ml of H2O. (b) The dried gels were exposed on a storage phosphor screen, which was subsequently scanned using the STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitative analysis on appropriate bands was performed using the ImageQuant software. In parallel determinations, both methods gave equivalent results, the STORM system being much quicker and easier. Synaptosomes were prepared from rat cerebral cortex and purified over a Percoll gradient as described by Nagy and Delgado-Escueta (29Nagy A. Delgado-Escueta A. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using 6–15% linear gradient minigels (30Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was done as described by Towbinet al. (31Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies developed by the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate. The free Ca2+ concentration indicated in the experiments was based on the calculation of 1 mm EGTA buffer capacity as described by Fabiato (28Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Concentrations of BM-V and calmodulin were based on the following extinction coefficients: BM-V, 1.04 at 280 nm for 1.0 mg/ml solutions (14Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forsher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar); calmodulin (in 1 mm EGTA), 2.0 at 276 nm for 1% solution (32Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Otherwise, protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin, fraction V, as a standard. The molecular weight of native BM-V was taken as 640,000 (14Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forsher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and CaMKII holoenzyme as 600,000 (26Goldenring J.R. Gonzalez B. McGuire Jr., J.S. DeLorenzo R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12632-12640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex were isolated on a Percoll gradient and examined by Western blotting for the presence of myosins and other proteins (Fig.1). Myosins II and V were most concentrated in the 20% Percoll interphase, which corresponded to the highly enriched synaptosome fraction as verified by electron microscopy (Ref. 28Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar; data not shown). The exclusion of neurofilament protein (NF200) and enrichment of synaptophysin, an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, served as biochemical markers in this fraction and corroborated the integrity of the preparation. CaMKII was distributed throughout the gradient. In a previous study (6Mani F. Espreafico E.M. Larson R.E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994; 27: 2639-2643PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that BM-V was partially solubilized by Triton X-100 extraction of lysed synaptosomes in the presence of millimolar concentrations of ATP. Since Triton extraction disrupts membranes, while many protein-protein interactions are maintained, we attempted to identify potential protein-ligands of BM-V in the Triton-solubilized fraction of synaptosomes by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the BM-V tail domain. By immunodetection on Western blots, we were able to show coimmunoprecipitation of CaMKII and syntaxin, a synaptic plasma-membrane protein, with BM-V under these conditions (Fig. 2). The portion of the total CaMKII and syntaxin in the soluble fraction that cosedimented with BM-V was small; however, the fact that synaptophysin, also present in equivalent amounts in the synaptosome lysate, did not cosediment with these proteins argues against nonspecific aggregation. Additionally, none of these proteins were cosedimented with Pansorbin cells coated with pre-adsorbed antiserum. CaMKII and syntaxin participate in large, variably assembled protein and cytoskeleton complexes, formed during the cycle of events of synaptic transmission (reviewed in Ref. 34Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that BM-V may also be an eventual component of these supramolecular structures. To assay for direct binding between BM-V and CaMKII, we performed in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments from a dilute mixture of the two purified proteins using the BM-V tail antibodies (Fig.3 A). Coimmunoprecipitation of CaMKII and BM-V was observed in the absence of ATP (reaction 2, no phosphorylation condition) as well as under conditions where autophosphorylation was promoted (reaction 3). Both non-phosphorylated (seen in lanes 2p and 3p) and phosphorylated forms of αCaMKII (the slower migrating band recognized by the αCaMKII antibody seen only in lane 3p) were detected. Controls demonstrated that the precipitation of CaMKII in this assay was dependent on the presence of both BM-V and the BM-V tail antibodies. Similarly, CaMKII coimmunoprecipitated with the bacterially expressed tail domain (Fig. 3 B). Under conditions where autophosphorylation of CaMKII was promoted (reaction 4, note the requirement for calmodulin), it appeared that the phosphorylated α-subunit (based on electrophoretic mobility) was the principal component that coimmunoprecipitated with the tail domain (lane 4p). To permit direct demonstration of the incorporation of 32P into the phosphorylated species, reaction mixtures of BM-V and CaMKII, diluted 2- and 8-fold in relation to the CaMKII concentration of Fig.3 A, were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C upon addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was then diluted to 3 ml containing 1 mm non-radioactive ATP and immunoprecipitation performed as described above. Autoradiography of the immunoprecipitated proteins separated on a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig.4) demonstrated that (a) the α- and β-subunits of CaMKII were autophosphorylated and BM-V phosphorylated, and (b) the phosphorylated species were coimmunoprecipitated by tail antibodies. The relative intensity of the bands was not affected by 4-fold dilution of substrate and enzyme in the kinase reaction, suggesting that the phosphorylated species were effectively bound during the reaction and fully immunoprecipitated under these dilute conditions. To further characterize the binding between BM-V and CaMKII, we used the “overlay” technique where Western blots of protein samples were incubated with protein ligand, followed by detection of binding by ligand-specific antibodies. When a Western blot of purified BM-V or of the MBP-tail fusion protein expressed in bacteria was incubated with purified CaMKII, its binding to the BM-V heavy chain and to the tail domain was detected by the CaMKII monoclonal antibody (Fig.5, lanes 2 and5). Reciprocally, when a blot of CaMKII was incubated with purified BM-V, both α and β subunits of CaMKII were detected by BM-V tail antibodies (Fig. 5, lane 8). These data strongly suggest that there is direct binding between these two proteins. In order to estimate the affinity of the CaMKII binding to BM-V, we developed a method of ligand detection on the immobilized tail domain with the overlay technique using autophosphorylated [32P]CaMKII as the ligand probe. As shown in Fig. 6 A, analysis of the overlaid blot by phosphor image scanning demonstrated that [32P]CaMKII was bound to the immobilized tail at incubation concentrations in the nanomolar range. The data from a typical experiment, plotted in Fig. 6 B, showed an apparently hyperbolic increase in [32P]CaMKII binding with increased concentration. The reciprocal plot of the data (inset) gave an apparent K d of 7.7 nm. Four equivalent experiments gave K d values tha"
https://openalex.org/W1974185738,"Conformational diversity within unique amino acid sequences is observed in diseases like scrapie and Alzheimer's disease. The molecular basis of such diversity is unknown. Similar phenomena occur in subtilisin, a serine protease homologous with eukaryotic pro-hormone convertases. The subtilisin propeptide functions as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC) that imparts steric information during folding but is not required for enzymatic activity. Point mutations within IMCs alter folding, resulting in structural conformers that specifically interact with their cognate IMCs in a process termed “protein memory.” Here, we show a mechanism that mediates conformational diversity in subtilisin. During maturation, while the IMC is autocleaved and subsequently degraded by the active site of subtilisin, enzymatic properties of this site differ significantly before and after cleavage. Although subtilisin folded by Ile−48 → Thr IMC (IMCI-48T) acquires an “altered” enzymatically active conformation (SubI-48T) significantly different from wild-type subtilisin (SubWT), both precursors undergo autocleavage at similar rates. IMC cleavage initiates conformational changes during which the IMC continues its chaperoning function subsequent to its cleavage from subtilisin. Structural imprinting resulting in conformational diversity originates during this reorganization stage and is a late folding event catalyzed by autocleavage of the IMC.

Subtilisins constitute a family of serine proteases that have served as model systems for understanding the structural origin of protease function and specificity (1Wells J.A. Estell D.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1988; 13: 291-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cloning of the gene for subtilisin E from Bacillus subtilis revealed that it is synthesized with an N-terminal precursor domain that is referred to as the propeptide (2Wong S.L. Doi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10176-10181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although several biochemical studies on subtilisin have indicated that the 77-mer propeptide was not part of the 275-amino acid active protease (3Olaitan S.A. DeLange R.J. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5296-5301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wright C.S. Alden R.A. Kraut J. Nature. 1969; 221: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), Escherichia coli expression experiments revealed that the propeptide of subtilisin was essential for proper activation and secretion of the protease in vivo(5Ikemura H.

Soon thereafter, the propeptide of α-lytic protease (a serine protease not evolutionarily related to subtilisin) was also shown to be essential for proper activation of its protease domain (8Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 362Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although these results were surprising at the time, propeptides are now known to be required for production of a large number of proteases. Propeptide-dependent systems have since then been identified both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (9Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Virtually all known extracellular bacterial proteases have propeptides (10Eder J. Fersht A.R. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3548-3554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) synthesized as precursor pro-proteases. Propeptides seem to perform two distinct functions: folding and inhibition of their protease domains (15Shinde U. Liu J. Inouye M. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in Proteins: Structure, Function and Mode of Action. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 467-489Google Scholar). In doing so they act as single turnover enzymes due to their tight binding with folded proteases and their proteolytic sensitivity. As propeptides facilitate correct folding they were classified as molecular chaperones (16Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but due to differences that exist between molecular chaperones, propeptides were also termed “intramolecular chaperones” (17Inouye M. Enzyme. 1991; 45: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although many proteases require their propeptides to facilitate their folding, these findings do not constitute a rule. In addition to proteases, proteins such as growth factors, neuropeptides, hormones, and plasma proteins also require their propeptides for correct folding (18Gray A.M. Mason A.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12160-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have shown them to be randomly structured. In the vicinity of the prefolded protease domain, the propeptide of subtilisin adopts an α-β conformation (22Shinde U. Li Y. Chatterjee S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anfinsen demonstrated that all the information necessary for folding of a protein into an active conformation resides in the amino acid sequence of that protein (26Anfinsen C.R. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). Based on Anfinsen's observation, the native state of a protein is generally believed to be the global free energy minimum (27Miranker A.D. Dobson C.M Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence that kinetically selected states play a role in the biological function of some proteins (28Philo J.S. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Wen J. Narhi L.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10812-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For example, the serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 folds into an active structure and then converts slowly to a more stable, but low activity “latent” conformation (29Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the folding of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is apparently under kinetic control. When α-lytic protease (11Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 30Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G. Landes Company, Austin TX1995: 61-83Google Scholar) and subtilisin (31Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,32Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A.R. Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 35-60Google Scholar) are folded in the absence of their propeptides, they fold into partially structured molten globule intermediates. These stable but inactive intermediates can convert into active conformations upon addition of their propeptides (30Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G. Landes Company, Austin TX1995: 61-83Google Scholar, 31Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and suggest that propeptides promote folding of their proteases by direct stabilization of the rate-limiting folding transition state (30Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G. Landes Company, Austin TX1995: 61-83Google Scholar, 31Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Propeptides seem to be essential only during late stages of the folding process because they help overcome a kinetic block in the folding pathway. A similar state is formed even in the presence of the propeptide (33Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and autoprocessing may occur in this intermediate state. Point mutations within the propeptides can affect their folding function (34Kobayashi T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As a result, identical protein sequences can display altered, enzymatically active conformations with specificity toward the propeptide that mediates folding (36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This finding helped introduce the concept termed “protein memory” and suggests that propeptide domains function as steric chaperones (28Philo J.S. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Wen J. Narhi L.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10812-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Altered protein folding also occurs in prion diseases wherein the protein can exist in two different conformations with invariant amino acid sequences, although this folding does not require propeptides (37Prusiner S.B. Scott M. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Therefore, proteins can display conformationally diverse biologically active states, and the native state of proteins may not necessarily reside at a thermodynamic minimum but may be ones that are most easily accessible (28Philo J.S. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Wen J. Narhi L.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10812-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present manuscript we describe a mechanism that mediates conformational diversity in subtilisin. Our results show that the propeptide continues its chaperoning function subsequent to its cleavage from subtilisin and that structural imprinting that results in conformational diversity originates during this reorganization stage. The desired mutations within the propeptide will be introduced through site-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction (38Weiner M.P. Gackstetter T. Costa G.L. Bauer J.C. Kretz K.A. Griffin A.M. Griffin H.G. Molecular Biology: Current Innovations and Future Trends. Horizon Scientific Press, Norfolk, UK1995Google Scholar). After site-directed mutagenesis the plasmids were sequenced using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 310). The plasmid (pET11a) carrying mutant and wild-type proteins were expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE) that is grown on M9 medium. Propeptides were isolated from inclusion bodies by solubilizing in 15–25 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl (39Mahoney W.C. Hermodson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11199-11203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the insoluble materials were removed through centrifugation. The supernatants were then be dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 5.0. Purification was carried out using a cation-ion exchange column (CM-Sephadex-50) with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) followed by high pressure liquid chromatography (C18-reverse phase) with a linear acetonitrile gradient (0–65%). The propeptides elute in 43% acetonitrile and are lyophilized and then resuspended into required buffers for use in different experiments (39Mahoney W.C. Hermodson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11199-11203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dissolved in 6m guanidine HCl (0.3 mg/ml) and dialyzed step-wise against a refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4) containing decreasing amounts of urea (5 to 0 m). The autocleavage of the propeptide occurs under conditions in which the refolding buffer contains 1.0 m urea. Therefore, for estimating autocleavage efficiency as a function of pH, the precursors were dialyzed in a step-wise manner to a final concentration of 1.5 m urea. Proteins were dialyzed extensively, and no autocleavage occurs under these conditions. Aliquots of the protein were further dialyzed against refolding buffers at different pHs that contained no urea. After 24 h of dialysis, the proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the extent of autocleavage was estimated densitometrically (40Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the sample was incubated at 25 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm buffer at different pH levels, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.13 mmsuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (41Zhu X. Ohta Y. Cash G. Tous I. Stein S. Inouye M. Jordan F. Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1992; 11: 35-47Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity of subtilisin at different pH levels was estimated by monitoring the release of p-nitroaniline through changes in absorbance at 405 nm. Reading were collected at 15 s using a Bio-Rad UV microplate reader, and the velocity of reaction was estimated (36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The propeptide of subtilisin behaves like a slow binding inhibitor. Competitive slow binding inhibition is usually described using two mechanisms (41Zhu X. Ohta Y. Cash G. Tous I. Stein S. Inouye M. Jordan F. Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1992; 11: 35-47Google Scholar).E+I⇋k2k1EI*Equation 1 E+I⇋k2k1EI⇋k4k3EI*Equation 2 Both mechanisms can be described by the same equation, wherev represent enzymatic rates at time t, andv o and v s represent initial and steady state enzymatic rates, respectively.v=vs+[vo−vs]exp(−kt)Equation 3 The apparent rate constant k for a first order reaction has a different significance for a one-step process and is shown by Equation 4.k=k2+k1[I]1+[S]/KMEquation 4 However, for a two-step process the rate constant is depicted using Equation 5.k=k4+k3[I]/k21+k3[I]/k2[S]/KMEquation 5 Because the initial velocity (v o) obtained from the on-set progress curves is independent of inhibitor concentration [I] for subtilisin E (35Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the results confirm that inhibition of subtilisin by its propeptide follows Equation 1.vo=Vmax[S](KM+[S])Equation 6 However, if the initial velocity (v o) is a function of the inhibitor concentration [I], then the inhibition occurs by a two-step process (35Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) described by Equation 2.vo=Vmax[S]KM(1+k1[I]/K2+[S]Equation 7 Integration of Equation 1 at a constant substrate concentration [S] results in the following equation.A=vst+(vo−vs)(1−e−k‘t)/k‘+AoEquation 8 where A0 and A depict the absorbance at 415 nm at time 0 and t, respectively. Hence v sand k can be graphically fitted using a nonlinear least square fitting of the absorbance A versus t.vo/vs=KM(1+[I]/Ki)[S](KM+[S])Equation 9 Because the propeptide is also a substrate for the reaction, measurement of the inhibition constants is more complex. Therefore, the inhibition experiments were carried out under pseudo-first-order kinetics where the lowest propeptide concentrations were greater than 10-fold excess. Enzyme concentrations were set at suitably low levels to give measurable rates of substrate hydrolysis, with observable state of inhibitor binding over the steady state time scale. The propeptide concentrations vary between 1 and 10 μm. Initial substrate concentration was 3 mm, and less than 10% of the substrate was degraded throughout the experiment. Reactions were initiated by addition of SubWT or SubI-48T. After thorough mixing, substrate cleavage was monitored by recording at 415 nm the release of p-nitroaniline with time (36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 42Longstaff C. Campbell A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7339-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Data from each curve were fitted to Equation 8, and theK i is estimated by fitting a set of inhibitor concentrations [I] versus[v o/v s]. CD measurements are performed on an automated AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer fitted with a thermostated cell holder that is controlled by an on-line temperature control unit. Quartz rectangular cells (Precision Cells, Hicksville, NY) with a path length of 1 mm are used. For CD studies, modified subtilisin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m(NH2)4SO4 and 1 mmCaCl2 will be used. Solutions are filtered through a 0.22-μm filter before measurement. Scans were carried out at wavelengths between 260 and 190 nm in a cuvette with a 1-mm path length maintained at 10 °C. In the thermal unfolding experiments, temperatures were increased from 10 to 90 °C in 1 °C intervals, with a 30-s equilibration at each temperature. Data were collected at each temperature for 10 s. Protein solutions contain 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to prevent autolysis during this procedure (36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 1-Anilino-8-napthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) 1The abbreviations used are: ANS, 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulfonic acid; IMC, intramolecular chaperone concentration was maintained 2.0 μm, whereas protein concentrations were 330 nm. Proteins were excited at a wavelength of 395 nm, whereas the emission spectra was recorded between 400 and 600 nm (33Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The in vitro maturation of the 352-residue IMC-subtilisin E involves folding, autocleavage, and degradation of its IMC domain (77-residues) to give mature subtilisin (275-residue). The folding of pro-subtilisin occurs through a molten globule like intermediate that becomes compact during or after the autocleavage of the propeptide domain. Denatured precursors are refolded through a step-wise dialysis procedure that gradually reduces urea concentration (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig.1 a depicts CD spectra of denatured IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin. Extensive dialysis (48 h) against buffer that contains 1.5 m urea, pH 7.0, induces significant secondary structure within the uncleaved precursor (Fig.1 a). This precursor binds with ANS (Fig. 1 b), a hydrophobic dye that fluoresces upon interacting with hydrophobic patches within proteins. Complete removal of urea through dialysis induces the subtilisin domain to cleave its IMC. The resulting autocleaved complex (Fig. 1 c) was purified using gel filtration and displays a secondary structure pattern similar to native subtilisin and fluoresces approximately 8-fold less than the uncleaved precursor (Fig. 1 b). Differences in ANS fluorescence intensities suggests that a structural reorganization that alters solvent accessible hydrophobic surfaces within the protein coincides with autocleavage. A Ser221 →Cys substitution at the active site of subtilisin blocks maturation after autocleavage, resulting in a stable stoichiometric IMC-S221C-subtilisin complex (43Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose x-ray structure was recently solved at 2 Å resolution (44Jain S. Shinde U. Li Y. Inouye M. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although active site residues Asp32, His64, and Ser221 within subtilisin mediate both autocleavage and degradation (5Ikemura H. Takagi H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7859-7864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ikemura H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12959-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 8Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 362Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the Ser221 → Cys substitution completely abolishes degradation while allowing efficient autocleavage of its IMC domain. Fig. 1 d displays both the autocatalytic cleavage of IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin and proteolytic activity of wild-type subtilisin as functions of pH. The procedure used to estimate the autoprocessing efficiencies is described under “Materials and Methods.” Maximum autocleavage occurs at pH 7.0, whereas optimum proteolytic activity is observed at pH 8.5. Although IMCWT-subtilisin also displays an optimum pH of 7.0 (data not shown), IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin is used because it allows an accurate estimation of autocleavage in the absence of any degradation of the cleaved IMC. Substitutions at position 221 by Cys or Ala does not alter the K m of subtilisin (46Philipp M. Bender M.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 51: 5-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47Polgar L. Bender M.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because S221C-subtilisin only autocleaves but does not degrade its IMC domain, these results suggest that although mediated via the active site of subtilisin, autocleavage and degradation activities of this catalytic triad differ significantly before and after cleavage. Differences in optimum pH substantiate that autocleavage and degradation activities are different from each other. IMCI-48V-subtilisin affects the folding process, and although the precursor undergoes maturation, the resulting conformation of the protease domain (SubI-48V) differs from that SubWT. Because autocleavage and degradation represent two activities of the same active site, effects of IMC mutations on these activities may help elucidate the molecular basis of altered folding. SubI-48V retains significant enzymatic activity, and hence the mutation Ile−48 → Thr was isolated in an attempt to further reduce proteolytic activity. Crystallographic studies of the IMC-subtilisin complex (44Jain S. Shinde U. Li Y. Inouye M. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) shows that Ile−48 is surrounded by hydrophobic side chains (Fig.2 a). Theronine, a polar residue, may disrupt the hydrophobic core and augment the phenomenon of altered folding. Upon renaturation, IMCI-48T-S221C-subtilisin cleaves its IMC domain (Fig.2 b) to form a complex that is further purified using gel filtration. Similarly, IMCI-48T-subtilisin undergoes maturation forming mature SubI-48T (Fig.3 b) with a well defined secondary structure (Fig. 2 c). The purified autocleaved complexes IMCWT and IMCI-48T-S221C-subtilisin interact differently with ANS, with IMCI-48T-S221C-subtilisin exhibiting a 4-fold greater fluorescence intensity than IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin complex. Similarly, SubI-48T fluoresces with an magnitude approximately 2-fold of that of SubWT (Fig. 2 d). These results suggest that subtilisin domains folded by the IMCI-48T display exposed hydrophobic surfaces that are absent in domains folded using IMCWT. Far ultraviolet CD spectra indicate that SubI-48T and SubWT are well folded and have similar but not identical conformations (Fig.2 c). The pH profile of the SubI-48T is depicted in Fig. 1 d, and it displays maximum proteolytic activity at approximately pH 8.2, whereas autoprocessing is maximum at pH 7.0.Figure 3a, thermal unfolding of precursor and mature proteins monitored using changes in negative ellipticity at 222 nm. Unfolding spectra of SubWT (black line) and SubI-48T (cyan line) displays higher melting temperatures (T m) than autocleaved precursors IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin (blue line) and IMCI-48T-S221Csubtilisin (red line), respectively. b, comparison of the inhibition profiles of SubWT and SubI-48T by IMCWT and IMCI-48T. Concentrations of SubWT and SubI-48T were adjusted such that they degrade the substrates at similar velocities.

Profiles due to SubWT are shown by in blue, whereas SubI-48T is shown inred.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thermostabilities of mature protease domains SubWT and SubI-48Tand the corresponding autocleaved complexes were determined by monitoring changes in negative ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig.3 a). The autoprocessed complexes used in these experiments were separated from the unautoprocessed precursors using gel filtration chromatography as described earlier (41Zhu X. Ohta Y. Cash G. Tous I. Stein S. Inouye M. Jordan F. Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1992; 11: 35-47Google Scholar). SubI-48T(T m 49.5 °C) was found to be substantially more unstable than SubWT (T m58.5 °C), whereas the IMCI-48T-S221C-subtilisin autocleaved complex (T m 46.8 °C) was also more unstable than the IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin complex (T m 53.2 °C). Both protease domains complexed with the IMC domains melt at lower temperatures than their corresponding protease domains. This suggests that the presence of IMC domains destabilize the corresponding complexes and conversely that the degradation of the IMC domains enhances stability of cognate protease domains. It is important to note that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride covalently interacts with the active site Ser221 residue. Crystallographic results have shown that such covalent linkage may cause local perturbations but does not seem to affect the rest of the backbone. The introduction of an bulky residue into the active site may therefore slightly destabilize the mature protein, causing it to lower the T m of the mature protease. Therefore the difference between the T m of subtilisin and the complex with its propeptide may actually be greater. Fig. 3 b describes the IMCI-48Tand IMCWT binding with SubWT and SubI-48T. From these curves it is evident that IMCI-48T binds to SubI-48T more strongly (and is degraded more quickly) than with SubWT, suggesting more specific recognition of SubI-48T than SubWT by IMCI-48T. Rates of autocleavage of the IMCI-48Tand IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin precursors are estimated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Relative rates of autocleavage of the two precursor proteins appear similar (Fig.3 c), whereas proteolytic activities of SubWT and SubI-48T toward a peptide substrateN-succinyl-A-A-P-F-p-nitroanilide differ significantly (Fig. 3 d). Enzymatic activities of SubWT and SubI-48T were estimated as described earlier (12van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8602-8609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Anfinsen C.R. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar), and SubI-48T displays aK m of 0.24 × 10−3m, whereas SubWT displays a K m of 2.0 × 10−3m. Because autocleavage occurs at similar rates whereas the proteolytic specific activity of SubI-48T is only 9.0% of that of SubWT, the results indicate that Ile−48 → Thr substitution seems to selectively affect proteolytic activity (final conformation) but not autocleavage of the maturation intermediate. Based on the above results a mechanism that leads to altered folding is proposed (Fig. 4). It is unclear how the IMC initiates this folding process, but it has been speculated that two helices between residues 100 and 144 within the protease domain may be involved (44Jain S. Shinde U. Li Y. Inouye M. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The IMC domain facilitates the precursors adopt an intermediate state that is capable of autocleavage, a process mediated by the active site of subtilisin (5Ikemura H. Takagi H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7859-7864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ikemura H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12959-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 8Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 362Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The properties of this active site differ from that of the mature protease because (i) it displays an optimum pH that is 1.5 units less than the mature protein; (ii) IMC-S221C-subtilisin can only autocleave its IMC but cannot degrade it to release mature S221C-subtilisin; and (iii) both IMCI-48T and IMCWT uncleaved precursors bind strongly with ANS, whereas the autocleaved complexes do not. This is consistent with structural reorganization that occurs after proteolytic cleavage (33Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). IMCI-48T and IMCWT S221C-subtilisin both cleave their IMC domains at similar rates, indicating that the Ile−48 → Thr substitution has little effect on autocleavage. Because SubWT and SubI-48T differ in their enzymatic activity after cleavage and subsequent degradation, we conclude that altered folding and protein memory that result from IMC-mutations occurs after autocleavage, after which the IMC continues to functions as a chaperone. Therefore, autocleavage does not imply that the folding process has been completed and may represent the transition state of the folding reaction. Autocleavage and degradation are closely coupled in wild-type subtilisin, and occurrence of these two processes renders the folding process irreversible. Although proteolytic activity of subtilisin at pH 8.5 is approximately 2-fold greater than pH 7.0 (Fig. 1 d), incubation of the IMCWT-S221C-subtilisin complex at pH 8.5 does not facilitate degradation of the IMC domain (data not shown). Changes in the optimum pH alone cannot explain the absence of proteolytic activity toward the noncovalently bound IMC domain. The protease domain in the autocleaved complex is almost identical to the wild-type protease domain with the exception of the active site Ser221 → Cys substitution that causes a 10,000-fold drop in the proteolytic activity. Because uncleaved precursors display exposed hydrophobic surfaces relative to cleaved complexes, it is reasonable to speculate that distribution of charge on cleaved and uncleaved protein surfaces are different. It is known that altering surface charges through mutagenesis produces subtilisin with altered specificities and pH activity profiles with enhanced catalytic activities (48Russell A. Thomas P. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 49Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Therefore, the active site within uncleaved precursor may also display enhanced autocleavage activity. After cleavage, the resulting conformational changes alter the catalytic properties of this active site. Because Ile−48 → Thr substitution within the IMC does not affect cleavage but alters enzymatic activity of the protease domain, our results indicate that conformational diversity that leads to protein memory occurs late during the folding pathway and the IMC functions even after its autocleavage. A sequence alignment of propeptides from the subtilisin family shows an interesting observation. Although the overall sequence identity is low, two regions dispersed over the N and C termini display significant sequence conservation (Fig. 5). These regions designated as motifs N1 and N2 contain the hydrophobic core residues (Val12, Phe14, Ile30, Val37, Leu51, Val56, Leu59, Val65, and Val68) within the subtilisin propeptide, apart from Ile30. We speculate that motifs N1 and N2 may be critical for nucleation of the folding process, whereas the nonconserved segments between N1 and N2 may be crucial for specific interactions with their cognate protease domains, during the propagation of folding and subsequent inhibition of activity. This speculation is supported by four of our findings: (i) A substitution at position Ile30 by a Val allows the propeptide to exert its chaperoning function but alters the final conformation of the protein (36Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This Ile30 residue is located in the nonconserved region flanked by motifs N1 and N2 (note that Ile30 was previously termed Ile−48). (ii) By using an Ile30 → Thr substitution, we have shown that the structural imprinting, which results in protein memory, occurs late in the folding pathway, after the propeptide has been cleaved from the protease domain through autocatalysis. Therefore, a substitution at position 30 within the propeptide does not affect folding nucleation but dramatically alters the final conformation of the protein. (iii) Results of a random mutagenesis procedure that helped identify mutational hot spots within the propeptide show that substitutions that blocked folding of subtilisin are localized within motifs N1 and N2 (34Kobayashi T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

This has allowed a thorough kinetic study of the ribonuclease activity of this protein. The catalytic efficiencies for oligouridylic acids of the type (Up)nU>p, mononucleotides U>p and C>p, and dinucleoside monophosphates CpA, UpA, and UpG have been interpreted by the specific subsites distribution in ECP. The distribution of products derived from digestion of high molecular mass substrates, such as poly(U) and poly(C), by ECP was compared with that of RNase A. The characteristic cleavage pattern of polynucleotides by ECP suggests that an exonuclease-like mechanism is predominantly favored in comparison to the endonuclease catalytic mechanism of RNase A. Comparative molecular modeling with bovine pancreatic RNase A-substrate analog crystal complexes revealed important differences in the subsite structure, whereas the secondary phosphate-binding site (p2) is lacking, the secondary base subsite (B2) is severely impaired, and there are new interactions at the po, Bo, and p-1sites, located upstream of the P-O-5′ cleavable phosphodiester bond, that are not found in RNase A. The differences in the multisubsites structure could explain the reduced catalytic efficiency of ECP and the shift from an endonuclease to an exonuclease-type mechanism.

Human eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) 1The abbreviations used are: ECP, eosinophil cationic protein; RNase A, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A; EDN, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin; UpA, uridylyl (3′,5′)adenosine; UpG, uridylyl (3′,5′)guanosine; CpA, cytidylyl (3′,5′)adenosine; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PRI, placental ribonuclease inhibitor; TB, Terrific broth; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; (Up)nU>p, an oligouridylic acid ofn + 1 residues ending in a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate; MALDI-TOF, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid is a small cationic protein found in the matrix of the large specific granules of eosinophils (1Ackerman S.J. Makino S. Fukada T. Eosinophils: Biological and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 33-74Google Scholar, 2Snyder M.R. Gleich G.J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, NY1997: 425-444Crossref Google Scholar). It is synthesized as a preprotein with a 27-residue signal peptide (3Rosenberg H.F. Ackerman S.J. Tenen D.G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mature ECP is a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 15.5 kDa, but several glycosylated forms ranging from 16 to 21 kDa have also been identified (4Gleich G.J. Loegering D.A. Bell M.P. Checkel J.L. Ackerman S.J. McKean D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3146-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The protein has a marked homology to the proteins from the pancreatic RNase A (EC 3.1.27.5) superfamily and shows a 67% amino acid sequence identity to another eosinophil-associated protein, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) (5Rosenberg H.F. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the other hand EDN was found indistinguishable from the human nonsecretory ribonuclease (6Beintema J.J. Hofsteenge J. Iwama M. Morita T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Sugiyama R.H. Schieven G.L. Dekker Ch.A. Glitz D.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4530-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The EDN and ECP genes (7Hamann K.J. Ten R.M. Loegering D.A. Jenkins R.B. Heise M.T. Schad C.R. Pease L.R. Gleich G.J. Barker R.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) arose from a duplication event that took place about 30 million years ago, and, while retaining the structural and catalytic requirements for RNase activity, both genes rapidly evolved under unusual evolutionary constraints to products with distinct biological properties (8Rosenberg H.F. Dyer K.D. Tiffany H.L. Gonzalez M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Zhang J. Rosenberg H.F. Nei M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). ECP shows a reduced RNase activity and is extremely cationic (pI ≈11) and toxic, whereas EDN shows a higher RNase activity but is much less cytotoxic (2Snyder M.R. Gleich G.J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, NY1997: 425-444Crossref Google Scholar). Helminthotoxic and antibacterial activities of ECP have been described (10Molina H.A. Kierszenbaum F. Hamann K.J. Gleich G.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 38: 327Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Lehrer R.I. Szklarek D. Barton A. Ganz T. Hamann K.J. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4428-4434PubMed Google Scholar), and a physiological function as a host defense protein has been suggested. Its cytotoxicity can damage the host epithelial tissuesin vivo. Respiratory epithelial damage, similar to that observed in severe asthmatics, has been reproduced in vitroby purified ECP (2Snyder M.R. Gleich G.J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, NY1997: 425-444Crossref Google Scholar). Eosinophil granule proteins may also be responsible for the enhanced capacity of eosinophils to kill cancer cells (12Trulson A. Nilsson S. Venge P. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of ECP remains unclear, and its toxicity against bacteria and helminths seems not to be related to its RNase activity. The ECP helminthotoxicity is not inhibited by the RNase inhibitor (10Molina H.A. Kierszenbaum F. Hamann K.J. Gleich G.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 38: 327Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis studies suggest that its toxicity for bacteria is also unrelated to the RNase activity (13Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7876-7881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ECP can disrupt cell and artificial membranes by creating ion-selective channels (14Young J.D.E. Peterson C.G.B. Venge P. Cohn Z.A. Nature. 1986; 321: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and in vitro lytic activity on the protozoaTrypanosoma cruzi was inhibited by heparin (1Ackerman S.J. Makino S. Fukada T. Eosinophils: Biological and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 33-74Google Scholar). However, both EDN and ECP appear to induce the neurotoxic Gordon phenomenon through their RNase activity (4Gleich G.J. Loegering D.A. Bell M.P. Checkel J.L. Ackerman S.J. McKean D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3146-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15Sorrentino S. Glitz D.G. Hamann K.J. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Gleich G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14859-14865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they participate in the host defense mechanism against single-stranded RNA viruses through their RNase activity (16Domachowske J.B. Rosenberg H.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Domachowske J.B. Dyer K.D. Bonville C.A. Rosenberg H.F. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1458-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The main catalytic residues required for RNase activity are conserved in ECP, as in all members of the mammalian RNase A superfamily, and site-directed mutagenesis at two of these residues (K38R and H128D) eliminates the RNase activity (13Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7876-7881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Early kinetic studies on the RNase activity of ECP indicated a pyrimidine specificity for the base position at the active site with a slight preference for cytidine in substrates of low molecular mass but a clear preference for polyuridylic acid (poly(U)), in comparison with polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) (18Slifman N.R. Loegering D.A. McKean D.J. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2913-2917PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sorrentino S. Glitz D.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No activity toward either 2′,3′-phosphate cyclic mononucleotides, dinucleoside monophosphates, or double-stranded RNA was detected (20Gullberg U. Widegren B. Arnason U. Egesten A. Olsson I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1239-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Initial studies indicated that EDN and ECP have a similar substrate specificity, although the catalytic efficiency of ECP is substantially reduced in comparison to that of EDN (2Snyder M.R. Gleich G.J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, NY1997: 425-444Crossref Google Scholar, 18Slifman N.R. Loegering D.A. McKean D.J. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2913-2917PubMed Google Scholar). The structure-function studies with ECP have been delayed by the limited availability of human ECP purified from eosinophils and the difficulties in obtaining a good yield in a prokaryote secretion expression system. We report here a different prokaryotic expression system, in which the vector pET11c and a synthetic gene for human ECP are used. This system allows recovery yields of about 5–10 mg of purified recombinant protein per 1 liter of culture. We have studied in detail the substrate specificity and polynucleotide substrate cleavage pattern of this recombinant protein, and the results have been analyzed by ECP molecular modeling based on the three-dimensional structure of EDN and RNase A-substrate analog complexes. The distinct putative subsites configuration of ECP favors an exonuclease mechanism in the same way as the endonuclease activity of RNase A is a result of its own multisubsite structure 2The RNase binding subsites are named as in de Llorens et al. (21de Llorens R. Arús C. Parés X. Cuchillo C.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). B, R, and p stand for the base-, ribose-, and phosphate-binding subsites, respectively. B1R1p1 is the main binding site where catalysis takes place. Subsites with subscript 2 are on its 3′ side in the nucleotide chain of the substrate, and subsites with subscript 0 or −1 are on its 5′ side.(22Moussaoui M. Guasch A. Boix E. Cuchillo C.M.

Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, NY1997: 272-304Google Scholar). Bovine pancreatic RNase A was purified according to Alonso et al. (24Alonso J. Nogués M.V. Cuchillo C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Poly(C), poly(U), uridylyl(3′,5′)adenosine (UpA), uridylyl(3′,5′)guanosine (UpG), cytidylyl(3′,5′)adenosine (CpA), uridine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate (U>p), cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate (C>p), carbenicillin, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma; reagents for performing the polymerase chain reaction were obtained from Perkin-Elmer; vectors pET11c and pET22b+, E. coliNovablue, and BL21(DE3) competent cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI). pFLAG-CTC expression vector was from International Biotechnologies, Inc. (New Haven, CT). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Recombinant human placental ribonuclease inhibitor (PRI) was from Promega (Madison, WI). MicroBCA Protein assay was from Pierce. Mono-S (HR 5/5) and Resource S cation exchange columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dowex 50W-X8 cation exchanger was from Bio-Rad. Nova-Pak C18 (3.9 × 150 mm) was from Waters. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The human ECP gene was synthesized using anEscherichia coli codon bias (25Grantham R. Gautier C. Gouy M. Jacobzone M. Mercier R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 43-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were ligated and subjected to polymerase chain reaction to incorporate appropriate restriction sites for cloning in pFLAG-CTC expression vector. Plasmid construct was further subjected to polymerase chain reaction for subcloning of the ECP synthetic gene into pET11c plasmid using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The final sequence corresponded to ECP lacking the leader sequence and having an additional N-terminal formylmethionine residue (pET11c/ECP). Alternatively, cDNA of ECP from the pFLAG-ECP7 construct (13Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7876-7881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pET22b+ vector, behind the pelB leader coding sequence. E. coli Novablue-competent cells were used for subcloning protocols, and the E. coliBL21(DE3) strain was chosen for expression of the recombinant protein. E. coli BL21(DE3)-competent cells were transformed with the pET11c/ECP plasmid. The expression protocol was optimized in Terrific broth (TB) medium and in minimal medium M9 (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For high yield expression, bacteria were grown in TB, containing 400 μg/ml carbenicillin. Recombinant ECP was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) cells after induction with 1 mm IPTG added when the culture showed anA 600 = 0.6–1. The cell pellet was collected after 4 h of culture at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, and sonicated at 50 watts for 10 min with 30-s cycles. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet fraction containing inclusion bodies was processed as follows: the pellet fraction was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.3m NaCl, pH 8, and after centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min, the pellet was dissolved in 12 ml of 6m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, containing 80 mm GSH, and incubated under nitrogen for 2 h at room temperature. The protein was then refolded by a rapid 100-fold dilution into 0.1 mTris acetate, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 ml-arginine, and GSSG was added to obtain a GSH/GSSG ratio of 4. Dilution in the refolding buffer should be adjusted to obtain a final protein concentration of 30–150 μg/ml. The protein was incubated in refolding buffer for 48–72 h at 4 °C. The folded protein was then concentrated, dialyzed against 0.15 msodium acetate, pH 5, and purified by cation exchange chromatography on a Resource S column equilibrated with the same buffer. ECP was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 2 m in 0.15m sodium acetate, pH 5 buffer. Further purification was achieved by a second cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S column, using the same buffers as described for the Resource S chromatography. Protein concentration was determined either by microBCA assay using RNase A as a standard or spectrophotometrically by the calculated extinction coefficient using the formula obtained by Pace et al. (27Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3450) Google Scholar) (ε280 = 17,460 m−1cm−1), obtaining comparable values. The homogeneity of the purified proteins was checked by 15% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and by N-terminal sequencing. The high molecular mass substrates poly(C) and poly(U) were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. 25 μl of 5 mg/ml substrate solution were incubated with 5 μl of 0.35 μm RNase A, or 5 μl of 7 μmECP for poly(U), and 5 μl of 28 μm ECP for poly(C) digestion. At different time intervals, between 0 and 90 min, the products of the reaction were analyzed as described previously (22Moussaoui M. Guasch A. Boix E. Cuchillo C.M. Nogués M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4687-4692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 15 μl of the reaction mixture were injected on a reversed-phase HPLC column, Nova-Pak C18 (size 3.9 × 150 mm), equilibrated with 10% ammonium acetate (w/v) and 1% acetonitrile (v/v) in water, and after a 10-min wash, a 50-min linear gradient was applied from 0 to 90% of elution buffer (10% ammonium acetate (w/v) and 11% acetonitrile (v/v) in water). The relative molecular mass of undigested substrates, poly(C) and poly(U), was estimated, as indicated by the manufacturer, to be about 260,000 to 1,200,000, and neither oligonucleotides nor other small molecular mass contaminants were observed in significant amounts. Product elution was detected from the absorbance at 260 nm. Peak identification was performed according to Moussaoui et al. (22Moussaoui M. Guasch A. Boix E. Cuchillo C.M. Nogués M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4687-4692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mononucleotides 3′UMP and U>p elute sequentially but very close in the first peak, and oligomers of increasing size elute with increasing retention times (Fig.1). The identity of the oligonucleotides, from 2 to 6 units, was checked by mass spectrometry (see below). The relative amount of each oligonucleotide was determined by integration of the 260-nm peak area divided by the number of nucleotide residues. As the elution profile cannot distinguish between consecutive sizes after a length of 9–10 nucleotides, for the calculation of the relative distribution of each oligonucleotide, the area corresponding to all oligonucleotides with a size larger than 9 nucleotides was considered as high molecular mass product together with the undigested substrate fraction. For the preparation of oligouridylic acids (Up)nU>p, n = 1–4, 500 μl of 10 mg/ml poly(U) solution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was incubated with 100 μl of 7 μm ECP at 25 °C for 15 min. Oligonucleotides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (Fig. 1) and freeze-dried. The relative activity of ECP with increasing amounts of Zn2+ was determined spectrophotometrically. Assays were carried out using 0.2 mm poly(U) as substrate in 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.2, and 0.15 μm final enzyme concentration. The activity was measured by following the change in absorbance at 280 nm. ZnSO4 was added from 0.2 to 1.2 μm final concentration in the assay reaction. 2 mm EDTA was added to all assay mixtures to abolish the inhibition by Zn2+ ions (see “Results” below). Poly(U), poly(C), C>p, U>p, CpA, UpA, UpG, and oligouridylic acids (Up)nU>p, n = 1–4, were used as substrates, and the kinetic parameters were determined by the spectrophotometric method. Assays were carried out in 50 mm MES-NaOH, 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.2, at 25 °C using either 0.2- or 1-cm path length cells. Substrate concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: ε268 = 6,200 m−1cm−1 for poly(C) nucleotide residue, ε260 = 9430 m−1 cm−1 for poly(U) nucleotide residue (28Yakovlev G.I. Bocharov A.L. Moiseyev G.P. Mikhaylov S.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); ε260 = 10,000m−1 cm−1 for U>p (29Del Rosario E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); ε268 = 8,400 m−1cm−1 for C>p (30Moiseev G.P. Bocharov A.L. Mamaeva O.K. Yakovlev G.I. Bioorg. Khim. 1982; 8: 1197-1206Google Scholar); ε265 = 21,000m−1 cm−1 for CpA, ε261 = 23,500 m−1cm−1 for UpA, and ε261 = 20,600m−1 cm−1 for UpG (31Imazawa M. Irie M. Ukita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 64: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For oligouridylic acids ((Up)nU>p) the ε260 values in each case were determined according to the following formula: ε260 = 10,000 × (n + 1)/n, where n is the number of non-cyclic phosphodiester bonds. The activity was measured by following the initial reaction velocities using the difference molar absorbance coefficients, in relation to cleaved phosphodiester bonds: Δε250 = 2380m−1 cm−1 for poly(C) and Δε282 = 829 m−1cm−1 for poly(U) (28Yakovlev G.I. Bocharov A.L. Moiseyev G.P. Mikhaylov S.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); Δε286 = 1450m−1 cm−1 for CpA, Δε286 = 570 m−1cm−1 for UpA (30Moiseev G.P. Bocharov A.L. Mamaeva O.K. Yakovlev G.I. Bioorg. Khim. 1982; 8: 1197-1206Google Scholar), and Δε280 = 480m−1 cm−1 for UpG (31Imazawa M. Irie M. Ukita T. J. Biochem.

Khim. 1982; 8: 1197-1206Google Scholar) and Δε280 = 1000 m−1cm−1 for U>p (32Irie M. Mikami F. Monma K. Ohgi K. Watanabe H. Yamaguchi R. Nagase H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) hydrolysis reactions. Δε280 = 700 m−1cm−1 was used for the transphosphorylation reaction of oligouridylic acids (Up)nU>p, the Δε280/n value being practically the same for all the oligouridylic acids (n = 1–4) analyzed (32Irie M. Mikami F. Monma K. Ohgi K. Watanabe H. Yamaguchi R. Nagase H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Substrate concentration ranges were from 0.1 to 1 mm for cyclic mononucleotides and dinucleoside monophosphates, and from 0.01 to 0.1 mm for (Up)nU>p oligonucleotides. Final enzyme concentrations were in the range from 0.1 to 10 μmdepending on the activity for each assayed substrate. The RNase activity was used to follow the expression and purification of recombinant ECP and to detect the presence of RNase activities both in the soluble and insoluble intracellular fractions of the E. coli BL21(DE3) expression strain without the expression plasmid. The zymogram technique on 15% SDS-PAGE, containing either poly(U) or poly(C) as substrate, was used according to the method described by Bravo et al. (33Bravo J. Fernández E. Ribó M. de Llorens R. Cuchillo C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mass determinations of purified recombinant ECP and of uridylyl oligonucleotides obtained from the HPLC separation of digestion products of poly(U) was carried out by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Brucker Biflex mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). For protein analysis a sinapinic acid matrix was used. For uridylyl oligonucleotide substrates the protocol of Wang and Biemann (34Wang B.H. Biemann K. Anal.

Before solvent evaporation, 0.7 μl of 0.5–10 mm oligonucleotide was added. Ions were generated by irradiation with a 337-nm nitrogen laser with an acceleration ion voltage of 19 kV. All spectra were taken in the reflectron positive ion mode. Analysis of ECP affinity for placental ribonuclease inhibitor was calculated using a modification of the methodology of Vicentini et al. (36Vicentini A. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Meyhack B. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J.

ECP was added at a 50 nm final concentration, and the remaining RNase activity was followed for 90–120 min. Several inhibitor concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 200 nm were used. Product formation was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 280 nm. A three-dimensional model of ECP was obtained based on the x-ray structure of EDN (38Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using the software ICM®, Internal Coordinate Modeling (39Abagyan R. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Main chain atoms of the ECP primary sequence were superimposed on the backbone of the EDN three-dimensional structure, taking Cα, carbon, and nitrogen atoms of both molecules except for amino acids 115–121, which correspond to a loop with a different conformation, obtaining a final root mean square deviation of 1.1 Å. The whole molecule was then subjected to free energy minimization. To analyze the interaction between the enzyme and different substrates, the predicted three-dimensional structure of ECP was overlapped with RNase A-d(CpA) (40Zegers I. Maes D. Dao-Thi M.H.

The expression protocol using a synthetic gene as described in this paper is the first reported method to obtain ECP in high yield. The previous prokaryotic expression system was a rather inefficient one (13Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7876-7881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The production of secreted soluble protein using the cDNA from ECP cloned behind the bacteria pelBleader peptide in pET22b+ vector was also very low (results not shown). Indeed, purification from human eosinophils is also a very limited source (1–20 μg/liter of serum and 5 μg/106 eosinophils) (42Abu-Ghazaleh R.I. Dunnette S.L. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Kita M. Thomas L.L. Gleich G.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our prokaryotic expression system combines the use of a synthetic gene for ECP with bacterial preferential codons and the pET11c vector. Induction of the T7 lacpromoter leads to the expression of intracellular protein in high yield that aggregates and accumulates in inclusion bodies. A yield of around 100 mg of protein in inclusion bodies per liter of medium is obtained in TB medium, and expression in minimal medium M9 yielded around 30 mg of protein per liter of medium. ECP represents more than 70% of the total protein in inclusion bodies after 2–5 h of culture following IPTG induction. Longer incubation leads to the accumulation of other cellular proteins and, consequently, a lower yield in the refolding step. Refolding of recombinant protein is achieved by rapid dilution of denatured reduced protein in renaturing buffer. The best yield was obtained when the GSH/GSSG ratio was 4, and the protein was added to the refolding buffer at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Protein concentration could rise up to 200 μg/ml if added stepwise, allowing 1 h incubation between each loading. The renatured protein was easily purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography with a final yield of 5–10 mg of purified protein per 1 liter of culture. The purified recombinant protein was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE stained with"

The activation is believed to be essential for the recovery of photoreceptors to the dark state; however, the molecular mechanism of the activation is unknown. Here, we report that dimerization of retGC-1 is involved in its activation by GCAPs. The GC activity and the formation of a 210-kDa cross-linked product of retGC-1 were monitored in bovine rod outer segment homogenates, GCAPs-free bovine rod outer segment membranes and recombinant bovine retGC-1 expressed in COS-7 cells. In addition to recombinant bovine GCAPs, constitutively active mutants of GCAPs that activate retGC-1 in a [Ca2+]-independent manner and bovine brain S100b that activates retGC-1 in the presence of ∼10 μm [Ca2+] were used to investigate whether these activations take place through a similar mechanism, and whether [Ca2+] is directly involved in the dimerization. We found that a monomeric form of retGC-1 (∼110 kDa) was mainly observed whenever GC activity was at basal or low levels. However, the 210-kDa product was increased whenever the GC activity was stimulated by any Ca2+-binding proteins used. We also found that [Ca2+] did not directly regulate the formation of the 210-kDa product. The 210-kDa product was detected in a purified GC preparation and did not contain GCAPs even when the formation of the 210-kDa product was stimulated by GCAPs. These data strongly suggest that the 210-kDa cross-linked product is a homodimer of retGC-1. We conclude that inactive retGC-1 is predominantly a monomeric form, and that dimerization of retGC-1 may be an essential step for its activation by active forms of GCAPs.

In outer segments of vertebrate retinal photoreceptors, rhodopsin absorbs a photon which in turn triggers GTP-dependent activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase. The activated phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cGMP. The resulting decrease in cytoplasmic [cGMP] leads to reduction in the activity of cGMP-gated cation channels and hyperpolarization of plasma membranes (1Hurley J.B. Annu. Rev.

Isozymes of the GC have also been shown biochemically (5Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Hakki S. Sitaramayya A.

Subsequently two forms of membrane GC (retGC-1, ROS-GC1 or GC-E, and retGC-2, ROS-GC2 or GC-F) were cloned from human, bovine, and rat retinal cDNA libraries (8Shyjan A.W. de Sauvage F.J.

The structure of these retGCs indicates that the enzyme is a member of the peptide-regulated, membrane-bound GC family, although the retGC is not activated by known peptides. Four functional domains in retGCs have been predicted: a N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, an intercellular protein-kinase-like domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Immunocytochemistry has shown that retGC-1 is localized primarily in cone outer segments and to a lesser extent in rod outer segments (13Liu X. Seno k. Nishizawa Y. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A.

RetGC-1 appears to be more abundant than retGC-2 in the retina (10Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reduction of cGMP-gated channel activity by lowering cytoplasmic [cGMP] blocks Na2+ and Ca2+ influx, and allows a Na2+/Ca2+, K+ exchanger to decrease cytoplasmic [Ca2+] (4Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W.

Nature. 1988; 334: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In contrast to other membrane-bound GCs that are regulated by binding of peptides to their extracellular domain (19Garbers D.L.

GCAPs interact with the intracellular domain of the enzyme (24Duda T. Goraczniak R. Surgucheva I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Gorczyca W.A. Palczewski K. Sitaramayya A. Baehr W. Sharma R.K.

RetGC-2 has also been reported to be stimulated by GCAP-2 under similar [Ca2+] (10Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, GCAPs appear to inhibit the basal GC activity in the presence of the higher [Ca2+] (more than ∼500 nm) (27Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

GCAP-1 is mainly detected in cone outer segments, in particular, in disc membrane regions (29Howes K. Bronson J.D. Dang Y.L. Li N. Zhang K. Ruiz C. Helekar B. Lee M. Subbaraya I. Chen J. Baehr W.

GCAP-1 is also observed in rod outer segments, but the content is much lower than that in cone outer segments. Less GCAP-1 is also found in synaptic regions and inner segments of cones. GCAP-2 is predominantly observed in outer and inner segments of rods and cones (23Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankouclinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Synaptic regions are also labeled by a GCAP-2 antibody. It has also been reported that Ca2+-binding proteins of the S100 family, especially S100b, activate retGC-1 in the presence of high [Ca2+] (32Pozdnyakov N. Yoshida A. Cooper N.G.F. Margulis A.

Commun. 1995; 218: 243-247Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that S100 proteins are not involved in phototransduction. Additional mechanisms and factors may also be involved in the regulation of retGCs, including phosphorylation (34Wolbring G. Schnetkamp P.P.

Characterizations of membrane-bound GC and adenylyl cyclase have suggested that the mechanisms for the expression of these enzymatic activities are closely related (42Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H.

Membrane adenylyl cyclase contains two putative catalytic domains that when separately expressed have no activity (44Tang W. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-regulated GCs have also been proposed to exist as dimeric or oligomeric forms even in the absence of ligands (45Iwata T. Uchida-Mizuno K. Katafuchi T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 73-79Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 47Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A recent study has also suggested that retGCs form homodimers in photoreceptor outer segments (48Yang R.-B. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13738-13742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether dimerization or oligomerization of retGCs is related to the regulation of retGC activity. This question is important especially because the activity of retGCs is regulated so differently from peptide-regulated GCs and the regulatory mechanism of retGCs by GCAPs may not be identical to that of peptide-regulated GCs. Thus, we investigated the relationship between activation of retGC-1 by GCAPs and dimerization of the enzyme. In addition to GCAPs, we used constitutively active mutants of GCAPs and S100b to show that dimerization of retGC-1 is related to its activation, not to Ca2+-binding proteins or [Ca2+]. Dimerization of retGC-1 was monitored using a cross-linker under the conditions similar to those used for the measurement of the GC activity. Our results suggest that GCAPs activate retGC-1 by enhancing its dimerization, and that transition of the active form of retGC-1 to its inactive form is caused by either partial or complete dissociation of the dimeric form.

Bovine ROS were prepared from dark-adapted frozen retinas as described (49Yamazaki A. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bleached ROS membranes from 20 retinas were suspended in 3 ml of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmleupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 100 μmCaCl2), homogenized by passing through a No. 21 needle 10 times and centrifuged (200,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min) (x 7). The membranes were further washed (3 times) with Buffer B (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluorine, 5 μmleupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A), suspended in 3 ml of Buffer B, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The washed membranes are termed GCAPs-free ROS membranes. Purified retGC from bovine ROS was prepared using a GTP-agarose column (5Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies indicated that 5 μg of protein of a ROS homogenate had high GC activity with negligible hydrolysis of cGMP under assay conditions. Thus, 5 μg of protein of ROS homogenate or GCAPs-free ROS membranes were used for all studies. Briefly, ROS membranes (5 μg of protein) were incubated with 200 μl of Buffer C (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm GTP, 1 mm cGMP, 2 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, ∼5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and ∼0.5 μCi of [3H]cGMP). The reaction was initiated by addition of GTP and cGMP. Following incubation (37 °C for 10 min), the reaction was terminated by adding 40 μl of 1 n HCl and boiling for 2 min. [32P]cGMP derived from [α-32P]GTP was isolated by alumina and AG 1-X2 columns (5Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and both3H and 32P radioactivities in samples were counted. In order to obtain the exact relationship between dimerization of retGC-1 and its activity, cross-linking reaction of retGC-1 was carried out under conditions similar to that for the measurement of GC activity, although the protein concentrations used were different because each experiment was performed in its linear range. A bovine ROS homogenate, GCAPs-free ROS membranes or COS-7 cell membranes containing recombinant bovine retGC-1 were used. The preparation was suspended in 50 μl of Buffer D (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm GTP, 1 mm cGMP, and 5 mm MgCl2). Pilot experiments indicated that the optimal conditions for the cross-linking reaction by BS3 were the following: BS3concentration, 50 μm (Fig. 1); temperature for the cross-linking reaction, 0 °C; incubation period for the cross-linking reaction, 30 min; and protein, 50 μg. We note that the GTP regeneration system and proteinase inhibitors added in the GC assay mixture did not affect the cross-linking reactions. We also note that the presence of 1 mm GTP in the cross-linking reaction mixture slightly (less than 10%) inhibited the formation of the 210-kDa cross-linked product, but 1 mm cGMP did not. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by addition of SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The cross-linked products were immediately separated by SDS-PAGE (5–20% acrylamide gradient). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to PVDF membranes and cross-linked products of retGC-1 were detected with a retGC-1-specific antibody (13Liu X. Seno k. Nishizawa Y. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Matsumoto H. Wakabayashi T. Usukura J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and chemiluminescent autoradiography using ULTRA Super Signal substrate. The bands of cross-linked products were scanned by Paragon 1200A3 Pro Scanner and the relative density (mm2 × OD) was calculated by Molecular Analyst Software (Bio-Rad). It should be emphasized that the R f value of the 210-kDa cross-linked product was slightly different in each SDS-PAGE; however, the molecular mass of the 210-kDa product was constantly monitored by myosin (205 kDa) as a molecular standard. The molecular mass of the >400-kDa cross-linked product(s) was estimated using high molecular mass (97,400–584,400) standards. The freshly solubilized retGC was prepared by incubation of ROS membranes with 1 ml of Buffer E (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside for 2 h at 0 °C (5Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), a portion of the supernatant (1.5 mg of protein, 200 μl) was immediately applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (9 × 600 mm) which had been equilibrated with Buffer E containing 0.1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Another portion of the supernatant was stored on ice overnight, and applied to the column under the same conditions. Purified retGC (8 μg) was also applied to the column under the same conditions. Column chromatography conditions were as follows: flow rate, 1.5 ml/10 min; and fraction volume, 1.0 ml. For column calibration, proteins with known Stokes radii were chromatographed under identical conditions. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (51Yamazaki A. Tatsumi M. Torney D.C. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9316-9323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assayed with bovine serum albumin as standard (52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in samples containing a detergent was monitored as described (5Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca-EGTA buffers were calculated (26Goraczniak R.M. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and prepared (53Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Free [Ca2+] was verified by Ca2+-electrode and Rod-2 titration. It should be emphasized that all experiments were carried out more than two times, and the results were similar. Data shown are representative of these experiments. Dimerization or oligomerization of peptide-regulated GCs have been monitored using several methods including cross-linking (45Iwata T. Uchida-Mizuno K. Katafuchi T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 73-79Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), measurement of molecular weight (46Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the yeast two-hybrid system (47Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this study, to obtain the exact relationship between dimerization of retGC-1 and its activity, we attempted to fix dimeric (or oligomeric) forms of retGC-1 by cross-linking under a condition similar to these used for measurement of GC activity. We found that two oligomeric forms of the retGC-1, ∼210 and >400 kDa, were fixed by less than 60 μm BS3 in a ROS homogenate (Fig.1, upper inset). The amounts of both cross-linked products were increased in a [BS3]-dependent manner; however, the 210-kDa product was detected by a much lower [BS3] than the >400-kDa product. These cross-linked products in ROS homogenates were also formed with different cross-linkers, such as 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) and disuccinimidyl suberate. These two cross-linked products of retGC-1 were also observed in a purified retGC preparation (Fig. 1, lower inset), indicating that these oligomers are made from retGC. Because the molecular mass (∼210 kDa) of the cross-linking product is similar to the calculated molecular mass of the retGC-1 dimer (∼220 kDa), we conclude that the 210-kDa product is a dimer of retGC-1. We note that the 210-kDa cross-linked product was detected in ROS homogenates only when [Ca2+] was low (data not shown), and that the amount of 210-kDa product in the purified retGC-1 preparation was much less than that in ROS homogenates. RetGC-1 has been shown to be regulated by proteins, such as GCAPs (14Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B.

Moreover, the side chains of Asn-123 and His-294 which are reported to bind the substrate, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, form hydrogen bonds characteristic of Galdieria Rubisco. Small subunits of Galdieria Rubisco have more than 30 extra amino acid residues on the C terminus, which make up a hairpin-loop structure to form many interactions with the neighboring small subunits.

It catalyzes the addition of gaseous CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) and produces two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) (1Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. Hatch M.D. Boardman N.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131-218Google Scholar, 2Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, this enzyme also catalyzes O2 addition to RuBP as the primary reaction of photorespiration. The latter reaction yields one molecule each of 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate from one molecule of RuBP. The oxygenation reaction reduces the photosynthetic efficiency up to 60% (3Zelitch I. Science. 1975; 188: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus the improvement of the carboxylation/oxygenation ratio by genetic engineering has been attempted to increase the productivity of crop plants. For the activation of Rubisco, the reaction of CO2 with ε-amino group of conserved Lys-201 must occur to form carbamate, which is stabilized by Mg2+ (4Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Carbamylation is necessary for both carboxylation and oxygenation reactions. Rubisco can be easily activated by including Mg2+ and bicarbonate in vitro, but in vivo activation requires a soluble chloroplast protein, Rubisco activase, and ATP (5Portis Jr., A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rubisco exists as a hexadecamer (L8S8) composed of eight large and eight small subunits and its molecular mass is about 550,000 Da in all eukaryotes except dinoflagellates and many bacteria (1Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. Hatch M.D. Boardman N.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131-218Google Scholar). Another type of Rubisco is composed of only large subunits as found in some dinoflagellates and some photosynthetic bacteria,Rhodospirillum rubrum. The primary structure of Rubisco's large subunits of non-green algae lacking chlorophyll b are highly homologous to that of the β-purple bacterial enzyme, however, less homologous to those of the enzymes of higher plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria (6Morden C.W. Golden S.S. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 379-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, amino acid sequences of small subunits are less similar than those of large subunits across the Rubiscos. Small subunits of Rubisco genes (rbcS) are nuclear-encoded in green algae,Euglena and higher plants (1Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. Hatch M.D. Boardman N.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131-218Google Scholar, 7Tabita F.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 155-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small subunits of these Rubiscos have 12–18 amino acid insertions, which are not present in the plastid-encoded small subunits of non-green algae and β-purple bacteria. On the other hand, more than 30 extra amino acid residues exist on the C terminus in these organisms (8Assali N.-E. Martin W.F. Sommerville C.C. Loiseaux-de Goër S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From phylogenetic analysis, Rubisco genes are divided into three groups, α-purple bacterial, β-purple bacterial, and non-green algal, and γ-bacterial, cyanobacterial and plant groups (9Assali N.-E. Mache R. Loiseaux-de Goër S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Even though the structural difference among these groups is presumed, no crystal structure of the non-green algal group has been determined. The gaseous substrates CO2 and O2 are the competitive inhibitors of oxygenase and carboxylase, respectively. The carboxylation/oxygenation ratio is defined as CO2/O2 relative specificity factor (Sr),V c K o/V o K c, where V c and V o are maximum velocities of carboxylation and oxygenation, and K oand K c are the Michaelis constants for O2 and CO2, respectively (10Liang W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high Sr value means the Rubisco with an effective carbon fixation activity. Rubisco from R. rubrum with L2 composition has the low Sr value of 15. In the case of Rubiscos with L8S8 composition, Sr values are 45 forSynechococcus, 70 for Chlamydomonas, and 93 for spinach (11Uemura K. Suzuki Y. Shinkai T. Wadano A. Jensen R.G. Chmara W. Yokota A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 325-331Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rubiscos from marine algae have been found to exhibit high Sr values over 100 (12Read B.A. Tabita F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Especially, Rubiscos from thermophilic red algae show exceptionally high Sr values. Rubisco fromGaldieria partita has the Sr value of 238, which is the highest among the Rubiscos hitherto reported (13Uemura K. Anwaruzzaman Miyachi S. Yokota A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thek cat(C)/K C andk cat(O)/K O values are compared between Galdieria and spinach enzymes, wherek cat(C) and k cat(O) are maximum turnover numbers of carboxylation and oxygenation, respectively. k cat(C)/K Cvalues are 0.242 and 0.182 s−1 site−1μm−1 in Galdieria and spinach Rubiscos, respectively. There is only 1.3-fold difference in carboxylation reaction between these Rubiscos. On the other hand,k cat(O)/K O values are 0.00102 and 0.00194 s−1 site−1μm−1 for these Rubiscos, respectively. About 2-fold difference between these Rubiscos is observed in the oxygenation reaction. The structure of Galdieria enzyme may hinder the stabilization of the transition state for the oxygenation reaction (13Uemura K. Anwaruzzaman Miyachi S. Yokota A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the complex of activated Rubiscos from spinach, tobacco, and Synechococcus with 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (2-CABP) have been reported (14Shibata N. Inoue T.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7078-7083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-CABP tightly binds to the active site of Rubisco (K d < 10 pm) and plays an inhibitory role for the carboxylation and oxygenation of RuBP (19Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). If the crystal structure of Rubisco fromG. partita could be solved and compared with those of other Rubisco's, it may be possible to derive the structural principle to control its high Sr value. Here we report the crystal structure analysis of the complex of activated Rubisco from a thermophilic red alga G. partitawith 2-CABP at 2.4-Å resolution. This is the first report on the crystal structure of Rubisco from β-purple bacterial and non-green algal group. Galdieria Rubisco was purified with the same method as described (13Uemura K. Anwaruzzaman Miyachi S. Yokota A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Crystallization of Galdieria Rubisco has already been reported (20Shibata N. Yamamoto H. Inoue T. Uemura K. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1064-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, a new crystal form of hexagonal lattice was obtained during the improvement process of crystallization conditions. The resolution of hexagonal crystal is higher than that of the reported monoclinic crystal. Crystallization was carried out using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion (21McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. 1st Ed. John Wiley, New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar). The drops consisted of 2 μl of protein solution of 10.0 mg ml−1 comprising 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, and 2 mm 2-CABP, and 2 μl of precipitating solution suspended over a 0.5-ml reservoir containing the same precipitating solution. Two crystal forms were obtained, monoclinic and hexagonal. Crystallization conditions of monoclinic form was 100 mmHepes (pH 7.5) containing 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 8% ethylene glycol for reservoir solution. By the use of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol instead of ethylene glycol, the hexagonal form was obtained. Finally, the hexagonal crystals were obtained at 293 K using 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 9% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 4% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol for reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a typical size of 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 in 4–5 days. Data collection was performed on beamline BL18B of the Photon Factory using the screenless Weissenberg camera (22Sakabe N. Nucl.

The space group of Rubisco was determined to be hexagonal P64 with unit cell parameters of a = b = 117.07 andc = 319.63 Å. Assuming L4S4 of Rubisco in the asymmetric unit, the Matthews constantV M (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7935) Google Scholar) is calculated to be 2.55 Å3Da−1 corresponding to a solvent content of 51.5%, which is the value for conventional protein crystals. X-ray diffraction data were processed by using DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Issacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend 1993. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1993: 56-62Google Scholar). A total of 277,331 measurements from 83,303 unique reflections were recorded and R merge was 9.7% for the data between 40 and 2.4 Å, with the completeness of 86.4%. Crystal structure of Galdieria Rubisco was solved by the molecular replacement method. The search model was based upon both large and small subunits (L1S1) of the activated Rubisco from Synechococcus complexed with 2-CABP (PDB code 1RBL) (17Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonconserved residues of the model were replaced by alanine. Molecular replacement calculations were performed by using AMoRe (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5031) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19824) Google Scholar). A pair of L4S4 in the asymmetric unit is related by the crystallographic 2-fold axis. From the calculation of self-rotation function, non-crystallographic 2-fold axis was found with high correlation coefficient. Thus, L4S4 has two non-crystallographic 2-fold axes, which are orthogonalized to a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Then, the practical structure unit is reduced up to L2S2. From the calculation of cross-rotation and translation functions, four expected solutions have been found. The model was refined by the use of X-PLOR with 2- and 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (27Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar). The 4-fold axis is set in common with one of the non-crystallographic 2-fold axes. Five percent of the reflections were set aside forR free calculations (28Brünger A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 366-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After the application of one round of simulated annealing protocol, multiple cycles of model fitting and refinements were alternated. When the weight of 2- and 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were 300 and 100 kcal·molecule−1 Å−2, respectively,R free value was the lowest. Ordered water molecules were included by selecting the peaks based onF obs − F calc difference Fourier maps contoured at 2.0 ς and 2F obs −F calc density contoured at 1.0 ς. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were performed throughout the refinement process. At the final stage of refinement, bulk solvent correction was applied. The quality of the final model was assessed from Ramachandran plots and analysis of model geometry with the program PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The plot indicated that 90.6% of the residues lay in the favorable regions, 9.2% in the allowed regions and 0.2% in the disallowed regions (Ser-135 of small subunit). The final Rand R free factors for all the reflections between 20.0- and 2.4-Å resolutions were 0.165 and 0.197, respectively. The root mean square deviations from ideal geometry of the bond lengths and angles were 0.010 Å and 2.55°, respectively. The estimated mean coordinate error is about 0.25 Å as deduced from the Luzzati plot (30Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). Compared with spinach Rubisco, the large subunits of Galdieria Rubisco have 8 and 10 prolonged amino acid residues on N and C termini, respectively. In the final model ofGaldieria Rubisco, the large subunits are traced in the electron density maps for residues 7–478, while the small subunits are traced for all residues. In the crystal structures of activated spinach and Synechococcus Rubiscos complexed with 2-CABP, the electron density of the large subunits was traced for residues 9–475 (15Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Galdieria Rubisco has a L8S8structure composed of 8 L1S1 units related by approximate D 4 point symmetry (Fig.1), which is common in cyanobacterial and plant Rubiscos. Secondary structures of Galdieria Rubisco are almost the same except the extra α-helix in residues 77–80 and the loss of β-strand in residues 24–26 of the large subunits (Fig.2). Sequence identities betweenGaldieria and spinach or Synechococcus Rubiscos are both about 60% in the large subunits and both about 30% in the small subunits, however, the differences in their overall structures are little between these Rubiscos. The root mean square deviations in L2S2 structures between Galdieriaand spinach or Synechococcus Rubiscos are 0.96 or 0.90 Å for 1138 corresponding Cα atoms, respectively, while that between spinach and Synechococcus Rubiscos is 0.62 Å. The root mean square deviations in the large and the small subunits betweenGaldieria and spinach Rubiscos are 0.70 and 1.47 Å, respectively, which indicates a larger structural difference between the small subunits than that between the large ones.Figure 2Sequence alignment of the Rubiscos and secondary structure of Galdieria Rubisco . These sequences have been aligned using the crystal structure of activated spinach and Synechococcus Rubiscos complexed with 2-CABP (14Shibata N. Inoue T. Fukuhara K. Nagara Y. Kitagawa R. Harada S.

The residues which cause the structural changes around the active site in Galdieria Rubisco areboxed with blue. Since N-terminal residues of the large subunit in Galdieria Rubisco are disordered and quite different from the structure of spinach enzyme's structures, large subunit sequences of N-terminal residues 1–13 were not aligned. The spinach numbering has been used in Galdieria and other Rubiscos. Secondary structure in Galdieria Rubisco was determined by the program DSSP (57Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12507) Google Scholar). Secondary structure assignment is from Knight et al. (58Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Helix-O (residues 77–80) of the large subunit is only observed in Galdieria Rubisco.

However, the corresponding residue is methionine in Galdieria Rubisco. Moreover, while tobacco Rubisco possibly forms disulfide bonds of 172–192 and 449–459 pairs (16Schreuder H.A. Knight S.

Thus,Galdieria Rubisco has no disulfide bond. Amino acid residues directly interacting with 2-CABP are completely conserved inGaldieria, spinach, tobacco, and SynechococcusRubiscos (Fig. 2). In Galdieria Rubisco, the magnesium ion is coordinated by the six atoms in the same way as in other Rubiscos (carbamate oxygen of Lys-201, side chains of Asp-203 and Glu-204, C-2 and C-3 hydroxyl groups, and carboxylate oxygen of 2-CABP) (14Shibata N. Inoue T. Fukuhara K. Nagara Y. Kitagawa R. Harada S. Kasai N. Uemura K. Kato K. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biol.

There are little differences of coordination geometry and the structure of 2-CABP between Galdieria and other Rubiscos. The binding modes of 2-CABP in Galdieria and other Rubiscos are almost the same, too. Loop-6 of the large subunits consists of residues 328–339 and exists between helix-6 and strand-6. Residues 329–337 in loop-6 are completely conserved except small subunit-less Rubiscos. Crystal structure of inactivated tobacco Rubisco adopts an open conformation in loop-6 (31Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loop-6 of activated unliganded spinach Rubisco is disordered. In contrast, structures of activated Rubiscos complexed with 2-CABP adopt a closed conformation and the ε-amino group of Lys-334 makes ion pairs to the carboxyl group of 2-CABP and the side chain of Glu-60 (Fig.3 A) (14Shibata N. Inoue T. Fukuhara K. Nagara Y. Kitagawa R. Harada S. Kasai N. Uemura K. Kato K. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biol.

Here, the ion pair formation is defined as the interaction between the ions within 4 Å distance. The mobility of loop-6 is necessary to bind the substrate RuBP and stabilize the reaction intermediate. GaldieriaRubisco complexed with 2-CABP also has the closed conformation. No significant difference is found in the main chain structure of loop-6 between the closed forms of Galdieria and spinach orSynechococcus Rubiscos. Temperature factors of the atoms in loop-6 are not so high in these Rubiscos suggesting that the loop is fixed in the closed structure. The side chain of Glu-336 makes a hydrogen bond to the main chain nitrogen of residue 472 in spinach, tobacco, and Synechococcus Rubiscos (14Shibata N. Inoue T. Fukuhara K. Nagara Y. Kitagawa R.

Residue 472 of β-purple bacterial and non-green algal Rubiscos is threonine, whose hydroxyl group together with the main chain nitrogen make hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Glu-336 in Galdieria Rubisco (Fig. 3 A). However, the side chain orientation of Lys-334 which makes ion pair to C-2 carboxylate group of 2-CABP is little different between Galdieria and spinach Rubiscos. Along the non-crystallographic 4-fold axis, there is a narrow solvent channel passing through the center of the Rubisco holoenzyme (Fig.1 A). The extra amino acid residues on the C-terminal end of the small subunit in Galdieria Rubisco make up hairpin-loop structure (Fig. 4 A). So, the solvent channel of Galdieria Rubisco is narrower than spinach Rubisco. The C-terminal region of the small subunit makes many interactions with other regions, especially with the neighboring small subunits. When the structures of Galdieria and spinach Rubiscos are superimposed, the hairpin region of the neighboring small subunit in Galdieria enzyme and apical portion of extra insertion residues 52–63 in spinach enzyme are almost overlapped to each other (Fig. 4). However, the insertion residues in spinach Rubisco makes only two hydrogen bonds to the large subunit composed of L1S1 and no interaction with neighboring small subunit (14Shibata N. Inoue T. Fukuhara K. Nagara Y. Kitagawa R. Harada S. Kasai N. Uemura K. Kato K. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26449-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The unique C-terminal region in GaldieriaRubisco forms one hydrogen bond and one ion pair to the large subunit composed of L1S1. Moreover, this region makes two hydrogen bonds to the neighboring large subunit arranged around the 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. In Galdieria Rubisco, Ser-135 of the small subunits occupies the disallowed region in the Ramachandran plot. Residues 134–137 of the small subunit forms β-bend I and the hydroxyl group and the main chain nitrogen of Ser-135 make hydrogen bonds to the main chain oxygen atoms of Lys-258 and Asn-287 of the neighboring large subunit, respectively. These bonds may distort the two dihedral angle (ϕ, φ) of Ser-135. Arg-130 of small subunit is almost conserved in β-purple bacterial and non-green algal group (8Assali N.-E. Martin W.F. Sommerville C.C. Loiseaux-de Goër S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The side chain of Arg-130 forms two intersubunit ion pairs. Moreover, this β-hairpin region forms 32 intersubunit ion pairs in the overall complex. Compared with the active site structures of Synechococcus or spinach Rubiscos (14Shibata N. Inoue T. Fukuhara K. Nagara Y. Kitagawa R. Harada S. Kasai N. Uemura K. Kato K. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26449-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,17Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Galdieria Rubisco has the unique structure around P-2 phosphate of 2-CABP. Especially, side chains of His-327 and Arg-295 show the significant structural differences from those of spinach Rubisco (Fig. 3, B and C). Around His-327, the terminal oxygen of Tyr-346 in Galdieria Rubisco forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-329 (Fig. 3 B). In higher plants and Synechococcus, residue 346 is valine instead of tyrosine. So the extra hydrogen bond in GaldieriaRubisco may affect the position of the side chain of His-327. Mutations of His-327 of R. rubrum Rubisco replaced by asparagine, glutamine, serine, and alanine increase more than 4 times theK m for RuBP compared with that of wild-type enzyme (33Harpel M.R. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24734-24740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, His-327 appears to control the K m for RuBP. His-298 is completely conserved except Rubiscos from non-green algae, in which residue 298 is asparagine. In Galdieria Rubisco, the side chain of Asn-298 ma"

When human DNA polymerase (pol) β was used to copy a short single-stranded gap containing a site-directed 8-oxo-dG lesion, incorporation of dAMP opposite 8-oxo-dG was slightly favored over dCMP depending on “downstream” sequence context. Unexpectedly, however, a significant increase in dCMP·A and dGMP·A mispairs was also observed at the “upstream” 3′-template site adjacent to the lesion. Errors at these undamaged template sites occurred in four sequence contexts with both gapped and primed single-stranded DNA templates, but not when pol α replaced pol β.

In contrast to G, which exists predominantly in an anti-conformation in DNA and forms base pairs almost exclusively with C, base pairing properties of 8-oxo-dG tend to be ambiguous, having asyn-conformation when paired opposite A (4Kouchakdjian M. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Eisenberg F. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J.

Procaryotic and eucaryotic cells contain highly conserved groups of enzymes to deal with the potentially lethal levels of 8-oxo-dG-stimulated mutations. Analogs of Escherichia coliMutM glycosylase excise 8-oxo-dG from DNA (paired opposite C) (6Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together, MutM and MutY, along with MutT, responsible for eliminating oxidized G from deoxy- and ribonucleoside triphosphate pools (7Maki H. Sekiguchi M.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Although most 8-oxo-dG lesions are repaired by this system, those that escape repair are likely to encounter DNA polymerases during either replicative or repair DNA synthesis. The nucleotide incorporation specificity opposite 8-oxo-dG may vary depending on which polymerase is used to copy the lesion in vitro (10Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Furthermore, very little is known regarding the effects of sequence context on incorporation specificities for different polymerases (11Hatahet Z. Zhou M. Reha-Krantz L.J. Morrical S.W. Wallace S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8556-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have used human DNA polymerase (pol) β and pol α to investigate specificity of incorporation opposite 8-oxo-dG, varying the template base immediately downstream from the lesion. During the course of this study, we observed unexpectedly that in addition to its own ambiguous base pairing properties, 8-oxo-dG also stimulates nucleotide misincorporations at adjacent upsteam and downstream template sites. This paper is focused on the potential implications of 8-oxo-dG-stimulated “action-at-a-distance” mutagenesis in relation to pol β-catalyzed gap repair synthesis. Human pol β was purified as described (12Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B. Widen S.G. Notario V. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). pol α (2000 units/mg), a kind gift from Dr. T. S.-F. Wang, refers to the large catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme and was purified as described (13Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22739-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both enzymes are highly purified and contain no detectable 3′-exonuclease activity. One DNA polymerase unit is defined as the incorporation of 1 nmol of dNMP into DNA in 1 h at 37 °C. DNA polymerase activity for pol β was measured on gapped primer-template DNA and for pol α on ungapped DNA. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Nonradioactive nucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [γ-33P]ATP (2000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Radiochemicals. 8-Oxo-dG phosphoramidite was synthesized as described (14Koizume S. Kamiya H. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1994; 13: 1517-1534Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Templates containing a single 8-oxo-dG site, control templates with no lesion, and various primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a 5′-phosphate group, needed to form 5-base gaps for pol β, were synthesized by Lynn Williams at the University of Southern California Comprehensive Cancer Center. To investigate the insertion specificity of pol β opposite 8-oxo-dG, 5-base gaps with the lesion in their center were formed by annealing 15-mer primers and 22-mer downstream oligodeoxyribonucleotides to 42-mer templates with a 8-oxo-dG lesion at position 18. The downstream oligodeoxyribonucleotides were phosphorylated at their 5′-end. This and a gap size of fewer than 6 nucleotides are required by pol β for processivity (15Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies of insertion opposite normal G or 8-Br-dG, similar primer templates were used with either G or 8-Br-dG substituting for 8-oxo-dG at position 18. The same experiments were also carried out with pol α, but no downstream oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used since these inhibited pol α activity ∼2-fold (data not shown). All primers and templates were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Primers were 5′-end-labeled with 33P using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (16Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Annealing was carried out by incubating 7.5 nm primer with 7.5 nm template and 38 nm downstream oligodeoxyribonucleotide in pol β reaction buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6.7 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% glycerol) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature. For pol α, 7.5 nm primer was annealed to 7.5 nm template in pol α reaction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature. Time courses were run to establish the conditions for measuring incorporation efficiencies opposite 8-oxo-dG. Reactions were carried out by mixing equal volumes of annealed primer-template with reaction buffer containing deoxyribonucleotide (for buffer components, see annealing conditions described above). The final concentration of primer-template in the reactions was 3.8 nm. pol β (0.2 units) or pol α (0.02 units) was added, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Under these conditions, the data for both enzymes were in the linear range. Four primer-template constructs were used to investigate the effect of the downstream nearest neighbor on incorporation efficiencies at the 8-oxo-dG site. For each reaction, the dNTP substrate for incorporation opposite the lesion was varied in concentration over a range of 10 μm to 1.2 mm. In the time course experiments, the dNTP substrate was held constant at 800 μm. The reactions were performed under running-start conditions with 5 μm dTTP for insertion opposite the two As upstream from 8-oxo-dG. Reactions were terminated by adding 2 volumes of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then cooled on ice, and the single-stranded primers were separated according to length by electrophoresis on 18% polyacrylamide gels. The kinetics of incorporation of each of the four deoxynucleotides opposite the lesion were determined as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration (17Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Band intensities were measured by a PhosphorImager using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Incorporation efficiencies were established as described (16Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To determine the nature of the dNMPs incorporated at or around the lesion site by pol β, primer extension reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 μm dTTP (running-start base) and a 50 μmconcentration of either dATP or dCTP. At various time points (a range of 1–30 min), ddATP or ddCTP was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the reactions were allowed to continue for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated as described above. Controls were run under the same conditions, but in the absence of dideoxynucleotides. Reaction products were separated on 18% polyacrylamide gels. We identified each product sequence based on the dideoxynucleotide sequencing data. An independent sequence confirmation was obtained first by synthesizing each “full size” oligonucleotide sequence on a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer). The oligonucleotides were gel-purified and 5′-end-labeled with 33P. A sequencing ladder containing a digest of the labeled oligonucleotides was obtained by 3′-exonucleolytic digestion using E. coli DNA polymerase III core (containing the ε-proofreading exonuclease) under the following conditions. Labeled oligonucleotide (13 nm) was incubated with 0.5 nm pol III core for 2–5 min at 37 °C in pol III reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2). Reactions were quenched as described above. Samples were run alongside pol β reaction products on 18% polyacrylamide gels. We have measured the effects of sequence context on dAMP and dCMP insertion efficiencies opposite 8-oxo-dG using human polymerases β and α. Synthesis by pol β involves filling in a 5-nucleotide template gap, 3′-AA 8-oxo-dG NC-5′, where the nucleotide N, immediately downstream from the lesion, is varied (Fig.1 and TableI). Two Ts are incorporated opposite the two running-start As, followed by incorporation of each of the four dNMPs opposite 8-oxo-dG. We have also used pol α to copy a subset of these sequences (Table I).Table INucleotide incorporation specificities for pol β and α opposite 8-oxo-dG, 8-Br-dG, and GPrimer-template DNA structure and sequenceaLetters in boldface indicate where template bases have been changed, e.g. G or 8-Br-dG (BG) replacing 8-oxo-dG (GO).

Open table in a new tab An analysis of the data reveals that pol β inserts dAMP slightly more efficiently than dCMP opposite 8-oxo-dG with three of the four 5′-nearest-neighbor bases and inserts dAMP and dCMP with about equal efficiency with the other nearest-neighbor base (G) (Table I). Both dAMP and dCMP are incorporated slightly more efficiently when C is the 5′-nearest neighbor. The efficiency of dCMP incorporation opposite 8-oxo-dG is 4-fold less than that of dCMP incorporation opposite G in this sequence context. This same template sequence, having an abasic site in place of 8-oxo-dG, also showed the highest misincorporation efficiency (16Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Low intensity gel bands corresponding to the incorporation of either dGMP or dTMP opposite 8-oxo-dG are clearly visible (Fig. 1, a and b). However, their corresponding V max/K m values are <1% of the values for incorporation of either A or C and are excluded from Table I. pol α also preferentially incorporates A opposite 8-oxo-dG. However, in contrast to pol β, which incorporates A with at most a 2-fold higher efficiency compared with C, pol α favors incorporation of A with much higher selectivity, ∼5–10-fold (Table I). The gel band patterns in Fig.1 demonstrate that dAMP and dCMP are both readily incorporated opposite 8-oxo-dG by pol β and are also extended 1 nucleotide beyond the lesion by incorporation of a mismatched base pair. Remarkably, however, in addition to its ambiguous base pairing and promiscuous extension properties, 8-oxo-dG also stimulates nucleotide misincorporations at adjacent upstream template sites. Correct and incorrect incorporations opposite a single template site appear as doublet gel bands (Fig. 1). When a combination of dTTP (at 5 μm, for incorporation opposite the running-start As) and either dCTP or dGTP at increasing concentrations is included in pol β reactions, doublet bands occur upstream, downstream, or directly opposite 8-oxo-dG in a sequence-dependent manner. In contrast, there are no doublet bands detected when dATP is used as a substrate for pol β, even when high-resolution (20% polyacrylamide) gels are used (data not shown). Data illustrating the presence of doublets are presented in which C (Fig. 1 a), A (Fig. 1 b), G (Fig.1 c), or T (Fig. 1 d) is immediately downstream from 8-oxo-dG on the template strand. We can identify individual doublet band sequences unambiguously, in almost all instances, using the following criteria. Dideoxynucleotides (ddCTP or ddATP) are added to the reaction at different time points, resulting in termination of primer extension following incorporation of each ddNMP by pol β. Each specific oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to the partial sequences deduced from the termination data, along with permutations of other possible sequences, are then synthesized; the synthetic oligonucleotides are end-labeled with33P and used as molecular mass markers for comparison with polymerase reaction products (Fig. 2). For example, the doublet appearing opposite template A in thedGTP lane (Fig. 2 a) contains G and T as upper and lower bands, respectively, based on the marker digest shown to the right. In a similar way, the doublet in the dCTP lane (Fig.2 b) is resolved into a lower C and an upper T. With C as the adjacent downstream neighbor (Fig. 1 a), doublets occur only when dTTP + dCTP are present in the reaction. The lesion is flanked by both upstream and downstream doublets. The upstream doublet opposite A is easily observed, even at the lowest concentration of dCTP (10 μm), and reflects the correct incorporation of dTMP (upper band in doublet) and the misincorporation of dCMP opposite A (lower band in doublet). The downstream doublet is much less intense, appearing at dCTP concentrations above 200 μm. The downstream doublet results from incorporation of two dCMPs (opposite 8-oxo-dG and then opposite C) from each upstream doublet. No other dNTP gives rise to doublets in this sequence context. Note that the 5-nucleotide gap is filled to the end when dGTP is present in the reaction. However, in contrast to incorporation of either dCMP or dAMP, incorporation of dGMP is unlikely to be occurring directly opposite 8-oxo-dG. Instead, G incorporation is likely to be taking place opposite the template C downstream from 8-oxo-dG (3′-AA 8-oxo-dG CC) (Fig. 1 a) by “skipping over” 8-oxo-dG using a transiently misaligned primer 3′-end (Fig.3; see “Discussion”) (16Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the template sequence 3′-AA 8-oxo-dG GC (Fig.1 c), both dAMP and dCMP are incorporated almost equally, primarily because of a reduction inV max/K m for incorporation of dAMP directly opposite 8-oxo-dG as opposed to an increase in the dCMP incorporation efficiency, e.g. compareV max/K m values in the dATP and dCTP columns for the four gapped primer-template DNAs containing 8-oxo-dG (Table I, first four sequences). Note thatV max/K m for incorporation of dCMP is no higher than for the other three sequences (Table I), suggesting that misalignment misincorporation may not be occurring. Three doublets are observed when G is located downstream from 8-oxo-dG when the reaction is carried out in the presence of dCTP + dTTP. The doublets occur opposite both upstream running-start As and directly opposite 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 1 c, dCTP lanes). Weak intensity bands running just below the bands corresponding to incorporation of each running-start T (Fig. 1 c, lower two arrows) are generated by misincorporation of dCMP opposite both As upstream from 8-oxo-dG. Further extension of each of the lower doublets gives rise to weak doublet bands opposite 8-oxo-dG (Fig.1 c, upper arrow). The weak bands corresponding to incorporation of C opposite 8-oxo-dG are efficiently extended by incorporation of another dCMP opposite the downstream G, followed, most likely, by misincorporation of dCMP opposite C. We also find that dAMP·8-oxo-dG base pairs are easily extended by two consecutive misincorporations of dAMP opposite the template bases G and C downstream from the lesion (Fig. 1 c, dATP lanes). The relative ease with which nucleotides can be misincorporated by pol β downstream from 8-oxo-dG (Fig.1 c, dATP and dCTP lanes) may result from significant template distortions by 8-oxo-dG and by primer termini distortions caused by the non-Watson-Crick 8-oxo-dG·A base pairing structure. For the template sequence having T proximal to 8-oxo-dG, there is a single upstream doublet when dCTP is included in the reaction, originating from correct incorporation of dTMP and misincorporation of dCMP opposite the second running-start A (Fig.1 d). Since the doublets are sequence-dependent, we decided to mask the template sequence downstream from 8-oxo-dG, by reducing the gap length from 5 to 3 bases, to see if the upstream doublet bands were altered by eliminating the downstream region of ssDNA. Indeed, the doublet bands were not altered. An example is shown where the template region to the 5′-side of 8-oxo-dG is annealed to a downstream oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). The doublet upstream from 8-oxo-dG is present at the same dCTP concentration (10 μm) either with or without the covered downstream Cs (compare Figs. 4 and 1 a). The 8-kDa amino-terminal domain of pol β has been shown to interact with the 5′-phosphoryl group on the downstream gap-forming DNA when functioning as a deoxyribose phosphate lyase during base excision repair (19Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 20Pierson C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is necessary to determine if the doublets occur only in the presence of gapped DNA. Since pol β is much more active and processive with primer-template DNA containing a 1–6-nucleotide gap compared with primed ssDNA (15Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we carried out reactions with both gapped and primed ssDNAs over a 10-fold range of enzyme concentration (Fig.5 a). The substrates for the reaction, dTTP for the running start and dCTP for incorporation opposite 8-oxo-dG, are those that give rise to doublet bands opposite the upstream A proximal to 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 1 a, dCTP lanes). Doublet bands opposite A are observed at each pol β level in the gap-filling reaction (Fig. 5 a, right panel). However, despite significantly reduced synthesis using primed ssDNA, a doublet band is nevertheless detectable opposite the upstream A at the highest pol β concentration used (Fig. 5 a, left panel). Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between the 8-kDa domain of pol β and the 5′-phosphoryl is not linked exclusively to the presence of the dCMP·A upstream misincorporation band. Although the downstream oligonucleotide is not necessary for doublet formation, its presence is required for continued synthesis beyond 8-oxo-dG. A similar experiment performed using pol α shows that doublets are not observed with either primer-template DNA (Fig.5 b), suggesting that these unusual misincorporation events are dependent not only on the presence of 8-oxo-dG, but also on properties specific to pol β. Again, the misincorporations upstream of 8-oxo-dG could be linked to 8-oxo-dG-induced distortions in the template (see “Discussion”). Templates with normal G in place of 8-oxo-dG were incubated with pol β (Fig. 6) or pol α (data not shown). Both polymerases incorporate two dTMPs opposite the two running-start As and dCMP opposite G. At high dCTP concentrations (≥100 μm), pol β catalyzes weak misincorporation of dCMP opposite the downstream C. However, no doublets are formed by pol β using templates in which either G (Fig.6) or T (data not shown) is used in place of 8-oxo-dG. NMR studies have shown that 8-oxo-dG favors asyn-conformation when paired opposite A (4Kouchakdjian M. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Eisenberg F. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1407-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Data showing favored hydrolysis of both 8-oxo-dGTP (22Akiyama M. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3949-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and 8-Br-dGTP (23Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) over dGTP by the MutT hydrolase suggest that 8-Br-dG also favors asyn-conformation (24Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although direct NMR evidence is not yet available to substantiate this point. To investigate whether asyn-nucleotide is required to generate mispair-containing doublet bands proximal to the template lesion, 8-Br-dG was substituted for 8-oxo-dG and copied using reactions similar to those displayed in Fig. 1 a (with C as the 5′-neighbor). Reactions were carried out using pol β (Fig. 7 a) and pol α (Fig. 7 b). Both polymerases exhibit similar primer extension patterns in the presence of 8-Br-dG. Following incorporation of the running-start Ts, dCMP and dAMP are incorporated directly opposite the modified template base. However, in contrast to the templates containing 8-oxo-dG, for which incorporation of dAMP is favored over dCMP (Table I), the reverse is now true, with dCMP strongly favored for incorporation opposite 8-Br-dG by both polymerases (Fig. 7, a and b). Note that, as before, the highly efficient incorporation of dGMP is unlikely to be taking place directly opposite the lesion, but more likely results from pairing an incoming dGTP opposite a downstream template C using a dNTP-stabilized misalignment mechanism (Fig. 3). The most important point is that the doublet patterns so obvious with 8-oxo-dG in this sequence context (Fig. 1 a) do not occur with 8-Br-dG. Thus, the emergence of upstream doublet bands when synthesis is carried out using pol β appears to require the presence of 8-oxo-dG on the template strand. In an attempt to drive out the upstream doublet on the template with C located 5′ to 8-oxo-dG (Fig.1 a), incubations were carried out using three dNTPs: dTTP for the running start, a high concentration of dCTP (1.2 mm) to form the doublet, along with increasing concentrations of dGTP, complementary to the downstream Cs (Fig. 8). The doublet is clearly visible in the absence of dGTP (Fig.8, first lane). However, as the concentration of dGTP is increased, the lower band of the doublet, corresponding to misincorporation of dCMP opposite the second running-start A, diminishes in intensity concomitant with complete filling of the 5-nucleotide gap (Fig. 8, dGTP lanes). We suggest that the dCMP·A mispair is eliminated because the binding of dCTP on the polymerase-primer-template DNA complex is reduced by mass-action competition with dGTP. However, in contrast to 8-oxo-dG-stimulated dCMP·A mispair formation, 8-oxo-dG does not stimulate misincorporation of dGMP opposite the upstream A. 8-oxo-dG DNA template lesions are believed to contribute significantly to the large increase in mutation rates observed in oxidatively damaged cells. NMR studies have shown that 8-oxo-dG can assume two conformations, a favored syn-conformation, in which base mispairs are formed with A (4Kouchakdjian M. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Eisenberg F. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), or ananti-conformation, forming “correct” base pairs with C (21Oda Y. Uesugi S. Ikehara M. Nishimura S. Kawase Y. Ishikawa H. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1407-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Previous measurements using DNA polymerase in vitro(10Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), including this investigation of the effect of sequence context on the specificity of incorporation by pol β opposite 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 1), confirm that both dAMP and dCMP are incorporated, suggesting that 8-oxo-dG exhibits both anti- and syn-conformation base pairing properties during replication. When synthesis is carried out using pol β, the data reveal an interesting and unexpected gel band pattern, namely the appearance of doublet bands at template sites adjacent to 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 1). A doublet band upstream from 8-oxo-dG corresponds to incorporation of a different nucleotide prior to reaching the les"

Functional analysis of the E2F1 core domain demonstrated that replacement of phenylalanine residues 413, 425, and 429 with alanine reduces both transcriptional activation of the dhfr promoter and protein-protein interactions with CBP, transcription factor (TF) IIH, and TATA-binding protein (TBP). However, additional amino acid substitutions for phenylalanine 429 demonstrated a strong correlation between activation of thedhfr promoter and binding of CBP, but not TFIIH or TBP.

Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). These interactions are thought to facilitate transcriptional regulation by directly altering the recruitment and/or activity of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes, or by modifying the chromatin structure of a gene (for a recent review, see Ref. 21Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies provide evidence indicating that different gene promoters require different protein-protein interactions for activation. For example, recruitment of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) appears to be important for TATA-containing, but not TATA-less promoters (22Majello B. Napolitano G. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16509-16516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additionally, the herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16 is a more robust activator of TATA-containing promoters than TATA-less promoters, whereas Sp1 shows no TATA preference, suggesting functional redundancy of the TATA element and Sp1, but not VP16 (23Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,24Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, the degree to which a transcription factor contributes to activation of a promoter can be influenced by the presence of other bound transactivators, which can provide either additive or redundant functions. Synergistic activation by two or more transactivators can be the result of multiple protein contacts that stimulate distinct stages of transcription (25Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For example, the human immunodeficiency virus Tat transactivator protein stimulates transcriptional elongation and can synergize with Sp1 (which stimulates initiation, but not elongation), but not with VP16, p53, or E2F1 (all of which stimulate elongation) (25Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparent potency of a particular transactivation domain and the importance of specific protein-protein interactions may vary considerably in different promoter contexts. We wish to understand the mechanisms by which site-specific DNA binding proteins activate the murine dhfr promoter, which contains four Sp1 binding sites and an E2F binding site that overlaps the start site of transcription. Our studies indicate that the Sp1 binding sites are critical for basal promoter activity, while the E2F binding site is required for growth-regulated transcription (26Schilling L.J. Farnham P.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar, 27Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell.

In vivo footprinting analysis of the hamster dhfr promoter demonstrated that protein binding to one strand of the E2F element correlates with the increase in promoter activity in late G1 and early S phase, suggesting that an E2F family member activates dhfr transcription in S phase (30Wells J. Held P. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that the E2F site is critical for high levels of activity from the murine dhfr promoter in S phase (29Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The focus of our current studies is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which proteins that bind to the E2F site regulatedhfr transcription. The E2F family of transactivator proteins mediates both transcriptional activation and repression through interactions with multiple target proteins. Eight members of this family have been identified: six E2F proteins (E2F1 to E2F6) and two DP proteins (DP1 and DP2). The E2F and DP proteins bind to DNA as a heterodimer to form a functional E2F/DP complex (for a recent review, see Ref. 31Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). The transcriptional repression function of E2F/DP is attributed to the interaction between E2F family members and the Rb family of transcriptional repressor pocket proteins. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 bind to the Rb protein, E2F4 binds to Rb and the related p107 and p130 proteins, and E2F5 binds to p130 (for recent reviews, see Refs. 31Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar and 32Johnson D.G. Schneider-Broussard R. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 447-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E2F6 (or EMA) does not bind pocket proteins, but is believed to contain an inherent repressor domain (33Morkel M. Wenkel J. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Hagemeier C. Nature. 1997; 390: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Verona R. Moberg K. Andon N. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2850-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The pocket proteins are thought to repress transcription in G0 and early G1 phase cells by recruiting histone deacetylases to promoters and by blocking E2F protein-protein interactions required for activation of transcription (35Brehm A.

However, as cells approach the G1/S phase boundary, the pocket proteins are phosphorylated and released from the E2F heterodimer, allowing E2F to function as a transcriptional activator. The activation functions of E2F/DP are mediated by a potent C-terminal transactivation domain in the E2F subunits. We, and others, have previously shown that several of the E2F family members can activate the dhfr promoter when overexpressed using transient or integrated E2F expression constructs (28Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (Correction (1993) Mol. Cell.

Additionally, using a formaldehyde cross-linking procedure, we have recently shown that E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, E2F4, and E2F5 can all bind to the dhfr promoter in vivo. 2J. Wells and P. J. Farnham, unpublished data. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Gal4 fusion proteins containing the transactivation domains of E2F1, E2F3, E2F4, and E2F5 activate adhfr promoter construct containing a Gal4 binding site in precise replacement of the E2F binding site (29Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 3C. J. Fry and P. J. Farnham, unpublished data. The in vivobinding data, the promoter activation experiments, and the fact that all of the E2F transactivation domains are very similar, suggests that all of the E2F family members may be bona fideactivators of the dhfr gene. However, the E2F1 transactivation domain is the best characterized (Fig.1), and therefore we have used E2F1 in our current experiments designed to determine the mechanism by which E2F family members activate the dhfr promoter. Previous analyses of the E2F1 transactivation domain have employed Gal4 fusion proteins and reporter constructs that have randomly positioned single or multiple Gal4 binding sites cloned upstream of minimal promoters whose basal activity is mainly mediated by a TATA box. Due to the abundance of cellular E2F proteins, the use of Gal4 fusion proteins is required for the functional analysis of a specific E2F family member. However, most E2F-regulated promoters, includingdhfr, are TATA-less promoters whose basal activity is conferred by transcriptional activators such as Sp1 and CCAAT binding proteins (42Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Farnham P.J. Transcriptional Control of Cell Growth: The E2F Gene Family. 208. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 1-30Google Scholar). Thus, prior functional analyses of the E2F1 transactivation domain may not accurately reflect the role of protein-protein interactions in the context of an authentic E2F-regulated cellular promoter. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that, unlike E2F-mediated activation of synthetic promoters, activation of dhfr transcription is dependent on the position of the E2F binding site proximal to the transcription start site (29Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have undertaken a functional analysis of E2F1 using an authentic E2F-regulated promoter, and present evidence that E2F1 recruitment of CBP is critical for activation ofdhfr transcription. Standard cloning techniques were used for all plasmid constructions (43Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The inserts for various E2F1 fusion proteins were made by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: primer 1, 5′-CATAGAATAAGTGCGACATCATCATCGG-3′; primer 2, 5′TAGTGGATCCTAGAAGCCCTGTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCCAAAGTCACAGTCGGCGAGGT-3′; primer 3, 5′-TAGTGGATCCTAGAAGCCCTGTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCCAGCGTCAC-3′; primer 4, 5′-TAGTGGATCCTAGAAGCCCTGTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCCATAGTCAC-3′; primer 5, 5′-TAGTGGATCCTAGAAGCCCTGTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCCTAAGTCAC-3′; primer 6, 5′-TAGTGGATCCTAGAAGCCCTGTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCCATCGTCAC-3′; primer 7, 5′-TAGTGGATCCTAGAAGCCCTGTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCCAGCGTCACAGTCGGCGAGGT-3′; primer 8, 5′-CCCGGATCCCTCGACGCCCACTTCG-3′; primer 9, 5′-CCCGGATCCCTCGACTACCACGCCG-3′; primer 10, 5′-CCCGGATCCTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGT-3′. For the construction of GST-E2F1 and Gal4-E2F1 expression plasmids, the appropriate polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested withBamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pBXG-1 (gift from Mark Ptashne). Both the GST and Gal4(1–147) versions of the following E2F1 constructs were made using the indicated primers and the E2F1 plasmid pBXG-1/E2F1(409–437) as template (39Pearson A. Greenblatt J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2643-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): E2F1(409–437)F425A, primers 1 and 2; E2F1(409–437)F429A, primers 1 and 3; E2F1(409–437)F429Y, primers 1 and 4; E2F1(409–437)F429L, primers 1 and 5; E2F1(409–437)F429D, primers 1 and 6; E2F1(409–437)F425A/F429A, primers 1 and 7. The Gal4 version of E2F1(409–437)Y411A was made using primers 8 and 10, and the plasmid pCMV-E2F1YA411 as template (44Cress W.D. Johnson D.G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6314-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The GST and Gal4 versions of E2F1(409–437)F413A were made using primers 9 and 10, and the plasmid pCMVFA413 as template (44Cress W.D. Johnson D.G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6314-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The GST and Gal4 versions of E2F1(409–437)3ΔF contain the triple alanine substitution F413A/F425A/F429A and were made using primers 1 and 7 with the E2F1 plasmid pBXG-1/E2F1(409–437)F413A as template. All other Gal4 and GST fusion protein expression plasmids used in these studies have been described previously and are referenced accordingly in the text. Gal4-E2F1ΔRb and Gal4-E2F1Δmdm2 have been described previously as Gal4-E2F1(368–437)(d418–422) and Gal4-E2F1(380–437)DF1 (45Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To construct Gal4-p62, a human p62 BamHI/SalI fragment from pAS1/p62 (gift from Errol Friedberg) was cloned intoBamHI/SalI-digested pSG424 (47Sadowski I.M.J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The DHFRGal4 reporter construct contains dhfr promoter sequence from −356 to +20, with the E2F binding element precisely replaced with a Gal4 binding element, cloned upstream of the luciferase cDNA in the vector pAAlucA (29Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The pG5TI and pMaeΔE2F reporter constructs have been described previously (27Means A.L.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cell cultures were maintained and calcium phosphate transfections were performed as described previously (29Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, 1.25 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm diameter dishes. Each dish of cells was transfected with 5 μg of reporter construct, 5 μg of Gal4-E2F1 expression construct, and 5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). For the transfection of Gal4-CBP, Gal4-TBP, and Gal4-p62, 10–20 μg of Gal4 fusion expression constructs were used without the addition of salmon sperm DNA. Cells were incubated in growth medium for 40–48 h before harvesting, and total cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. Each transfection was repeated at least four times with duplicate samples and multiple DNA preparations. HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared from frozen cells as described previously (49Means A.L. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and was dialyzed against Affinity Chromatography Buffer (ACB) (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 m NaCl. GST fusion proteins were prepared and immobilized on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as follows. Overnight cultures ofEscherichia coli strain DHF5α transformed with GST or GST-E2F1 expression plasmids were diluted 1:10 in 1 liter of fresh Luria Broth + ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and grown at 30 °C to anA 600 between 0.5 and 1.0 before adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 2–3 h of additional growth at 30 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 rpm in a Beckman model J2–21 centrifuge (JA-17 rotor). Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and lysed by mild sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 11,500 rpm. Glycerol was added to the supernatant (to 10% final concentration), which was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. E. coli GST lysates (precleared by centrifugation) were incubated with prewashed Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The Glutathione 4B was then washed three times with 10 volumes of ACB containing 0.1m NaCl, and stored at 4 °C as a 50% slurry in ACB containing 0.1 mm NaCl and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). For the affinity chromatography experiments, 60 μl of GST-protein affinity columns (4 μg of GST fusion protein/μl of Glutathione-Sepharose 4B) were prewashed with eight column volumes of ACB containing 1 m NaCl and equilibrated with eight column volumes of ACB containing 0.1 m NaCl. 1 mg of HeLa nuclear extract was applied to the columns, which were then washed with 10 column volumes of ACB containing 0.1 m NaCl, and eluted with four column volumes of ACB containing 1% SDS. Eluates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-p62 mAb3c9 (50Fischer L. Gerard M. Chalut C. Lutz Y. Humbert S. Kanno M. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1992; 257: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), anti-CBP sc-583 (Santa Cruz), and anti-TBP 1TBP18 (gift from Nancy Thompson) antibodies. Autoradiograms were scanned and the signals were quantitated using ImageQuant version 4.2a (Moleular Dynamics). Each binding experiment was repeated at least four times. To investigate the activation of dhfrtranscription by E2F1, we have precisely replaced the E2F binding site in the murine dhfr promoter with a Gal4 binding site to create a Gal4-responsive dhfr promoter (Fig.2 A). We have previously demonstrated that, like activation of the dhfr promoter by endogenous E2F, the activation of DHFRGal4 by a Gal4 fusion protein containing the E2F1 transactivation domain is dependent on the position of the Gal4 binding site proximal to the transcription start site, suggesting that Gal4-E2F1 and endogenous E2F activate thedhfr promoter through similar mechanisms (29Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using the DHFRGal4 promoter, and Gal4-E2F1 fusion proteins, we have now determined the minimal E2F1 transactivation domain and protein-protein interactions required for transcriptional activation of thedhfr promoter. Previous studies have implicated mdm2 and Rb in E2F1-mediated transactivation (46Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 51Baskaran R. Dahmas M.E. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 52Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To determine if recruitment of mdm2 or Rb is critical for activation of thedhfr promoter, we cotransfected NIH 3T3 cells with the DHFRGal4 reporter construct and either wild-type Gal4-E2F1 or Gal4-E2F1 expression constructs containing mutations that have been shown to abolish mdm2 or Rb binding (45Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 46Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). At 2 days post-transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. The activation of DHFRGal4 by the Gal4-E2F1 proteins is shown as percentage of activation, defining the activity of the wild-type Gal4-E2F1 constructs as 100% activation (Fig. 2). We found that the wild-type E2F1 transactivation domain robustly activates the DHFRGal4 reporter construct and that mutations which abolish mdm2 or Rb binding do not reduce activation. Therefore, recruitment of mdm2 or Rb is not required for E2F1-mediated activation of the dhfr promoter. This work is in agreement with the model that Rb functions to keep E2F1 inactive in G0 phase cells but has no role in the S phase-mediated activation of promoters by E2F1. Previous studies have mapped the E2F1 transactivation domain to amino acids 380–437 or 399–437, using different minimal TATA box-containing synthetic promoter constructs with either one or three upstream Gal4 binding sites, respectively (38Hagemeier C. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 45Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine the minimal region of E2F1 required for activation of dhfr, we employed a series of Gal4-E2F1 fusion proteins containing N-terminal and C-terminal deletions of the E2F1 transactivation domain (45Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with the DHFRGal4 reporter construct and the different Gal4-E2F1 expression constructs. A Gal4-E2F1 fusion protein containing E2F1 amino acids 368–437 shows a 57-fold activation of the DHFRGal4 reporter construct, and deletion of N-terminal amino acids to position 399 does not reduce activation (Fig.3 A). This indicates that the region of E2F1 required for activation of dhfr does not extend as far N-terminal as the region previously shown to be required for activation of a minimal promoter containing one upstream Gal4 binding site (38Hagemeier C. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, deletion of the next 23 N-terminal amino acids (399–422) does result in a 7-fold decrease in activation levels. An analysis of C-terminal deletions demonstrates that deletion of the last 5, 10, and 15 amino acids of E2F1 results in 2-, 4-, and 13-fold decreases in activation levels, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the extreme C terminus of E2F1 is critical for activation ofdhfr transcription. Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2F1 amino acids 399–437 can confer robust activation to the dhfr promoter. To more precisely map the N-terminal boundary of the E2F1 transactivation domain, we utilized an additional series of N-terminal deletion constructs (39Pearson A. Greenblatt J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2643-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We found that a Gal4-E2F1 fusion protein containing E2F1 amino acids 386–437 activated the DHFRGal4 reporter construct 118-fold, and a Gal4-E2F1 containing amino acids 409–437 retained 38-fold activation (Fig. 3 C). However, further N-terminal deletion to amino acid 415 reduced activation to a very low level. Therefore, we define amino acids 409–437 as the core transactivation domain of E2F1. Our deletion analysis of E2F1 identified a core domain that spans amino acids 409–437 and potently activates thedhfr promoter. Previous studies demonstrated that this domain binds to TBP and TFIIH (39Pearson A. Greenblatt J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2643-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); we show below that this domain is also sufficient to bind CBP (Fig. 5 B). We next wanted to determine the contributions of TBP, TFIIH, and CBP binding to the activation of dhfr transcription by E2F1. A larger E2F1 transactivation domain is required for maximal activation of thedhfr promoter, but is also likely to bind additional unidentified proteins. Therefore"
https://openalex.org/W2088033659,"Mammalian Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM-KK) has been identified and cloned as an activator for two kinases, CaM kinase I (CaM-KI) and CaM kinase IV (CaM-KIV), and a recent report (Yano, S., Tokumitsu, H., and Soderling, T. R. (1998) Nature 396, 584–587) demonstrates that CaM-KK can also activate and phosphorylate protein kinase B (PKB). In this study, we identify a CaM-KK from Caenorhabditis elegans, and comparison of its sequence with the mammalian CaM-KK α and β shows a unique Arg-Pro (RP)-rich insert in their catalytic domains relative to other protein kinases. Deletion of the RP-domain resulted in complete loss of CaM-KIV activation activity and physical interaction of CaM-KK with glutathioneS-transferase-CaM-KIV (T196A). However, CaM-KK autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate were normal in the RP-domain mutant. Site-directed mutagenesis of three conserved Arg in the RP- domain of CaM-KK confirmed that these positive charges are important for CaM-KIV activation. The RP- domain deletion mutant also failed to fully activate and phosphorylate CaM-KI, but this mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type CaM-KK for the phosphorylation and activation of PKB. These results indicate that the RP-domain in CaM-KK is critical for recognition of downstream CaM-kinases but not for its catalytic activity (i.e. autophosphorylation) and PKB activation. Mammalian Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM-KK) has been identified and cloned as an activator for two kinases, CaM kinase I (CaM-KI) and CaM kinase IV (CaM-KIV), and a recent report (Yano, S., Tokumitsu, H., and Soderling, T. R. (1998) Nature 396, 584–587) demonstrates that CaM-KK can also activate and phosphorylate protein kinase B (PKB). In this study, we identify a CaM-KK from Caenorhabditis elegans, and comparison of its sequence with the mammalian CaM-KK α and β shows a unique Arg-Pro (RP)-rich insert in their catalytic domains relative to other protein kinases.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CaM-KK is a recently cloned protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates CaM-KI and CaM-KIV, constituting the CaM-K cascade (11Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Like other CaM-Ks, CaM-KK is negatively regulated by an intrasteric mechanism through its autoinhibitory domain (residue 436–441) and activated by the Ca2+·CaM complex (16Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM binding to both CaM-KK and its downstream target CaM-Ks are required to activate the CaM kinase cascade (6Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.-H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J.

The CaM-KK/CaM-KIV cascade can stimulate gene transcription through phosphorylation of Ser133 in cAMP response element-binding protein, and this may play an important physiological role in learning and memory (11Tokumitsu H.

It has also been demonstrated that the MAP kinase pathways, especially JNK and p38, may be indirectly activated by the CaM-KK/CaM-KIV cascade (24Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been provided that CaM-KK may mediate the anti-apoptotic effect of modest elevations of Ca2+ through phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B (PKB) (25Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This result also indicates that multiple protein kinases might be phosphorylated and activated by CaM-KK, resulting in regulation of a wide variety of functions. The activation sites in CaM-KI (Thr177) (7Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Synderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), CaM-KIV (Thr196) (6Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.-H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) which are phosphorylated by CaM-KK are located in their “activation loops” analogous to Thr197 in PKA (26Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Thr160 in cdk2 (27Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For most protein kinases the substrate recognition determinants are located just NH2- and COOH-terminal of the phosphorylated Ser/Thr. For example, many substrates of PKA have basic residues at position 2 and 3 NH2-terminal of the phosphorylated Ser, and these basic residues are recognized by Glu127 and Glu170 in PKA (33Knighton D.R.

However, there is little sequence similarities in the NH2-terminal sequences of the activation sites of CaM-KI, CaM-KIV, or PKB. There is considerable COOH-terminal sequence identity, but these sequences are also conserved in many other kinases that have activation loops but are not phosphorylated by CaM-KK. This suggests that CaM-KK has specific mechanisms to recognize its target kinases other than the primary sequence surrounding the phosphorylated Thr. Although CaM-KK can phosphorylate a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence in the CaM-KIV activation loop (KKKEHQVLMKT196VCGTPGY), very high concentrations of the peptide are required (28Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this report, we explored the mechanisms of selective substrate recognition of CaM-KK by identifying a unique kinase insert domain which is involved in its interaction and activation of CaM-KI and IV but not PKB. CaM-KK cDNA (GenBank accession number L42810) was from a rat brain cDNA library (11Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM-KIV was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (21Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM-KKs were expressed in Escherichia coliBL-21 (DE3) pLys(S) with pET16b vector and purified by CaM-Sepharose as described previously (12Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CaM was purified from bovine brain (29Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) was synthesized by the Bio-Synthesis, Inc. Caenorhabditis elegans CaM-KK cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR by using a sense oligonucleotide (5′-TTACTCGAGATGTACACATTTCAGTCGGTCTCACAGCAG-3′), and an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-AGACTAGTTTACCTGAATGGATTGCCAAACCGCTTGCGA-3′) based on the sequence of C. elegans cosmid (C05H8.1) and reverse transcribed DNA from mRNA of N2 stage C. elegans as a template, which was kindly provided from Dr. Shouhei Mitani (Tokyo Woman's Medical College). A 1.1-kilobase pair of PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and SpeI and then inserted into pME18s vector. Nucleotide sequence of cloned C. elegansCaM-KK cDNA (GenBank accession number AB016838) was confirmed and the deduced amino acid sequence (357 amino acids) was completely matched with predicted coding sequence using the program Genefinder from C05H8.1 (30Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

The 5′-untranslated region of C. elegansCaM-KK cDNA was also cloned by RT-PCR using a sense primer (5′-AAACTTCTGTAGTATTTACA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-AAATAGTTGTCATTTGGATCG-3′) based on the cosmid sequence and reverse transcribed DNA from mRNA of N2 stage C. elegans as a template (see Fig. 1 A) and completely sequenced. Rat CaM-KI cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using a sense oligonucleotide (5′-ATGCCAGGGGCAGTGGAAGG-3′) and an antisense-oligonucleotide (5′-TCAGTCCATGGCCCTAGAGC-3′) based on the published sequence (31Cho F.S. Phillips K.S. Bogucki B. Weaver T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and reverse transcribed cDNA from rat brain mRNA (CLONTECH) as a template. The PCR product (1.1 kilobase pairs) was subcloned into pT7Blue plasmid and then sequenced. CaM-KI cDNA was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and then subcloned into pGEX-4T3 and transformed into E. coli JM109. Expressed GST-CaM-KI was purified on glutathione-Sepharose followed by CaM-Sepharose. GST-CaM-KIV (17–469, T196A) was constructed into pGEX-KG as follows: His-tagged CaM-KIV (T196A) cDNA in pME18s vector (12Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was digested withBstEII at the position of Val17 and then filled in and digested with XbaI. CaM-KIV fragment was ligated intoSmaI-XbaI digested pGEX-KG and then transformed into E. coli BL-21 (DE3). Nucleotide sequence of this construct was confirmed. Expressed GST-CaM-KIV was purified by CaM-Sepharose. All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources. Mutagenesis of CaM-KK using pME-CaM-KK (wild-type) plasmid as a template was carried out by using either the GeneEditor™ in vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Promega Co.) or QUANT-ESSENTIAL™ (QUANTUM Biotechnologies Inc.) and mutagenic oligonucleotides as follows; P237E, 5′-CTCCTGAGAAAGGGAGAAGTCATGGAAGTGCCC-3′; P237V, 5′-CTCCTGAGAAAGGGAGTAGTCATGGAAGTGCCC-3′; P237A, 5′-CTCCTGAGAAAGGGAGCAGTCATGGAAGTGCCC-3′; S279E, 5′-AGGGACATCAAGCCGGAGAATCTGCTCCTTGGG-3′; S279D, 5′-AGGGACATCAAGCCGGACAATCTGCTCCTTGGG-3′; 279A, 5′-AGGGACATCAAGCCGGCCAATCTGCTCCTTGGG-3′; RP-domain deletion, 5′-CCAAAAAGAAGTTACTGAAGCTGCTGCCCCTGGAGCGTGT-3′; R172.177E, 5′-CAGTATGGCTTTCCTGAACGTCCTCCCCCGGAAGGGTCCCAAGCTCCT-3′; R172.177A, 5′-CTGTATGGCTTTCCTGCCCGTCCTCCCCCGGCAGGGTCCCAAGCCTCCT-3′; R172E, 5′-CAGTATGGCTTTCCTGAACGTCCTCCCCCGAGA-3′; R177E, 5′-CGCCGTCCTCCCCCGGAAGGGTCCCAAGCTCCT-3′; R173A, 5′-TATGGCTTTCCTCGCGCTCCTCCCCCGAGAGGG-3′; R173E, 5′-TATGGCTTTCCTCGCGAGCCTCCCCCGAGAGGG-3′. Nucleotide sequences of each mutant were confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were subcultured in 10-cm dishes 12 h before transfection. The cells were then transferred to serum-free medium and treated with a mixture of either 10 μg of pME18s plasmid DNA (DNAX Research Institute, Inc.) or CaM-KK cDNA containing plasmid DNAs and 60 μg of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 6.8 ml of medium. After 32–48 h incubation, the cells were collected and homogenized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylemethylsulfonyl fluroide, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter pepstatin A, 10 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor) at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was used for CaM-KIV activation assay and quantitated by Western blotting. Either COS-7 cell extract (0.6 μg) transfected with CaM-KK or E. coli expressed CaM-KK was incubated with either recombinant CaM-KIV (3.4 μm) or GST-CaM-KI (1 μg) at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 400 μm ATP, and 2 mmCaCl2, 8 μm CaM. The reaction was terminated at the indicated time points by a 20-fold dilution at 4 °C with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% ethylene glycol, and 2 mm EDTA. CaM-KIV (34 nm) activity was measured at 30 °C for 5 min in a 25-μl assay containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 400 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol), 40 μmsyntide-2, and 2 mm EGTA (Ca2+/CaM-independent activity). CaM-KI activity (1 μg/ml) was measured at 30 °C for 5 min in a 25-μl assay containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol), 40 μm syntide-2, and 2 mm CaCl2, 8 μm CaM. The reaction was initiated by the addition of CaM-KIV or CaM-KI and terminated by spotting aliquots (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81) followed by washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid (32Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). CaM-KK activity is expressed in terms of its ability to increase either Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of CaM-KIV or Ca2+/CaM dependent activity of CaM-KI under the defined assay conditions. The data of CaM-KIV activation are expressed as a percentage of the value of incubation of recombinant CaM-KIV with wild-type CaM-KK for 10 min which was calculated to be approximately 0.5 μmol/min/mg. The data of CaM-KI activation are expressed as a percentage of the value of incubation of recombinant CaM-KI with wild-type CaM-KK for 5 min which was calculated to be approximately 4.0 μmol/min/mg. GST-rat PKB (α isoform) was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells with pME18s vector as described above and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (25Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Purified GST-PKB (0.1 μg) was incubated for the indicated times with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmCaCl2, 3 μm CaM, 0.2 mg/ml histone H2B, 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol), and approximately 100 ng of wild-type, mutant CaM-KK, or buffer. After terminating the reaction by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer,32P incorporation into GST-PKB and histone H2B was analyzed by SDS-15% PAGE followed by autoradiography and then quantitated by densitometric scanning. The data of GST-PKB activity are expressed as fold of control value of 32P incorporation into histone H2B by recombinant GST-PKB with wild-type CaM-KK at 0 min. CaM-KIV peptide phosphorylation activity of CaM-KK was measured at 30 °C for 10 min in a 25-μl assay containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol), 400 μm CaM-KIV peptide and either presence of 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm CaM using 5 μl of partially purified CaM-KKs. Autophosphorylation reaction was essentially the same as CaM-KIV peptide phosphorylation assay as described above except for 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol) and omitting peptide substrate in a reaction solution. After terminating the reaction by addition of 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, samples were loaded onto SDS-10% PAGE and then subjected to autoradiograph. After 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (50 μl of 50% slurry) was loaded with either buffer or 0.5 μg of GST-CaM-KIV (T196A) which was purified by CaM-Sepharose, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Mg(Ac)2. Equal amounts (approximately 200 ng) of either wild-type or mutant CaM-KK were applied to the resin in a solution (100 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 5 μm CaM, and 1 mm ATP and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. These resins were washed three times with 500 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 μm CaM at 4 °C and then GST-CaM-KIV was eluted with 80 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm glutathione. Equal volumes of samples were subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting by using both anti-CaM-KIV antibody or anti-CaM-KK antibody. Western blotting was carried out using antiserum (1/1000 dilution) against a peptide corresponding to a conserved protein kinase motif (residues 132–146 of CaM-KII), anti-CaM-KIV antibody (Transduction Laboratories), or anti-CaM-KK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Transduction Laboratories), and the biotinylated-CaM overlay was done as described previously (10Tokumitsu H.

Detection was performed by using chemiluminesence reagent (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Protein concentration was estimated by Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A protein kinase gene was recently identified in the C. elegans genome data base that is highly homologous to rat CaM-KK (30Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S.

To determine whether this clone encodes CaM-KK, cDNA of 1074 bp was cloned by RT-PCR from C. elegans mRNA (Fig.1 A). In order to ensure that the methionine at position 1 is the point of translation initiation, we also cloned the 5′-untranslated region by RT-PCR using two nucleotide sequences, 200 bp upstream in C. elegans genome sequence and 353 bp downstream from the first Met (ATG), as PCR primers (Fig.1 A, underlined). The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product (553 bp) includes 200 bp of the 5′-untranslated region containing three in-frame stop codons and the remaining 353-bp region is completely matched with its open reading frame from the first ATG. Since the antisense primer is located in the third exon, this PCR product is derived from C. elegans mRNA and the Met at position 1 is likely the translation initiation. The full-length clone encoded a protein of 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40,701 (Fig. 1 A). This protein is likely the C. eleganshomologue of CaM-KK as it contains the unique RP-rich insert (residues 60-81) in the catalytic domain highly homologous to similar inserts in the α (11Tokumitsu H.

TheC. elegans clone was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and a CaM overlay in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B, inset panel) identified a 45-kDa protein which is smaller than the mammalian αCaM-KK. COS-7 cell extracts from mock transfected or transfections with vectors encoding mammalian αCaM-KK or C. elegans protein were tested for their abilities to activate recombinant mammalian CaM-KIV. The C. elegans protein gave activation of CaM-KIV which was about 2–3-fold less efficient than the mammalian CaM-KK in the initial rate of activation (Fig.1 B). Next we tested Ca2+/CaM dependence of theC. elegans enzyme by using both wild-type CaM-KIV (Fig.1 C, left panel) and constitutively active mutant of CaM-KIV (316FN-DD, Fig. 1C, right panel) (10Tokumitsu H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which has shown to be activated by the constitutively active form of rat αCaM-KK (1–434) in a Ca2+/CaM-independent manner (16Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, both wild-type and mutant CaM-KIVs are activated by the C. elegans enzyme in a complete Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner suggesting thatC. elegans enzyme requires Ca2+/CaM for its activity as well as the mammalian CaM-KK (11Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the COOH-terminal end of the C. elegans clone (residues 331–356, Fig. 1 A) is 54% identical to the CaM-binding domain of αCaM-KK (16Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have also detected Ca2+-dependent CaM binding of the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 331–356 in the C. elegansclone (data not shown) similar to that of a CaM-binding peptide of αCaM-KK (16Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These biochemical criteria confirm that the protein is the C. elegans homologue of CaM-KK. The mechanism of substrate recognition by CaM-KK has not been studied. To determine critical residues or domains for substrate recognition in CaM-KK, we first aligned and compared the amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of mammalian α and β CaM-KK and C. elegans CaM-KK with mammalian CaM-KII and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), the best protein kinase for enzyme-substrate recognition mechanisms (Fig.2 A). According to the studies of: 1) the crystal structure of PKA with PKI (33Knighton D.R. Zheng L. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), acidic residues Glu127 and Glu170 interact with the Arg in the P-2 and P-3 positions of PKA substrates. It has been shown that mutation of these Glu residues in PKA affect its K mwith the peptide substrate Kemptide (35Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol.

Residues equivalent to Glu127 and Glu170 are also conserved in Arg/Lys-directed CaM kinases (myosin light chain kinase, CaM-KI, -II, -IV, and phosphorylase kinase). Residues Pro237 and Ser279 in rat CaM-KK are analogous to Glu127and Glu170 in PKA (Fig. 2 A).

The middle subunit, RPA32, is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. RPA occurs in two nuclear compartments, bound to chromatin or free in the nucleosol. We show here that the chromatin-associated fraction of RPA contains the phosphorylated forms of RPA32. Treatment of chromatin with 0.4m NaCl releases bound RPA and causes a separation of the large and the phosphorylated middle RPA subunit. Unmodified RPA in the nucleosolic fraction remains perfectly stable under identical conditions. Phosphorylation is most likely an important determinant of RPA desintegration because dialysis from 0.4 to 0.1 NaCl causes the reformation of trimeric RPA only under dephosphorylating conditions. Biochemical studies with isolated Cyclin-dependent protein kinases showed that cyclin A/CDK1 and cyclin B/CDK1, but not cyclin E/CDK2, can phosphorylate human recombinant RPA in vitro. However, only a small fraction of in vitro phosphorylated RPA desintegrated, suggesting that phosphorylation may be one, but probably not the only, determinant affecting subunit interaction. We speculate that phosphorylation and changes in subunit interaction are required for the proposed role of RPA during the polymerase switch at replication forks.

RPA 1The abbreviations used are: RPA, replication protein A; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase1The abbreviations used are: RPA, replication protein A; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase (replication protein A) is the most abundant eukaryotic single strand-specific DNA-binding protein with copy numbers of up to 105/mammalian cell nucleus (1Seroussi E. Lavi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7147-7154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian RPA, like RPA in other eukaryotic organisms, is a heterotrimeric protein with subunits of apparent molecular masses of 70, 32, and 14 kDa, respectively known as RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 (2Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Within the three subunits, RPA may contain at least four potential binding sites for single-stranded DNA as recently suggested based on weak homologies to the bacterial single strand binding protein (3Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two of the sites in the central part of the RPA70 subunit are characterized by cocrystallization of the central RPA70 binding domain with an oligonucleotide ligand (4Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and recent cross-linking experiments suggest that additional sites are localized in carboxyl-terminal regions of RPA70 and RPA32 (5Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The high affinity for single-stranded DNA is one property of RPA, another is its ability to interact with a variety of proteins involved in DNA replication (6Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), recombination (11Heyer W.D. Rao M.R. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D.

A. 1995; 92: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, RPA binding to single-stranded DNA and its interaction with DNA polymerase α-primase and with other replication factors are required for the establishment and the propagation of replication forks (14Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In recombination, RPA stimulates DNA strand exchange between Rad51-coated single-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA substrate (11Heyer W.D. Rao M.R. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); and in nucleotide excision repair, binding of RPA may help to stabilize the locally unwound DNA and to localize the repair endonucleases at damaged DNA sites (15de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). RPA32 is phosphorylated when cells transit from the G1phase into the S phase of the cell cycle and remains so throughout S phase (16Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Fang F. Newport J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, dramatic increases of RPA32 phosphorylation occur as a response to DNA damage in x-ray- and UV-irradiated cells (18Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzymes responsible for RPA32 phosphorylation in intact nuclei have not yet been unambiguously identified although in vitroexperiments show that RPA32 serves as a substrate for the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2-cyclin B as well as for the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). The enzymes recognize serine and threonine residues as phosphorylation sites in the amino-terminal section of RPA32 and cause a retardation in the electrophoretic mobility of RPA (23Lee S.H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Henricksen L.A. Carter T. Dutta A. Wold M.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12634-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The physiological consequences of RPA32 phosphorylation are not clear yet. Mutations of the major phosphorylation sites of RPA32 cause no detectable phenotype in yeast (3Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutant RPA, lacking the amino-terminal phosphorylation sites, binds well to single-stranded DNA (24Henricksen L.A. Carter T. Dutta A. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), supports SV40 DNA replication in vitro, and appears to be active in nucleotide excision repair (26Pan Z.Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RPA is suppressed in human cells lacking a functional DNA damage surveillance ATM gene product as well as in yeast cells without the MEC1gene, a counterpart of the mammalian ATM gene (18Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Brush G.S. Morrow D.M. Hieter P. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15075-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The MEC1 gene product is known to be involved in S phase arrest of cells with damaged DNA (28Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the phosphorylation of RPA32 has a function regulating the switch from replicative DNA synthesis to repair synthesis (26Pan Z.Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Mass G. Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6399-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a report that damage-induced inhibition of DNA replication correlates with RPA32 phosphorylation in an in vitro system and can be reversed by the addition of purified unphosphorylated RPA (19Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In our previous studies with proliferating cultured human cells we observed that phosphorylated RPA32 may be less stably associated with the large RPA70 subunit than unmodified RPA32 (22Treuner K. Okuyama A. Knippers R. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To further investigate this possibility we have performed the experiments reported in this communication. We could show that trimeric RPA complexes tend to desintegrate when subunit RPA32 is phosphorylated, whereas unmodified trimeric RPA remains perfectly stable under the same conditions. The results contribute to discussions on the role of RPA32 phosphorylation in proliferating cells and could explain earlier data of others who detected by immunological means that individual RPA subunits partition to different parts of the nucleus at some cell cycle stages (30Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Human HeLa S3 cells (31Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Jurkat T lymphoma cells (32Schwab B.L. Leist M. Knippers R. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were cultivated as described. For cell fractionation, nuclei were isolated using the digitonin procedure of Adam et al. (33Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with 10 mm NaF and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and the modifications described earlier (34Treuner K. Eckerich C. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31744-31750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chromatin was prepared as originally described by Hancock (35Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with the modifications detailed in Ritzi et al. (31Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the preparation of chromatin-associated proteins, isolated chromatin was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.25 mmEDTA, pH 8) containing NaCl at concentrations specified in the text. Unsoluble nucleoprotein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g. Supernatants were analyzed by centrifugation through linear 25 to 5% sucrose gradients in TE buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8; with either 0.1 or 0.4m NaCl) using the Beckman SW 40 rotor at 35,000 rotations/min and 4 °C for 60 h. The gradients were fractionated from the top into 0.6-ml aliquots. Samples from each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting for RPA. Recombinant human RPA was isolated from bacterial extracts as described previously (36Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was used as an antigen for the preparation of antisera in rabbits. RPA-specific antibodies were affinity-purified according to standard procedures (37Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antibodies were used for immunoblotting (Western blotting) after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar) essentially as described by Towbin et al. (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44889) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Active cyclin A/CDK1, cyclin B/CDK1, and cyclin E/CDK2 were isolated from Xenopus egg extracts according to Strausfeld et al. (40Strausfeld U.P. Howell M. Descombes P. Chevalier S. Rempel R.E. Adamczewski J. Maller J.L. Hunt T. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1555-1563PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation, 4 μg of recombinant human RPA was incubated with 500 ng of purified cyclin-dependent kinases in 15 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Tween 20) with 0.2 mmATP and, if required, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Control phosphorylation assays were performed with 5 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) instead of RPA as substrate. Aliquots from each assay mixture were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting or autoradiography. Using frog enzymes in these reactions appears to be justified, since cyclin-dependent kinases are highly conserved as exemplified by the fact that human CDK1 can complement yeast strains mutated in the cdc2 gene (41Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). About one third of RPA in cultured human cells is bound to chromatin while the remaining fraction of RPA occurs free in the nucleosol (34Treuner K. Eckerich C. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31744-31750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylated RPA32 is present in the chromatin-bound fraction, in the nucleosol, or both, we extracted proteins from isolated HeLa cell nuclei under different salt conditions and probed the extracts with RPA-specific antibodies using an immunoblot (“Western”) procedure. The antibodies, prepared in rabbits against recombinant human RPA as an antigen, recognize the two largest RPA subunits, but not RPA14 (34Treuner K. Eckerich C. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31744-31750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Using these antibodies as a tool, we were able to identify subunits RPA70 and RPA32 in unfractionated total cell extracts (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). We also detected these subunits in nuclear extracts and found that RPA32 subunits in the chromatin-bound fraction, but not in the nucleosolic fraction, had retarded electrophoretic mobilities (indicated as bands p1 and p2 in Fig.1 B). Identical results were obtained using fractionated nuclear extracts from cells of the human Jurkat lymphoma cell line (data not shown). To verify that the retarded electrophoretic mobilities were due to phosphorylation, we treated the nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase and found that the slower moving bands were converted to a single electrophoretic band corresponding to unmodified RPA32 (Fig.1 C). We conclude that most phosphorylated RPA32 occurs in the chromatin-bound fraction of RPA and could be in direct contact with DNA (34Treuner K. Eckerich C. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31744-31750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the results of biochemical experiments that had shown previously that DNA-bound RPA is a better substrate for protein kinases than free RPA (42Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Masrangelo I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4798-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To further investigate the chromatin-bound RPA fraction, we treated aliquots of isolated chromatin with buffers of increasing salt concentrations. We found that low salt concentrations cause a release of RPA with unmodified RPA32 subunits, whereas higher salt concentrations were necessary to also release RPA with phosphorylated RPA32 (Fig. 2). The data of Fig. 2 also indicate that more RPA70 subunits than RPA32 subunits appeared to be mobilized at 0.1 m NaCl. This has been noted before (see Fig. 5B in Ref. 34Treuner K. Eckerich C. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31744-31750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and could mean that the subunits of chromatin-bound RPA separate upon release from their binding sites on chromatin. That would be surprising as isolated trimeric RPA complexes are known to be extremely stable under a variety of ionic conditions (2Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). To further investigate the possibility that phosphorylated RPA could dissociate into its subunits, HeLa cell chromatin was treated with 0.4 m NaCl, a salt concentration that mobilizes a large fraction of non-histone chromatin proteins, including most of the bound RPA (Fig. 2). Chromatin proteins were then fractionated through sucrose gradients at 0.4 mNaCl. Controls were investigated in parallel tubes of the same sedimentation run. One control was recombinant human RPA, and a second control was the soluble nucleosolic fraction that contains unmodified RPA as shown in lane 2 of Fig. 1 B. We confirmed that recombinant human RPA remained stable under the experimental conditions of 0.4 m NaCl, since all three RPA subunits sedimented together in a symmetrical peak with a sedimentation rate just ahead the bovine serum albumin marker with 4.2 S (Fig.3 A). Unphosphorylated RPA in the nucleosolic fraction had the sedimentation properties of recombinant RPA (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that all three RPA subunits remained in trimeric complexes although the properties of the antibodies precluded a determination of the smallest subunit, RPA 14 (see Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the RPA fraction, prepared from chromatin at 0.4m salt, behaved quite differently: the RPA70 subunits and the phosphorylated RPA32 subunits sedimented as independent peaks (Fig.3 C). Again, we could not determine the distribution of the RPA14 subunit in the gradient. We can therefore not say whether RPA14 remained bound to RPA70, to RPA32, or to both subunits. In either case, the data clearly show that the large and the phosphorylated middle subunit of RPA dissociate when extracted from chromatin at 0.4m NaCl. The sedimentation analysis revealed an unusual distribution of released RPA70. While RPA70 subunits appeared in symmetric peaks when they remain in intact trimeric RPA (Fig. 3,A and B), released RPA70 exhibited a leading shoulder (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that RPA70 tends to form aggregates with itself or with unidentified chromatin proteins upon release from RPA32. In the particular experiment, leading to Fig.3 C, a minor fraction of unphosphorylated RPA32 sedimented together with the main RPA70 peak in the gradient. This is an interesting internal control showing again that the association of unphosphorylated RPA32 and RPA70 was not disrupted under the experimental conditions. To demonstrate that phosphorylation was responsible for the dissociation of RPA, we dialyzed released chromatin proteins against buffer with 0.1 m NaCl in the presence or absence of phosphatase. The structure of RPA was then determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and Western blotting as shown above. We found that the removal of phosphate groups resulted in reformation of RPA complexes as shown by a cosedimention of subunits RPA70 and RPA32 exactly as normal trimeric RPA (Fig.4 A). However, when not dephosphorylated, RPA32 failed to combine with RPA70 during dialysis against 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that phosphorylation is a major determinant causing the separation of RPA70 and RPA32 in chromatin-bound RPA. Immunoprecipitation of chromatin-bound RPA showed indeed that phosphorylated RPA32 could be immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to the total RPA complex (data not shown), but a monoclonal RPA70 antibody failed to coimmunoprecipitate the phosphorylated RPA32, in agreement with previous reports (20Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Treuner K. Okuyama A. Knippers R. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While necessary, RPA32 phosphorylation may not be sufficient for RPA desintegration, and we cannot exclude the possibility that an additional chromatin function may be required for the separation of RPA70 and RPA32. As a first attempt to investigate this possibility we used recombinant human RPA as substrate for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in in vitrophosphorylation experiments. Previous work had shown that isolated RPA serves as an in vitro substrate for DNA-PK and for cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDK) (24Henricksen L.A. Carter T. Dutta A. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Pan Z.Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Since DNA-PK has a major function in DNA damage recognition and repair (20Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the present research deals with undamaged cycling cells, we decided to investigate the effects of CDK on the stability of isolated RPA. For that purpose, we used CDK1 in association with cyclin A and cyclin B, or cyclin E/CDK2 as kinase activities and recombinant RPA as a substrate. While cyclin A/CDK1, cyclin B/CDK1, and cyclin E/CDK2 efficiently phosphorylated the common substrate histone H1, only cyclin A/CDK1 and cyclin B/CDK1 could phosphorylate RPA32 causing a electrophoretic mobility shift characteristic for phosphorylated RPA32 (Fig. 5 A). The kinetics of the reaction showed that incubation times of 30–60 min were sufficient to obtain a maximal transfer of phosphate groups to RPA and that longer incubation had no additional effects. We also observed a low degree of phosphate transfer to the large subunit, RPA70 (Fig.5 B). To determine whether CDK-mediated phosphorylation caused a separation of RPA subunits, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation at 0.1 and 0.4 m NaCl as described above under Fig. 3. In four independent experiments, we obtained ambiguous results: most RPA subunits remained together in one complex as shown by a cosedimentation of the middle and the large RPA subunits, of which some were degraded during incubation (Fig. 6). However, a minor fraction of RPA32 sedimented slower than the main peak of RPA. Interestingly, the fraction of slower sedimenting RPA32 appeared to be enriched for the phosphorylated P1 and P2 forms of RPA32 (Fig. 6), showing a partial dissociation from the RPA complex. Similar results were obtained by centrifugation at 0.1 m NaCl (data not shown). In addition, we observed in these experiments a wide distribution of RPA70 reaching into fractions close to the top of the sucrose gradient. The reason for this is not known, but could be due to an adherence of CDK-treated RPA to the walls of the centrifuge tubes. A trailing of RPA or its subunits was not observed in control experiments using RPA, incubated with phosphorylation buffer in the absence of CDK (not shown) or with RPA in nuclear extracts (see Figs. 3 and 4). To summarize the in vitro phosphorylation experiments, we note that recombinant human RPA serves as a substrate for cyclin A/CDK1 and for cyclin B/CDK1, but even incubation times of up to 60 min lead to an incomplete phosphorylation of RPA32 as shown by the fact that only a minor fraction of CDK-treated RPA showed the electrophoretic retardation characteristic for highly phosphorylated RPA32. The reasons for this behavior of RPA in biochemical phosphorylation assays remain to be investigated. However, the interesting point here is that whenever a high degree of in vitro phosphorylation was achieved, the large and the middle subunit of RPA tended to dissociate. Phosphorylation of the RPA32 subunit has been observed in normally proliferating cells at the time of genome replication and in cells with damaged DNA during DNA repair synthesis (see Introduction). Here we have investigated RPA32 phosphorylation in proliferating transformed human HeLa and Jurkat T lymphoma cells in tissue culture. We confirmed our previous results showing that the majority of RPA occurs in the nucleosol, while only about one-third of RPA is associated with chromatin (34Treuner K. Eckerich C. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31744-31750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The physiologic reason for this distribution is not clear. RPA in the soluble nuclear fraction could function as a back-up system for situations with high demands for RPA such as repair synthesis. Another possibility is that soluble RPA forms a nucleosolic pool or reservoir where phosphorylated RPA from replicated DNA is dephosphorylated and recycled. In this regard it is interesting to note that most soluble RPA is unphosphorylated, whereas chromatin-bound RPA contains phosphorylated RPA32. This suggests that RPA32 is phosphorylated as a consequence of the functions that RPA performs at replication forks. These functions could include an orchestration of the “polymerase switch” occurring when DNA polymerase α has finished the synthesis of short RNA-DNA primers and DNA polymerase δ takes over to continue chain elongation synthesis (14Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 44Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O′Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). While the large RPA subunit probably resides on and protects the exposed single-stranded DNA template, subunit RPA32 contacts the 3′-ends of DNA primers (29Mass G. Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6399-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After the polymerase switch RPA32 changes its position and can no longer be detected at the 3′-ends of the more advanced products of DNA synthesis. RPA cycling at replication forks may require changes of the RPA70/RPA32 interface and flexible subunit interactions. These conformational changes could be regulated by phosphorylation and may facilitate the separation of the large and the middle RPA subunits at the experimental conditions described above (Fig. 3). This does not necessarily imply that subunits RPA70 and the RPA32 physically separate when bound to their sites at replication forks. It is in fact quite possible that RPA desintegration is induced upon its release from chromatin at 0.4 m NaCl. We note, however, that a reduction of salt concentration by dialysis from 0.4 to 0.1 m NaCl leads to a reformation of stable trimeric RPA only when dialysis is accompanied by dephosphorylation of RPA32 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, Murtiet al. (30Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown by immunostaining of fixed intact HeLa cells that RPA70 binds to spindle poles and RPA32 to chromosomes during mitosis. Cardoso et al. (45Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 74: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) found that RPA70, but not RPA32, localizes at replication foci in mouse myotube cells. These earlier studies are consistent with the possibility that a separation of the RPA subunits could occur in vivo, at least in some cell types and during certain cell cycle stages. While our data clearly indicate that the mode of interaction between RPA70 and RPA32 is strongly affected by phosphorylation, we cannot say yet which enzymes are responsible for RPA32 phosphorylation and how their function is regulated. Biochemical studies had shown that DNA-PK as well as cyclin A- or cyclin B-dependent kinases phosphorylate RPA32 in vitro at defined serine and threonine side chains in an amino-terminal section of RPA32 (17Fang F. Newport J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PK has a major function in DNA damage repair (2Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Therefore, CDKs are more likely candidates for RPA phosphorylation in normally proliferating cells as studied in this communication. For this reason, we have used cyclin A/CDK1 and cyclin B/CDK1 for in vitro phosphorylation experiments with recombinant RPA as a substrate. Niu et al.(25Niu H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Pan Z.Q. Lee S.H. Tempst P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12634-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have shown that cyclin B/CDK1 efficiently transfers one phosphate group to a serine residue at amino acid position 29 of RPA32 and other phosphates with reduced efficiency to additional unmapped RPA32 sites. This leads to two electrophoretic bands of phosphorylated RPA32, termed P1 with one, and P2 with two or maybe more, phosphate groups per molecule. In agreement with these results, we find that a treatment of RPA with either cyclin A/CDK1 or cyclin B/CDK1 predominantly produces the P1 form of phosphorylated RPA32 (Fig. 5). However, even after long incubation times, in vitro phosphorylation never reached the level of RPA32 phosphorylation in vivo as judged from the relative abundance of the phosphorylated RPA forms P1 and P2. Thus, CDKs are either more active in vivo, or the DNA-PK together with other unidentified protein kinases are responsible for the major phosphorylation of chromatin-bound RPA in vivo. In either case, only a partial fraction of the most highly phosphorylated form of CDK-treated RPA desintegrated in vitro (Fig. 6), supporting the notion that phosphorylation plays a major role in changing the interaction of the RPA subunits. A possible explanation for the ambiguous results could be the use of Xenopus CDKs to phosphorylate human RPA in vitro, although CDKs are known to be highly conserved from yeast to human and are functionally exchangeable (41Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). However, it could be possible that there exist important differences in the phosphorylation pattern of RPA32 in vivo and in vitro. Further work has to identify the amino acid residues in RPA32 whose phosphorylation is responsible for the changes in RPA complex formation that we have observed. The important point emerging from the experiments reported in this communication is that phosphorylation changes the interaction and affinity between the large and the middle RPA subunits, resulting in their separation at least under in vitro conditions, but possibly also in intact nuclei.

https://openalex.org/W2023899444,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a MADS box transcription factor that controls a wide range of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The MADS box mediates homodimerization and binding of SRF to the consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG, known as a CArG box, which is found in the control regions of numerous serum-inducible and muscle-specific genes. Using a modified yeast one-hybrid screen to identify potential SRF cofactors, we found that SRF interacts with the high mobility group factor SSRP1 (structure-specific recognition protein). This interaction, which occurs in yeast and mammalian cells, is mediated through the MADS box of SRF and a basic region of SSRP1 encompassing amino acids 489–542, immediately adjacent to the high mobility group domain. SSRP1 does not bind the CArG box, but interaction of SSRP1 with SRF dramatically increases the DNA binding activity of SRF, resulting in synergistic transcriptional activation of native and artificial SRF-dependent promoters. These results reveal an important role for SSRP1 as a coregulator of SRF-dependent transcription in mammalian cells.

Serum response factor (SRF) 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; HMG, high mobility group; TAD, transcription activation domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline belongs to the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, SRF) box family of transcription factors (1Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The MADS box mediates homodimerization and binding of SRF to the serum response element or CArG box, CC(A/T)6GG, first identified in the c-fos promoter (1Treisman R.

Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). SRF regulates a variety of genes whose transcription can be stimulated in the absence of new protein synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 3Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and is essential for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle (4Gauthier-Rouviere C. Cavadore J.-C. Blanchard J.-M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), presumably because key SRF target genes are required for this process. In addition to replicative responses, SRF has been implicated in controlling gene expression in postmitotic cells, particularly in muscle, and CArG boxes are required for expression of numerous muscle-specific genes in vitro and in vivo (6Li L.

Microinjection studies have demonstrated that neutralizing SRF expression blocks differentiation of skeletal myoblasts (5Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Gilles C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SRF is also highly enriched in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells (12Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the activity of SRF is influenced by cofactors that either interact with SRF directly or bind DNA sequences adjacent to CArG boxes. Among the transcription factors that influence SRF activity are Ying Yang 1 (YY1) (14Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell.

Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Most recently, two members of the HMG-I family of nonhistone nuclear proteins, HMG-I(Y) and HMG-I(C), have also been demonstrated to associate with SRF (21Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Parrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Physical association of SRF and HMG-I proteins leads to enhanced SRF-DNA association and increased SRF-dependent transcription in yeast and Drosophila cells. HMG transcription factors are the most abundant nonhistone proteins in the nucleus. These proteins fall into three distinct classes: HMG-I, HMG 14/17, and HMG-1/2 (22Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). There are three known members of the HMG-I family. HMG-I and HMG-Y are derived from alternatively spliced transcripts from the same gene and show indistinguishable biologic activities and HMGI-C is derived from a separate gene (22Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The HMG-I factors bind AT-rich DNA in the minor groove through an AT-hook protein motif (22Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 23Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These factors influence the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of other transcription factors, but they lack intrinsic transcriptional activity. The HMG-1/2 class of transcription factors is divided into two subfamilies according to the number of HMG domains, DNA sequence recognition, and evolutionary conservation (22Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). One subfamily, which includes yeast ARS-binding factor, ABF-2, RNA polymerase II upstream binding factor, UBF, and the mitochondrial transcription factor, mTF-1, consists of proteins with multiple HMG domains that bind to structurally modified DNA with little or no sequence specificity (23Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Members of the other subfamily, which includes the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor, LEF-1, the sex-determining factor, SRY, the related Sox factors (23Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and structure-specific recognition protein, SSRP1 (24Dyer M.A. Hayes P.J. Baron M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possess a single HMG box and bind DNA with moderate sequence specificity. By themselves, members of the HMG-1/2 family of factors do not activate transcription, but are postulated to facilitate DNA binding of other transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 23Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Specifically, HMG-1/2 factors have been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-6 (25Zwilling S. Konig H. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the homeotic protein HOXD9 (26Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Citterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), MLTF (27Watt F. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1471-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), p53 (28Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 462-472Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and a variety of steroid hormone receptors (29Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence for a role of HMG-1/2 factors in transcriptional regulation comes from gene disruption experiments in yeast. Disruption of the yeast genes encoding the HMG-like factors NHP-6A and -6B results in diminished expression of a subset of genes in response to stimuli (30Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This effect seems to be transcription factor-specific since only certain genes are affected. In the present study, using a modified yeast one-hybrid screen to identify SRF-interacting factors, we demonstrate that the HMG-1/2 protein SSRP1 physically interacts with SRF. Transfection assays reveal that SSRP1 enhances SRF-dependent transcription in mammalian cells and that this is mediated by an increase in DNA binding by SRF in the absence of detectable SSRP1-DNA interaction. These results suggest that SSRP1 is a positive coregulatory protein involved in modulating SRF-dependent gene expression in mammalian cells. A modified yeast one-hybrid screen was performed using full-length human SRF as bait to identify potential interacting factors. The SRF bait plasmid encoded amino acids 1–508 under control of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. For this screen, we created a yeast strain, 4xCArGnear-LacZ, by integration of an SRF-dependent lacZ reporter into theURA3 locus. This reporter contains the lacZ gene under control of 4 tandem copies of the promoter-proximal CArG box, referred to as CArGnear, from the mouse SM22 promoter (6Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) plus 15 flanking nucleotides on each side, in the vector pLacZi. Each copy of CArGnear contained the sequence (+ strand): 5′-ACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTGTGTGCAGTG-3′. In addition, this strain contains a plasmid expressing the histidine marker under control of 4 tandem copies of CArGnear as described above. This was integrated into the HIS 4 locus allowing for growth on selective media upon activation of the reporter. pADH-SRF was co-transformed into the 4xCArGnear-LacZ yeast strain with an adult rat lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) that contained the GAL4 transcription activation domain (TAD) fused to random cDNA. Greater than 4 million primary colonies were screened for positive interactions and 62 LacZ-positive yeast colonies were initially identified. From each positive colony, the activating plasmid was rescued, transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, plasmid DNA was isolated and the cDNA insert sequenced. Clones containing inserts in the antisense orientation or out-of-frame with the GAL4 TAD were discarded. The 2 remaining clones were retransformed back into yeast to verify the interaction with SRF. Both clones (48 and 62) encoded amino acids 489–587 of SSRP1. Deletions of clone 48 were made using unique restriction sites contained within clone 48 that allowed for in-frame fusions to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 activation domain in plasmid pGAD10 (CLONTECH). flag-clone 48 was constructed by fusing the cDNA fragment isolated in the initial one-hybrid screen in-frame downstream of a flag epitope in vector pECE. Myc-SSRP1 expression plasmid was provided by M. Baron. 2J. A. Spencer, M. H. Baron, and E. N. Olson, unpublished data. For plasmids used for in vitro transcription/translation, the SSRP1 cDNA (amino acids 22–709) plus the NH2-terminal Myc epitope was excised from vector pMT23-SSRP1 by digestion withNotI and ligated in-frame into vector pCITE2A creating pCITE-SSRP1. The cDNA insert of clone 48 was excised withEcoRI and ligated in-frame into vector pCITE2A, creating pCITE-clone 48. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.01% penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin. Cells were seeded at approximately 50% confluence in 6-well plates and grown for 18 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using Fugene 6 as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and harvested 24–48 h later. Typically, greater than 40% of the cells were transfected as detected by LacZ staining (not shown). Approximately 200 ng of luciferase reporters under control of the following SRF-dependent promoters were used: the 322-base pair SRF promoter (31Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the 282-base pair SM22promoter (6Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the 600-base pair α-myosin heavy chain promoter (32Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter under control of three tandem copies of the muscle creatine kinase MEF2 site and the E1bpromoter (33Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) was also used. Transactivation assays also included 100 ng of pCGN-SRF or pM1 (34Prywes R. Zhu H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 200 ng of near full-length SSRP1 (amino acids 22–709) or flag-clone 48 (amino acids 489–587), 100 ng of pcDNA-MEF2C (33Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and 50 ng of pHsp68-LacZ were used in the transfections where indicated. In transfections not receiving the full complement of expression plasmids, total plasmid was adjusted to 1 μg with parental expression plasmid lacking insert. Luciferase assays were performed as described by the manufacturer (Promega). In each instance, luciferase data were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described in Ref. 31Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. In vitro transcription/translation was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). SSRP1 products were generated from pCITE-SSRP1 and pCITE-clone 48. SRF was generated from plasmid pT7ΔATG (2Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled complementary oligonucleotides spanning nucleotides −165 to −125 of the SM22 promoter. The sequence of the top strand was 5′- ACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTGTGTGCAGTG-3′. In gel mobility shift reactions using nuclear extract, approximately 5 μg of total protein was used. Approximately 5 μl of in vitrotranslated SSRP1 or clone 48 were used in the binding reaction with or without increasing concentrations of in vitro translated SRF. The gel mobility shift buffers, binding conditions, and electrophoresis conditions are described elsewhere (31Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected as described above with the following modifications. Cells were seeded onto 10-cm plates and transfection mixtures (volumes and amounts of DNA) were increased 10-fold. Two μg of plasmids expressing Myc-SSRP1 (amino acids 22–709) or flag-clone 48 (amino acids 489–587) were included in the transfections. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Approximately 500 μg of nuclear extract was diluted to 1 ml in nondenaturing immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mmNaP04, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 × EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Five μg of anti-SRF antisera (Santa Cruz) and 50 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were added and incubated at 4 °C on a platform rocker for 30 min. Reactions were spun at 2500 rpm for 3 min and pellets were washed three times with 500 μl of coimmunoprecipitation buffer. After the final wash, pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were spun briefly and denaturing electrophoresis performed. Electrophoresis conditions and transfer to membrane were performed using standard protocols (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed using the ECL-PLUS detection kit (Amersham), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz), anti-flag (Kodak), and anti-SRF (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Quantitation was performed by densitometry of x-ray films. COS cells were transfected as described above with the following modifications. Cells were plated onto sterile glass coverslips before transfection. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were washed with 1 × PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed three times in 1 × PBS, and then pre-blocked in 1 × PBS containing 2% horse serum, 2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-Myc or anti-flag antibody was added at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:400, respectively, in fresh pre-block solution and incubated an additional 30 min. Cells were then washed three times in 1 × PBS. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was then added at a dilution of 1:250 for 30 min in pre-block solution and cells washed again three times with 1 × PBS before visualization. Our initial goal was to identify factors from smooth muscle cells that interact with SRF, using a rat lung cDNA library in a yeast one-hybrid screen. Adult lung was used as the source of the cDNA library due to its high degree of vascularization and smooth muscle content. The SRF “bait” consisted of the entire 508-amino acid human SRF protein. Expression of SRF was verified by Western analysis of yeast extracts using an anti-SRF antibody (data not shown). As a reporter, we used a lacZgene under control of 4 tandem copies of the proximal CArG box from theSM22 promoter, referred to as CArGnear (6Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), plus 30 nucleotides of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequence. CArGnear has been shown to bind SRF and to be essential for SM22 expression in subsets of smooth muscle in transgenic mice (6Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). 3L. Li and E. Olson, unpublished observations. Although the SRF bait used in the screen contained the SRF transcription activation domain (36Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it failed to activate transcription of the lacZreporter on its own in yeast. The inability of full-length SRF to activate transcription in yeast has been previously reported (37Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Screening of approximately 4 million primary yeast colonies for lacZ expression following transformation with the rat lung cDNA library resulted in identification of two clones, referred to as 48 and 62, that strongly activated lacZ and fulfilled all criteria for specificity (see “Materials and Methods”). Both clones, which were isolated from independent yeast transformations, contained cDNA inserts encoding amino acids 489–587 of the HMG protein SSRP1. This region encompasses eight amino acids of the acidic region, a basic region, and approximately the first two-thirds of the HMG box (Fig.1 A). The modified yeast one-hybrid screen indicated that a 99-amino acid portion of SSRP1, residues 489–587, physically associated with SRF. To dissect this region further, we divided clone 48 into two parts, residues 489–542 and 543–587, and tested the ability of each region, when fused to the GAL4 TAD, to interact with SRF and activate the integrated CArG box-dependent reporter genes in yeast. As seen in Fig. 1 B, residues 489–542 retained the ability to interact with SRF, while residues 543–587 were unable to interact with SRF, as measured by growth on selective media and LacZ activity. Neither clone 48 nor the two deletion derivatives activated expression of the reporter in yeast in the absence of SRF. These results demonstrate that activation of CArG-dependent transcription in yeast by clone 48-GAL-TAD is SRF-dependent and that this interaction is mediated by amino acids 489–542 of SSRP1. This region includes the basic region, but excludes the HMG domain. Recently, residues 50–81 of HMG-I(Y), which include the third AT-hook DNA-binding domain, were shown to interact with SRF (21Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Parrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SRF-binding domain of SSRP1 might share homology with this region of HMG-I(Y), we compared the two domains using the MacVector Clustal Alignment program. Indeed, there was substantial homology between the two regions, particularly within the charged residues (Fig.1 C). To determine whether clone 48 and full-length SSRP1 colocalize to the nucleus, COS cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding clone 48 with a flag-epitope tag or SSRP1 with a Myc-epitope tag and immunocytochemistry was performed. Full-length SSRP1 was localized to the nucleus of COS cells, as was the portion of SSRP1 encoded by clone 48 (Fig.2). The nuclear localization of SSRP1 is consistent with its ability to interact with SRF and enhance SRF-dependent transcription (38Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.-D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the nuclear localization signal of SSRP1 is contained within amino acids 489–587. This signal is probably contained within the basic region amino-terminal to the HMG domain of clone 48 and SSRP1 (Fig.1 A). Our one-hybrid data demonstrated that SSRP1 was capable of interacting with SRF in yeast. However, because SSRP1 was fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain, it was unclear whether native SSRP1 might influence SRF-dependent transcription in mammalian cells. We therefore transfected COS cells with a plasmid expressing near full-length SSRP1 with or without SRF, and the effect on SRF-dependent transcription was determined using a variety of promoters linked to luciferase. Three SRF-dependent luciferase reporters were used in the analysis: SRF-luciferase containing the SRF promoter with two functionally redundant CArG boxes (31Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), SM22-luciferase containing 282 nucleotides of promoter sequence including CArGnear and CArGfar (6Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and α-myosin heavy chain-luciferase containing approximately 600 nucleotides of promoter sequence with a single CArG box shown to bind SRF (32Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, SSRP1 weakly activated these three promoters. Similar results were obtained with clone 48 (not shown). SRF was also able to activate transcription from all three promoters in COS cells. However, co-transfection of SSRP1 and SRF resulted in synergistic activation of all three promoters, suggesting a functional role for the SSRP1-SRF interaction identified in yeast. Since SSRP1 does not contain a transcription activation domain (24Dyer M.A. Hayes P.J. Baron M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of SSRP1 to enhance activity of these promoters in the absence of exogenous SRF is likely to reflect synergy with endogenous SRF. To determine if SRF-binding sites are required for SSRP1-dependent activation of transcription, anSRF promoter-luciferase reporter containing in-context mutations of both CArG boxes was used. These mutations have been demonstrated to disrupt SRF DNA binding and ablate serum-inducible expression of the SRF promoter in fibroblasts (31Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, mutation of the CArG box sequences completely abolished SRF- and SSRP1-dependent activation. This demonstrates that SSRP1-dependent activation is mediated by the CArG boxes and not simply by a general up-regulation of transcription due to SSRP1 recruitment of other regulatory factors to the promoter. To further investigate the requirement of SRF in SSRP1-mediated activation of transcription through the CArG box, we used a dominant negative SRF mutant (pM1) that lacks DNA binding activity but possesses the ability to dimerize with endogenous SRF (34Prywes R. Zhu H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Transfection of pM1-SRF reduced expression of all three luciferase reporters, consistent with a primary role of SRF in regulating these promoters. More importantly, co-transfection of SSRP1 with pM1-SRF severely hampered the ability of SSRP1 to enhance CArG box-dependent expression, reflecting interference with endogenous SRF. These data demonstrate that SSRP1 is able to enhance CArG box-dependent transcription specifically through SRF and not through other mammalian CArG box-binding factors. We also examined the role of the MADS box of SRF in SSRP1-dependent transcriptional activation. The MADS box of SRF, contained in amino acids 90–222 of SRF and referred to as SRFcore, was fused to the activation domain of VP16, creating the chimeric protein SRF-VP16. This chimeric protein also synergized with SSRP1 to activate SRF-dependent transcription (data not shown). These data demonstrate that SSRP1 enhances SRF-dependent transcription from a variety of promoters and suggest that the MADS box-DNA binding/dimerization domain of SRF is required to observe the effect. Given the ability of SSRP1 to enhance the transactivation potential of a SRFcore-VP16 chimeric protein containing the MADS box of SRF, we considered the possibility that a similar effect might be observed with other MADS box-containing transcription factors. To test this, we transfected COS cells with a MEF2-dependent reporter gene in the presence or absence of SSRP1 and MEF2C. MEF2 contains a MADS box related to that of SRF, but it binds a different DNA sequence (CTA(T/A)4TAG). As shown in Fig. 3 D, MEF2C activated this reporter, whereas SSRP1 had no effect either alone or with MEF2C. This demonstrates that SSRP1 is not simply a MADS box-dependent transcriptional activator. To determine whether SSRP1 increased transcriptional activity of SRF by enhancing SRF-DNA binding activity, we performed gel mobility shift assays within vitro-translated SRF and SSRP1 and a labeled probe co"

The proposed mechanism of CcrA enzymatic hydrolysis includes formation of a hydroxide ion from Wat1. This hydroxide ion mounts a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon atom of the β-lactam. Atomic absorption studies of the metal content of CcrA (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) confirmed that CcrA binds two atoms of Zn2+ and that the presence of both metal ions is required for full catalytic activity.In this work, we describe a set of CcrA derivatives harboring selected amino acid substitutions of active-site and nearby residues (see TableI) and the involvement of these individual amino acid residues in enzymatic activity. Purified mutant proteins were used to analyze the β-lactam hydrolytic and inhibition properties conferred by each amino acid substitution. The metal content of the CcrA wild-type and mutant enzymes was determined using a novel approach, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) utilizing nondenaturing and denaturing conditions, and was then compared with the measurements obtained by a classic approach, atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The effects of the specific amino acid substitutions on metal content and catalytic activity were analyzed.Table IAmino acid substitutions and proposed functionsSubstitutionProposed functionH99NZn1 ligandD103NZn2 ligandC104RCysteine near-active site, not Zn-coordinatingC181SZn2 ligandK184RStabilizes intermediateN193DOxyanion holeΔ46–51 (Ile-Glu-Gly-Trp-Gly-Met)Disordered sequence, absent from CphA metallo-β-lactamaseC104S/C155VNot Zn-coordinating cysteines Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe metallo-β-lactamases CcrA1 and CcrA3 from B. fragilis have a broad substrate profile and are refractory to inhibition by the commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors (6Yang Y.

J. 1974; 143: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Bandoh K. Muto Y. Wanatanabe K. Katoh N. Ueno K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Within the active site, there are two zinc ligands, designated Zn1 and Zn2 (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, eight different ccrA genes have been constructed that encode enzymes with amino acid substitutions in or near the active site. The hydrolytic activity, susceptibility to inhibitors, and metal content of each mutant enzyme were investigated. The results indicate that many of the substituted amino acids play a critical role in the enzymatic function of the protein. The most dramatic effects were observed when the enzyme harbored an amino acid substitution of one of the zinc-ligating residues.Among the most exciting findings of this study are the zinc content determinations for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Two different methods were used to analyze the zinc content: ESI/MS and AAS. For most of the enzymes, the zinc content was comparable using either of the two methods. However, AAS tended to underestimate the zinc content of the enzyme relative to that observed by ESI/MS. This may be the result of the dialysis procedure that was required when performing AAS. Since this method cannot discriminate between enzyme-bound zinc and zinc in buffer solution, dialysis of the enzyme sample to remove extraneous Zn2+ was required. Unfortunately, this process may also remove weakly bound Zn2+ from the active site of the enzyme, resulting in an underestimated Zn2+ content. This is likely to be the case for the H99N enzyme. ESI/MS identified two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule, whereas only one zinc molecule/enzyme molecule was determined using AAS. This suggests that the H99N enzyme binds Zn1 with much less affinity than the wild-type enzyme and that this zinc is lost during dialysis. The lower IC50 value of H99N for the Zn2+ chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (2 μm) compared with that of CcrA3 (15 μm) supports the above hypothesis. Another unique advantage of using ESI/MS to measure Zn2+ content is the ability to detect multiple enzyme populations that have different Zn2+ contents within the same sample. This is evident in the ESI/MS data for D103N, C104R, and C104R/C155V, in which two enzyme populations containing one or two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule were observed. This novel and powerful application of ESI/MS has not been applied previously in studies of metallo-β-lactamases.The substitution of the Zn2-coordinating residue Cys181with Ser resulted in dramatic changes in enzymatic function with reduced hydrolytic activity for all the substrates tested (Table II) and reduced susceptibility to the inhibitor BRL 42715 (Table III). ESI/MS indicated the presence of only one zinc atom/molecule of C181S (Fig. 2, c and d). This might result from the substitution of a negatively charged cysteine sulfur with a serine hydroxyl or the inability of the two remaining ligands (Asp103 and His223) to capture a Zn2+ atom in the absence of the binding contribution of Cys181. Recent x-ray crystallographic data (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicated that, although the overall structure of the C181S enzyme remains the same as the wild-type enzyme, with the side chain of Ser181occupying the same spatial position as that of Cys181, there is no electron density at the position of Zn2. Furthermore, in C181S, the distance between the remaining Zn1 and Wat1 was extended. It has been proposed that Wat1 exists as a hydroxide ion in the wild-type enzyme and is responsible for carrying out the nucleophilic attack on the β-lactam ring. Based on the changes in the Wat1 coordination, it is unlikely that Wat1 exists as a hydroxide ion in the C181S enzyme (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the major factor affecting the catalytic activity of this enzyme.

J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrate the mono-zinc form of the enzyme to be nearly as active as the di-zinc form.Another substitution that affects Zn2 binding is the replacement of Asp103 with Asn. ESI/MS data indicated that 29% of the D103N molecules harbored one zinc atom, whereas 71% harbored two zinc atoms (Fig. 2, e and f; and Table IV). However, the enzymatic activity of D103N was <71% that of CcrA3. Thus, the reduced hydrolytic activity for CLD and IMP and the decreased affinity for PenG cannot be fully accounted for by assuming that the di-zinc form of the enzyme is fully active. The carboxylate group of Asp103 is predicted to function as a general base during hydrolysis (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), forming interactions with both Zn2 and Wat1. The decreased enzymatic activity may more accurately reflect the inability of Asn to function as a general base to activate Zn2 and Wat1 as effectively as Asp. Substitution of Asp103 with Val has been reported by Crowder et al. (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For this enzyme, the metal content (determined using AAS) was reported to be 0.43 ± 0.09. This is significantly less than the 1.2 zinc molecules/enzyme molecule observed for the D103N enzyme using AAS, suggesting that the valine-substituted enzyme is less effective at incorporating zinc into the active site than the Asn substitution. Thek cat value for the Val enzyme, using the cephalosporin nitrocefin as a substrate, decreased 6400-fold. Similarly, the k cat value for the Asn enzyme, using cephaloridine as a substrate, showed a 260-fold decrease. In contrast to the cephaloridine k cat value, only a 2-fold decrease in the k cat value for penicillin G was observed for the D103N enzyme. This minor effect suggests that the main function of Asp103 is to coordinate and activate Zn2 and that it plays no direct role in the catalytic cycle as might be predicted, and has been proposed, from the nitrocefin hydrolysis data (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asp103 clearly has an additional effect on cephalosporin hydrolysis beyond the decreased zinc binding. Both the Val and Asn substitutions may affect the active-site architecture such that cephalosporin hydrolysis is more dramatically affected than the hydrolysis of other classes of β-lactams.His99 is one of the three histidine residues that ligate to Zn1 (Fig. 1). Kinetic and inhibition data (Tables II and III) indicated that His99 plays an active role in enzymatic function since the physiological efficacy of H99N was reduced 2000–3000-fold for PenG and IMP and >200-fold for CLD. Interestingly, H99N also had a 29-fold higher hydrolytic activity for nitrocefin (a chromogenic cephalosporin) than PenG (data not shown). This indicated that some cephalosporins might fit in the structure of H99N better than five-membered ring β-lactams. As discussed previously, two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule was observed using ESI/MS, whereas AAS identified only one zinc molecule/enzyme molecule. Computer modeling predicted the distance between Asn99 and Zn1 to be 4.5 Å (generated using the coordinates from 1ZNB), compared with the distance between His99 and Zn1 of 2.2 Å (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metallo-β-lactamase CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila AE036 (19Segatore B. Massidda O. Satta G. Setacci D. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has a naturally occurring Asn at residue 99. This enzyme shows substrate specificity for carbapenems. Such substrate specificity was not observed with the CcrA3 H99N mutant enzyme.Although not directly ligated to either zinc molecule, substitutions of Cys104 (C104R and C104S/C155V) resulted in proteins harboring either one or two zinc atoms/enzyme molecule. The location of Cys104 within the enzyme might play a critical role in this phenomenon. Cys104 is at the active site and close to both zinc molecules (Fig. 1). The sulfhydryl group on the cysteine might contribute more stability to the protein structure than either arginine or serine. Residue 104 is an arginine in the B. cereusβ-lactamase II (20Hussain M. Carlino A. Madonna M.J. Lampen J.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 223-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the substrate profile for this enzyme (21Felici A. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the k cat value for PenG was 3.8-fold higher than that for IMP. The C104R enzyme also showed stronger hydrolytic activity for PenG (5.9-fold) than for IMP, compared with a 1.2-fold difference for CcrA3 (Table II). The double mutant C104S/C155V contains the same residues at positions 104 and 155 as the metallo-β-lactamase IMP-1 from Serratia marcescens (22Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wachrotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). IMP-1 has stronger hydrolytic activity for PenG than for IMP. The same pattern was also seen for the C104S/C155V enzyme. The reduced hydrolytic activity of β-lactamase II and IMP-1 for CLD (22Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wachrotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 23Marumo K.A. Takeda A. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was not observed in either of the CcrA Cys104 substitutions and may relate to differences in other regions of these enzymes.Amino acids 46–51 form a “disordered loop” in CcrA3 (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Removal of these six amino acids significantly affected the activity against PenG and CLD, the predominant effect being on substrate affinity (increased K m) (Table II). Activity against IMP and susceptibility to BRL 42715 were only marginally affected. The crystallographic structure of CcrA3 indicates that residues 46–51 compromise the end of a hairpin loop that protrudes into the solvent (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This “flap” could adjust upon substrate binding to accommodate a variety of β-lactam side chain substitutions (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Removal of the loop may restrict substrate specificity, resulting in reduced affinity for many β-lactams.The data presented were obtained using the powerful technique of ESI/MS to assess the Zn2+ content and its relation to enzymatic activity. The Zn2+ content was differentially affected by various amino acid substitutions. From these analyses, it becomes clear that the zinc content was not the only factor contributing to the observed changes in the enzymatic activity of these mutant enzymes. Metallo-β-lactamases require zinc or another metal cofactor to be enzymatically active and capable of hydrolyzing the amide bond of the β-lactam ring (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 2Davies R.B. Abraham E.P. Biochem.

Amicosante G. Oratore A. Storm R. Ledent P. Joris B. Fanuel L. Frere J.-M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The metallo-β-lactamase CcrA hydrolyzes almost all known β-lactams and is not effectively inactivated by the marketed β-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam (6Yang Y. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Rasmussen B.A. Yang Y. Jacobus N. Bush K. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the metallo-β-lactamase CcrA3 indicates that the active site of this enzyme is at the edge of the β-sandwich of the four-layer α/β/β/α molecule and contains two zinc atoms (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Zn1 is coordinated to four ligands in a tetrahedral geometry: His99, His101, and His162, and a solvent molecule defined as water 1 (Wat1). 1The abbreviations used are: Wat, water; ESI/MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; AAS, atomic absorption spectrophotometry; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PenG, penicillin G; CLD, cephaloridine; IMP, imipenem1The abbreviations used are: Wat, water; ESI/MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; AAS, atomic absorption spectrophotometry; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PenG, penicillin G; CLD, cephaloridine; IMP, imipenem Zn2 ligates with three amino acids (Asp103, Cys181, and His223) and two water molecules (Wat1 and Wat2) (Fig.1). The proposed mechanism of CcrA enzymatic hydrolysis includes formation of a hydroxide ion from Wat1. This hydroxide ion mounts a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon atom of the β-lactam. Atomic absorption studies of the metal content of CcrA (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) confirmed that CcrA binds two atoms of Zn2+ and that the presence of both metal ions is required for full catalytic activity. In this work, we describe a set of CcrA derivatives harboring selected amino acid substitutions of active-site and nearby residues (see TableI) and the involvement of these individual amino acid residues in enzymatic activity. Purified mutant proteins were used to analyze the β-lactam hydrolytic and inhibition properties conferred by each amino acid substitution. The metal content of the CcrA wild-type and mutant enzymes was determined using a novel approach, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) utilizing nondenaturing and denaturing conditions, and was then compared with the measurements obtained by a classic approach, atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The effects of the specific amino acid substitutions on metal content and catalytic activity were analyzed. DISCUSSIONThe metallo-β-lactamases CcrA1 and CcrA3 from B. fragilis have a broad substrate profile and are refractory to inhibition by the commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors (6Yang Y. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,7Rasmussen B.A. Yang Y. Jacobus N. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2116-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). These enzymes require a metal cofactor to be enzymatically active (2Davies R.B. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Bandoh K. Muto Y. Wanatanabe K. Katoh N. Ueno K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Within the active site, there are two zinc ligands, designated Zn1 and Zn2 (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, eight different ccrA genes have been constructed that encode enzymes with amino acid substitutions in or near the active site. The hydrolytic activity, susceptibility to inhibitors, and metal content of each mutant enzyme were investigated. The results indicate that many of the substituted amino acids play a critical role in the enzymatic function of the protein. The most dramatic effects were observed when the enzyme harbored an amino acid substitution of one of the zinc-ligating residues.Among the most exciting findings of this study are the zinc content determinations for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Two different methods were used to analyze the zinc content: ESI/MS and AAS. For most of the enzymes, the zinc content was comparable using either of the two methods. However, AAS tended to underestimate the zinc content of the enzyme relative to that observed by ESI/MS. This may be the result of the dialysis procedure that was required when performing AAS. Since this method cannot discriminate between enzyme-bound zinc and zinc in buffer solution, dialysis of the enzyme sample to remove extraneous Zn2+ was required. Unfortunately, this process may also remove weakly bound Zn2+ from the active site of the enzyme, resulting in an underestimated Zn2+ content. This is likely to be the case for the H99N enzyme. ESI/MS identified two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule, whereas only one zinc molecule/enzyme molecule was determined using AAS. This suggests that the H99N enzyme binds Zn1 with much less affinity than the wild-type enzyme and that this zinc is lost during dialysis. The lower IC50 value of H99N for the Zn2+ chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (2 μm) compared with that of CcrA3 (15 μm) supports the above hypothesis. Another unique advantage of using ESI/MS to measure Zn2+ content is the ability to detect multiple enzyme populations that have different Zn2+ contents within the same sample. This is evident in the ESI/MS data for D103N, C104R, and C104R/C155V, in which two enzyme populations containing one or two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule were observed. This novel and powerful application of ESI/MS has not been applied previously in studies of metallo-β-lactamases.The substitution of the Zn2-coordinating residue Cys181with Ser resulted in dramatic changes in enzymatic function with reduced hydrolytic activity for all the substrates tested (Table II) and reduced susceptibility to the inhibitor BRL 42715 (Table III). ESI/MS indicated the presence of only one zinc atom/molecule of C181S (Fig. 2, c and d). This might result from the substitution of a negatively charged cysteine sulfur with a serine hydroxyl or the inability of the two remaining ligands (Asp103 and His223) to capture a Zn2+ atom in the absence of the binding contribution of Cys181. Recent x-ray crystallographic data (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicated that, although the overall structure of the C181S enzyme remains the same as the wild-type enzyme, with the side chain of Ser181occupying the same spatial position as that of Cys181, there is no electron density at the position of Zn2. Furthermore, in C181S, the distance between the remaining Zn1 and Wat1 was extended. It has been proposed that Wat1 exists as a hydroxide ion in the wild-type enzyme and is responsible for carrying out the nucleophilic attack on the β-lactam ring. Based on the changes in the Wat1 coordination, it is unlikely that Wat1 exists as a hydroxide ion in the C181S enzyme (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the major factor affecting the catalytic activity of this enzyme. Interestingly, studies of the Bacillus cereus metallo-β-lactamase II (2Davies R.B. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrate the mono-zinc form of the enzyme to be nearly as active as the di-zinc form.Another substitution that affects Zn2 binding is the replacement of Asp103 with Asn. ESI/MS data indicated that 29% of the D103N molecules harbored one zinc atom, whereas 71% harbored two zinc atoms (Fig. 2, e and f; and Table IV). However, the enzymatic activity of D103N was <71% that of CcrA3. Thus, the reduced hydrolytic activity for CLD and IMP and the decreased affinity for PenG cannot be fully accounted for by assuming that the di-zinc form of the enzyme is fully active. The carboxylate group of Asp103 is predicted to function as a general base during hydrolysis (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), forming interactions with both Zn2 and Wat1. The decreased enzymatic activity may more accurately reflect the inability of Asn to function as a general base to activate Zn2 and Wat1 as effectively as Asp. Substitution of Asp103 with Val has been reported by Crowder et al. (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For this enzyme, the metal content (determined using AAS) was reported to be 0.43 ± 0.09. This is significantly less than the 1.2 zinc molecules/enzyme molecule observed for the D103N enzyme using AAS, suggesting that the valine-substituted enzyme is less effective at incorporating zinc into the active site than the Asn substitution. Thek cat value for the Val enzyme, using the cephalosporin nitrocefin as a substrate, decreased 6400-fold. Similarly, the k cat value for the Asn enzyme, using cephaloridine as a substrate, showed a 260-fold decrease. In contrast to the cephaloridine k cat value, only a 2-fold decrease in the k cat value for penicillin G was observed for the D103N enzyme. This minor effect suggests that the main function of Asp103 is to coordinate and activate Zn2 and that it plays no direct role in the catalytic cycle as might be predicted, and has been proposed, from the nitrocefin hydrolysis data (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asp103 clearly has an additional effect on cephalosporin hydrolysis beyond the decreased zinc binding. Both the Val and Asn substitutions may affect the active-site architecture such that cephalosporin hydrolysis is more dramatically affected than the hydrolysis of other classes of β-lactams.His99 is one of the three histidine residues that ligate to Zn1 (Fig. 1). Kinetic and inhibition data (Tables II and III) indicated that His99 plays an active role in enzymatic function since the physiological efficacy of H99N was reduced 2000–3000-fold for PenG and IMP and >200-fold for CLD. Interestingly, H99N also had a 29-fold higher hydrolytic activity for nitrocefin (a chromogenic cephalosporin) than PenG (data not shown). This indicated that some cephalosporins might fit in the structure of H99N better than five-membered ring β-lactams. As discussed previously, two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule was observed using ESI/MS, whereas AAS identified only one zinc molecule/enzyme molecule. Computer modeling predicted the distance between Asn99 and Zn1 to be 4.5 Å (generated using the coordinates from 1ZNB), compared with the distance between His99 and Zn1 of 2.2 Å (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metallo-β-lactamase CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila AE036 (19Segatore B. Massidda O. Satta G. Setacci D. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has a naturally occurring Asn at residue 99. This enzyme shows substrate specificity for carbapenems. Such substrate specificity was not observed with the CcrA3 H99N mutant enzyme.Although not directly ligated to either zinc molecule, substitutions of Cys104 (C104R and C104S/C155V) resulted in proteins harboring either one or two zinc atoms/enzyme molecule. The location of Cys104 within the enzyme might play a critical role in this phenomenon. Cys104 is at the active site and close to both zinc molecules (Fig. 1). The sulfhydryl group on the cysteine might contribute more stability to the protein structure than either arginine or serine. Residue 104 is an arginine in the B. cereusβ-lactamase II (20Hussain M. Carlino A. Madonna M.J. Lampen J.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 223-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the substrate profile for this enzyme (21Felici A. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the k cat value for PenG was 3.8-fold higher than that for IMP. The C104R enzyme also showed stronger hydrolytic activity for PenG (5.9-fold) than for IMP, compared with a 1.2-fold difference for CcrA3 (Table II). The double mutant C104S/C155V contains the same residues at positions 104 and 155 as the metallo-β-lactamase IMP-1 from Serratia marcescens (22Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wachrotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). IMP-1 has stronger hydrolytic activity for PenG than for IMP. The same pattern was also seen for the C104S/C155V enzyme. The reduced hydrolytic activity of β-lactamase II and IMP-1 for CLD (22Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wachrotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 23Marumo K.A. Takeda A. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was not observed in either of the CcrA Cys104 substitutions and may relate to differences in other regions of these enzymes.Amino acids 46–51 form a “disordered loop” in CcrA3 (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Removal of these six amino acids significantly affected the activity against PenG and CLD, the predominant effect being on substrate affinity (increased K m) (Table II). Activity against IMP and susceptibility to BRL 42715 were only marginally affected. The crystallographic structure of CcrA3 indicates that residues 46–51 compromise the end of a hairpin loop that protrudes into the solvent (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This “flap” could adjust upon substrate binding to accommodate a variety of β-lactam side chain substitutions (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Removal of the loop may restrict substrate specificity, resulting in reduced affinity for many β-lactams.The data presented were obtained using the powerful technique of ESI/MS to assess the Zn2+ content and its relation to enzymatic activity. The Zn2+ content was differentially affected by various amino acid substitutions. From these analyses, it becomes clear that the zinc content was not the only factor contributing to the observed changes in the enzymatic activity of these mutant enzymes. The metallo-β-lactamases CcrA1 and CcrA3 from B. fragilis have a broad substrate profile and are refractory to inhibition by the commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors (6Yang Y.

This might result from the substitution of a negatively charged cysteine sulfur with a serine hydroxyl or the inability of the two remaining ligands (Asp103 and His223) to capture a Zn2+ atom in the absence of the binding contribution of Cys181.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicated that, although the overall structure of the C181S enzyme remains the same as the wild-type enzyme, with the side chain of Ser181occupying the same spatial position as that of Cys181, there is no electron density at the position of Zn2. Furthermore, in C181S, the distance between the remaining Zn1 and Wat1 was extended. It has been proposed that Wat1 exists as a hydroxide ion in the wild-type enzyme and is responsible for carrying out the nucleophilic attack on the β-lactam ring. Based on the changes in the Wat1 coordination, it is unlikely that Wat1 exists as a hydroxide ion in the C181S enzyme (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the major factor affecting the catalytic activity of this enzyme. Interestingly, studies of the Bacillus cereus metallo-β-lactamase II (2Davies R.B. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrate the mono-zinc form of the enzyme to be nearly as active as the di-zinc form. Another substitution that affects Zn2 binding is the replacement of Asp103 with Asn. ESI/MS data indicated that 29% of the D103N molecules harbored one zinc atom, whereas 71% harbored two zinc atoms (Fig. 2, e and f; and Table IV). However, the enzymatic activity of D103N was <71% that of CcrA3. Thus, the reduced hydrolytic activity for CLD and IMP and the decreased affinity for PenG cannot be fully accounted for by assuming that the di-zinc form of the enzyme is fully active. The carboxylate group of Asp103 is predicted to function as a general base during hydrolysis (17Li Z. Rasmussen B.A. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), forming interactions with both Zn2 and Wat1. The decreased enzymatic activity may more accurately reflect the inability of Asn to function as a general base to activate Zn2 and Wat1 as effectively as Asp. Substitution of Asp103 with Val has been reported by Crowder et al. (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For this enzyme, the metal content (determined using AAS) was reported to be 0.43 ± 0.09. This is significantly less than the 1.2 zinc molecules/enzyme molecule observed for the D103N enzyme using AAS, suggesting that the valine-substituted enzyme is less effective at incorporating zinc into the active site than the Asn substitution. Thek cat value for the Val enzyme, using the cephalosporin nitrocefin as a substrate, decreased 6400-fold. Similarly, the k cat value for the Asn enzyme, using cephaloridine as a substrate, showed a 260-fold decrease. In contrast to the cephaloridine k cat value, only a 2-fold decrease in the k cat value for penicillin G was observed for the D103N enzyme. This minor effect suggests that the main function of Asp103 is to coordinate and activate Zn2 and that it plays no direct role in the catalytic cycle as might be predicted, and has been proposed, from the nitrocefin hydrolysis data (9Crowder M.W. Zhang W. Franklin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asp103 clearly has an additional effect on cephalosporin hydrolysis beyond the decreased zinc binding. Both the Val and Asn substitutions may affect the active-site architecture such that cephalosporin hydrolysis is more dramatically affected than the hydrolysis of other classes of β-lactams. His99 is one of the three histidine residues that ligate to Zn1 (Fig. 1). Kinetic and inhibition data (Tables II and III) indicated that His99 plays an active role in enzymatic function since the physiological efficacy of H99N was reduced 2000–3000-fold for PenG and IMP and >200-fold for CLD. Interestingly, H99N also had a 29-fold higher hydrolytic activity for nitrocefin (a chromogenic cephalosporin) than PenG (data not shown). This indicated that some cephalosporins might fit in the structure of H99N better than five-membered ring β-lactams. As discussed previously, two zinc molecules/enzyme molecule was observed using ESI/MS, whereas AAS identified only one zinc molecule/enzyme molecule. Computer modeling predicted the distance between Asn99 and Zn1 to be 4.5 Å (generated using the coordinates from 1ZNB), compared with the distance between His99 and Zn1 of 2.2 Å (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metallo-β-lactamase CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila AE036 (19Segatore B. Massidda O. Satta G. Setacci D. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has a naturally occurring Asn at residue 99. This enzyme shows substrate specificity for carbapenems. Such substrate specificity was not observed with the CcrA3 H99N mutant enzyme. Although not directly ligated to either zinc molecule, substitutions of Cys104 (C104R and C104S/C155V) resulted in proteins harboring either one or two zinc atoms/enzyme molecule. The location of Cys104 within the enzyme might play a critical role in this phenomenon. Cys104 is at the active site and close to both zinc molecules (Fig. 1). The sulfhydryl group on the cysteine might contribute more stability to the protein structure than either arginine or serine. Residue 104 is an arginine in the B. cereusβ-lactamase II (20Hussain M. Carlino A. Madonna M.J. Lampen J.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 223-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the substrate profile for this enzyme (21Felici A. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the k cat value for PenG was 3.8-fold higher than that for IMP. The C104R enzyme also showed stronger hydrolytic activity for PenG (5.9-fold) than for IMP, compared with a 1.2-fold difference for CcrA3 (Table II). The double mutant C104S/C155V contains the same residues at positions 104 and 155 as the metallo-β-lactamase IMP-1 from Serratia marcescens (22Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wachrotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). IMP-1 has stronger hydrolytic activity for PenG than for IMP. The same pattern was also seen for the C104S/C155V enzyme. The reduced hydrolytic activity of β-lactamase II and IMP-1 for CLD (22Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wachrotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 23Marumo K.A. Takeda A. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was not observed in either of the CcrA Cys104 substitutions and may relate to differences in other regions of these enzymes. Amino acids 46–51 form a “disordered loop” in CcrA3 (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Removal of these six amino acids significantly affected the activity against PenG and CLD, the predominant effect being on substrate affinity (increased K m) (Table II). Activity against IMP and susceptibility to BRL 42715 were only marginally affected. The crystallographic structure of CcrA3 indicates that residues 46–51 compromise the end of a hairpin loop that protrudes into the solvent (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This “flap” could adjust upon substrate binding to accommodate a variety of β-lactam side chain substitutions (1Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Removal of the loop may restrict substrate specificity, resulting in reduced affinity for many β-lactams. The data presented were obtained using the powerful technique of ESI/MS to assess the Zn2+ content and its relation to enzymatic activity. The Zn2+ content was differentially affected by various amino acid substitutions. From these analyses, it becomes clear that the zinc content was not the only factor contributing to the observed changes in the enzymatic activity of these mutant enzymes. We are grateful to Niraja Bhachech for performing enzyme kinetic studies and to Ramaswamy Nilakantan for the preparation of Fig. 1.

However, the biochemical mechanism for neuronal death triggered by activated microglia is still unclear. When treated with activated microglia, neuronal PC12 cells undergo apoptosis accompanied by caspase-3-like protease activation and DNA fragmentation. Apoptotic bodies formed were subsequently phagocytosed by neighboring activated microglia. Pretreatment of the cells with the caspase-3-like protease inhibitorN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde did not reverse this cell death. Although Bcl-2 overexpression in the cells caused the inhibition of caspase-3-like protease activity and DNA fragmentation and the effective interference of apoptosis induced by deprivation of trophic factors, it could not suppress the activated microglia-induced neuronal death. At the electron microscopic level, degenerating cells with high levels of Bcl-2 were characterized by slightly condensed chromatins forming irregular-shaped masses, severely disintegrated perikarya, and marked vacuolation. Various protease inhibitors tested did not inhibit this cell death, whereas the radical oxygen species scavengerN-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly suppressed this death.

Altogether, our study provides an alternative death pathway for the activated microglia-induced neuronal death by blockage of the caspase-3 protease cascade. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is distinguished from lytic or necrotic cell death by specific biochemical and structural events. The most characteristic features of apoptosis are the activation of caspase cascades, nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, blebbing of cytoplasmic membranes, and apoptotic body formation. It is generally accepted that apoptosis is a fundamental cell death pathway contributing to the regulation of tissue development and homeostasis and that dysregulated apoptosis may cause a variety of pathologic states such as autoimmune disease and malignancy. Therefore, apoptosis appears to be highly controlled by a complex interplay between regulatory proteins such as Bcl-2 and its family members. However, the biochemical mechanism involved in the function of these proteins has not been fully elucidated. Bcl-2 is a 26-kDa integral membrane protein that is found in the nuclear envelope, the part of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the outer mitochondrial membrane. Several reports have reported that overexpression of Bcl-2 can delay or prevent apoptosis by a diverse number of death-promoting signals in some cell systems (1Garcia I. Martinou I. Tsujimoto Y.

Moreover, the study of Bcl-2-knockout mice has revealed that this protein is involved in regulation of cellular redox in response to oxidative stress (9Hockenbery D. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Bcl-2 inhibits the activation of caspases by blocking cytochrome c release from mitochondria (10Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

In addition to the anti-apoptosis activity, recent studies have revealed that Bcl-2 also promotes regeneration of severed neuronal axons (16Chen D.F. Schneider G.E. Martinou J.-C. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1997; 385: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), regulates neuronal differentiation (17Zhang K.-Z. Westberg J.A. Holtta E. Andersson L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Natl. U. S.

So far, it has been shown that microglia are activated by cytokines to produce neurotoxic agents such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates (23Zielasek J. Tausch M. Toyka K.V. Hartung H.P. Cell Immunol. 1992; 141: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 24Betz-Corradin S. Mauel J. Donini S.D. Quattrocchi E. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P.

Therefore, it is considered that activation of microglia contributes to expansion of neuronal injury and has important pathogenetic implications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia (27McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 21: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 28Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrei G.I. Otvos Jr., L. Baron P. Villalba M. Ferrari D. Rossi F.

Despite the clinical importance, the precise intracellular mechanism for neuronal death triggered by activated microglia is currently unknown. To elucidate the biochemical mechanism for activated microglia-induced neuronal death, control and Bcl-2-transfected neuronal PC12 cells were treated with activated microglia that were challenged with a combination of interferon-γ/lipoplysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ANOVA, analysis of variance; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MCA, aminomethylcoumarin; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; NGF, nerve growth factor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; Ac-DEVD-CHO, N-Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde; Ac-YVAD-MCA, Ac- Try-Val-Ala-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin in the presence and absence of the caspase-3-like protease inhibitors. Ac-DEVD-CHO, pepstatin A, leupeptin, Ac-YVAD-MCA, and Ac-DEVD-MCA were purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Calpain inhibitor I was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA).N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was obtained from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant rat IFN-γ and LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5) were purchased from Genzyme Corporation (Cambridge, MA) and Sigma, respectively. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). OX42 and OX6 were purchased from Serotec Ltd (Bichester, UK). Anti-human Bcl-2 antibody was purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (Cambridge, UK). Papain and DNase were from Worthington Biochemical (Freehold, NJ). RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Calceinacetoxy methyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). ApopTag kit was from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD). The pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was transfected with the plasmid pSTneoB and human Bcl-2/pcDNA/Amp by the electroporation method (7Takai N. Nakanishi H. Tanabe K. Nishioku T. Sugiyama T. Fujiwara M. Yamamoto K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected by their resistance to G418 (800 μg/ml) for 2 months in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The resulting stable neomycin resistant clonal PC12 cell line and Bcl-2 overexpressing clonal cell line were termed Vector N2 and Bcl-2 N2, respectively. Stock PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were obtained by plating 3–4 × 104 cells onto 24-well collagen-coated dishes in the presence of 50 ng/ml NGF for a period of 8–10 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% FCS. Microglia were isolated from a primary culture of the rat brain as described previously (7Takai N. Nakanishi H. Tanabe K. Nishioku T. Sugiyama T. Fujiwara M. Yamamoto K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral cortex from 3-day-old male Wistar rats was minced and treated with papain (90 units/ml) and DNase (2000 units/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. The mechanically dissociated cells were seeded into plastic flasks at a density of 107 per 300 cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.3% NaHCO3, 50 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS, and maintained at 37 °C in a 10% CO2, 90% air atmosphere. Subsequent medium replacement was carried out every 3 days. After 10–14 days in culture, floating cells and weakly attached cells on the mixed primary cultured cell layer were isolated by gentle shaking of the flask for 3–5 min. The resulting cell suspension was transferred to plastic dishes (Falcon 1001, Lincoln Park, NJ) and allowed to adhere at 37 °C. Unattached cells were removed after 30 min, microglia were isolated as strongly adhering cells. About 90% of these attached cells were positive for OX42 or OX6, makers for macrophage/microglial cell types. Isolated microglia were directly plated into 24-well dishes containing neuronal PC12 cells, and then IFN-γ (100 units/ml) and LPS (1 ng/ml) were added in the medium. In some experiments, isolated microglia were plated into cell culture inserts (0.4-μm pore size, Falcon 3095) and placed in 24-well dishes containing neuronal PC12 cells. Cell death was quantified by the measurement of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium from degenerating cells. For determination of LDH activity, the culture medium was collected from each culture well, and then the well was washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing HEPES. The medium was centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min to sediment nonadherent cells. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and pelleted cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (lysing buffer). Cells remaining on the well were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. LDH activities in the culture medium (supernatant) and in the cell lysates were measured spectrophotometrically. The percentage of cell death was calculated by the following formula: cell death = (LDH activity in the culture medium/total LDH activity) × 100. LDH levels in the culture medium and the cell lysate from microglia (generally less than 10% of the total LDH) were determined in the sister cultures and subtracted from the levels in co-culture experimental systems. Apoptosis of neuronal PC12 cells after co-culture with activated microglia were detected by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) using the ApopTag kit. Neuronal Vector N2 and Bcl-2 N2 cells plated on the chamber slides at various days after co-culture with activated microglia were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells on the slides were stained for TUNEL following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Detailed electrophoresis and immunoblotting procedures were described previously (31Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in the dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mechanically removed. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The soluble cell extracts were prepared by ultrasonication followed by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 30 min. The extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions in 7–12% gradient gels after the heat treatment in the solubilizing buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. For immunoblotting, the proteins on gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then immunostained with anti-human Bcl-2 antibody (10 μg/ml), essentially according to the procedure described previously (32Nakanishi H. Amano T. Sastradipura D.F. Yoshimine Y. Tsukuba T. Tanabe K. Hirotsu I. Ohono T. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As a control, the primary antibody was replaced by preimmune mouse IgG. Assays for caspase-3-like proteases (caspase-2, -3, and -7) and caspase-1-like proteases (caspase-1 and -4) were performed at pH 7.4 by using fluorogenic synthetic tetrapeptide substrates (100 μm), Ac-DEVD-MCA and Ac-YVAD-MCA, respectively. After the removal of the culture medium at the appropriate time, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100). After centrifugation, 100 μl of cleared lysates were subjected to assays for caspase-3-like and caspase-1-like proteases with the respective substrates at pH 7.4. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm using CytoFluor II fluorometer (PerSeptive, Eugene, OR). The measurements were performed in triplicate, and the activity was expressed as change in fluorescence units per hour per 10,000 cells. At 52 h after the treatment with activated microglia, neuronal Vector N2 or Bcl-2 N2 cells on a glass slide chamber (Falcon) were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% glutaraldehyde. After washing with 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, the cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and then embedded in Epon 812. Serial ultrathin sections were cut and mounted on nickel grids and stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. The significance of differences between groups was determined with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Scheffe's post hoc test for multiple comparison when F ratios reached significance. The cell viability of neuronal PC12 cells following co-culture with rat microglia immunostimulated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml)/LPS (1 ng/ml) was examined in the serum-free and NGF-containing medium. When the neuronal cells were cultured for 72 h in the absence of activated microglia, approximately 20% of the total cells were dead (Fig.1 A). The neuronal cells, when treated with IFN-γ/LPS in the absence of microglia, exhibited no significant increase of their death. However, when the neuronal PC12 cells were treated with activated microglia, approximately 60% of the neuronal cells were dead at 72 h after co-culture. Importantly, no significant increase of the neuronal death was induced by the treatment with either unstimulated microglia or activated microglia plated on culture inserts to avoid direct contact with the neuronal cells (data not shown). The activated microglia-induced neuronal death was accompanied by the significant increase of the caspase-3-like protease activity determined with Ac-DEVD-MCA as the substrate (Fig.1 B). When the neuronal cells were pretreated with the caspase-3-like protease inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (100 μm) for 24 h, the caspase-3-like protease activity in the cells was completely inhibited, but the microglia-induced neuronal death was only partially inhibited, as compared with that of the untreated neuronal cells. The result indicates that inhibition of the caspase-3-like protease activity is not sufficient to inhibit activated microglia-induced neuronal death. At 72 h after treatment with activated microglia, the majority of neuronal cells became TUNEL-positive and contained various sizes of multiple apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2 B), indicating the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. When Ac-DEVD-CHO (100 μm) was added to the culture medium at 24 h before and during treatment with activated microglia, the majority of neuronal cells were not stained with TUNEL (Fig. 2 C). However, damage of neuronal cells was clearly evident by morphological alterations such as their retracted neurites. Neither TUNEL-positive staining nor neuronal damage was observed in the neuronal cells treated with IFN-γ/LPS in the absence of activated microglia (Fig.2 A). We then examined the effect of high levels of Bcl-2 protein in the neuronal cells on the activated microglia-induced neuronal death. The stable neomycin-resistant clonal PC12 cells without (Vector N2) or with human Bcl-2 protein (Bcl-2 N2) were differentiated to neurons by NGF treatment. Then both serum and NGF were deprived from cultures of the respective cell types. As shown in Fig.3 A, neuronal Vector N2 cells were markedly induced to neuronal death by the trophic factor deprivation in a time-dependent manner, whereas neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells were more resistant to death induced by deprivation of trophic factors (Fig. 3 A). These data indicate that Bcl-2 is expressed highly enough in neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells to suppress cell death induced by deprivation of trophic factors. In contrast, no significant difference with regard to the extent of the activated microglia-induced neuronal death was observed between Vector N2 and Bcl-2 N2 cells, indicating that high levels of Bcl-2 cannot protect the neuronal cells from the activated microglia-induced cell death (Fig. 3 B). To examine the possibility that the lack of protective effect of Bcl-2 expression on the activated microglia-mediated neurotoxicity may be because of the changes of its cellular levels or molecular forms during incubation, the cellular levels of Bcl-2 protein were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). When the same amounts of proteins from the cell extracts of neuronal Bcl-2 N2 before and after treatment with activated microglia for 72 h were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis, single immunoreactive bands with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa were observed with both samples at the same intensity, and their electrophoretic mobilities were also indistinguishable. Therefore, it is unlikely that the activated microglia-induced neuronal death of Bcl-2 N2 cells is caused by either the reduction of cellular levels of Bcl-2 or its molecular change. In the neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells, the proteolytic activities of caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like proteases were determined after treatment with activated microglia by use of the fluorogenic substrates Ac-YVAD-MCA and Ac-DEVD-MCA, respectively (Fig.5). The hydrolytic activity of Ac-YVAD-MCA was barely detectable in the extracts of both neuronal Vector N2 and Bcl-2 N2 cells during the whole period of co-culture with activated microglia. No significant activity of Ac-DEVD-MCA was detected in the extract of neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells during the co-culture, although only a slight increase in the activity was observed around 42 h after the co-culture. In contrast, the extract of neuronal Vector N2 cells showed a gradual increase in the hydrolytic activity of Ac-DEVD-MCA to attain the peak value at around 42 h after the treatment with activated microglia. This activity profile appeared to be correlated with their death as measured by LDH activity in the culture medium per total LDH activity. No hydrolytic activity of either Ac-YVAD-MCA or Ac-DEVD-MCA was detected in cytosolic extracts of microglia. Moreover, various protease inhibitors, other than Ac-DEVD-CHO, such as the aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin A (30 μm for 48 h), the cysteine proteinase inhibitor leupeptin (100 μm for 24 h), and calpain inhibitor I (30 μm, for 24 h) had no significant inhibitory effect on either the Ac-DEVD-MCA hydrolytic activity or the death of neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells following co-culture with activated microglia (data not shown). At 48 h after treatment with activated microglia, the majority of neuronal Vector N2 cells became TUNEL-positive and contained various sizes of multiple apoptotic bodies (Fig. 6 B). A number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies were attached to neighboring microglia and were engulfed by the microglia (Fig. 6, D andE). Some of the TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies appeared to be extensively degraded in microglia (Fig. 6 F). Approximately 40% of the total TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies were engulfed by microglia. On the other hand, the majority of neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells were not stained by TUNEL even at 48 h after treatment with activated microglia but were nevertheless clearly damaged by the treatment as evidenced by their retracted neurites and accumulated vacuoles in their perikarya (Fig. 6 C). No staining was observed in neuronal Vector N2 cells co-cultured with unstimulated microglia (Fig. 6 A). After treatment with IFN-γ/LPS, most of the microglia showed characteristic ruffled membrane structures on their cell surface and had a large number of phagosome-like dense bodies containing phagocytosed materials (Fig.7 A). Fig. 7 B shows an apoptotic body of neuronal Vector N2 cells containing distinct chromatin condensation in the vicinity of activated microglia (anarrowhead indicates the ruffled cell membrane of microglia). Apoptotic bodies of neuronal Vector N2 cells were found to be frequently phagocytosed by activated microglia. Nuclei of Vector N2 cells were also characterized by chromatin uniformly aggregated into large discrete masses abutting on the nuclear membrane (Fig.7 C). In contrast, in the activated microglia-treated neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells, their chromatin was slightly condensed to form irregular shaped masses (Fig. 7 D), but their nuclear membranes were still maintained and formed some boundaries between nuclear and cytoplasmic matrixes. Importantly, these degenerating Bcl-2 N2 cells frequently showed severely disintegrated perikarya, dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, and swollen mitochondria, suggesting that the degenerating process is similar to the necrotic death pathway rather than the apoptotic death pathway. Several lines of evidence have revealed a role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a mediator of cell death. Indeed, generation of ROS has been commonly observed after treatment with agents such as tumor necrosis factor-α (33Albrecht H. Tschopp J. Jongeneel C.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), LPS (34Wang J.H. Redmond H.P. Watson R.W. Bouchier-Hayes D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1543-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ceramide (35Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Trophic factor deprivation can also stimulate the ROS production (36Atabay C. Cagnoli C.M. Kharlamov E. Ikonomovic M.D. Nanev H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS scavengers, such as NAC, are known to inhibit cell death induced by various death stimuli (9Hockenbery D. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 37Lafon C. Mathieu C. Guerrin M. Pierre O. Vidal S. Valette A.

Med. 1997; 22: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, to elucidate the involvement of ROS in the activated microglia-induced death of neuronal PC12 cells, we examined the effect of NAC (60 mm). Both neuronal Vector N2 and Bcl-2 N2 cells, when treated with NAC (60 mm) for 1 h before and during the treatment with activated microglia, exhibited significant resistance to the microglia-induced neuronal death (Fig.8). It was also noted that NAC-treated neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells were more resistant to killing by activated microglia than NAC-treated neuronal Vector N2 cells. The present study has clearly demonstrated that activated microglia can effectively induce the apoptotic cell death of neuronal PC12 cells. This apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3-like protease activation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies that were finally phagocytosed by neighboring microglia. This demonstrates the predominance of the caspase-3-executed apoptotic cell death of neuronal cells by activated microglia. When the neuronal cells were pretreated with Ac-DEVD-CHO, no activation of caspase-3-like proteases was observed. Nevertheless, activated microglia-induced neuronal death occurred, suggesting that the activation of caspase-3-like proteases is not essential for the execution of activated microglia-induced neuronal death. However, since the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation, were not observed in this process, the microglia-induced neuronal death executed in the presence of inhibitor seems to be non-apoptotic. There is increasing evidence that cells can die without chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation after apoptotic stimuli in the presence of the inhibitor for caspase-3-like proteases (40Xiang J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also indicates that caspase-3 is not required for apoptosis in the PC12 cells (43Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30663-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and that thymocytes isolated from caspase-3 knockout mice exhibit normal Fas-induced apoptosis (44Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-y Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Taken together, the present data indicate that although caspase-3-like proteases are essential for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, they are not required for other apoptotic events in the cytoplasm or the cell death itself. It should also be noted that this inhibitor rescued the same cells from death induced by trophic factor deprivation. Then we examined whether high levels of Bcl-2 protein in neuronal PC12 cells inhibited the activated microglia-induced neuronal apoptosis. The results indicated that Bcl-2 overexpression effectively protected the neuronal cells from apoptosis induced by deprivation of both serum and NGF, whereas it did not abrogate the activated microglia-induced neuronal death. In either case, the caspase-3-like protease activity was effectively inhibited in neuronal PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 protein, but the trophic factor deprivation-induced cell death only was prevented. Importantly, the Bcl-2-overexpressing cells after treatment with activated microglia showed morphological changes different from apoptosis. These results suggest that apoptotic signaling pathways dependent on the activation of caspase-3-like proteases would be changed to non-apoptotic signaling pathways independent of the activation of caspase-3-like proteases. It has recently been shown that, in addition to the caspase-3-like proteases, some other intracellular proteolytic systems are identified as executioners to activate cell death. Cathepsin D, a typical lysosomal aspartic proteinase, has been shown to mediate cytokine-induced apoptosis of some cell types (45Deiss L.P. Galinka H. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3861-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 46Wu G.S. Saftig P. Peters C. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2177-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine proteinase, has also been shown to mediate cell death in some cell systems (47Seubert P. Larson J. Oliver M. Jung M.W. Braudry M. Lynch G. Brain Res. 1988; 460: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Seubert P. Lee K. Lynch G. Brain Res. 1989; 492: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 49Siman R. Noszek J.C.

Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the intracellular proteolytic machinery mediated by either cathepsin D or calpain is responsible for the activated microglia-induced neuronal death of Bcl-2 overexpressing PC12 cells in the present study because pepstatin A, leupeptin, or calpain inhibitor I failed to protect the cells from death. Recently, several lines of evidence support a role for ROS as a mediator of both apoptosis and necrosis. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide caused apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (9Hockenbery D. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 52Bladier C. Wolvetang E.J. Hutchinson P. de Haan J.B. Lola I.

Med. 1997; 22: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, antioxidants such as NAC can inhibit apoptosis of neuronal PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons induced by trophic factor deprivation (54Slater A.F. Nobel C.S. Orrenius S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 55Ferrari G. Yan C.Y.I. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2857-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROS and resulting cellular redox changes are known to be part of the signal transduction pathway during apoptosis. On the other hand, ROS toxicity has been also shown to result in necrosis of some cell types (56Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 57Higuchi M. Honda T. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2753-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). More recently, Vercammen et al. (58Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 59Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) have reported that enhanced production of ROS is responsible for TNF-induced necrosis of L929 cells in the presence of caspase inhibitors. Accordingly, we attempted to determine whether ROS was important in the activated microglia-induced death of neuronal Vector N2 and Bcl-2 N2 cells. The results indicated that NAC significantly but partially decreased the activated microglia-induced death of both cell types, suggesting that ROS production is partially involved in death pathways of both neuronal PC12 cells. It should also be noted that NAC showed more effective protection in the neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells than the control Vector N2 cells against the activated microglia-induced cell death. This suggests that the activated microglia-induced death of neuronal Bcl-2 cells is accompanied by the enhanced production of ROS. Although the enhanced production of ROS may be one of the mediators for non-apoptotic death of neuronal Bcl-2 N2 cells, the precise mechanism is to be elucidated in future studies. In conclusion, it must be pointed out that activated microglia predominantly induce caspase-3-like protease-executed apoptosis of neuronal PC12 cells but alternatively trigger non-apoptotic cell death when the caspase-3-like protease cascade is inhibited by protease inhibitors and Bcl-2 overexpression. Thus, it is more likely that whether activated microglia induce apoptosis or non-apoptosis, the neuronal cells depend on the prominence of caspase-3-like protease activation in the death process as well as other factors such as the ROS production. These findings also suggest that adaptation to one type of death pathway may render cells more susceptible to alternative death pathways and that the hypersensitive response of the neuronal cells may be caused by the process of adaptation to the microglia-induced apoptosis. This could be an effective backup mechanism to execute the activated microglia-induced neuronal death. To our knowledge, the data presented here provide the first evidence for a possible mechanism for the regulation of neuronal death by activated microglia. We thank Drs. N. Takai and D. F.

In the present studies, we have investigated possible mechanisms of thermal inactivation of five temperature-sensitive SipS mutants. The results demonstrate that two of these mutants, L74A and Y81A, are structurally stable but strongly impaired in catalytic activity at 48 °C, showing the (unprecedented) involvement of the conserved leucine 74 and tyrosine 81 residues in the catalytic reaction of type I signal peptidases. This conclusion is supported by the crystal structure of the homologous signal peptidase of Escherichia coli (Paetzel, M., Dalbey, R. E., and Strynadka, N. C. J. (1998) Nature 396, 186–190). In contrast, the SipS mutant proteins R84A, R84H, and D146A were inactivated by proteolytic degradation, indicating that the conserved arginine 84 and aspartic acid 146 residues are required to obtain a protease-resistant conformation. The cell wall-bound protease WprA was shown to be involved in the degradation of SipS D146A, which is in accord with the fact that SipS has a large extracytoplasmic domain. As WprA was not involved in the degradation of the SipS mutant proteins R84A and R84H, we conclude that multiple proteases are responsible for the thermal inactivation of temperature-sensitive SipS mutants.

Bacterial proteins that are exported from the cytoplasm via the general secretion pathway are synthesized with an amino-terminal signal peptide. The signal peptide is required for the targeting of pre-proteins to the membrane and the initiation of protein translocation across this membrane (for review, see Ref. 1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During, or shortly after, the translocation of secretory pre-proteins, signal peptides are removed by type I signal peptidases (SPases), 1The abbreviations used are: SPase, signal peptidase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside which is a prerequisite for the release of the mature protein from thetrans side of the membrane (for review, see Ref. 2Dalbey R.E.

As demonstrated by the crystallographic analysis of the type I SPase ofEscherichia coli (also known as leader peptidase), the active site serine residue acts as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond at the SPase recognition site, whereas the unprotonated form of the lysine ε-amino group probably serves to activate the hydroxyl group of the serine residue.

Cells depleted of functional SipS and SipT stop growing and lyse, showing that the presence of either SipS or SipT is essential for growth and viability. This was demonstrated with aB. subtilis strain in which the chromosomal copies of thesipS and sipT genes were disrupted and functionally replaced by one of five different plasmid-borne genes for temperature-sensitive SipS mutant proteins (i.e. L74A, Y81A, R84A, R84H, and D146A; Ref. 13Tjalsma H.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of thermal inactivation of these five SipS mutant proteins. The results show that SipS L74A and Y81A are structurally stable at high temperature, indicating that the substituted residues are, in addition to the putative active site serine (Ser-43) and lysine residues (Lys-83), involved in catalysis. By contrast, SipS R84A, R84H, and D146A are prone to proteolytic degradation, in particular at high temperature, showing that the residues at these positions are required to maintain resistance to proteases. Interestingly, a cell wall-bound protease, WprA, was shown to be involved in the degradation of SipS D146A, but not in the degradation of SipS R84A and R84H.

Open table in a new tab B. subtilis was transformed by growth in GCHE medium until an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of approximately 1.0, subsequent addition of DNA to the culture, and continued growth for 4 h. Western blotting was performed using a semi-dry system as described by Kyhse-Andersen (17Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Proteins were visualized with specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG conjugates, using the ECL detection system of Amersham (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). We have shown previously that the SipS mutant proteins R84A, R84H, and D146A are prone to proteolytic degradation at 37 °C, showing very low levels of SPase activity (6van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, at this temperature sufficient active molecules of SipS R84A, R84H, or D146A are produced in B. subtilis to replace the wild-type forms of SipS and SipT (13Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the inactivity of these three mutant proteins at 48 °C (13Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was due to increased proteolytic degradation, Western blotting experiments were carried out with B. subtilis 8G5 sipS (ΔS; lacking the chromosomalsipS gene) transformed with plasmid pS-R84A, pS-R84H, or pS-D146A (Table I). As shown in Fig.1 (A and B), SipS R84A, R84H, or D146A were detectable at 37 °C, but not at 48 °C. Furthermore, at 37 °C all three mutant proteins were present in reduced amounts compared with wild-type SipS, the D146A mutant protein being most unstable. Examination of the accumulation of the hybrid precursor pre(A13i)-β-lactamase (11van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) in B. subtilis ΔST (lacking the chromosomal sipS and sipT genes) transformed with pS-R84A, pS-R84H, or pS-D146A, showed that SPase activity was strongly reduced at 48 °C, compared with B. subtilis ΔST transformed with pGDL41, specifying wild-type SipS (Fig. 1 C). Thus, impaired SPase activity at 48 °C was paralleled by the disappearance of the SipS mutant proteins, indicating that SipS R84A, R84H, and D146A were inactivated by proteolysis. Similarly, the stability of the SipS mutant proteins L74A and Y81A, which compared with SipS R84A, R84H, and D146A, showed a relatively high activity at 37 °C (6van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and which were unable to replace SipS and SipT at 48 °C (13Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was investigated by Western blotting, usingB. subtilis ΔS transformed with plasmids pS-L74A or pS-Y81A. Unexpectedly, both at 37 and 48 °C, the levels of SipS L74A and Y81A were comparable with those of wild-type SipS (Fig. 1,A and B). The impaired SPase activity of SipS L74A and Y81A at 48 °C was reflected by the increased accumulation of pre(A13i)-β-lactamase in B. subtilis ΔST transformed with plasmids pS-L74A or pS-Y81A, as compared with B. subtilis ΔST producing wild-type SipS (Fig. 1 C). These results show that leucine 74 and tyrosine 81 are very important for catalysis at 48 °C, but not for protease resistance of SipS. As SipS is a type II membrane protein, the largest (carboxyl-terminal) part of which is exposed to the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (11van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it seems likely that proteases residing in the membrane or cell wall are responsible for the degradation of the SipS R84A, R84H, and D146A mutant proteins. As a first approach to identify the proteases responsible for their degradation, we tested the stability of SipS D146A, the most unstable mutant, in B. subtilis strains lacking (putative) membrane-bound proteases such as FtsH, HtrA, protease IV or Tsp (for a review on the E. coli homologues of these proteases, see Ref. 18Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 465-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), or the cell wall-bound protease WprA (19Margot P. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3437-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Stephenson K. Harwood C.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2875-2881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, none of the membrane-bound proteases appeared to be involved in the degradation of SipS D146A (data not shown). In contrast, at 37 °C, B. subtilis WΔS (depleted of WprA, lacking wild-type SipS) accumulated approximately 10-fold higher levels of SipS D146A thanB. subtilis ΔS (Fig. 2), showing that WprA is involved in the degradation of SipS D146A. Interestingly, the levels of SipS R84A and R84H were not increased in the absence of WprA, indicating that these SipS mutants are not substrates for WprA. Despite the improved stability at 37 °C, SipS D146A was not detected immunologically in cells of B. subtilis WΔS (pS-D146A) grown at 48 °C (data not shown). Similarly, at 48 °C, SipS R84A and R84H were not detected in cells of B. subtilis WΔS transformed with pS-R84A or pS-R84H (data not shown). We have shown previously that the production of SipS D146A, to levels that are below the detection limit for Western blotting, can be sufficient for growth of strains lacking SipS and SipT, provided that the temperature is not raised above 42 °C (13Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To determine whether the depletion of WprA in B. subtilis ΔST (pS-D146A) could suppress the temperature sensitivity of this strain, even though the depletion of WprA did not result in the accumulation of detectable amounts of SipS D146A at 48 °C (see above), a wprA mutation was introduced into this strain. As shown in Fig. 3, the depletion of WprA resulted in the suppression of the temperature sensitivity of B. subtilis ΔST (pS-D146A); while B. subtilis ΔST (pS-D146A) stopped growing and started to lyse upon a temperature shift from 37 to 48 °C, the corresponding WprA-depleted strain continued to grow normally at 48 °C. These observations show that depletion of WprA resulted in increased levels of active SipS D146A even at 48 °C. In the present studies, we show that temperature-sensitive mutants of SipS are inactivated via different mechanisms. Two major classes of temperature-sensitive SipS mutants were identified. The first class of mutant proteins, consisting of SipS L74A and Y81A, is structurally stable but has impaired catalytic activity at 48 °C, while the second class of mutant proteins, consisting of SipS R84A, R84H, and D146A, is sensitive to proteolysis, in particular at 48 °C. The observation that SipS L74A and Y81A are structurally stable, showing a particularly reduced enzymatic activity at 48 °C, indicates that leucine 74 and tyrosine 81 are involved in catalysis. This is a novel conclusion, which was not evident from previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments with SipS or other type I SPases (for review, see Ref. 2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 17: 474-478Google Scholar), but which is supported by the recently published crystal structure of the E. coli SPase I (5Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As evidenced by the latter structure, the side chains of phenylalanine 133, tyrosine 143, and methionine 270, and the main chain atoms of methionine 270, methionine 271, glycine 272, and alanine 279 make van der Waals contacts with the side chain of the active site lysine residue 145. Thus, the ε-amino group of lysine 145 is located in a hydrophobic environment, which is probably essential to lower its pK a to such an extent that it can function as a general base (5Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As leucine 74 and tyrosine 81 of SipS are the equivalents of phenylalanine 133 and tyrosine 143 of E. coliSPase I, it seems likely that their side chains are required to lower the pK a of the active site lysine residue 83 of SipS. Even though the latter hypothesis provides an explanation for the reduced activities of the SipS L74A and Y81A mutant proteins, it does not explain why these mutant proteins display some residual activity at 37 °C (6van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but not at 48 °C. It is, however, conceivable that the pK a of lysine 83 is further increased at elevated temperature due to local unfolding events. Alternatively, local unfolding in the L74A and Y81A mutant proteins at 48 °C may affect the interaction between the active site serine 43 and lysine 83 residues. In contrast to SipS L74A and Y81A, the thermal inactivation of the SipS mutants R84A, R84H, and D146A seems to be based on proteolysis, suggesting that these mutations strongly retard the folding of SipS to a protease-resistant conformation or that they make the folded SipS protein protease-sensitive. Based on the crystal structure of E. coli SPase I (5Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we favor the latter hypothesis, because the equivalent residues of arginine 84 and aspartic acid 146 of SipS in theE. coli SPase I (i.e. arginine 146 and aspartic acid 273) form a salt bridge, 2R. E. Dalbey, personal communication. which may be required to rigidify the structure of type I SPases, such as SipS. Our present results show that the wall-bound protease WprA (19Margot P. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3437-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which was shown recently to be involved in the degradation of folding intermediates of secreted proteins (20Stephenson K. Harwood C.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2875-2881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is involved in the degradation of SipS D146A, but not of SipS R84A and R84H. Furthermore, depletion of WprA did not result in the accumulation of SipS D146A to wild-type levels. Thus, it seems that other, as yet unidentified, proteases at the membrane-cell wall interface are also involved in the degradation of structurally unstable SipS mutant proteins. These could even include other type I SPases, such as SipU, SipV, or SipW, as suggested by the observation that the homologous Sec11p subunit of the SPase complex in the yeast endoplasmatic reticular membrane is involved in protein degradation (21Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, we are currently unable to exclude the possibility that cytosolic proteases are involved the degradation of SipS mutant proteins, either before, during, or after membrane insertion. The latter possibility is particularly intriguing since it would require retrograde transport to the cytoplasm, as documented recently for the degradation of ER lumenal proteins (22Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 23Kopito R.R.

Apo(a) is a highly polymorphic glycoprotein with a close sequence homology to plasminogen that contains from 12 to 50 copies of a domain homologous to plasminogen kringle 4 (8McLean J.W.

These sequence similarities constitute a basis to explain the correlation between high Lp(a) concentration and atherosclerosis. Through its apo(a) moiety, Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to fibrin. This prevents plasminogen conversion to plasmin, which in turn hinders fibrinolysis and activation of latent transforming growth factor-β, contributing to an atherogenic phenotype (10Harpel P.C.

Kochl S. Menzel H.J. Sandholzer C. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 18Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Generally, Lp(a) plasma concentration is inversely proportional to the number of apo(a) kringle repeats (19Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, other features of the apo(a) locus contribute to determine Lp(a) plasma levels since Lp(a) plasma concentration can vary several hundredfold in individuals with the same number of kringles (20Cohen J.C.

Here we report that the DNA region containing the enhancer element at 26 kb from the apo(a) promoter also promotes 17β-estradiol responsiveness in a reporter vector in transfected hepatic cells. Its position coincides with a DNase I-hypersensitive site (33Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Such sites are normally associated with an open chromatin structure, an indication that the DNA region is in a favorable conformation to interact with transcription factors (49Fedor M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activity of the 700-base pair fragment containing the DHII enhancer (construct 20 in Fig. 1) was orientation-dependent, the activity being stronger when the fragment was cloned in the same orientation relative to the apo(a) promoter as it is in the chromosomal locus. A larger 2-kb fragment was reported to lack enhancer activity when cloned in the opposite orientation to the apo(a) promoter (34Wade D.P. Puckey L.H. Knight B.L. Acquati F. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30387-30399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For this reason, we failed to detect this enhancer in our previous screening for apo(a) regulatory elements. It is not clear what gives rise to this phenomenon. It is possible that additional negative regulatory or insulator elements are present downstream of the DHII enhancer, to ensure proper separation and differential regulation of the apo(a) and plasminogen genes.The orientation dependence is essentially lost when the enhancer/estrogen-responsive region is deleted down to its core elements. The DHII enhancer was shown to require a 186-base pair region encompassing two footprints (ee-I and ee-II in Fig. 2). The Sp1 and PPAR transcription factors are required for ee-I activity, and the PPAR for ee-II activity (43Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1995: 78-94Google Scholar). (Such PPAR sites could be involved in the reported effect of retinoids on apo(a) expression (50Ramharack R. Spahr M.A. Sekerke C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).) We found that the ee-II region alone was sufficient to confer E2responsiveness to the apo(a) minimal promoter reporter vector. Although this region contains a potential ERE sequence, our data indicate that direct binding of ER-α to this DNA site does not seem to be involved. Mutations in the right arm of the ERE do not impair E2responsiveness. ER-α mutants lacking a functional ERE DNA-binding domain are still efficient, and gel shifts and supershifts fail to yield any evidence of ER-α binding. On the other hand, the requirement for functional transactivation domains suggests that ER-α interacts with a transcription factor necessary for the enhancer activity, interfering in this way with its function. The gel-shift data indicate that the presence of ER-α prevents the interaction between other nuclear proteins and the ERU. This interaction is crucial to its function. In fact, an oligonucleotide bearing a mutation that destroys enhancer and estrogen response activity is impaired in its ability to form the same complexes that are inhibited by ER-α.Interaction of ER-α with other transcription factors has been reported for a number of gene regulatory units. In some cases, no direct binding of the receptor to a canonical ERE sequence is involved. For example, in erythroid precursor cells, ER-α binds to the transcription factor GATA-1 through its AF2 domain without direct or indirect DNA binding, preventing the activation of GATA-1-requiring genes (51Blobel G.A. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1687-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 52von Lindern M. Boer L. Wessely O. Parker M. Beug H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Another well characterized mechanism by which nuclear receptors have been shown to modulate gene expression is competition for common non-DNA-binding cofactors with other transcription factors (36Harnish D.C. Evans M.J. Scicchitano M.S. Bhat R.A. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9270-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 53Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). This possibility is unlikely due to the observation that binding of a transcription factor to a DNA target seems to be involved in the DHII enhancer/ERU activity. In fact, mutations at a specific site of the ERU destroy all DHII activity. This observation also argues against the possibility that ER-α exerts its effect indirectly by inhibiting the expression of factors required for DHII activity.The identity of the factor interacting with ER-α is not determined. The sequence spanning the nucleotides whose mutation was crucial contains a potential binding site for the nuclear orphan receptor ARP-1, but gel-shift competition and gel-supershift experiments did not yield evidence to support its role in ERU function.The physiological relevance of the DHII enhancer/ERU remains to be established in vivo. Experiments are under way to delete this region from a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse carrying the apo(a) genomic locus. It is interesting to note that, although apo(a) expression is responsive to estrogen, plasminogen expression is not. The homologous apo(a) and plasminogen genes are separated by only ∼35 kb of genomic DNA. Their minimal promoter regions have significant sequence and functional similarities, including the requirement for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α. It will be of interest to discover how the two genes are differentially regulated. It can be suggested that some form of insulator element (54Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar,55Gerasimova T.I. Corces V.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) separates the last apo(a) control region (probably the DHII region) from the plasminogen promoter. Apolipoprotein(a) is the characteristic protein component of the lipoprotein particle Lp(a). Lp(a) consists of a low density lipoprotein covalently linked to apo(a) through its protein moiety, apolipoprotein B-100 (1Scanu A.M. Fless G.M. J. Clin.

Most prospective studies and a recentmeta-analysis have identified Lp(a) excess as a major risk factor of premature atherosclerotic vascular disease (3Stein J.H. Rosenson R.S. Arch. Intern.

Assoc. 1993; 270: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Apo(a) is a highly polymorphic glycoprotein with a close sequence homology to plasminogen that contains from 12 to 50 copies of a domain homologous to plasminogen kringle 4 (8McLean J.W.

These sequence similarities constitute a basis to explain the correlation between high Lp(a) concentration and atherosclerosis. Through its apo(a) moiety, Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to fibrin. This prevents plasminogen conversion to plasmin, which in turn hinders fibrinolysis and activation of latent transforming growth factor-β, contributing to an atherogenic phenotype (10Harpel P.C.

In contrast to other lipoproteins, Lp(a) plasma concentration varies widely (<0.1 to >100 mg dl−1) in individual humans, and at least 90% of this variation is attributable to the apo(a) genetic locus (17Kraft H.G. Kochl S. Menzel H.J. Sandholzer C. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 18Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), indicating that the regulation of apo(a) expression is significant in controlling pathological levels of Lp(a). Generally, Lp(a) plasma concentration is inversely proportional to the number of apo(a) kringle repeats (19Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, other features of the apo(a) locus contribute to determine Lp(a) plasma levels since Lp(a) plasma concentration can vary several hundredfold in individuals with the same number of kringles (20Cohen J.C.

Population studies have shown that Lp(a) levels increase 8–13% in postmenopausal women relative to premenopausal controls (22Brown S.A. Hutchinson R. Morrisett J. Boerwinkle E. Davis C.E.

Longitudinal studies have reported that hormone replacement therapy lowers Lp(a) concentration as much as 50% (24Farish E. Rolton H.A. Barnes J.F. Hart D.M. Br. Med.

Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1687-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 52von Lindern M. Boer L. Wessely O. Parker M. Beug H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Another well characterized mechanism by which nuclear receptors have been shown to modulate gene expression is competition for common non-DNA-binding cofactors with other transcription factors (36Harnish D.C.

This possibility is unlikely due to the observation that binding of a transcription factor to a DNA target seems to be involved in the DHII enhancer/ERU activity. In fact, mutations at a specific site of the ERU destroy all DHII activity. This observation also argues against the possibility that ER-α exerts its effect indirectly by inhibiting the expression of factors required for DHII activity.The identity of the factor interacting with ER-α is not determined. The sequence spanning the nucleotides whose mutation was crucial contains a potential binding site for the nuclear orphan receptor ARP-1, but gel-shift competition and gel-supershift experiments did not yield evidence to support its role in ERU function.The physiological relevance of the DHII enhancer/ERU remains to be established in vivo. Experiments are under way to delete this region from a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse carrying the apo(a) genomic locus. It is interesting to note that, although apo(a) expression is responsive to estrogen, plasminogen expression is not. The homologous apo(a) and plasminogen genes are separated by only ∼35 kb of genomic DNA. Their minimal promoter regions have significant sequence and functional similarities, including the requirement for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α. It will be of interest to discover how the two genes are differentially regulated. It can be suggested that some form of insulator element (54Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar,55Gerasimova T.I. Corces V.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) separates the last apo(a) control region (probably the DHII region) from the plasminogen promoter. Sex steroid hormones are the most potent known regulators of apo(a) gene expression and concomitant plasma concentration of Lp(a). Previous studies have described chromosomal elements involved in apo(a) expression, a 300-base pair promoter encompassing the apo(a) transcription start site and putative apo(a) enhancers located 18 and 26 kb upstream (30Wade D.P.

Control elements located at large distances from the promoter are involved in the regulation of numerous other genes, including other apolipoproteins (45Nishiyori A. Tashiro H. Kimura A. Akagi K.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the DNA region containing the enhancer element at 26 kb from the apo(a) promoter also promotes 17β-estradiol responsiveness in a reporter vector in transfected hepatic cells. Its position coincides with a DNase I-hypersensitive site (33Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Such sites are normally associated with an open chromatin structure, an indication that the DNA region is in a favorable conformation to interact with transcription factors (49Fedor M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activity of the 700-base pair fragment containing the DHII enhancer (construct 20 in Fig. 1) was orientation-dependent, the activity being stronger when the fragment was cloned in the same orientation relative to the apo(a) promoter as it is in the chromosomal locus. A larger 2-kb fragment was reported to lack enhancer activity when cloned in the opposite orientation to the apo(a) promoter (34Wade D.P. Puckey L.H. Knight B.L. Acquati F. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30387-30399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For this reason, we failed to detect this enhancer in our previous screening for apo(a) regulatory elements. It is not clear what gives rise to this phenomenon. It is possible that additional negative regulatory or insulator elements are present downstream of the DHII enhancer, to ensure proper separation and differential regulation of the apo(a) and plasminogen genes. The orientation dependence is essentially lost when the enhancer/estrogen-responsive region is deleted down to its core elements. The DHII enhancer was shown to require a 186-base pair region encompassing two footprints (ee-I and ee-II in Fig. 2). The Sp1 and PPAR transcription factors are required for ee-I activity, and the PPAR for ee-II activity (43Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1995: 78-94Google Scholar). (Such PPAR sites could be involved in the reported effect of retinoids on apo(a) expression (50Ramharack R. Spahr M.A. Sekerke C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).) We found that the ee-II region alone was sufficient to confer E2responsiveness to the apo(a) minimal promoter reporter vector. Although this region contains a potential ERE sequence, our data indicate that direct binding of ER-α to this DNA site does not seem to be involved. Mutations in the right arm of the ERE do not impair E2responsiveness. ER-α mutants lacking a functional ERE DNA-binding domain are still efficient, and gel shifts and supershifts fail to yield any evidence of ER-α binding. On the other hand, the requirement for functional transactivation domains suggests that ER-α interacts with a transcription factor necessary for the enhancer activity, interfering in this way with its function. The gel-shift data indicate that the presence of ER-α prevents the interaction between other nuclear proteins and the ERU. This interaction is crucial to its function. In fact, an oligonucleotide bearing a mutation that destroys enhancer and estrogen response activity is impaired in its ability to form the same complexes that are inhibited by ER-α. Interaction of ER-α with other transcription factors has been reported for a number of gene regulatory units. In some cases, no direct binding of the receptor to a canonical ERE sequence is involved. For example, in erythroid precursor cells, ER-α binds to the transcription factor GATA-1 through its AF2 domain without direct or indirect DNA binding, preventing the activation of GATA-1-requiring genes (51Blobel G.A.

https://openalex.org/W1964946285,"The RON receptor-type tyrosine kinase, a member of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor family, is a receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP). Recently, we observed that MSP induces morphological changes in interleukin (IL)-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells ectopically expressing RON. We show here that stimulation of those cells with either MSP or IL-3 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 130, 110, 90, 62, and 58 kDa and induces similar morphological changes, accompanied by unique nuclear shape and redistribution of F-actin. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocked both the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and morphological changes. Upon stimulation with either MSP or IL-3, prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated pp90 was similarly co-immunoprecipitated with the common β chain of IL-3 receptor (βc). Unlike IL-3, stimulation with MSP increased tyrosine phosphorylation of βc without activation of JAK2, resulting in morphological changes with modest cell growth. Confocal immunofluorescence analyses showed colocalization of RON, βc, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In vitro kinase assays revealed that autophosphorylated RON phosphorylated βc. These results suggest that the signaling pathway for morphological changes through βcand its associated protein pp90 is distinct from the pathway for cell growth in the IL-3 signal transduction system.

All RTKs are composed of three major domains, an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that contains a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain (3Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar,4Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, RTKs undergo dimerization leading to activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation (5Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated regions of the receptor function as high-affinity binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, which transduce recep tor-generated signals upon phosphorylation (1Schlessinger J.

The RON receptor-type tyrosine kinase is a member of a subfamily of RTK that includes the c-Met hepatocyte growth factor receptor and c-Sea (7Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Borgman C.A. Lasing T.J. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6140-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The human RON gene was cloned from human keratinocytes (8Ronsin C. Muscatelli F. Mattei M.-G. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar), and the mouse homolog, formerly known as STK (stem cell-derivedtyrosine kinase), was derived from mouse hematopoietic stem cells (9Iwama A. Okano K. Sudo T. Matsuda Y. Suda T. Blood. 1994; 83: 3160-3169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RON, as well as the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, is synthesized as a single-chain precursor, then cleaved to a mature disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of an extracellular α chain and a transmembrane β chain with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (10Gaugino G.

MSP is an 80-kDa serum protein that belongs to a family characterized by the presence of a highly conserved triple disulfide loop structure (Kringle domain). The family includes prothrombin, plasminogen, urokinase, and hepatocyte growth factor (14Han S. Stuart L.A. Degen S.J.F.

Res. 1976; 102: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MSP has multiple biological effects. In murine resident peritoneal macrophages it induces cell spreading and migration (18Leonard E.J. Skeel A. Exp. Cell.

Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14027-14031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MSP also plays roles in chemotaxis of keratinocytes (21Wang M.-H.

Masuyama K. Yamanaka T. Ando M. Suda T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has been established that the IL-3 receptor shares a common β (βc) subunit with the IL-5 receptor and the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor and that each receptor is composed of a unique α subunit and the βc subunit (24Takaki S.

Each α subunit specifically exhibits low-affinity binding to IL-3, IL-5, or GM-CSF, whereas the βc subunit lacks direct ligand binding but confers high affinity binding to the α subunit. Binding of IL-3 to its receptor complex induces activation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase. In turn, autophosphorylated JAK2 kinase activates βc to recruit various signaling molecules to the tyrosine-phosphorylated βc and triggers signal transduction events mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of βc (27Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 28Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A.

Recently, we found that stimulation with MSP induces cell growth through phosphorylation of two C-terminal tyrosine residues in the multifunctional docking site of RON (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Stimulation with MSP also induces cell shape changes (11Iwama A. Wang M.-H. Yamaguchi N. Ohno N. Okano K. Sudo T. Takeya M. Gervais F. Morisette C. Leonard E.J. Suda T. Blood. 1995; 86: 3394-3403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain further insight into signal transduction events required for morphological changes and cell growth, we have compared MSP- and IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells that ectopically express RON on the cell surface. Binding of MSP to RON activates βcwithout activation of JAK2 to produce morphological changes. Our findings suggest that IL-3 stimulation activates two distinct signaling pathways, one involved in morphological changes and the other in cell growth. Recombinant human MSP and recombinant mouse IL-3 were kindly provided by Drs. M. Hagiya and T. Takehara (Toyobo Co. Ltd, Shiga, Japan) and Dr. T. Sudo (Toray Industries, Inc., Kamakura, Japan), respectively. A rabbit polyclonal and a biotinylated rat monoclonal antibody against RON recognize the intracellular C-terminal region and the extracellular domain, respectively (11Iwama A. Wang M.-H. Yamaguchi N. Ohno N. Okano K. Sudo T. Takeya M. Gervais F. Morisette C. Leonard E.J. Suda T. Blood. 1995; 86: 3394-3403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10 and FITC-conjugated 4G10) and anti-mouse JAK2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-mouse β chain common to IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF receptors (βc), and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and PharMingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-mouse Ig and of anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) were also used. cDNAs for murine full-length RON and RON-F1330/F1337, carrying combined mutations of tyrosine 1330 and 1337 to phenylalanine, were described previously (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The murine IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3 stably expressed with either wild-type RON or RON-F1330/F1337 was cultured in serum-free medium containing 100 units/ml IL-3, as described (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Wild-type RON- or RON-F1330/F1337-expressing Ba/F3 cells were deprived of IL-3 for 12 h before stimulation. Cells were adjusted to 1.6 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), preincubated in the presence of 1 mmNa3VO4 for 5 min, and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml MSP or 100 units/ml IL-3 in the presence of 1 mmNa3VO4 for the indicated periods at 30 °C. Treatment of cells with Na3VO4 specifically enhanced MSP- or IL-3-induced morphological changes. Morphological changes were quantitated by counting the number of cells characterized by distortion, bending, stretching, and branching of the cell body under a phase-contrast microscope in three randomly selected high-power fields (magnification, ×200). Cells having filopodia and lamellipodia around the cell periphery were not counted. For treatment with various inhibitors, cells (1.6 × 105 cells/ml) were pretreated with various concentrations of genistein dissolved in 0.25% Me2SO, 20 μg/ml actinomycin D, or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide in 0.5% ethanol at 37 °C for 30 min, and then stimulated with MSP or IL-3 as described above. Murine bone marrow cells were obtained from C57BL/6 mice and long-term cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-3 for 14 days. Cells were deprived of IL-3 for 7 h and then stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-3 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells (1.6 × 105cells/ml) were stimulated with MSP or IL-3 as described above. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. After washing, the cells were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% BSA and 0.1% saponin for 20 min, as described (32Yamaguchi N. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and then stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for F-actin or propidium iodide for nuclei. For detection of colocalization of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and RON, cells were fixed as above, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% BSA for 20 min, and then stained with biotinylated anti-RON for 1 h. After permeabilized with saponin, the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 1 h and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. To prevent dephosphorylation, 10 mm Na3VO4 was included throughout the staining procedure, as described (33Tada J. Omine M. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. Blood. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). To detect colocalization of RON and βc, cells were fixed as above, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% BSA for 20 min, and then stained with biotinylated rat anti-RON for 1 h, followed by staining with Texas red-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. After permeabilization with saponin, cells were stained with anti-βc for 30 min, followed by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min. FITC-anti-rabbit IgG was not cross-reactive with the rat anti-RON antibody. Confocal and Nomarski differential-interference-contrast images were obtained using a Fluoview laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Z-series sections were recorded at 0.5-μm intervals and merged. To ensure no bleed-through from the fluorescein signal into the red channel, fluorescein and Texas red fluorochromes were independently excited at 488 nm and 568 nm, respectively. Emission signals were detected at between 510 and 550 nm for fluorescein, more than 585 nm for Texas red, and more than 610 nm for propidium iodide. 50 μl of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.1% BSA) in triplicate were placed in the top wells of a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe Inc., Cabin John, MD). The lower wells, separated by a 5-μm pore polycarbonate membrane, were filled with 30 μl of 100 ng/ml MSP, 100 units/ml IL-3, or medium alone. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, cells migrating through the membrane were fixed and stained with May-Giemsa. The cells were counted under a microscope in five randomly selected high-power fields (magnification, ×400). Results were expressed as cell number/5 high-power fields (5 hpf). Cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were stimulated in the presence of 1 mmNa3VO4 at 30 °C as described above, unless stated. The cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C, and then lysed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na3VO4) containing 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm leupeptin, 50 μmpepstatin A, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunodetection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence, as described (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Hirao A.

Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-RON, anti-βc, and anti-JAK2, and the immune complexes were washed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer at 4 °C and analyzed as described (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N.

Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) were precoated with both anti-RON reactive to the epitope in the extracellular domain of RON and anti-βc antibodies. First, βc was immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100 lysate of parental Ba/F3 cells on the precoated beads. After washing with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Na3VO4), and Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl, the beads were incubated with equal amounts of Triton X-100 lysates of either COS-7 cells or COS-7 cells transiently transfected with RON. RON kinase expressed in COS-7 cells was highly autophosphorylated without exposure to MSP, probably due to aggregation of abundantly expressed RON. After washing as above, equal amounts of each immunoprecipitate were subjected to in vitro kinase assays. The immunoprecipitates were suspended with 70 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2) containing 0.2 mmNa3VO4 and 100 μm ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated periods, reactions were terminated by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunodetections were performed as described above. Phosphorylated bands detected with anti-pTyr (4G10) were quantified with a densitometer (ATTO, Tokyo). It is often observed that exposure of bone marrow cells and IL-3-dependent cell lines to IL-3 leads to changes in cell morphology and cell growth. Fig.1 A shows an example of cell shape changes of IL-3-dependent long-term cultured bone marrow cells. Our previous finding (11Iwama A. Wang M.-H. Yamaguchi N. Ohno N. Okano K. Sudo T. Takeya M. Gervais F. Morisette C. Leonard E.J. Suda T. Blood. 1995; 86: 3394-3403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that MSP stimulation induces morphological changes in the IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3 ectopically expressing wild-type RON. We therefore compared the effects of MSP and IL-3 on cell morphology in these cells. MSP and IL-3 were found to induce similar morphological changes. A decrease in incubation temperature from 37 to 30 °C and addition of Na3VO4, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, increased the proportion of cells morphologically changed (Fig.1 B, upper panels). Morphological changes were detected at 15 min and peaked at ∼60 min of stimulation (data not shown). Phosphorylation of two C-terminal tyrosine residues, Tyr-1330 and Tyr-1337, in the multifunctional docking site of RON plays a critical role in RON-mediated signal transduction (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, cells expressing RON-F1330/F1337, which carried mutations of tyrosine 1330 and 1337 to phenylalanine, responded to MSP with striking changes of morphology (lower panels). To characterize MSP- or IL-3-induced shape changes, cells were stained with propidium iodide for nuclei and rhodamine-phalloidin for F-actin, and analyzed by Nomarski differential-interference-contrast and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 1 C shows that stimulation with MSP or IL-3 induced drastic morphological changes accompanied by unique nuclear shape changes and redistribution and an increase in F-actin. Most cells showed uropod-like structures. Note that lobulated nuclei were preferentially observed upon MSP stimulation, suggesting that the activity of MSP is stronger than that of IL-3. These results indicate that MSP and IL-3 induce similar shape changes, and that MSP-induced shape changes are not mediated through the multifunctional docking site of RON. Tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in MSP and IL-3 signaling. We examined whether genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked morphological changes. Treatment of wild-type RON-expressing cells with genistein inhibited both MSP- and IL-3-induced morphological changes, whereas genistein alone had no effect on morphology and viability (Fig. 2, A andB). Another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A (20 μg/ml), also blocked morphological changes (data not shown). Morphological changes were not inhibited by actinomycin D (ActD), an RNA synthesis inhibitor, or cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 2 B, a). MSP was more potent than IL-3 in both cell types (Fig. 2 B, aand b), and the proportion of cells morphologically changed in RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells was larger than that observed in wild-type RON-expressing cells (data not shown). In RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells, morphological changes were also blocked by genistein (Fig. 2 B, b). These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for morphological changes. To determine whether MSP or IL-3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, Western blotting was performed using the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Fig.3). Stimulation of wild-type RON-expressing cells with MSP increased tyrosine phosphorylation of RON at 145 kDa and of proteins at 130, 110, 90, 62, and 58 kDa (Fig.3 A). A similar increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 130, 110, 90, 62, and 58 kDa was observed upon stimulation with IL-3. Tyrosine phosphorylation of RON per se was not induced by stimulation with IL-3. Addition of Na3VO4 to cell suspensions throughout stimulation periods and the decrease in reaction temperature from 37 °C (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6) to 30 °C (lanes 1–3) enhanced increases in the level of MSP- or IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation probably due to inhibition of rapid dephosphorylation. These results are consistent with the morphological observations (Figs. 1 and 2) and suggest that RON-mediated signaling is closely related to the IL-3-induced signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were apparent 5 min after stimulation, peaked at 15 min, and sustained for at least 60 min of stimulation (data not shown). These kinetics suggest that MSP- or IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation precedes morphological changes. Furthermore, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by MSP were generally higher than those induced by IL-3, consistent with observations that MSP was more potent than IL-3 in promoting morphological changes (Fig. 2). pp90 was a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein consisting of four subspecies (pp86, pp87, pp91, and pp94) (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). Fig. 3 B (lower panel) represents schematic locations of pp90 subspecies. Because treatment with genistein inhibited MSP- or IL-3-induced morphological changes (Fig. 2), we examined whether genistein indeed inhibited MSP- or IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in both wild-type RON- (Fig.4, A-C) and RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells (E-G). Tyrosine phosphorylation was similarly induced in both cell types, and treatment with genistein inhibited increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of RON, pp130, pp110, pp90, pp62, and pp58 (Fig. 4, A andE). Inhibition of RON autophosphorylation (B andF) indicates that RON kinase activity is repressed by genistein. The common β chain of IL-3 receptor (βc) is known to play a pivotal role in signal transduction mediated by the IL-3 receptor system (27Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Because βc appeared to correspond to pp130 on anti-βc blots (data not shown; see Figs.3 A and 4, A and E), we therefore examined whether βc is involved in RON-mediated signaling. Fig. 4, C and G show by immunoprecipitation that MSP, like IL-3, induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the βc doublet. The levels of βc tyrosine phosphorylation induced by MSP were generally higher than those induced by IL-3. In addition, MSP- or IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of βc was inhibited by genistein (Fig. 4, C and G, lanes 4–6). IL-3-induced receptor aggregation initiates autophosphorylation and activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase, and activated JAK2 in turn phosphorylates βc to recruit various signaling molecules (36Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). We analyzed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. Fig.4, D and H show that MSP, unlike IL-3, was unable to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, suggesting that activation of JAK2 is not required for RON-mediated signaling. To examine whether RON kinase could directly tyrosine-phosphorylate βc, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with RON kinase immunoprecipitated from RON-transfected COS-7 cells. Fig. 5, A and Bshow that tyrosine phosphorylation of βc was clearly detected at 5 min (Fig. 5 A, lane 5), and increased at 30 min (lane 6), whereas an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of βc was not detected at 0 min (lane 4). βc was not tyrosine-phosphorylated without RON kinase (lanes 1–3). These results suggest that RON kinase could directly tyrosine-phosphorylate βc. To examine whether βc could associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed with Triton X-100 lysates obtained from wild-type RON-expressing cells. We found that βc was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with pp90 but not with pp62 and pp58 (Fig.6 A; data not shown). Three pp90 subspecies, pp87, pp91, and pp94, were co-immunoprecipitated with MSP- or IL-3-activated βc, whereas pp86 was associated with control βc. The degree of association of pp87, pp91, and pp94 with βc corresponded to that of tyrosine phosphorylation of βc (see Fig. 6, shorter exposure). Neither pp86, pp87, pp91, nor pp94 was identified as STAT5, Vav, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or ezrin (data not shown). These results suggest that tyrosine-phosphorylated βc forms a novel complex with pp90. RON-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of βc suggests that RON, βc, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins could be colocalized. To test this, confocal immunofluorescence microscopic analyses were performed. Fig. 6 B (upper panels) shows a uniform distribution of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and RON in control cells. On the other hand, cells stimulated with MSP showed the redistribution and colocalization of RON and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as well as increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Colocalization of RON and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was prominently observed in regions containing many granules and uropod-like structures (Fig.6 B, arrowheads, lower panels). As shown in Fig. 6 C, control cells showed colocalized βc and RON in a uniform distribution. Interestingly, cells stimulated with MSP showed the redistribution and colocalization of RON and βc. The pattern of colocalization of βc with RON is similar to that of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and RON (arrowheads, lower panels), consistent with redistribution of F-actin upon stimulation (Fig.1 C). These results suggest that RON, βc, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are colocalized particularly in uropod-like regions of stimulated cells. IL-3 induced a strong proliferative response in wild-type RON-expressing cells, whereas MSP-stimulated cells displayed modest growth responses or prolonged survival (Fig.7). However, in RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells, treatment with MSP or medium alone did not induce cell growth, whereas IL-3 stimulation induced a strong proliferative response (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous demonstration that MSP stimulation results in modest growth responses (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). MSP is reported to induce chemotactic responses of murine peritoneal macrophages and keratinocytes (19Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4618-4623PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang M.-H. Dlugosz A.A. Sun Y. Suda T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 226: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). IL-3 has also been shown to act as a chemotactic factor for eosinophils (37Warringa R.A.J. Koenderman L. Kok P.T.M. Kreukniet J.K. Bruijnzeel P.L.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effects of MSP and IL-3 on chemotaxis, cell migration assays were performed. MSP and IL-3 induced cell migration toward respective stimulants. After 3 h of stimulation, numbers of migrating cells increased approximately 4-fold (205 ± 10 cells/5 hpf) and 2.8-fold (132 ± 25 cells/5 hpf) in response to MSP and IL-3, respectively, compared with medium alone (47 ± 23 cells/5 hpf). Cell migration to MSP or IL-3 was inhibited by 50 μg/ml genistein (control, 17 ± 4 cells/5 hpf; MSP, 27 ± 1 cells/5 hpf; IL-3, 21 ± 6 cells/5 hpf). Similar results were obtained in RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells (data not shown). These results suggest that RON-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of βcunderlying morphological changes contributes to migration but not to cell growth. In this study, we use IL-3-dependent cells ectopically expressing RON to characterize distinct pathways involved in cell growth and changes in morphology seen following IL-3 and MSP stimulation. Our model for the mechanism of IL-3 receptor-mediated morphological changes is shown in Fig. 8. In unstimulated cells (Fig. 8 A), ectopically expressed RON kinase localizes with the IL-3 receptor βc. Neither JAK2 kinase that constitutively associates with βc nor RON kinase is activated in the absence of IL-3 or MSP. When cells are stimulated with IL-3 (Fig. 8 B), JAK2 is activated to phosphorylate both βc at multiple sites and recruited STAT5 to trigger cell growth. Moreover, activation of JAK2 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including pp90, which associates with βc. When cells are stimulated with MSP (Fig. 8 C), RON kinase activated by autophosphorylation triggers increased tyrosine phosphorylation of βc and several proteins including pp90, resulting in morphological changes. In contrast to IL-3, MSP stimulation does not activate JAK2 or promote strong proliferative responses. Modest cell growth induced by MSP results from phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues in the multifunctional docking site of RON. pp90 is located downstream of activated JAK2 in the IL-3 signal transduction pathway. Activated RON kinase presumably phosphorylates p90 without activation of JAK2; this path leads to βc-mediated morphological changes but not to proliferation. It has been well established that tyrosine phosphorylation of βc is crucial for IL-3 signal transduction (24Takaki S. Mita S. Kitamura T. Yonehara S. Yamaguchi N. Tominaga A. Miyajima A. Takatsu K.

Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Binding of IL-3 to its receptor induces activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase and triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of βc phosphorylation sites, resulting in recruitment of signaling proteins, such as STAT5 and c-Myc. Stimulation of the c-Kit receptor-type tyrosine kinase with the Kit ligand phosphorylates and activates the erythropoietin receptor, which associates with JAK2 (40Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The activated β subunit of the IL-6 receptor and the ErbB2 receptor-type tyrosine kinase interact directly with each other (41Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.-J. Nature. 1998; 393: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The results presented here provide another example of cross-talk between a receptor-type tyrosine kinase and a signal-transducing subunit/domain of the cytokine receptor family. Based on our observations of crosstalk between RON and βcin cell shape changes, we hypothesize that ectopically expressed RON preferentially phosphorylates some of tyrosine residues on βc that can be phosphorylated by activated JAK2 following stimulation with IL-3. Identification of the βc tyrosine residues responsible for morphological changes will help further our understanding of this signaling pathway. We recently showed that two C-terminal tyrosine residues, Tyr-1330 and Tyr-1337, in the multifunctional docking site of RON that are conserved among the hepatocyte growth factor family receptors are principally responsible for the signal transduction involved in cell growth (31Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After MSP binds to RON, signaling molecules such as Shc, phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Grb2, and others are recruited to the two C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites. We therefore compared morphological changes and tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type RON-expressing cells with those in RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells. Surprisingly, the F1330/1337 mutation enhanced the morphological responses, indicating that the multifunctional docking site is not required. However, the kinase activity of RON is required for morphological changes. Intriguingly, treatment of cells with Na3VO4 at 30 °C during stimulation periods greatly augments not only the morphological responses but also the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, because this treatment prevents tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from rapid dephosphorylation by a yet unidentified protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s). We have evidence that activity of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) is tightly associated with RON (data not shown), although the site of interaction of RON with the phosphatase(s) is not known. It is possible that the F1330/1337 mutation enhances activity of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) by an unknown mechanism. Moreover, treatment with the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A, completely blocks the morphological changes observed in both wild-type RON-expressing or RON-F1330/F1337-expressing cells. The delicate balance between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific proteins plays an important role in MSP- or IL-3-induced morphological changes. pp90 consists of 4 subspecies, pp86, pp87, pp91, and pp94. pp86 is associated with βc in the unstimulated state. Upon stimulation with MSP or IL-3, pp87, pp91, and pp94 are tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with βc, and the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins correspond to those of tyrosine phosphorylation of βc. In addition, using sucrose density gradient fractionation analyses we found that pp90 was localized in the higher density lysate fractions at ∼400 kDa (data not shown), consistent with the results that pp90 can form a protein complex with βc. Treatment of cells with MSP relocates RON, βc, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to uropod-like structures where F-actin is redistributed and concentrated. These results suggest that phosphorylation of pp90 could control distribution and reorganization of actin filaments. Despite efforts to purify pp90, at present we are unable to immunoprecipitate pp90 with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, probably because phosphotyrosine residues are not exposed to the surface of the protein complex. Although we do not know that the migration of pp90 subspecies on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stems from one molecule having four different phosphorylation states or from four distinct molecules, identification of pp90 will help us more fully understand how activation of βc initiates morphological changes. Previous data with LyD9 IL-3-dependent pro-B cells, which ectopically express the IL-2 receptor, and FDC.P-1 IL-3-dependent hematopoietic precursor cells show that stimulation of the former with IL-3 or IL-2 and the latter with IL-3 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of an ∼90-kDa protein accompanied by early cell shape changes and later cell growth (42Sabe H. Kuno J. Kolomilas A. Saito Y. Kinashi T. Ueda M. Takamatsu T. Hamaguchi M. Kawakami T. Honjo T. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is possible that the IL-2 receptor, which associates with JAK1 and JAK3, also interacts with βc. Given that morphological change-related pp90 is induced in IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells, we hypothesize that a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein at ∼90 kDa seen in other IL-3-dependent LyD9 and FDC.P-1 cells is identical to pp90 seen in Ba/F3 cells. In conclusion, we have elucidated a novel IL-3 signaling pathway involving pp90, which associates with βc, and leading to morphological changes and subsequent cell migration. Our findings demonstrate that the signaling events of this pathway are distinct from those required for cell growth. Cell migration is accompanied by induction of morphological changes (43Bretscher M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 601-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To move through small openings in various tissues, cells must be able to change their shapes drastically. Because the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF each consist of a ligand-binding α chain associated with a common signal transducer βc chain (24Takaki S. Mita S. Kitamura T. Yonehara S. Yamaguchi N.

Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to predict that, in addition to IL-3 in immature hematopoietic cells, IL-5 and GM-CSF can induce pp90 required for morphological changes of eosinophils and neutrophils/macrophages, respectively. We are grateful to Drs. Michio Hagiya and Toyohiro Takehara (Toyobo Co. Ltd) and Dr. Tetsuo Sudo (Toray Industries, Inc) for generously providing MSP and IL-3."
https://openalex.org/W1979288060,"Abstract We previously reported that several stresses can induce cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant expression in a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent manner. In this study, we focused further on the regulation of NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB and the subsequent cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant induction in response to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and proteasome inhibitor I. Translocation of NF-κB into nuclei occurs by the phosphorylation, multi-ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα, a regulatory protein of NF-κB. Nascent IκBα began to degrade 5 min after treatment with IL-1β and disappeared completely after 15 min. However, IκBα returned to basal levels after 45–60 min. Interestingly, resynthesized IκBα was already phosphorylated at Ser-32. These results suggest that 1) the upstream signals are still activated, although the translocation of NF-κB peaks at 15 min; and 2) the regulated protein(s) acts downstream of IκBα phosphorylation. Western blotting showed that the resynthesized and phosphorylated IκB molecules were also upward-shifted by multi-ubiquitination in response to IL-1β treatment. On the other hand, ATP-dependent Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr cleaving activity transiently increased, peaked at 15 min, and then decreased to basal levels at 60 min. Furthermore, the cytosolic fraction that was stimulated by IL-1β for 15 min, but not for 0 and 60 min, could degrade phosphorylated and multi-ubiquitinated IκBα. These results indicate that the transient translocation of NF-κB in response to IL-1β may be partly dependent on transient proteasome activation."
https://openalex.org/W2041557058,"The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor was expressed in embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking the α subunits of Gq and G11 (Fq/11 cells) to determine whether G protein coupling is necessary for agonist-dependent receptor internalization. Neither TRH nor agonists acting on endogenous receptors increased intracellular calcium unless the cells were co-transfected with the α subunit of Gq. In contrast, temperature-dependent internalization of [3H]MeTRH in Fq/11 cells was the same whether Gqα was expressed or not. A rhodamine-labeled TRH analog and fluorescein-labeled transferrin co-localized in endocytic vesicles in Fq/11 cells, indicating that endocytosis took place via the normal clathrin pathway. Cotransfection with β-arrestin or V53D β-arrestin increased TRH-dependent receptor sequestration. Fq/11 cells were co-transfected with the TRH receptor and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-β-arrestin conjugate. GFP-β-arrestin was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of untreated cells and quickly translocated to the periphery of the cells when TRH was added. A truncated TRH receptor that lacks potential phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus signaled but did not internalize or cause membrane localization of GFP-β-arrestin. These results prove that calcium signaling by the TRH receptor requires coupling to a G protein in the Gq family, but TRH-dependent binding of β-arrestin and sequestration do not. The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor was expressed in embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking the α subunits of Gq and G11 (Fq/11 cells) to determine whether G protein coupling is necessary for agonist-dependent receptor internalization. Neither TRH nor agonists acting on endogenous receptors increased intracellular calcium unless the cells were co-transfected with the α subunit of Gq. In contrast, temperature-dependent internalization of [3H]MeTRH in Fq/11 cells was the same whether Gqα was expressed or not.

These results prove that calcium signaling by the TRH receptor requires coupling to a G protein in the Gq family, but TRH-dependent binding of β-arrestin and sequestration do not. Many G protein-coupled receptors undergo ligand-driven internalization through the clathrin pathway. Internalization or sequestration appears to modulate various aspects of signal transduction such as desensitization, resensitization, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (1Bohm S.K.

A fundamental question regarding internalization of G protein-coupled receptors is how the activated receptor is targeted to clathrin-coated pits in response to agonist binding. Recently, this question has been answered with the discovery that β-arrestin acts as an adaptor (4Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Downey W.E.R. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), and receptor phosphorylation is promoted by agonist binding, β-arrestin can discriminate between inactive and active receptors and target agonist-occupied receptors to clathrin-coated pits and the endocytic pathway. Most receptors coupled to G proteins in the Gq family are sequestered following the binding of an agonist but not an antagonist (8Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). There are exceptions to this generalization, however, because some Gq-coupled receptors do not internalize at all, others internalize only in some cell contexts (9Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar), and a few internalize when occupied by an antagonist (10Roettger B.F. Ghanekar D. Rao R. Toledo C. Yingling J. Pinon D. Miller L.J. Mol.

It is uncertain if coupling to Gq proteins is required for receptor phosphorylation, β-arrestin recognition of agonist-occupied receptor, or receptor internalization. Internalization of the receptor for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), 1The abbreviations used are: TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; Rhod-TRH, rhodamine TRH; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′,-tetraacetic acid which signals through Gq and G11 to activate phospholipase C, has been studied extensively (12Ashworth R.

The TRH receptor internalizes rapidly (t12 ∼ 2.5 min) through the clathrin pathway upon agonist binding (13Hinkle P.M. Shanshala III, E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When its cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail is deleted, the TRH receptor binds ligand with high affinity and stimulates phospholipase C but does not internalize, showing that coupling to Gq is not sufficient to cause internalization (15Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2389-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear whether coupling to Gq is necessary for receptor sequestration. Several investigators have approached this question by characterizing the internalization of mutant receptors using antibodies rather than hormones to promote internalization and blocking signal pathways pharmacologically (15Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol.

They have reached contradictory conclusions about whether receptor-G protein coupling is necessary for TRH receptor internalization. In this report, we have taken advantage of a fibroblast cell line that lacks Gq and G11 to examine directly the role of these G proteins in the internalization of TRH receptor (19Offermanns S.

The Fq/11 cells were derived from the embryos of mice in which the α subunits of both Gq and G11 had been knocked out by targeted gene disruption. Our results show that Gq or G11 is absolutely required for calcium signaling but not for coupling between the activated TRH receptor and β-arrestin or for receptor internalization.

Fq/11 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were passaged by trypsinization. Transfection of Fq/11 cells was achieved with LipofectAMINE PLUS according to the manufacturer's suggestions. In cotransfection assays, 1 μg of pCDM8mTRHR and 2 μg of pCMVGq or pRSVCAT were used. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were a gift from Dr. Dianqing Wu (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) and were cultured and transfected similarly. Ca2+ imaging was carried out as described (22Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To measure radioligand binding, cells in 35-mm dishes were incubated in Hank's buffered saline solution containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 5 nm[3H]MeTRH with or without a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled hormone. Dishes were then washed and incubated in ice-cold 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.8) for 1 min, and radioactivity in the acid wash (surface) and the cells (internalized) was quantified (13Hinkle P.M. Shanshala III, E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding data shown are typical of results in 2 to 4 independent experiments. Staining with Rhod-TRH and fluorescein-labeled transferrin (FITC-transferrin) was carried out as described (12Ashworth R. Yu R. Nelson E.J. Dermer S. Gershengorn M.C. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In colocalization experiments, cells were incubated in Hepes-buffered saline solution with 170 nm Rhod-TRH and 5 μg/ml fluorescein-labeled transferrin (FITC-transferrin) at 37 °C for 1 h. Control experiments, in which cells were stained with either Rhod-TRH or FITC-transferrin alone, showed that bleed-through was negligible. To examine translocation of the β-arrestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) conjugate (βarr2GFP), Fq/11 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCDM8mTRHR or pAd/CMVmTRHRC335STOP and 0.4 μg of pβarr2GFP/dish. About 24 h after transfection, cells were washed and incubated with Hepes-buffered saline solution at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm TRH for up to 20 min. Localization of βarr2GFP in live cells was followed microscopically with a 40× objective and a fluorescein filter. Microscopic results are typical of data obtained in 3 to 10 independent experiments. We transfected Fq/11 cells with cDNA encoding the TRH receptor and a 2-fold higher concentration of either a control plasmid or plasmid encoding Gqα and then measured the ability of various agonists to increase the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, in individual cells loaded with the Ca2+ reporter Fura-2. Following transfection with the TRH receptor alone, Fq/11 cells failed to respond to TRH or to a mixture of agonists acting on endogenous receptors (thrombin, endothelin, bombesin, and bradykinin) (Figs.1 and 2 and Table I). When transfected with the TRH receptor and the α subunit of Gq, a significant number of cells responded to TRH (15%) and to the mixture (11%) (Figs. 1 and 2and Table I). Subsequent experiments showed that bradykinin was responsible for most of the activity in the agonist mixture (Table I). TRH caused a consistently larger increase in [Ca2+]i than the mixture. Based on [3H]MeTRH binding, the number of TRH receptors expressed was within 50% of the same in cultures transfected with a control plasmid or plasmid encoding Gqα (data not shown). To determine whether intracellular Ca2+ stores were adequate in the nonresponsive cells, we added the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA to reduce extracellular Ca2+ to ∼4 nmand then added a low concentration of ionomycin to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores. All of the Fq/11 cells tested responded to ionomycin with a large increase in Ca2+except those cells that had previously responded to TRH, which had predictably smaller responses because their Ca2+ stores had been partially depleted.Figure 2Single-cell Ca2+ responses to agonists in Fq/11 cells. Fq/11 cells were transfected with either TRH receptor and control plasmid (A–D) or TRH receptor and Gqα (E–H) as described for Fig. 1. Shown are 340/380 fluorescence ratios in pseudocolor before treatment (A and E) and immediately after the addition of 1 μm TRH (B and F), 1.5 mm BAPTA (C and G), and 500 nm ionomycin (D and H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of [Ca 2+]i responses to agonists in transfected Fq/11 cellsCells responding/tested %Wild type TRH receptor + controlWild type TRH receptor + GqαC335STOP TRH receptor + GqαTRH0/113 (0%)20/133 (15%)3/17 (18%)Agonist cocktail0/72 (0%)3/27 (11%)NDBradykininND5/21 (24%)NDFq/11 cells were transfected as described in the legend of Fig. 1.

Data were derived from 4–6 experiments done in 2 days. ND, not determined. To determine whether internalization of the TRH receptor also requires G protein coupling, we measured sequestration of [3H]MeTRH to an acid/salt-resistant compartment in Fq/11 cells with and without transfection of Gqα. When Fq/11 cells were transfected with only the TRH receptor and then incubated with [3H]MeTRH at 37 °C, 32% of specifically bound hormone was acid/salt resistant, in comparison to only 12% when binding was performed at 0 °C (Fig.3). When cells were transfected with the receptor and Gqα, the extent of internalization was the same (Fig. 3). Internalization of [3H]MeTRH was unaffected by treatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that Gi and Go are not involved. We also transfected embryonic fibroblast cultures obtained from wild type mice of the same strain as the knockout mice (MEF cells) with the TRH receptor cDNA and followed [3H]MeTRH internalization. The wild type fibroblasts expressed TRH receptors at the same level as the Fq/11 cells, and they also internalized [3H]MeTRH by a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Because the TRH receptor normally internalizes in a clathrin-dependent manner, we compared internalization of FITC-transferrin, a classical marker for the coated pit pathway, and a bioactive, rhodamine-labeled TRH analog, Rhod-TRH, in Fq/11 cells. Rhod-TRH fluorescence in Fq/11 cells was dim, consistent with the low level of [3H]MeTRH binding. When Fq/11 cells were transfected with only the TRH receptor and incubated with Rhod-TRH at 0 °C, fluorescence was on the cell surface (Fig.4). Incubation with excess TRH blocked the membrane fluorescence, indicating that it was because of receptor-bound Rhod-TRH. When these cells were incubated with Rhod-TRH at 37 °C, Rhod-TRH was concentrated inside the cell, indicating that internalization of the liganded receptor had taken place. The bright specks that can be seen in all panels were associated with transfection reagents and were also seen in mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Internalization of FITC-transferrin was rapid and extensive, with nearly all the label in an endocytic compartment by 5 min (data not shown). Cells were also incubated simultaneously with Rhod-TRH (red) and FITC-transferrin (green) at 37 °C. There was extensive colocalization of the two labels, shown in yellow and orange (Fig.5). These findings all indicate that TRH drives internalization of its receptor via the normal coated pit pathway without G protein interaction.Figure 5Colocalization of rhodamine-labeled TRH and FITC-labeled transferrin. Fq/11 cells were transfected with TRH receptor and incubated with Rhod-TRH and FITC-transferrin at 37 °C for 1 h.

Cells transfected with the receptor and β-arrestin internalized more [3H]MeTRH (56%) than cells transfected with receptor alone (32%) (Fig.6), suggesting that β-arrestin was functioning as an adaptor in the absence of G protein coupling. A mutant β-arrestin, V53D, has been shown to act in a dominant negative manner in some settings but not in others. V53D β-arrestin increased internalization of [3H]MeTRH as effectively as wild type arrestin (Fig. 6). To determine whether G protein coupling is needed for β-arrestin binding, we transfected Fq/11 cells with the TRH receptor and a GFP-β-arrestin conjugate and followed the localization of GFP-β-arrestin before and after activating the receptor. GFP-β-arrestin was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of untreated cells (Fig. 7). Following the addition of TRH, GFP-β-arrestin quickly translocated to the periphery of the cells, suggesting that it bound to the agonist-occupied receptor in the absence of G protein interaction. Once translocated to the plasma membrane, much of the GFP-β-arrestin remained there for up to 1 h in the continued presence of TRH (data not shown). TRH did not cause translocation of GFP-β-arrestin in cells expressing a carboxyl-terminal-truncated TRH receptor (Fig. 7, also see below). Even at a concentration of 10 nm, TRH rapidly and effectively translocated GFP-β-arrestin (Fig. 8). The cells shown in Figs. 7 and 8 were fairly dim. In cells with bright GFP fluorescence, translocation was not as evident, presumably because the bright cells expressed more GFP-β-arrestin, and the proportion translocated in response to TRH was small. We never observed translocation of GFP-β-arrestin to the membrane following activation of the endogenous bradykinin receptor (Fig. 8). We have found that agonist mixtures activating endogenous receptors in transfected 293 cells or GH3 cells do not cause translocation of GFP-β-arrestin, although they cause [Ca2+]i responses comparable with those evoked by TRH. 2R. Yu and P. M. Hinkle, unpublished observations.These results suggest that the TRH receptor is more effective than most in translocating GFP-β-arrestin.Figure 8Effect of bradykinin and low dose TRH on GFP-β-arrestin localization. Fq/11 cells were transfected with GFP-β-arrestin conjugate and TRH receptor. Shown are images of transfected cells before treatment (A), 1 min after the addition of 1 μm bradykinin (B), and 1 min after the subsequent addition of 10 nm TRH (C). GFP-β-arrestin translocation was not observed in any cell after bradykinin treatment. GFP-β-arrestin translocation was observed in independent experiments where 10 nm TRH was added alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also evaluated the effect of a TRH antagonist, chlordiazepoxide, on GFP-β-arrestin localization. Chlordiazepoxide (10 μm) did not cause translocation of GFP-β-arrestin by itself but blocked GFP-β-arrestin translocation initiated by a low dose of TRH, 10 nm (Fig. 9). When added at 10 μm, TRH overcame the effect of the antagonist and caused GFP-β-arrestin to move to the membrane. The K dvalues of TRH and chlordiazepoxide for the TRH receptor are ∼10 nm and 3 μm, respectively. β-Arrestin is believed to bind more tightly to phosphorylated receptors (6Goodman Jr., O.B.

We therefore transfected cells with GFP-β-arrestin and a truncated form of the TRH receptor (C335 STOP) that lacks these potential phosphorylation sites. The truncated receptor was expressed and capable of transducing a signal, because TRH increased [Ca2+]i if Gqα was cotransfected with the C335STOP receptor (TableI). Activation of the truncated TRH receptor with TRH did not cause GFP-β-arrestin to move to the membrane, however (Fig. 7). Because it has been suggested that a receptor-β-arrestin complex can signal directly to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), we asked whether TRH can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase in Fq/11 cells expressing the TRH receptor with and without Gqα. We did not detect significant TRH effects on the abundance of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases on Western blots using cells that had been serum-starved for 24 h and treated with 1 μm TRH for up to 20 min, regardless of expression of Gqα. Because background mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was high and TRH receptor levels were low, these results do not rule out the possibility that TRH activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway weakly in transfected Fq/11 cells, but any response must be very small. Previous studies have led to contradictory conclusions concerning the requirement for G proteins in the sequestration of G protein-coupled receptors coupled to the Gq family (15Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol.

By using cells lacking the α subunits of Gq and G11, we have obtained definitive evidence that the TRH receptor undergoes agonist-dependent sequestration in the absence of its normal signal transducers, Gq and G11. It is improbable that the receptor internalized as a result of coupling to some other G protein. Although the TRH receptor has been reported to exert effects on ion channels via Giand Go (26Gollasch M. Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The TRH receptor has been reported to couple to phospholipase C via Gs in oocytes (29de la Pena P. del Camino D. Pardo L.A. Dominguez P. Barros F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but neither TRH nor bradykinin evoked any calcium response in Fq/11 cells unless the cells were transfected with Gqα. The TRH receptor was not overexpressed in mouse fibroblasts. Assuming that 15% of Fq/11 cells expressed receptors, because 15% of the cells exhibited a calcium response to TRH when Gqα was co-transfected, we calculate that there were no more than 30,000 TRH binding sites/cell. This is below the level in pituitary cells (at least 50,000) and well below the levels in other transfected cell models (HEK, COS, HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary, C6) (16Yu R. Hinkle P.M. Mol.

They also suggested that Gqα and the TRH receptor internalize in the same vesicles. Milligan and co-workers (32Drmota T. Novotny J. Kim G.D. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Svoboda P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21699-21707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) find that TRH down-regulates Gqα and causes an increased accumulation of Gqα in endocytic vesicles, but they do not think that the receptor and Gq cointernalize because of large discrepancies in the half-times for receptor and Gqα internalization. Our results prove that Gq/11 is not needed for internalization but do not establish whether the receptor co-internalizes with Gq/11when the appropriate G protein is available. Gershengorn and co-workers (18Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1105-1111PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that G protein coupling and phospholipase C activation are both necessary for TRH receptor sequestration, because the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 inhibits sequestration and several mutant receptors that bind TRH with high affinity but do not activate phospholipase C fail to internalize (18Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1105-1111PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative interpretation is that mutants unable to activate phospholipase C do not internalize because they do not assume the activated conformation necessary for interaction with receptor kinases or β-arrestin as well as G protein. U73122 exerts multiple effects on calcium homeostasis and other processes (33Hildebrandt J.P. Plant T.D. Meves H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Muto Y. Nagao T. Urushidani T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1379-1388PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jan C.R. Ho C.M. Wu S.N. Tseng C.J. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and may have impaired TRH-driven internalization by a nonspecific action. Uncertainty regarding the requirement for Gq coupling is not limited to the TRH receptor, because U73122 inhibits the internalization of muscarinic receptors (25Thompson A.K. Mostafapour S.P. Denlinger L.C. Bleasdale J.E. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23856-23862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequestration of bombesin receptors has been reported to require G protein interaction (24Benya R.V. Akeson M. Mrozinski J. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 495-501PubMed Google Scholar). It was not previously known whether receptors needed to couple to Gq either to promote an activated receptor conformation or to promote phosphorylation by receptor kinases to bind β-arrestin. Our results, which show that GFP-β-arrestin moves to the membrane in response to TRH in Fq/11 cells, confirm the role of β-arrestin in TRH receptor sequestration and prove that the process does not require G protein interaction. By demonstrating that GFP-β-arrestin does not bind to the carboxyl-terminal-truncated C335STOP receptor, we have established the molecular basis for its failure to internalize. These results suggest that phosphorylation sites between Thr-342 and Ser-391 are important for β-arrestin binding and receptor sequestration. Although β-arrestin appears to be involved in the internalization of most G protein-coupled receptors, there are exceptions, including the Gq-coupled M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors (36Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The maximal extent of TRH receptor sequestration was relatively low in the Fq/11 cells and in wild type mouse fibroblasts, below 40%, whereas the extent of internalization is above 80% when the receptor is expressed in HEK293, HeLa, or C6 cells (16Yu R. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1105-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRH receptor sequestration in Fq/11 cells was increased by overexpression of β-arrestin. Because the extent of internalization correlates with the level of expression of β-arrestin and receptor kinases in a number of cell lines (37Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it seems likely that β-arrestin was expressed at low levels in the Fq/11 cells. The failure of the V53D mutant β-arrestin to act as a dominant negative is not completely surprising, because the dominant negative effect is only partial for the β2-adrenergic receptor (5Ferguson S.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Previous work had shown that internalization of Gs- and Gi/Go-coupled receptors can occur without G protein involvement. The β2-adrenergic receptor can internalize in cyc− and unc S49 cells (with absent or nonfunctional Gsα, respectively) (38Clark R.B. Friedman J. Prashad N. Ruoho A.E. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphor. Res. 1985; 10: 97-119PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mahan L.C. Koachman A.M. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and at least some Gi/Go-coupled receptors can internalize normally in pertussis toxin-treated cells (40Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have now shown that β-arrestin binding and internalization of Gq-coupled receptors can also occur in the absence of G protein coupling. β-Arrestin apparently discriminates between the agonist-activated and the inactive TRH receptor either by recognizing the active conformation of the receptor or by recognizing a protein that interacts with the activated receptor. Further work will be required to establish the molecular basis of this process."

A carboxyl-terminal fragment of Agouti protein, Ser73-Cys131, is sufficient for melanocortin receptor antagonism, but Western blot analysis of skin extracts reveals that the electrophoretic mobility of native Agouti protein corresponds to the mature full-length form, His23-Cys131. To investigate the potential role of the amino-terminal residues, we compared the function of full-length and carboxyl-terminal fragments of Agrp and Agouti protein in a sensitive bioassay based on pigment dispersion in Xenopusmelanophores. We find that carboxyl-terminal Agouti protein, and all forms of Agrp tested, act solely by competitive antagonism of melanocortin action. However, full-length Agouti protein acts by an additional mechanism that is time- and temperature-dependent, depresses maximal levels of pigment dispersion, and is therefore likely to be mediated by receptor down-regulation. Apparent down-regulation is not observed for a mixture of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments. We propose that the phenotypic effects of Agouti in vivo represent a bipartite mechanism: competitive antagonism of agonist binding by the carboxyl-terminal portion of Agouti protein and down-regulation of melanocortin receptor signaling by an unknown mechanism that requires residues in the amino terminus of the Agouti protein.

Studies of the mouse coat color Agouti gene have led to the identification of a novel pair of secreted signaling molecules which regulate mammalian pigmentation and body weight.Agouti encodes a 131-amino acid secreted protein that is expressed in the skin, where it induces the production of yellow pigment (pheomelanin) in hair follicle melanocytes (Refs. 1Miller M.W.

Agouti protein is secreted but has a small sphere of action; its localized expression is thought to give rise to characteristic white or yellow markings found in many different mammals such as chinchillas and the Doberman breed of domestic dogs (Ref. 5Millar S.E.

In agreement with this model, Agouti protein and α-MSH inhibit the binding of each other to the Mc1r (17Lu D.S. Willard D. Patel I.R. Kadwell S. Overton L. Kost T. Luther M. Chen W.B. Woychik R.P.

Additional findings, however, have suggested that Agouti protein and possibly Agrp inhibit melanocortin receptor signaling by mechanisms besides simple competitive antagonism of α-MSH binding (26Sakai C.

Using a sensitive bioassay based on α-MSH-induced pigment dispersion in Xenopus melanophores, we have previously shown that inhibition of melanocortin signaling by Agouti protein is increased significantly by preincubating melanophores in Agouti protein for several hours prior to the addition of α-MSH (25Ollmann M.M. Lamoreux M.L. Wilson B.D. Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that Agouti protein induces melanocortin receptor down-regulation in addition to its ability to inhibit α-MSH binding. Our previous studies utilized a full-length (His23-Cys131) recombinant form of Agouti protein generated in a baculovirus expression system (11Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Yang Y.K. Kerns J.A. Chen Y. Gantz I. Barsh G.S. Science. 1997; 278: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the related cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal domains of Agouti protein and Agrp are sufficient for competitive antagonism inXenopus melanophores. However, the amino-terminal residues of Agouti protein are required for additional effects likely due to down-regulation of melanocortin receptor signaling. To investigate whether Agouti protein was proteolytically cleaved to smaller formsin vivo, extracts of skin were examined by Western blot analysis using antisera that detected epitopes in both the amino and carboxyl termini. We found little, if any, post-translational proteolysis of full-length (His23-Cys131) Agouti protein. These findings demonstrate that Agouti protein alters melanocortin signaling by two mechanisms mediated by distinct domains within the native protein. Production and characterization of recombinant mouse Agouti protein and Agrp using the baculovirus system has been previously described (11Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Yang Y.K. Kerns J.A. Chen Y. Gantz I. Barsh G.S. Science. 1997; 278: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 25Ollmann M.M. Lamoreux M.L. Wilson B.D. Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In brief, cation followed by anion exchange chromatography resolves mouse Agouti protein to >99% purity as determined by analysis of silver-stained PAGE, mass spectroscopy, and amino-terminal sequencing. Blue-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by anion exchange chromatography resolves multiple forms of Agrp into two pools. One pool contains form A, a single species processed by signal peptidase cleavage after residue 20, in an approximately equimolar ratio with form B, a mixture of three species processed by cleavage after residues 46, 48, or 50, present in a 15:1:4 ratio, respectively. The second pool contains form C, a mixture of two species processed by cleavage after residues 69 or 71, present in a 1:4 ratio, respectively. Relative purity of Agrp preparations was estimated by scanning densitometry of a 10-μg sample loaded on a 10% Tricine gel stained with ProBlue (Integrated Separation Systems, MA) and was used to calculate 60% purity for forms A+B and 20% purity for form C. Polyclonal antibodies to full-length (His23-Cys131) mouse Agouti were generated in rabbits by standard procedures (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1998Google Scholar); 100–200 μg of protein at approximately 90% purity was used for each of five injections; antisera were recovered at day 70. Following SDS-PAGE carried out under nonreducing conditions and Western blotting, the antiserum detects 1 ng/lane of the immunogen against which it was raised, as well as 1 ng/lane carboxyl-terminal (Ser73-Cys131) Agouti protein. Disulfide bond reduction of the antigen prior to SDS-PAGE slightly reduces sensitivity of the antiserum for detection of the full-length protein (<2-fold) but reduces sensitivity for detection of the carboxyl-terminal fragment by more than 100-fold. These findings suggest that the antiserum contains multiple antibodies: one or more directed at an epitope in the amino terminus and one or more that recognize an epitope in the cysteine-rich carboxyl terminus that requires proper disulfide bonding. Sections of dorsal and ventral skin from 3-day oldat/at mice were homogenized in ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) or high salt buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 750 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine) using a ground glass homogenizer. Following homogenization, samples were centrifuged in a microfuge for 25 min at 4 °C. Samples in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer and a portion of the high salt extracts were added to an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, boiled 5–10 min, and kept on ice. To concentrate and partially purify Agouti protein by cation exchange, 1 ml of each high salt buffer extract was added to 9 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, to bring the final [NaCl] to 75 mm. The diluted samples were rocked with 50 μl of a cation exchange resin (SP-Sepharose FF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed in batch mode with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine and eluted with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 750 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA. Eluates were added to an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and loaded on an 18% polyacrylamide gel. Transfer and incubation with primary antisera at 1:1000 dilution were carried out according to standard methods (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1998Google Scholar). Secondary immunodetection was accomplished with a goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5 mg of recombinant mouse Agouti protein was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and incubated at 30 °C for 6 h with 5000 units/mg Kex-2 protease (38Brenner C.

A. 1992; 89: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. Michael Kay, Stanford University Department of Biochemistry. To resolve the products of cleavage, the sample was loaded at 800 μl/min onto a 1-ml HiTrap SP cation exchange column, washed with 5 ml of 50 mm Bicine, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl and then eluted with a 20-ml NaCl gradient (100–600 mm) in 50 mm Bicine, pH 9.0. Fractions (500 μl) were tested in the melanophore assay for α-MSH-inhibitory activity at a 1:200 dilution, and two peaks of activity were found to correspond to residual uncleaved full-length protein and the Ser73-Cys131 fragment at >99% purity. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed into 20 mmPIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, flash frozen, and stored at −70 °C. The data shown utilized a preparation of carboxyl-terminal Agouti protein that was made by cleaving a full-length hemagglutinin-tagged Agouti protein (25Ollmann M.M. Lamoreux M.L. Wilson B.D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (the hemagglutinin tag was inserted in the amino terminus of the Agouti protein and is therefore not present in the Ser73-Cys131 fragment). Identical results were observed using a preparation of carboxyl-terminal Agouti protein made from recombinant Agouti protein His23-Cys131. To test the effects of the amino terminus in trans, a mixture of His23-Arg70 or Arg72 and Ser73-Cys131 was made by digesting recombinant mouse Agouti protein (99% purity) with Kex-2 as above. SDS-PAGE, mass spectroscopy, and amino-terminal sequencing revealed the presence of equimolar amounts of His23-Arg70 or Arg72 and Ser73-Cys131, along with a minor amount (<2% of total protein) of uncut full-length Agouti protein. Xenopus melanophores were grown at 27 °C in 50% L-15 medium (Specialty Media, Lavallete, NJ), supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin; the medium had been previously conditioned using Xenopus fibroblasts as described by Potenza and Lerner (48Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. Pigment Cell. Res. 1992; 5: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pigment dispersion assay developed by Potenza and Lerner (48Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. Pigment Cell. Res. 1992; 5: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is based on the ability of agents that cause a decrease or increase in intracellular cAMP levels to produce a dose-dependent aggregation or dispersion, respectively, of intracellular pigment granules. Because pigment granules are neither fully aggregated nor dispersed in the absence of any drug, pretreatment of the cells with melatonin to aggregate pigment granules increases the range and sensitivity of the assay for detecting agents such as α-MSH that disperse pigment granules. For a typical assay, cells were plated 24–48 h beforehand in 96-well plates at 25,000 cells/well, washed briefly with 250 μl/well assay buffer (70% L-15 medium; 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and 40 μl/well assay buffer was then added, followed by 40 μl/well assay buffer that contained 2 nm melatonin (Sigma) to provide a final melatonin concentration of 1 nm. After a 45-min incubation to aggregate pigment granules, the optical density of each well was measured at 650 nm (ODinitial) to provide a base-line optical density reading. Test samples (Agouti protein, Agrp, or control buffer) were then added at 40 μl/well, followed by the addition of various concentrations of α-MSH or NDP-MSH at 40 μl/well. All additions were made in assay buffer supplemented with 1 nmmelatonin to maintain a constant concentration of melatonin during the assay. Optical density at 650 nm was then determined at multiple time points from 30 to 420 min (ODfinal). Unless stated otherwise, the entire assay was carried out at 22 °C in triplicate, and assay points represent the mean ± S.E. of the mean. A unitless parameter, degree of pigment dispersion, was calculated as described by Potenza and Lerner (48Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. Pigment Cell. Res. 1992; 5: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), (ODfinal − ODinitial)/ODfinal, which creates an internal standard for each well (ODinitial) and scales the maximal degree of pigment dispersion to 1. The effects of 1 mmmelatonin occasionally increase during the course of the assay, which gives rise to negative values for the degree of pigment dispersion. Optical density at 650 nm melanophores was measured with aV max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) in end point mode, and data were transferred electronically to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for analysis. Graphing and curve fitting of dose-response curves were carried out with DeltaGraph (DeltaPoint, Monterey, CA), using a four-parameter logistic equation, y = a + ((b −a)/(1 + (10 c/10 x) d)); where a = minimum, b = maximum,c = half-maximal value, and d = slope. Dose ratios (the amount of α-MSH required for half-maximal response in the presence of Agouti protein/amount of α-MSH required for half-maximal response in the absence of Agouti protein) were determined using the four-parameter logistic equation described above. Within each experiment, individual slopes of the α-MSH dose-response curves were not significantly different and therefore were fixed at the average slope to provide the data for dose-ratio calculations. Schild plots [log(dose ratio − 1)] versuslog([Ser73-Cys131Agouti or Agrp]) were created and analyzed in DeltaGraph (DeltaPoint, Monterey, CA). Linear curve fitting was used to determine the slope and the correlation coefficient. To estimate KB, a second linear curve fitting was performed with the slope fixed at 1. The similar genomic structure of Agouti andAgrp suggests evolution from a common ancestral gene, yet the sequence similarity of the two proteins is confined entirely to the carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1). Twenty-one of the final forty-seven residues in Agouti protein and Agrp are identical, of which ten residues are cysteines in a spacing similar to that found in conotoxins and plectoxins from the venoms of cone snails (34Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Scott J.K. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22067-22070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spiders (35Quistad G.B. Skinner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11098-11101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, the amino terminus of the Agouti protein contains several paired basic residues that could serve as potential proteolytic cleavage sites (Fig.1 A). These observations suggested that the Agouti protein might be processed in vivo into an active fragment spanning the cysteine-rich region. In support of this hypothesis, proteolytic fragments containing the carboxyl terminus of either protein retain α-MSH-inhibitory activity (11Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Yang Y.K. Kerns J.A. Chen Y.

Recombinant mouse Agouti protein produced in insect cells is secreted as a mature form with the signal sequence removed (His23-Cys131) (17Lu D.S. Willard D. Patel I.R. Kadwell S. Overton L. Kost T.

Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, recombinant proteins secreted by insect cells may undergo altered or incomplete post-translational processing (41Wang W. Yum L. Beinfeld M.C. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 1295-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 42Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the active form of Agouti protein in mouse skin underwent proteolytic cleavage in vivo, we raised polyclonal antibodies against full-length recombinant mouse Agouti protein (His23-Cys131). Western blotting experiments determined that the antiserum detects epitopes in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Agouti protein with a sensitivity of <1 ng/lane provided that SDS-PAGE was carried out under nonreducing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). We used the anti-Agouti antiserum on nonreducing Western blots of dorsal and ventral skin extracts from 3-day-old black and tan (at/at) mice. These animals expressAgouti transcripts in ventral, but not in dorsal skin (43Vrieling H. Duhl D.M. Millar S.E. Miller K.A. Barsh G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), providing a control for antiserum specificity. As shown in Fig.2, Agouti protein is detected in ventral, but not dorsal, at/at skin extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 or a buffer containing 750 mm NaCl. In addition, we concentrated and partially purified Agouti protein from the 750 mm NaCl extracts using a cation exchange resin known to bind either full-length Agouti protein or the Ser73-Cys131 carboxyl-terminal fragment (25Ollmann M.M. Lamoreux M.L. Wilson B.D. Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Agouti protein extracted from mouse skin has a mobility of 21.5 kDa on a nonreducing gel, similar to that of the full-length (His23-Cys131) recombinant form. The intensity of the 21.5-kDa band and the lack of any smaller fragments demonstrates that the full-length form predominates in mouse skin and indicates that Agouti protein undergoes little, if any, proteolytic processingin vivo after cleavage of the signal sequence. To investigate the potential function of the amino terminus of the Agouti protein, we used the Xenopusmelanophore pigment dispersion assay to compare the activity of full-length Agouti protein and a carboxyl-terminal Agouti protein fragment. We produced a carboxyl-terminal fragment, Ser73-Cys131, by treating recombinant Agouti protein with Kex-2, a protease that cleaves specifically after paired Lys-Arg residues (39Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two such sites are present at residues 69 and 70 and at 71 and 72 (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of Agouti protein with Kex-2 produces a 48- or 50-residue amino-terminal fragment, His23-Arg70 or Arg72, and a 59-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment, Ser73-Cys131, that comigrate at 7.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE carried out under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B). Cation exchange chromatography resolved the carboxyl-terminal fragment at >99% purity (determined by amino-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry) from both the amino-terminal fragment and a small amount of uncleaved full-length protein. Like full-length Agouti protein, the carboxyl-terminal fragment inhibits α-MSH-induced pigment dispersion in Xenopusmelanophores but has no effect in the absence of α-MSH or other melanocortin peptides (data not shown). By analyzing the effect of the two Agouti peptides on melanocortin receptor signaling over time, however, we discovered a difference in their activities. Addition of α-MSH to melanophores causes a rapid increase in pigment dispersion that reaches equilibrium in 15–30 min. When full-length Agouti protein is added simultaneously or immediately prior to α-MSH, a gradual inhibition of pigment dispersion ensues that increases for several hours (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, under the same conditions, the carboxyl-"

To understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling rod-specific expression, the abundant Xenopusrod arrestin cDNA and a partial genomic clone, containing the immediate upstream region and amino terminus of the polypeptide, have been characterized. The deduced polypeptide has ∼69% identity to other vertebrate rod arrestins. Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction of intronic sequences demonstrated multiple alleles for rod arrestin. DNase I footprinting with retinal proteins revealed four major DNA binding sites in the proximal promoter, coinciding with consensus sequences reported in mammalian promoters. Purified bovineCrx homeodomain and mouse Nrl proteins protected a number of these sites. A dual approach of transient embryo transfections and transgenesis was used to locate transcriptional control sequences essential for rod-specific expression inXenopus. Constructs containing −1287/+113 of 5′ upstream sequence with or without intron 1 directed high level expression, specifically in rods. A construct containing only −287/+113 directed expression of green fluorescent protein solely in rod cells.

This association prevents additional interaction between rhodopsin and transducin, effectively terminating the response. The regulatory role of arrestin has been highlighted by arrestin knock-out mice, which exhibit prolonged rod photoresponses (22Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Arrestin also appears to be critical for recycling of the light-exposed rhodopsin in Drosophila (23Ranganathan R. Stevens C.F. Cell. 1995; 81: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Kiselev A. Subramanian S. Science. 1994; 266: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, a frameshift mutation in the human arrestin gene causes Oguchi's disease, which is characterized by slowed dark adaptation and reduced sensitivity (25Fuchs S. Nakazawa M. Maw M. Tamai M. Oguchi Y. Gal A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of visual arrestins is restricted to a few cell types. For example, mouse rod arrestin is found predominantly in the retinal photoreceptor layer and pinealocytes (18Breitman M.L. Tsuda M. Usukura J. Kikuchi T. Zucconi A. Khoo W. Shinohara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15505-15510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas rat cone arrestin was found in cone photoreceptors and pinealocytes (10Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. Weichmann A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4613-4619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InXenopus, arrestin expression has been detected in photoreceptors and pinealocytes (26Korf B. Rollag M.D. Korf H.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The onset of rod arrestin gene transcription in mouse occurs before rod outer segment formation (27Bowes C. van Veen T. Farber D. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 369-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas in the bovine retina, arrestin expression is concurrent with other genes involved in phototransduction (28Timmers M.A. Newton B.R. Hauswirth W.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transcription of arrestin also appears to be regulated by diurnal or circadian rhythms in certain species (29Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. Donoso L.A. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was screened using a 1.6-kbp EcoRI fragment of bovine rod arrestin, BSC 70 (5Shinohara T. Dietzschold B. Craft C.M. Wistow G. Early J.J. Donoso L.A. Horwitz J. Tao R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6975-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Positive plaques were purified and characterized by restriction and sequence analysis (46, Sequenase Ver 2.0; U. S. Biochemical Corp). Using antisense primers: 5′-ggatccaccaagaacaactc-3′ and P2, 5′-ttgcccaggtacacgct-3′, RACE PCR (47Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4313) Google Scholar) was carried out on retinal poly(A)+ RNA. Sequences from two independent RACE clones were determined on both strands. A Xenopus genomic library (a gift of E. deRobertis, UCLA) was screened using a radiolabeled 748-bpSmaI-KpnI cDNA fragment (Probe 1, Fig. 1). Positive plaques were isolated, purified, and restriction-mapped according to standard protocols (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).BamHI subclones were characterized, and 1.3 kbp of upstream and 3.5 kbp of intron I sequence were obtained on both strands using an automated ABI stretch DNA sequencer (DNA services, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). DNA sequences were assembled and analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package (GCG9, Madison, WI). Multiple sequence alignments were performed on both DNA and amino acid sequence files using the GCG program, PILEUP. The resulting alignments were used to run PAUP*4.0 (Phylogeny Analysis Using Parsimony (49Swofford D. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, Version 4.0. Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar)) implemented in GCG. A PAUP heuristic search with bootstrap option (100 bootstrap samples) was performed to find a majority rule consensus unrooted tree. Total RNA from adult male Xenopusretina, brain, liver, and olfactory bulbs were isolated by the acid-guanidinium method (50Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62888) Google Scholar), and poly (A)+ RNA was isolated using an oligo(dT) column. Poly(A)+ (0.2 μg) or total RNA (10 μg) was resolved by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. After transfer, the blot was hybridized to the radiolabeled SmaI-KpnI cDNA fragment (Probe 1, Fig. 1). The blot was washed at a final stringency of 1 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 0.18 m NaCl. 10 mm NaPi, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7) and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Primer extension reactions were carried out at 50 °C for 1 h using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 15 μg of total RNA with 0.5 pmol of radiolabeled 5′-ctgagatccagtaaggtaacccgttagc-3′. As a control, RNA was omitted from the reaction. The products were resolved on 8% acrylamide gels and exposed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A fragment encoding nucleotides 178 to 720 of the cDNA was cloned into the EcoRV sites in pBSII (Stratagene). The plasmid was linearized with HindIII to generate the antisense probe using T7 RNA polymerase.XbaI-linearized plasmid was used with SP6 polymerase to generate the sense probe. Sense and antisense probes were synthesized using a digoxigenin labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). Hybridization to 10-μm paraffin sections was carried out as described previously (51Green C.B. Besharse J.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2420-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the hybridized probe was detected immunocytochemically using an antidigoxigenin and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody (Roche). Slides were visualized and photographed using a Zeiss Photomicroscope III. Southern analysis was performed as described previously (43Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The blot was hybridized using a32P-labeled BamHI-AvaI fragment (Probe 2, Fig. 1), and final washes were performed at 62 °C in 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 mNaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS. The blot was exposed using a PhosphorImager. To amplify intron 2, PCR was carried out using exon-specific primers P2 and forward primer 5′-tgtcatgtataagaaaacc-3′ as described previously (43Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) except that 30 cycles of annealing (58 °C), extension (72 °C for 2 min), and denaturation (95 °C for 1 min) were performed. Nuclear proteins were extracted from adult Xenopus retina as described (52Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase-tagged bovine Crx homeodomain and flanking region (residues 34–107, GST-CrxHD) and a hexahistidine-tagged mouse Nrl (residues 16–237, His-Nrl) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (35Chen S. Wang Q.-L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 53Kerppola T. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). 32P end-labeled DNA fragments (−256/+25) were produced by PCR and footprinting reactions were carried out as described (35Chen S. Wang Q.-L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Poly(dI-dC) was included only in the reactions containing retinal extracts. Varying concentrations of purified protein (as indicated in the Fig. 4 legend) were used in the footprinting reaction. The arrestin reporter constructs generated for promoter analysis contained upstream, exon, and intron 1 sequences. For clarity, upstream and exon sequences are numbered relative to transcription start site, + and −, respectively, whereas intron 1 sequences (nucleotides 1417–4741 inAF053942) are numbered from the 5′ splice donor nucleotide without −/+. XAR1 (−1287/+130, in 1/3324, +131/+155), containing the 5′ portion of the arrestin gene, was assembled in pBSII (Stratagene) from a 4.3-kbp PstI-XbaI fragment and a 450-bpXbaI-HindIII, fragment generated by PCR. The PCR fragment was sequenced after cloning. The 4.8-kbp XAR1 fragment was transferred into either pGL2 (Promega Corp) or pEGFP(−) (45Knox B. Schlueter C. Sanger B. Green C. Besharse J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 243: 117-121Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to generate pXAR1luc or pXAR1gfp respectively. pXAR2luc (−2600/+130, in 1/1383) was constructed by ligating a 4.0-kbp BamHI fragment into the BglII site of pGL2. To prepare plasmids containing intronic fragments, a 2.8-kbp BamHI fragment was first cloned into pBSII. The 5′ end of this clone, XAR3luc (in 1383/2896) was cloned into pGL2 using KpnI from the multicloning site andXbaI. XAR3gfp was cloned as a KpnI andXbaI (filled in) fragment into the KpnI andBamHI (filled in) sites of pEGFP(−). pXAR4luc (in 1732/2896) was generated by removing the 350-bp 5′ end atNcoI from pXAR3luc and recircularization of the blunted ends. XAR5 (−1287/+113) was cloned as an EcoRI fragment into pBSII. This fragment from cloned using KpnI andXbaI from the multicloning site into theKpnI-NheI sites of pGL2, generating pXAR5luc. pXAR5gfp was generated by directly cloning the 1.4-kbp EcoRI fragment into pEGFP(−). XAR6 (+113/+130, in 1/1325) was generated by ligating an EcoRI fragment into pBSII and cloned usingKpnI and XbaI from the multicloning site into theKpnI-NheI sites of pGL2 to generate pXAR6luc. pXAR6gfp was generated by cloning the 1.3-kbp EcoRI fragment into pEGFP(−). pXAR7luc (−287/+113) was constructed by digesting pXAR5luc with KpnI and NheI, blunting with Klenow, and religation. pXAR7gfp (−289/+113) was generated by digestion of pXAR5gfp with HindIII and NheI, filling with DNA polymerase, and religation. The orientation of the inserts and junctions of all the constructs were verified by sequencing. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen protocol (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Xenopus embryos were transfected as described previously (43Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that 10 μg of DNA was mixed with 30 μl of DOTAP (Roche) before transfection. Protein extracts from transfected heads or trunks were prepared in 80–100 μl of lysis buffer, and duplicate aliquots of 10-μl each (equivalent to one head or trunk) were assayed for luciferase activity. Groups of 8–10 heads were transfected and assayed for luciferase activity, and 4–6 independent groups (indicated as N in the Fig. 5legend) were used for determining average activities. Statistical comparisons were performed using ANOVA (Excel). Average activities were expressed as relative light units/embryo, where 1 pg of purified luciferase gave 8.5–9.0 × 104 relative light units measured using a single-channel luminometer (Berthold) for 30 s. Protein determinations were performed using the Coomassie dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). Arrestin GFP plasmids were linearized using XhoI and transgenic Xenopus laevis embryos were produced as described (45Knox B. Schlueter C. Sanger B. Green C. Besharse J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 243: 117-121Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). GFP-positive transgenic tadpoles were fixed overnight in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen sections (10–15-μm thickness) were prepared, and confocal images were obtained using a slit-scanner instrument (Meridian Insight). The figures were produced using Photoshop (Adobe). An adultXenopus retinal cDNA library (43Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was screened using a 1.6-kbp bovine rod arrestin cDNA fragment (5Shinohara T. Dietzschold B. Craft C.M. Wistow G. Early J.J. Donoso L.A. Horwitz J. Tao R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6975-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The sequence obtained from three partial overlapping cDNA clones (Fig.1) exhibited 69% homology at the nucleotide level to bovine rod arrestin cDNA. The longest clone (Xarr10) contained 1835 nucleotides coding for amino acids 6–396 and the entire 3′-UTR. The 5′ end of the cDNA was obtained by RACE, which had 2 changes compared with the corresponding sequence (236 bp) from the genomic region (see below), probably reflecting errors introduced during PCR. The lengths and sequence of the 5′ UTR ofXenopus rod arrestin exhibited no homology to the mammalian arrestins; in fact, it was significantly shorter than both mouse and human (130 compared with 358 and 387 bp, respectively). The full-length transcript (1978 bp) encodes a predicted polypeptide of 396 amino acids. Comparison of this sequence with other arrestins revealed a high degree of similarity with rod arrestins from other vertebrates (3Tsuda M. Syed M. Whelan J.P. McGinnis J.F. Shinohara T. Gene. 1988; 73: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Yamaki K. Takahashi Y. Sakuragi S. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Takeuchi Y. Komori N. Kobayashi H. Sakai Y. Hotta Y. Matsumoto H. Science. 1990; 248: 483-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Smith D.P. Shieh B.H. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) exhibited more divergence (40% identity and 60% similarity). The Xenopus rod arrestin polypeptide was most closely related to amphibian rod arrestin (6Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Smith W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) fromRana pipiens (86.1% identity and 92.4% similarity) andRana catesbiana (86.1% identity and 92.6% similarity). In contrast, comparison with sequences from Xenopus cone arrestin (11Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) revealed only 54.7% identity (75.5% similarity) at the amino acid level. Comparison of the Xenopus polypeptide with cone arrestin sequences from other vertebrates showed an overall identity of only 50–55%. Phylogenetic analysis (using maximum parsimony analysis, data not shown) clearly places thisXenopus sequence with the rod arrestin group. To obtain the potential promoter regions of Xenopus rod arrestin, a genomic library was screened, and one clone (gXArrA, Fig. 1) containing a 6.5-kbp sequence upstream of the cDNA, was partially sequenced. Exon 1 (+1/+130), 2 (+131/+224), and 3 (+225/+285) were identical to the cDNA (except at two positions in the RACE product, see above). Like other mammalian arrestins, the 5′-UTR of theXenopus mRNA was encoded by exons 1 and 2, with the translation initiation codon in exon 2. Although exon 1 exhibited significant variation in size amongst various species, exon 2 sizes were quite similar (94 versus 105 bp in mouse and human). In addition, exons 3 and 4 of Xenopus rod arrestin showed conservation of splice junctions (data not shown). Two major primer extension products, differing by one nucleotide, were obtained with retinal RNA, whereas no products were found using brain RNA (Fig.2 A). The shorter of the two corresponds to that obtained by RACE PCR, and the 5′-most nucleotide (T) was designated as +1. A minor doublet at +3 and +4 may reflect products from minor start sites, incomplete primer extension products because of secondary structure at the 5′ end, or expression from additional alleles (see below). The presence of multiple start sites has been reported for a number of arrestin genes including human (56Yamaki K. Tsuda M. Kikuchi T. Chen K.H. Huang K.P. Shinohara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20757-20762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed a single retina-specific band of 1.9 kbp (Fig. 2 B). No cross-reactivity was observed in RNA from brain, liver, or olfactory bulb under high or low stringency conditions. These results are in contrast to a previous report that detected rod arrestin transcripts in brain and testes RNA in addition to the retina (11Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus"
https://openalex.org/W2048486638,"Prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) (EC1.14.99.1) expression was examined in human thyroid tissue and in KAT-50, a well differentiated human thyroid epithelial cell line. PGHS-1 is found constitutively expressed in most healthy tissues, whereas PGHS-2 is highly inducible and currently thought to be expressed, with few exceptions, only in diseased tissues. Surprisingly, PGHS-2 mRNA and protein were easily detected in normal thyroid tissue. KAT-50 cells express high levels of constitutive PGHS-2 mRNA and protein under basal culture conditions. Compounds usually associated with PGHS-2 induction, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and serum transiently down-regulated PGHS-2 expression. Human PGHS-2 promoter constructs (−1840/+123 and −831/+123) fused to a luciferase reporter and transfected into untreated KAT-50 cells exhibited substantial activity. NS-398, a highly selective inhibitor of PGHS-2 could inhibit substantial basal prostaglandin E2 production. Exogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist or IL-1α neutralizing antibodies could attenuate constitutive PGHS-2 expression in KAT-50 cells, suggesting that endogenous IL-1α synthesis was driving PGHS-2 expression. Our findings suggest that normal thyroid epithelium expresses high constitutive levels of PGHS-2 in situ andin vitro and this enzyme is active in the generation of prostaglandin E2. Thus, unprovoked PGHS-2 expression might be considerably more widespread in healthy tissues than is currently believed.

Thus, unprovoked PGHS-2 expression might be considerably more widespread in healthy tissues than is currently believed. The human thyroid is a frequent site for the occurrence of inflammatory and neoplastic disease. Much of the inflammation found in this gland appears to be autoimmune, and the common processes include Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (1Davies T.F. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 525-536Google Scholar). Thyroid immunity has been the subject of substantial investigation because of the high incidence of these autoimmune diseases in the general population. Despite the particular susceptibility exhibited by thyroid to inflammation, little insight currently exists into the molecular basis for the peculiarities associated with thyroidal immunity. The currently undefined role of arachidonate metabolites in the normal regulation of thyroid growth and function, and in the mediation of thyroid disease, is of potential importance. Cyclooxygenases, also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs) 1The abbreviations used are: PGHS, prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IL, interleukin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; kb, kilobase pair(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (EC 1.14.99.1) are a family of two bifunctional enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonate to prostaglandins (2Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). PGHSs are heavily glycosylated and contain heme prosthetic groups. They are membrane-associated, rate-limiting enzymes, each with two discrete, active sites catalyzing both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase steps in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin G2 is generated from arachidonate, and then it is converted to prostaglandin H2. The two PGHS isoforms are encoded by distinct human genes and localize to different human chromosomes, and yet they have protein x-ray crystallographic structures that are remarkably similar (3Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme that is found at high levels of abundance in most tissues and cells in culture (4Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A.

The levels of PGHS-1 expression are relatively invariant with respect to tissue involvement in disease or cytokine and mitogen action. It is the enzymatic activity attributable to PGHS-1 that is currently thought to contribute predominantly to basal PGE2 production in healthy tissues and to maintain the integrity of renal and enteric epithelium (2Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). In contrast, PGHS-2, the inflammatory cyclooxygenase, is ordinarily not expressed in most tissues in states of health but can be massively up-regulated by cytokines, growth factors, tumor promoters, and serum in many cell types (7Hla T.

Nüsing R.M. Fritz P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The pattern of cellular distribution of PGHS-1 and -2 differs (17Morita I. Schindler M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two enzymes might utilize discrete pools of arachidonate and participate in different metabolic pathways. The question of why two distinct but very similar enzymes might be co-expressed by the same cell has not been answered, but PGHS-1 and -2 are thought to function, at least in part, independently (2Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). PGE2 production associated with the inflammatory response is currently believed to emanate primarily from the activity of PGHS-2. Moreover, the decrease observed in prostaglandin production in vivo and in vitro following glucocorticoid treatment is attributable to the down-regulation of PGHS-2 expression (9Kujubu D.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7991-7994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Zweifel B. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For instance, in rat brain, the greatest constitutive PGHS-2 expression is associated with the hippocampus, the pyramidal cells of the piriform cortex, the amygdala, and neurons in the neocortex (19Yamagata K.

The macula densa of the kidney was found to express substantial levels of PGHS-2 under physiological conditions (21Harris R.C. McKanna J.A. Akai Y. Jacobson H.R. DuBois R.N. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2504-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Unprovoked PGHS-2 has also been detected in bronchial epithelium (22Asano K. Lilly C.M. Drazen J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L126-L131PubMed Google Scholar) and in granulosa (23Narko K. Ritvos O. Ristamäki A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3638-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), pancreatic islet (24Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and hepatic stellate cells (25Gallois C. Habib A. Tao J. Moulin S. Maclouf J. Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23183-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The function of PGHS-2 expressed in nonpathological states is uncertain but opens the possibility that the biological role of this cyclooxygenase isoform is not limited to the mediation of inflammatory responses. Thus, the current categorization of cyclooxygenases as representing a purely housekeeping enzyme (PGHS-1) on the one hand, and a protein expressed exclusively in disease (PGHS-2) on the other, may fail to embrace the apparent complexities of the prostanoid biosynthetic machinery. Very little is currently known about the expression of PGHS isoforms or the production of prostanoids and other eicosanoids in the human thyroid. The biosynthesis and action of lipid mediators in thyroid tissue may be complex because multiple cell types normally reside or are recruited there in states of disease. We have reported recently that human thyroid fibroblasts can synthesize PGE2 and that the production of this prostanoid is up-regulated by cytokines such as IL-1β (26Smith T.J. Sempowski G.D. Berenson C.S. Cao H.J. Wang H.-S. Phipps R.P. Endocrinol. 1997; 138: 5576-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have postulated that fibroblasts, by virtue of their diverse array of small molecule expression, represent potentially important orchestrators of the early events in tissue remodeling (27Smith R.S. Smith T.J. Blieden T.M. Phipps R.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 317-322PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to thyroid epithelial cells, recent studies have suggested that the proliferation-promoting actions of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, as assessed in the FRTL-5 rat thyrocyte line, are mediated through activation of phospholipase A2 and arachidonate release and can be attenuated with indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor (28Atwa M.A. Smallridge R.C. Burch H.B. Gist I.D. Lu R. Abo-Hashem E.M. El-Kannishy M.H. Burman K.D. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Di Paola R. Menzaghi C. De Filippis V. Corda D. Di Cerbo A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 670-673PubMed Google Scholar). Although the results of these studies imply that cyclooxgenase products are involved in the growth-stimulating effects of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin on rat thyrocytes in vitro, the expression of specific PGHS isoforms has not been examined previously. In the present study, we assessed the expression of both PGHS-1 and -2 proteins by immunohistochemical means in situ in thin tissue sections from a wide spectrum of thyroid disease. We report here the unexpectedly high level of PGHS-2 protein expression in thyroid follicular epithelium, both in normal tissue and in that involved in or adjacent to disease. In addition, PGHS expression and activity were assessed in an established, well differentiated human thyrocyte cell line, KAT-50 (30Venkataraman G.M. Yatin M. Ain K.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, KAT-50 cells express very high constitutive levels of PGHS-2 mRNA and protein in culture and produce PGE2. A substantial fraction of the PGE2 generating activity in untreated KAT-50 cells can be attenuated with dexamethasone or NS-398, a highly selective inhibitor of PGHS-2 (31Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Thus, we present compelling evidence that thyroid epithelium expresses PGHS-2 at high levels both in vivo andin vitro and that this expression is constitutive and thus may play an important role in normal thyroid function and immunity, as well as in the pathogenesis of disease. NS-398 as well as anti-PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). IL-1β was obtained from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA), and dexamethasone (1,4 pregnadien-9-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17α,21-triol-3,20-dione), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 cDNA plasmids were gifts from Dr. Donald Young (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). Plasmids containing fragments of the human PGHS-2 promoter were generously provided by Dr. Stephen M. Prescott (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Plasmid −1800pGL2 contained −1840/+123, and plasmid −800pGL2 contained the sequence −831/+123. pSV-β-galactosidase was a gift of Dr. Brian Wilcox (Albany Medical College) and was used as a transfection efficiency control. pGL2 Basic and pGL2 Promoter were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-IL-1α and IL-1β antibodies were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was a gift from Amgen (Boulder, CO). Luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured with a Dual-Light kit from Tropix. Human thyroid, abdominal adipose, and orbital connective tissues were obtained from surgical waste. These activities have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Albany Medical College. Thyroid tissue obtained from reactive and neoplastic cases (37 total) was examined for the expression of PGHS-2 protein. These cases included nodular hyperplasia (8 cases), chronic thyroiditis (5 cases), diffuse hyperplasia of Graves' disease (5 cases), follicular adenoma (8 cases), follicular carcinoma (3 cases), papillary carcinoma (3 cases), and medullary carcinoma (5 cases). In addition, at least one case from each of these categories was also stained for PGHS-1. Five-μm-thick sections were cut from formalin-fixed thyroid tissue that had been embedded in paraffin and were applied to glass slides. After routine deparaffination and rehydration, tissue sections were incubated in APK wash solution (Ventana Medical Systems, Tuscon, AZ). Sections were placed in the reaction chamber of a Ventana ES automated immunohistochemistry system, which uses an indirect biotin-avidin detection method. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1% H2O2. Sections were then incubated with primary anti-human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 antibodies (Cayman) at a dilution of 1:100 for 24 min at 41 °C. Following washes, sections were incubated with a biotinylated secondary anti-mouse antibody, supplied by Ventana, for 8 min at 41 °C. Isotype-matched antibodies were used as a negative control. KAT-50 cells were a generous gift from Dr. K. Ain, University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY) (30Venkataraman G.M. Yatin M. Ain K.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They were maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C covered with Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. These cells have been characterized as expressing, among other thyroid markers, thyroglobulin mRNA and the sodium/iodine symporter and were supplied to us in January 1997 at passage 8 (30Venkataraman G.M. Yatin M. Ain K.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged with gentle trypsin/EDTA treatment and were utilized between the 10th and 35th passage. Medium was changed every 3–4 days. Human orbital fibroblasts were obtained from explants of surgical waste emanating from individuals with severe thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. Fibroblasts were cultivated as described previously (32Smith T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and antibiotics. They were used between the 2nd and 12th passages. Relative levels of the cyclooxgenase proteins in thyroid and control tissues, fibroblasts, and KAT-50 cells were determined by Western immunoblot analysis utilizing monoclonal antibodies generated against human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 and obtained from Cayman. Confluent cultures, usually cultivated in 60-mm-diameter plates, were shifted to 1% FBS for 48 h. Monolayers were washed and harvested, and cellular protein was solubilized in an ice-cold buffer containing 15 mmCHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were taken up in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) were incubated with the membranes for 2 h at room temperature and the membranes were then washed extensively and reincubated with secondary, peroxidase-labeled antibodies for 2 h. Following washes, the ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection system was used to generate the specific signals. Resulting bands were quantitated densitometrically with a BioImage (Milligen) scanner. Total cellular RNA was extracted using a method published by Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from thyroid and control tissues or from near-confluent 100-mm-diameter plastic plates of KAT-50 cells that had been incubated without or with the test compounds indicated in the figure legends. Following extensive rinsing with PBS, monolayers were covered with a solution containing guanidium isothiocyanate (ULTRASPEC RNA isolation systems, Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX), and RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by addition of isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol, and solubilized in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Equal amounts of RNA (usually 10–20 μg) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred to Zetaprobe (Bio-Rad). The integrity of the electrophoresed RNA was verified by UV inspection following ethidium bromide staining. [32P]dCTP random-primed (Bio-Rad) PGHS probes were hybridized in a buffer containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 1% SDS, and 0.25 mg/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C overnight. Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions and exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at −70 °C. To normalize the amounts of RNA transferred, either membranes were stripped according to the manufacturer's instructions or the radioactivity was allowed to decay and the RNA was rehybridized with a radiolabeled human GAPDH cDNA probe. Radioactive DNA/RNA hybrids were quantitated by subjecting autoradiographs to densitometric analysis. For the PGHS-2 mRNA stability studies, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB) (20 μg/ml), an inhibitor of gene transcription, was added to the culture medium for the time intervals marked in Fig. 8, and the abundance of steady-state PGHS-2 mRNA was quantitated with Northern blot hybridization. The PGHS-2 mRNA signals were normalized to their respective GAPDH signals. Data from two separate, identical experiments were combined, and the normalized results were subjected to a polynomial curve fit program (Delta Graph) using the least-squares method to generate the curve shown in Fig. 8. To calculate thet12 for PGHS-2 mRNA, the densitometric values were modeled assuming first order decline employing the ADAPT II program described by D'Argenio and Schumitzky (34D'Argenio D.Z. Schumitzky A. ADAPT II: A program for Simulation, Identification and Optimal Experimental Design: User Manual. Los Angeles Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California, Los Angeles1992Google Scholar). Those values that were undetectable were coded as midway between the limit of detection and zero in the analysis. KAT-50 cells were allowed to proliferate to a state of 60–80% confluence in 6-well plates covered with medium containing 10% FBS, and then monolayers were incubated with 1% FBS-enriched medium for 24 h. Transfections were performed using Cellfectin (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids utilized for these studies included −1800pGL2, containing −1840/+123 and −800pGL2 containing −831/+123, and are thus 5 base pairs upstream from the ATG of the human PGHS-2 promoter (35Yang X. Hou F. Taylor L. Polgar P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Appleby S.B. Ristimäki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These were fused upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Control plasmid pGL2 was used to determine the basal level of luciferase activity exhibited by these cells and pGL2 Promoter to compare the strength of the PGHS-2 promoter to that of the SV40 promoter. pSV40-β-galactosidase was used as a transfection efficiency control. 10 μl of Cellfectin was added to 100 μl of serum-free medium without antibiotics, and the suspension was mixed gently with the DNA, either the test plasmid (0.36 nm) or pGL2 (0.36 nm) together with pSV-β-galactosidase (0.4 μg). Complexes were allowed to form over 15 min at room temperature before being added to the washed monolayers. Cultures were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and then the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Cultures were incubated for 24 h, cell monolayers were washed in PBS, and 1× reporter lysis buffer (Tropix) was added for 15 min at room temperature. The extract was vortexed and frozen at −80 °C. Samples were thawed and assessed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in a LUMI-VETTE luminometer (CHRONO-LOG). The luciferase activities were corrected for their respective β-galactosidase levels and therefore reflect relative transfection efficiency. PGE2 levels were determined as described previously (14Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22718-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) utilizing a radioimmunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, KAT-50 cells were inoculated in 24-well plates covered with medium supplemented with 10% FBS. One day prior to experimental manipulation, culture wells were shifted to medium with 1% FBS, and the following day, the test compounds indicated in the legends to the figures were added. Thirty min prior to monolayer harvest, medium was removed and replaced with 150 μl of PBS with the respective additives. Following the incubation, the PBS was removed quantitatively and subjected to the assay for PGE2following the manufacturer's instructions. These studies were conducted with three separate plates per treatment group. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate cultures from representative experiments. Details concerning these studies have been published previously (15Cao H.J. Wang H.-S. Zhang Y. Lin H.-Y. Phipps R.P. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29615-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, KAT-50 cells were allowed to proliferate to near confluence in 24-well plastic culture plates covered with medium containing 10% FBS. Monolayers were then shifted to medium with 1% FBS for 16–24 h, and then test compounds were added at the times indicated in the figure legends. Medium was removed, monolayers were washed with PBS, and cellular material was harvested in a buffer containing 15 mm CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cellular proteins (5 or 10 μg) were subjected to specific ELISAs for IL-1α and IL-1β using kits from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). These assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate culture wells. Data are usually expressed as the mean ± S.E. of replicate determinations unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance was determined by Student'st-test. Sections of thyroid tissue, obtained from surgical thyroidectomies performed as therapy for a wide variety of diseases, were examined for PGHS protein expression by immunohistochemical staining using isoform-discriminatory monoclonal antibodies directed at either PGHS-1 or PGHS-2. As the photomicrographs in Fig. 1 demonstrate, staining with either PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 antibodies yielded very similar patterns. Both enzymes are expressed abundantly in most follicular epithelial cells in each of the cases examined. In addition, both antibodies labeled vascular media, peripheral nerve, and some lymphoid cells. In contrast, other stromal elements failed to stain with either antibody. The epithelium exhibited diffuse, largely cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, in lesional cells and normal elements adjacent to the lesions or in separate blocks of nonlesional tissue. The intensity of staining was generally moderate to strong and correlated with the cytoplasmic volume rather than the presence or absence of disease. Little or no nonspecific background staining was observed in sections stained with isotype-matched controls (Fig. 1, middle left panel). We next determined whether PGHS-2 mRNA could be detected in thyroid tissue. As the Northern blot in Fig.2 A indicates, a predominant 4.8-kb transcript is easily detected in total cellular RNA samples from normal thyroid tissue, remote from any disease process. PGHS-1 mRNA is also found in high abundance in these same samples as a single 5.2-kb band. Using Western blotting, PGHS-1 and -2 protein were also detected in thyroid tissue from three different cases. (Fig.2 B). As the figure demonstrates, normal tissue from multinodular goiter (patients 1 and 3) and Graves' disease (patient 2) all express easily detectable levels of both isoenzymes. The levels of the enzyme in the sample from the patient with Graves' disease are somewhat lower than that found in the normal tissue from the two multinodular glands. PGHS-1 appears as a 68-kDa protein band, whereas PGHS-2 migrates to 72 kDa, consistent with our findings in human fibroblasts (14Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22718-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to the abundant PGHS-2 mRNA and protein signals observed in thyroid tissue, normal intestinal fat failed to express PGHS-2 mRNA on Northern analysis (Fig.2 C), and fat and normal striated muscle failed to exhibit PGHS-2 protein on Western blots (Fig. 2 D). Thus, it would appear that both PGHS-1 and -2 mRNA and protein are abundantly expressed in normal and pathological thyroid tissue, and this expression localizes to epithelial cells. The recent reports of human thyroid epithelial cell lines being isolated and characterized should facilitate studies concerning thyroid growth and function. One of these, KAT-50, derived from the non-neoplastic goiter of a young child, expresses thyroglobulin and the sodium-iodine symporter (30Venkataraman G.M. Yatin M. Ain K.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have determined that these cells express high levels of thyrotropin receptor mRNA. 2T. J.

FeMo-co consists of Mo, Fe, and S atoms in a 1:7:9 ratio; in addition, the organic acid homocitrate is an integral component of the compound (6Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2768-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), serving as a nonprotein ligand to the molybdenum atom. The structure of FeMo-co in the protein was determined by Kim and Rees (7Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and Chan et al. (8Chan M.K. Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 260: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have revealed that functional copies of thenifB, nifN, nifE,nifH, and nifV genes are required for synthesis of FeMo-co in vivo (9Roberts G.P. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 210-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Filler W.A. Kemp R.M. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A. Smith B.E. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThenifKD genes, which encode the subunits of dinitrogenase (NifKD), are not required for FeMo-co synthesis, and thus FeMo-co is not synthesized “in place” but rather is preformed and then transferred to its site in dinitrogenase (13Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of NifKD, completed FeMo-co accumulates on a protein called gamma, which serves as a chaperone/insertase for the maturation of NifKD and for insertion of FeMo-co (14Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system was devised to address the biochemical roles of these genes and to identify other factors required for FeMo-co synthesis (15Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this system, at least homocitrate, molybdenum (supplied as molybdate), MgATP, NifB-co, NifH (dinitrogenase reductase), reductant, and NifNE are required to achieve FeMo-co synthesis. Each of these components is available in a purified form, but when they are added together, very little FeMo-co synthesis is observed, suggesting that additional factor(s), yet to be discovered, are required. Previous studies have shown that NifB-co contains iron and sulfur (16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Purified, 55Fe- and 35S-labeled NifB-co has been shown to bind to NifNE in the absence of other factors, and the label can be shown to accumulate on the gamma protein and in dinitrogenase (17Allen R.M.

The entry point of molybdenum into the pathway of FeMo-co synthesis has not been established. Pienkos and Brill (19Pienkos P.T. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 743-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used99MoO42− to study the incorporation of molybdenum in A. vinelandiicells in vivo. They observed the accumulation of molybdenum in a non-nif protein that they termed the molybdenum storage protein (Mo-Sto) and in the dinitrogenase protein in vivo. Ugalde et al. (13Ugalde R.A.

The accumulation of99Mo on dinitrogenase and on possible precursors duringin vitro FeMo-co synthesis was investigated by Hooveret al. (3Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Liang J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3647-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using various homologs of homocitrate in the synthesis system. In this study, the incorporation of 99Mo into protein-bound precursors of FeMo-co during in vitro FeMo-co synthesis was investigated. In vitro FeMo-co synthesis mixtures containing extracts and cofactors were mixed with99MoO42− under anoxic conditions and following incubation to allow FeMo-co synthesis; the mixtures were electrophoresed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands containing 99Mo were detected by phosphorimage analysis. Where possible, 99Mo-labeled protein bands were identified by co-migration with purified proteins known to be involved in FeMo-co synthesis and by reaction with antibodies against those known proteins on immunoblots. A list of theAzotobacter vinelandii mutant strains used in this study is presented in Table I. In order to avoid dilution of the 99Mo with nonradiolabeled molybdenum, allA. vinelandii strains in this work (except as specified) were grown and derepressed in medium containing tungsten in place of molybdenum as described previously (15Shah V.K.

Nine-ml serum vials were flushed with purified argon and rinsed with anoxic, 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1.7 mm sodium dithionite (DTH). Complete FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixtures (defined below) were prepared by combining the following: 100 μl of anoxic 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (containing 1.7 mm DTH, 10 μl of 10 μm Na2MoO4, 20 μl of 5 mm homocitrate (which had been treated with base to cleave the lactone, pH 8.0)) and 200 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mmMgCl2, 51 mm phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm DTH in 25 mmTris-HCl; pH of the mixture was 7.4). These mixtures were incubated anoxically at room temperature for 10–15 min. Two hundred μl of the appropriate A. vinelandii cell-free extract, 10 μl of a solution containing an excess of NifB-co as Fe and S donor for FeMo-co (16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 0.1 mg of purified dinitrogenase reductase (10 μl) were added to the reaction mixtures. One-half μCi (carrier free) of Na299MoO4 (10 μl) (Nordion, Ontario, Canada) prepared in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1.7 mm DTH was then added to the reaction. The total volume of each assay mixture was 560 μl. The vials were incubated in a rotary water-bath shaker at 30 °C for 30 min to allow time for FeMo-co synthesis and its subsequent insertion into apodinitrogenase. After this incubation (designated the “incubation phase” of the assay), samples to be applied onto native polyacrylamide gels were placed on ice until loading. To demonstrate that all components of the assay were functional, the synthesis of FeMo-co was monitored in duplicate vials using the acetylene reduction assay (17Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W.

Demonstration that a significant portion of the apodinitrogenase molecules present in the assay are activated by binding of newly synthesized FeMo-co was accomplished by demonstrating that acetylene reduction activity of the mixture was comparable to mixtures to which an excess of purified FeMo-co was added. In vitro synthesis reactions in which all components known to be required for FeMo-co synthesis are present, in addition to apodinitrogenase, will be referred to as a “complete reaction.” Components are supplied in extracts or in purified form, as indicated. Although FeMo-co synthesis does not require the presence of apodinitrogense, acetylene reduction activity resulting from the activation of apodinitrogenase is used to monitor FeMo-co synthesis. Reactions that utilized extracts of mutants lacking specific gene products required for FeMo-co synthesis are referred to by the known component that is excluded. For example, if all known components required for FeMo-co synthesis are present except NifNE, the reaction will be referred to as “−NifNE.” If this reaction also lacks apodinitrogenase, it will then be referred to as “−NifNE, −apodinitrogenase.” The purified in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction included NifNE, NifH, homocitrate, Na299MoO4, MgATP, DTH, and NifB-co. No apodinitrogenase was included in the experiments that employed the purified system; therefore, no label was detected at the position of dinitrogenase in those gels. FeMo-co was purified as described by Shah and Brill (2Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).

Dinitrogenase reductase protein from Clostridium pasteurianum was a gift from Dr. Lance Seefeldt. Antibodies against various proteins were prepared at the UW antibody facility. When 99Mo-labeled molybdate is supplied to extracts capable of FeMo-co synthesis, two proteins become prominently labeled (Fig. 2, lane 2). These are the dinitrogenase protein and the molybdenum storage protein (Fig. 2, Mo-Sto). Mo-Sto was previously shown to accumulate99Mo in vivo and the protein was purified by Pienkos and Brill (19Pienkos P.T. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 743-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mo-Sto is not co-regulated with nitrogenase, and the protein purified as an α2β2tetramer of 21 and 24 kDa subunits with approximately 15 Mo atoms/tetramer, although the Mo content of the protein decreased during purification. The protein labeled as Mo-Sto in Fig. 2 and elsewhere is proposed to be the same protein based on its accumulation of Mo, its position of migration on nondenaturing gels, and its expression in NH4+-grown cells. Based on its size and on results presented here, Mo-Sto would not appear to be the periplasmic molybdate-binding protein, ModA, or the molybdate-binding regulatory protein, ModE (24Mouncey N.J. Mitchenall L.A. Pau R.N. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Maupin-Furlow J.A. Rosentel J.K. Lee J.H. Deppenmeier U. Gunsalus R.P. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4851-4856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mo-Sto is soluble, and thus it is not likely to be the product of the modB, modC, or modD genes, which encode the membrane-bound molybdate transport system that has been described in A. vinelandiiand Escherichia coli. Previously, it had been shown that Mo-Sto was99Mo-labeled during in vitro FeMo-co synthesis, and studies here expand that observation to show that either ATP or ADP is required for accumulation of 99Mo on Mo-Sto (Fig. 2) (26Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleotide, label does not accumulate on any protein observed by phosphorimage. At this point, it is unknown whether the nucleotide is required to allow MoO42− to bind to Mo-Sto or if it is required to allow the removal of nonradioactive species (MoO42− or WO42−) already bound to the protein, thereby making sites for binding of99MoO42− available. Previous studies showed that 185W accumulated in185WO42−-grown cells on a protein that copurified with Mo-Sto (19Pienkos P.T. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 743-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts used in experiments reported here were prepared from cells grown in the absence of Na2MoO4 and the presence of Na2WO4 to prevent the accumulation of molybdenum-containing intermediates in the FeMo-co synthetic pathway. Thus, it is possible that nucleotide is required to allow unlabeled W species to vacate sites for99MoO42−. This question will be addressed in future studies. Previous studies have shown that ATP is required for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co and for the insertion of FeMo-co. Results in Fig. 2 show that ATP (Fig. 2, lane 2), but not ADP (Fig. 2, lane 3), will support synthesis of FeMo-co when all other required factors are present. In the absence of nucleotide, 99Mo does not accumulate on any protein band and when ADP is supplied, Mo-Sto becomes labeled, but Mo does not enter the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway. Thus, the requirement for nucleotide does not represent merely a requirement for label to pass through Mo-Sto, as that protein can be labeled in the presence of ADP. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, 99Mo accumulates on the protein identified as the dinitrogenase protein when a complete in vitro FeMo-co synthesis mixture was used. This band has been identified as dinitrogenase by comigration with purified dinitrogenase detected by cross reaction with anti-dinitrogenase antibodies. The amount of Mo incorporated into FeMo-co and inserted into dinitrogenase in a typical complete reaction mixture (for example, Fig. 3, lane 1) was estimated to be approximately 1.2 atoms of Mo per molecule of dinitrogenase. The amount of dinitrogenase present was estimated by quantitation of the protein band on immunoblots compared with the standards of known quantity of purified dinitrogenase. The amount of Mo incorporated was estimated from the known specific activity of 99Mo in the reaction mixture and the quantitation of the amount of radioactivity in the band by comparison with known amounts of 99Mo blotted on a piece of filter paper. ImageQuant (Applied Biosystems) software was used in the measurement. Furthermore, an assay equivalent to that shown in Fig. 3,lane 1, exhibits > 80% of the acetylene reduction activity of a mixture to which an excess of purified FeMo-co is added (e.g. Fig. 3, lane 6). When one or more components of the FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture are left out of the assay, 99Mo does not accumulate on dinitrogenase, and acetylene reduction activity is not observed. As noted above, ATP is also essential for label to appear in the dinitrogenase band (Fig. 2). When any of the following are eliminated from the reaction mixture, accumulation of 99Mo on dinitrogenase is not observed: NifNE (Fig. 3, lane 4), NifB-co (Fig. 3, lane 5), and NifH (Fig. 3, lane 7). Furthermore, when an extract ofnif-repressed (NH4+-grown), wild type A. vinelandii is used in the assay, only Mo-Sto is observed to accumulate 99Mo, and neither dinitrogenase nor any other protein is labeled. Finally, if the assay is saturated with unlabeled FeMo-co, 99Mo does not accumulate on dinitrogenase (Fig. 3, lane 6); this indicates that all the sites for FeMo-co on dinitrogenase are occupied and any99Mo-labeled FeMo-co that is synthesized accumulates elsewhere. In the reaction mix used for Fig. 3, lane 6, the label accumulates on gamma protein and on an unidentified band (band B). The migration of gamma protein at this position has been established by comigration with purified gamma protein and by cross reaction with anti-gamma protein antibodies. When homocitrate is left out of the reaction mixture, label fails to accumulate as completed FeMo-co on gamma protein (Fig. 3, lane 8; in this reaction, both homocitrate and apodinitrogenase were left out of the mix). This result suggests that only completed FeMo-co is capable of being stably bound to gamma protein. It is surprising that no 99Mo is detectable on NifNE in these experiments. From previous studies, it is known that NifNE migrates a little faster than dinitrogenase in the gel system employed here (17Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is known that purified NifNE and NifNE in an in vitro FeMo-co synthesis mixture will bind NifB-co and that no additional factors are required for NifNE to bind NifB-co (17Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 55Fe-labeled NifB-co is known to donate Fe atoms to FeMo-co (17Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A significant degree of sequence similarity is observed between nifNE andnifKD, and the cysteine residue that serves as the ligand to FeMo-co in dinitrogenase is conserved in the deduced sequence of NifNE (27Brigle K.E. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Gene. 1985; 37: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus it has been proposed that NifNE is the scaffold upon which FeMo-co is completed. The results presented here do not support that hypothesis, as 99Mo is not observed at the position of the NifNE band under any conditions. If Mo did bind to NifNE, accumulation of 99Mo on NifNE might have been expected in a mixture in which a component that performed a step in FeMo-co synthesis subsequent to NifNE was omitted from the reaction mixture; no reaction mixture lacking a single component of the assay mixture resulted in accumulation of 99Mo on NifNE (Fig. 3). Furthermore, binding of NifB-co to NifNE is not inhibited by FeMo-co (17Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is very important to note that only those complexes of proteins with99Mo that are sufficiently stable to remain intact during electrophoresis will be observed with the approach employed here. Therefore, it is possible that Mo does enter the pathway at the NifNE step but that the resulting intermediate is not stable during electrophoresis. Our working hypothesis is that Mo enters the FeMo-co synthesis pathway at a step subsequent to NifNE. The gamma protein serves as a chaperone/insertase for the maturation of apodinitrogenase and the insertion of FeMo-co (14Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was first observed as a protein that co-purified with apodinitrogenase fromnifB mutants (5Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3515-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has shown that gamma protein is associated with the nifKD gene products in extracts of nifB mutants. Gamma protein becomes associated with apodinitrogenase in the presence of NifH and MgATP (apodinitrogenase from nifH mutants accumulates as an α2β2 tetramer of nifK andnifD gene products) and is required for the insertion of FeMo-co (28Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free gamma protein exists as a dimer and binds purified FeMo-co in the absence of any additional factors; upon binding FeMo-co, gamma dimers dissociate into monomeric gamma:FeMo-co units (14Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In thein vitro FeMo-co synthesis system, 99Mo accumulates at the position of the gamma protein in a system that includes all components required for FeMo-co synthesis, but lacks the apodinitrogenase (Fig. 3, lane 2). When the apodinitrogenase is available, most of the label accumulates on dinitrogenase as a result of insertion of completed FeMo-co into the apodinitrogenase. In these experiments, the position of gamma protein with FeMo-co bound was confirmed by co-electrophoresis with purified material.99Mo is not observed at the position of the gamma protein if NifNE, NifB-co, NifH, ATP, or homocitrate is excluded from the reaction mixture (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 5, 7, and 8; Fig. 2, lane 1). Because purified gamma protein will bind FeMo-co, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the label accumulating at the position of gamma protein represents completed FeMo-co bound to gamma protein. It is possible that the label represents an immature form of FeMo-co bound to gamma protein, but there are no data to suggest that hypothesis. Accumulation of99Mo on gamma protein does not occur when an extract ofnif-repressed, wild type A. vinelandii is used in the assay (Fig. 3, lane 3) even though that extract contains gamma protein; expression of gamma protein is not co-regulated with thenif regulon (14Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the accumulation of 99Mo on the gamma protein requires products of the nif regulon that perform known steps of FeMo-co synthesis. Note that the assay with the NH4+-grown extract did contain added ATP, homocitrate and NifB-co; these plus the gamma protein are not sufficient to allow accumulation of 99Mo on any protein in the extract other than Mo-Sto. When excess, unlabeled FeMo-co is added to the complete FeMo-co synthesis mixture, a decreased amount of99Mo is observed on gamma protein (Fig. 3, lane 6), indicating that most of the sites are occupied by the added FeMo-co. NifH (dinitrogenase reductase) plays several roles in nitrogen fixation. In addition to serving as the unique electron donor to dinitrogenase for N2 reduction, NifH is required for both FeMo-co synthesis and insertion (10Filler W.A. Kemp R.M. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A. Smith B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Robinson A.C. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14327-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of NifH, no 99Mo accumulates on any protein other than Mo-Sto in the in vitroFeMo-co synthesis system (Fig. 3, lane 7); thus, Mo does not appear to enter the FeMo-co synthesis pathway in the absence of NifH. In the gel system employed here, NifH migrates in the region of the protein bands labeled C and D in Fig. 3. At this time, it is not possible to state definitively that one or the other of these 99Mo-labeled bands contains NifH. Identification of the proteins forming bands C and D will require at least partial purification of the labeled proteins, and this is being pursued at this time. It is interesting that a 55Fe-labeled band is observed in the same region of the gel as bands C and D when55Fe-labeled NifB-co is used in the in vitrosystem (i.e. lanes 2 and 5 of Fig. 3 of Ref. 17Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Like bands C and D, that 55Fe-labeled band appeared in reactions lacking homocitrate, consistent with the hypothesis that they represent FeMo-co precursors. Collectively considered, these results suggest a model in which NifB-co, synthesized by NifB, is donated to NifNE. In a MgATP- and NifH-dependent step, molybdenum is incorporated and accumulates on the protein bands marked as C and D. Homocitrate is added last either as a prerequisite to transfer of completed FeMo-co to gamma protein or as the final step of FeMo-co synthesis on gamma protein. FeMo-co accumulates on gamma protein until NifH-mediated association of gamma protein and apodinitrogenase occurs, whereupon gamma protein transfers FeMo-co to apodinitrogenase. At some point, perhaps when MoO42− enters the pathway, it must be reduced from Mo(VI) to Mo(IV), the formal oxidation state proposed to be in FeMo-co. In previous experiments, a requirement for reductant for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis was demonstrated (21Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4256-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), although it has not been shown that the reductant is consumed stoichiometrically with the amount of FeMo-co produced. Likewise, it is shown here and elsewhere that ATP is required for FeMo-co synthesis, although it is not known which step in the synthesis requires ATP. It is not known whether ATP is hydrolyzed. Experiments described above have utilized centrifuged, desalted crude extracts of appropriate strains of A. vinelandii. Purified components known to be required for FeMo-co synthesis include NifNE, NifB-co, Na2MoO4, NifH, MgATP, homocitrate, and reductant (dithionite). When purified samples of each of these are mixed with purified gamma protein and purified apodinitrogenase, very little active dinitrogenase is formed. The incorporation of 99Mo into components of the purified system was investigated, and the results are shown in Fig.4. No 99Mo accumulated on any band in the absence of NifB-co (Fig. 4, lane 1), NifH (lane 2), NifNE (lane 3), or ATP (lane 4). In the complete purified system, a small amount of label accumulated in the region of bands C and D, similar to the bands C and D of Fig. 3. In the absence of homocitrate, 99Mo accumulated in a band that moves more slowly than band C and D; this band was not observed in the crude system. Although complexes of citrate with MoO42− and homocitrate with vanadate have been reported (30Carrell C.J. Carrell H.L. Erlebacher J. Glusker J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8651-8656Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 31Glusker J.P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1980; 13: 345-352Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Wright D.W. Chang R.T. Mandal S.K. Armstrong W.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 143-151Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), MoO42−:homocitrate did not form a species that migrates as a distinct band in our gel system; for example, such a band would be expected in Fig. 4, lanes 1–4. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that one or more of the purified proteins added to the system is responsible for the99Mo-labeled bands seen in lanes 5 and6. These bands are in the approximate position of NifH, and this protein is the best candidate for these bands, although we lack a positive demonstration of NifH at exactly these positions. From other work, it is known that binding of metal clusters to proteins can affect the migration of the protein on gels (18Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows a time course of labeling of Mo-Sto and dinitrogenase using a crude extract ofA. vinelandii strain UW45 (nifB) plus added NifB-co, homocitrate, and MgATP. Mo-Sto becomes labeled first, and dinitrogenase fails to show marked labeling until the 10 min time point. More importantly, it appears that the entry of Mo into the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway is a slow step in the process, as there is no significant accumulation of label on gamma protein or bands C and D. Any Mo that makes it into the system is rapidly converted to completed FeMo-co that is inserted into dinitrogenase. NifH from C. pasteurianum was used in place of NifH from A. vinelandii to supplement a crude extract of A. vinelandii strain UW97 (nifH) that lacks NifH. NifH from C. pasteurianum is known to form an inhibitory complex with A. vinelandii dinitrogenase that is unable to reduce substrates (33Emerich D.W. Ljones T.L. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was thought that C. pasteurianum NifH might fail to function in FeMo-co synthesis or might form an inhibitory complex with a component of FeMo-co synthesis, leading to accumulation of an intermediate in the pathway. As seen in Fig.6, C. pasteurianum NifH functions effectively in FeMo-co synthesis in the crude A. vinelandii system, indicating that it possesses the structural features required for this role of NifH. Some 99Mo accumulation on gamma protein is observed in this experiment, indicating that the C. pasteurianum NifH might not be fully effective in mediating the association of gamma protein with A. vinelandii dinitrogenase. Previously, we have shown that VnfH fromA. vinelandii will substitute for A. vinelandiiNifH in FeMo-co synthesis and gamma protein-dependent insertion (34Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21604-21608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that 99Mo label accumulates on dinitrogenase only when all known components of the FeMo-co synthesis system are present. Furthermore, 99Mo label only accumulates on the gamma protein, which has been shown to be a chaperone/insertase for the maturation of apodinitrogenase when all known components are present. It appears that only completed FeMo-co can accumulate on the gamma protein. Using all known components in purified form, very little FeMo-co synthesis was observed, and therefore, additional factors are required for optimal FeMo-co synthesis. 99Mo was not observed on NifNE under any conditions tested, suggesting that Mo enters the pathway at some other step, although it remains possible that a Mo-containing precursor of FeMo-co that is not sufficiently stable to persist during gel electrophoresis occurs but was not observed. 99Mo accumulates on several unidentified species, which may be the additional components required for FeMo-co synthesis. A nucleotide dependence for accumulation of Mo on Mo-Sto was demonstrated. We thank M. Homer and R. Chatterjee for helpful discussions.

The binding of the dinucleotide substrate, NAD+, to the PE24 active site was studied by exploiting intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence for the wild-type, single Trp, and tryptophan-deficient mutant proteins. Various approaches were used to study the substrate binding process, including dynamic quenching, CD spectroscopy, steady-state fluorescence emission analysis, NAD+-glycohydrolase activity, NAD+ binding analysis, protein denaturation experiments, fluorescence lifetime analysis, steady-state anisotropy measurement, stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy, and quantum yield determination. It was found that the conservative replacement of tryptophan residues with phenylalanine had little or no effect on the folded stability and enzyme activity of the PE24 protein. Dynamic quenching experiments indicated that when bound to the active site of the enzyme, the NAD+ substrate protected Trp-558 from solvent to a large extent but had no effect on the degree of solvent exposure for tryptophans 417 and 466. Also, upon substrate binding, the anisotropy of the Trp-417(W466F/W558F) protein showed the largest increase, followed by Trp-466(W417F/W558F), and there was no effect on Trp-558(W417F/W466F). Furthermore, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence exhibited the highest degree of substrate-induced quenching for the wild-type protein, followed in decreasing order by Trp-417(W466F/W558F), Trp-558(W417F/W466F), and Trp-466(W417F/W558F).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in soil, water, sewage, and even in hospital environments (1Bopp L.H. Baltch A.L. Hammer M.C. Franke M.A. Smith R.P. Lutz F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 708-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This bacterium is a leading cause of infections in burn, cystic fibrosis, and postoperative patients and in other various immune-compromised hosts. P. aeruginosa synthesizes a number of extracellular toxic products believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of these infections. The most toxic factor secreted by P. aeruginosa is the 66-kDa protein exotoxin A (ETA). 1The abbreviations used are: ETA, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A; ave, average; β-TAD+, β-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide; DT, diphtheria toxin; ε-AMP, 1,N 6-etheno AMP; εM, molar extinction coefficient; ε-NAD+, 1,N 6-etheno-NAD+; GH, NAD+ glycohydrolase; Gn-HCl, guanidine hydrochloride; λemmax, fluorescence emission maximum; NATA, N-acetyltryptophanamide; PE24, P. aeruginosaexotoxin A 24-kDa C-terminal fragment; QF, fluorescence quantum yield; WT, wild-type1The abbreviations used are: ETA, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A; ave, average; β-TAD+, β-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide; DT, diphtheria toxin; ε-AMP, 1,N 6-etheno AMP; εM, molar extinction coefficient; ε-NAD+, 1,N 6-etheno-NAD+; GH, NAD+ glycohydrolase; Gn-HCl, guanidine hydrochloride; λemmax, fluorescence emission maximum; NATA, N-acetyltryptophanamide; PE24, P. aeruginosaexotoxin A 24-kDa C-terminal fragment; QF, fluorescence quantum yield; WT, wild-typeETA belongs to a family of toxins related in their mechanisms of action, which include diphtheria toxin (DT), pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin. These toxins exert their effects via ADP-ribosylation of specific target molecules within eukaryotic cells. More specifically, ETA catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ onto elongation factor 2 (2Iglewski B.H. Liu P.V. Kabat D. Infect. Immun. 1977; 15: 138-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oppenheimer N.J. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8579-8581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This covalent transfer inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2, rendering it incapable of polypeptide chain elongation, inhibiting protein synthesis, and eventually killing the target cell.The three-dimensional crystallographic structure of the 613-residue ETA protein has been solved to a resolution of 3.0 Å (4Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of the 66-kDa ETA molecule, along with other physicochemical data, molecular models were proposed that consist of three distinct functional domains (5Jinno Y. Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Willingham M.C. Adhya S. FitGerald D.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15953-15959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domain Ia (residues 1–252) is involved in receptor binding, domain Ib (residues 365–404) has no known function, and domain II (residues 253–364) aids in translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the host cell cytoplasm after receptor-mediated endocytosis. Domain III (residues 405–613) comprises the catalytic domain, which contains an extended cleft postulated to be the active site of the enzyme.From the resolved 2.3-Å crystal structure of DT (6Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1444-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), some active site residues are located in essentially identical positions within ETA and DT. Previously, a model was proposed in which NAD+ fits into the cleft with the adenine ring bound in the hydrophobic pocket defined by the aromatic rings of Tyr-470 (Tyr-54, DT), Tyr-481 (Tyr-65, DT), Trp-466 (Trp-50, DT), Trp-558 (Trp-153, DT), and His-440 (His-21, DT) (7Domenighini M. Montecucco C. Ripka W.C. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The model suggests that either the nicotinamide or adenine ring of NAD+ would stack on the indole ring of Trp-466. More recently, the 2.5-Å crystal structure of domain III of ETA complexed with NAD+ hydrolysis products (AMP and nicotinamide) has been solved (8Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and close inspection of this structure revealed that NAD+ likely does not directly interact with the Trp-466 side chain (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a three-dimensional structure of domain III of ETA complexed with the NAD+ analogue, β-TAD+, has also been determined (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as has the structure of DT complexed with intact NAD+ (11Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Bell et al. (12Bell C.E. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2084-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) compared the conformations of NAD(P+) bound to 23 distinct NAD(P+)-binding oxidoreductases enzymes. The majority of the oxidoreductase-bound NAD(P+) conformations were found to be similar, but the conformation of NAD+ bound to DT (and ETA) was found to be unusual. This difference was seen in the highly folded conformation of the nicotinamide mononucleotide portion of NAD+ and a strained N-glycosidic bond, which places the nicotinamide ring outside the preferred anti andsyn conformations. In DT and ETA, the NAD+-binding site is formed at the junction of the two anti-parallel β-sheets that are orthogonal to one another. This is again in sharp contrast to other NAD(P+) enzymes that bind NAD(P+) at the C-terminal end of a parallel β-sheet.Within domain III of ETA are three tryptophans (Trp-417, Trp-466, and Trp-558) that could potentially participate in hydrophobic stacking interactions as described previously. Previously, we demonstrated that upon NAD+ binding to the catalytic domain, the intrinsic protein fluorescence of ETA is significantly quenched (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This effect was attributed to the fluorescence quenching of one or more tryptophans located within domain III. However, at that time, a catalytically active fragment of ETA that consisted of domain III only was not available. In order to elucidate the roles of these tryptophans in substrate binding and catalysis, we made conservative substitutions (phenylalanine for tryptophan) within PE24, a recombinant protein that is a catalytically active fragment of ETA consisting primarily of domain III, using a site-directed mutagenesis technique. The effects of these mutations were determined by accessibility of the Trp residues to acrylamide, CD spectroscopy, NAD+-glycohydrolase (GH) activity, NAD+ binding affinity, protein folded stability, fluorescence lifetimes, anisotropies, and quantum yields (QF). The results suggest that Trp-558 is protected from the solvent when NAD+ fills the active site and that a major structural change occurs within the catalytic domain within the vicinity of Trp-417.DISCUSSIONThe quantum yield of the WT PE24 protein is not the average of that measured for the three single Trp mutant proteins (WT, 0.17; mutant average, 0.09). This indicates that there must be some degree of local perturbation of the protein environment upon Trp → Phe substitution within PE24 or energy transfer between Trp residues of the WT. However, the weighted average for the anisotropy of the three single Trp mutant proteins is similar to the measured value for the WT anisotropy, indicating little or no depolarization of the WT anisotropy value. This effectively rules out the latter possibility. The origin of the low quantum yield for Trp-558 is likely its close position to the guanido side chain of Arg-467 in addition to its high degree of aqueous solvent exposure. It is well known that Arg will quench indole fluorescence, although the mechanism is not well understood (21Permyakov E.A. Luminescent Spectroscopy of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). All three Trp residues showed a significant degree of fluorescence quenching upon NAD+ binding. In the case of Trp-558, because the adenine ring of NAD+ docks next to the benzene portion of the indole, a ground state nucleic acid-indole complex could be formed (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Creed D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 39: 537-562Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, the origin of the fluorescence quenching of Trp-417 and Trp-466 is less obvious. Previously it was suggested that a conserved loop region within ETA (residues 456–470, and residues 39–46 in DT) that harbors two Asp residues, Asp-461 and Asp-463, could be the source of substrate-induced fluorescence quenching within the active site of the toxin (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this loop is unresolved in the x-ray structure of the PE24-β-TAD+ substrate complex (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The largest change in the fluorescence quantum yield upon substrate binding was observed for Trp-417. Given that both bases of the NAD+ substrate are no closer than 17 Å to the Trp-417 indole ring, the origin of the fluorescence quenching mechanism of this Trp must lie in a structural change within the protein segment surrounding it. A comparison of the protein environment of Trp-417 in the substrate bound and substrate-free forms revealed that the likely candidates for the fluorescence quenching are a number of peptide bonds from various residues including Thr-418 (23Chen Y. Liu B. Yu H.-T. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 39: 9271-9278Google Scholar).Upon NAD+ binding, the anisotropy of the WT increased (Table I), and this increase was reflected in the anisotropies of the both single Trp mutant proteins, W-417 and W-466, the former showing the greatest change. This adds further credence to the idea that there is a substrate-induced structural change within the protein near Trp-417. Trp-558 was previously believe to dock against the adenine ring of NAD+ (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, with the advent of the β-TAD+-PE24 structure (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it can be seen that there is 3–4 Å between the Trp-558 and β-TAD+ rings. The anisotropy results for W-558 binding to NAD+ confirm this observation because the Trp-558 r ave value does not change significantly upon substrate binding (Table I). If there was direct van der Waals contact between the two ring structures, an increase in Trp-558 anisotropy would be expected.The k q value for the WT protein was similar to the weighted average values for the three single Trp mutant proteins (1.41 and 1.58 m−1 ns−1, respectively). Trp-417 and Trp-558 were similar in their extent of solvent accessibility, and both were considerably more exposed to solvent than was Trp-466. These findings were consistent with earlier suggestions based on x-ray data (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and sensitivity to NBS oxidation (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Trp-417 remains solvent exposed upon substrate binding, whereas Trp-466 becomes more exposed. In contrast, Trp-558 is protected from solvent upon substrate complexation with the enzyme. This latter observation is likely due to the close proximity of NAD+ to the Trp-558 residue.The GH activity of the various single Trp mutant proteins mirrored our earlier report that none of the Trp residues were critical for GH activity of the toxin-enzyme (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The measured turnover number (k cat value) was also nearly identical to the reported value for WT PE40 (1.67 ± 0.5 and 1.84 ± 0.4 h−1 for PE24 and PE40, respectively) previously reported by our laboratory. The GH activity was the lowest for the triple mutant Trp–, which resulted in GH activity that was 16% of the WT value. This difference is most probably due to the accumulated perturbation of the active site of the enzyme and does not reflect a specific role for the Trp residues within the PE24 active site. However, the single Trp mutant W-558, which lacks Trp-417 and Trp-558, exhibited a lower affinity (albeit marginally) for the NAD+substrate (Table II). This may indicate that when both Trp-417 and Trp-466 are replaced by Phe, there is a cumulative structural change within the active site of the protein that leads to a less effective binding pocket. The replacement of Trp-558 by Phe does not seem to have any such effect (Table II).The enzyme domain of ETA alone (domain III) is less stable than the whole toxin or PE40 (domains II and III) (Table IV) (24Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the stability of WT PE24 protein was increased by 2-fold upon complexation of the NAD+ substrate (Table IV). The stopped flow experiments using denaturants as the unfolding agents revealed that PE24 (domain III) refolds extremely quickly—much more rapidly than either whole toxin or PE40. This was proposed from our earlier folding experiments involving whole toxin and PE40 (24Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The biological implications of the rapid refolding process of domain III may reflect the need for this domain to refold upon translocation to the cytoplasm upon crossing the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in order to avoid destruction by host endogeneous proteinases or other scavenging cellular machinery during the intoxication process. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in soil, water, sewage, and even in hospital environments (1Bopp L.H. Baltch A.L. Hammer M.C.

It is well known that Arg will quench indole fluorescence, although the mechanism is not well understood (21Permyakov E.A. Luminescent Spectroscopy of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). All three Trp residues showed a significant degree of fluorescence quenching upon NAD+ binding. In the case of Trp-558, because the adenine ring of NAD+ docks next to the benzene portion of the indole, a ground state nucleic acid-indole complex could be formed (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Creed D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 39: 537-562Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, the origin of the fluorescence quenching of Trp-417 and Trp-466 is less obvious. Previously it was suggested that a conserved loop region within ETA (residues 456–470, and residues 39–46 in DT) that harbors two Asp residues, Asp-461 and Asp-463, could be the source of substrate-induced fluorescence quenching within the active site of the toxin (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this loop is unresolved in the x-ray structure of the PE24-β-TAD+ substrate complex (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The largest change in the fluorescence quantum yield upon substrate binding was observed for Trp-417. Given that both bases of the NAD+ substrate are no closer than 17 Å to the Trp-417 indole ring, the origin of the fluorescence quenching mechanism of this Trp must lie in a structural change within the protein segment surrounding it. A comparison of the protein environment of Trp-417 in the substrate bound and substrate-free forms revealed that the likely candidates for the fluorescence quenching are a number of peptide bonds from various residues including Thr-418 (23Chen Y. Liu B. Yu H.-T. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 39: 9271-9278Google Scholar).Upon NAD+ binding, the anisotropy of the WT increased (Table I), and this increase was reflected in the anisotropies of the both single Trp mutant proteins, W-417 and W-466, the former showing the greatest change. This adds further credence to the idea that there is a substrate-induced structural change within the protein near Trp-417. Trp-558 was previously believe to dock against the adenine ring of NAD+ (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, with the advent of the β-TAD+-PE24 structure (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it can be seen that there is 3–4 Å between the Trp-558 and β-TAD+ rings. The anisotropy results for W-558 binding to NAD+ confirm this observation because the Trp-558 r ave value does not change significantly upon substrate binding (Table I). If there was direct van der Waals contact between the two ring structures, an increase in Trp-558 anisotropy would be expected.The k q value for the WT protein was similar to the weighted average values for the three single Trp mutant proteins (1.41 and 1.58 m−1 ns−1, respectively). Trp-417 and Trp-558 were similar in their extent of solvent accessibility, and both were considerably more exposed to solvent than was Trp-466. These findings were consistent with earlier suggestions based on x-ray data (10Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and sensitivity to NBS oxidation (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Trp-417 remains solvent exposed upon substrate binding, whereas Trp-466 becomes more exposed. In contrast, Trp-558 is protected from solvent upon substrate complexation with the enzyme. This latter observation is likely due to the close proximity of NAD+ to the Trp-558 residue.The GH activity of the various single Trp mutant proteins mirrored our earlier report that none of the Trp residues were critical for GH activity of the toxin-enzyme (9Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The measured turnover number (k cat value) was also nearly identical to the reported value for WT PE40 (1.67 ± 0.5 and 1.84 ± 0.4 h−1 for PE24 and PE40, respectively) previously reported by our laboratory. The GH activity was the lowest for the triple mutant Trp–, which resulted in GH activity that was 16% of the WT value. This difference is most probably due to the accumulated perturbation of the active site of the enzyme and does not reflect a specific role for the Trp residues within the PE24 active site. However, the single Trp mutant W-558, which lacks Trp-417 and Trp-558, exhibited a lower affinity (albeit marginally) for the NAD+substrate (Table II). This may indicate that when both Trp-417 and Trp-466 are replaced by Phe, there is a cumulative structural change within the active site of the protein that leads to a less effective binding pocket. The replacement of Trp-558 by Phe does not seem to have any such effect (Table II).The enzyme domain of ETA alone (domain III) is less stable than the whole toxin or PE40 (domains II and III) (Table IV) (24Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the stability of WT PE24 protein was increased by 2-fold upon complexation of the NAD+ substrate (Table IV). The stopped flow experiments using denaturants as the unfolding agents revealed that PE24 (domain III) refolds extremely quickly—much more rapidly than either whole toxin or PE40. This was proposed from our earlier folding experiments involving whole toxin and PE40 (24Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The biological implications of the rapid refolding process of domain III may reflect the need for this domain to refold upon translocation to the cytoplasm upon crossing the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in order to avoid destruction by host endogeneous proteinases or other scavenging cellular machinery during the intoxication process. The quantum yield of the WT PE24 protein is not the average of that measured for the three single Trp mutant proteins (WT, 0.17; mutant average, 0.09). This indicates that there must be some degree of local perturbation of the protein environment upon Trp → Phe substitution within PE24 or energy transfer between Trp residues of the WT. However, the weighted average for the anisotropy of the three single Trp mutant proteins is similar to the measured value for the WT anisotropy, indicating little or no depolarization of the WT anisotropy value. This effectively rules out the latter possibility. The origin of the low quantum yield for Trp-558 is likely its close position to the guanido side chain of Arg-467 in addition to its high degree of aqueous solvent exposure.

G-CSF augmented the functional maturation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells in terms of both O⨪2-generating ability and expression of the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptor. G-CSF induced enhancement of cell growth in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. These results indicate that G-CSF is a potent enhancer for the differentiation and proliferation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. G-CSF caused the activation of p70 S6 kinase but not mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. On the other hand, G-CSF rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3), but did not induce serine727 phosphorylation. From the analysis of confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and differential centrifugation, it was clearly demonstrated that G-CSF induced nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. The G-CSF-dependent enhancement of neutrophilic differentiation in Me2SO-HL-60 cells was reversely inhibited by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Notably, in the presence of GM-CSF, G-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but failed to induce the nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. GM-CSF induced activation of not only p70 S6 kinase, but also of MAP kinase. Furthermore, GM-CSF caused the rapid serine727 phosphorylation of STAT3, both in the presence and absence of G-CSF. PD98059, an MEK1 inhibitor, inhibited the G-CSF-dependent serine727 phosphorylation of STAT3 and blocked the inhibitory effect of GM-CSF on G-CSF-dependent nuclear translocation of STAT3.

G-CSF stimulates the proliferation, survival, and maturation of cells committed to neutrophilic lineage (3Nicola N.A. Int. J.

The diverse biological effects of G-CSF are mediated through a single class of cell-surface receptor protein that forms homodimeric complexes on ligand binding (5Lieschke G.J. Grail D. Hodgson G. Metcalf D. Stanley D. Cheers C. Fowler K.J. Basu S. Shan Y.F. Dunn A.R. Blood. 1994; 84: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human G-CSF receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily (6Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 8702-8706Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). On the other hand, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is also thought to play an important role in the proliferation and maturation of neutrophil and macrophage lineage cells (6Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 7Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Mizushima S. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), retinoic acid (RA), and Bt2cAMP cause the neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells, whereas interferon-γ and phorbol ester cause the differentiation of macrophages (8Collins S.J.

Because of these advantages, many studies have been performed on HL-60 differentiation as a model of proliferation and maturation of myelogenic lineage cells. Several reports have suggested that although G-CSF cannot itself induce neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells, it can potentiate the neutrophilic differentiation of RA and Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells in terms of the O⨪2-generating ability (11Bollag W. Blood. 1991; 79: 87-91Google Scholar, 12Sakashita A. Nakamaki T. Tsuruoka N. Honma Y. Hozumi M. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Acrh. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of G-CSF role on the neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells has not been fully elucidated. Conversely, GM-CSF has been shown to directly induce the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells (14Sakamaki T. Kawakami K. Sato S. Hino K. Tomoyasu S. Tsuruoka N. Honma Y. Hozumi M. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1331-1337PubMed Google Scholar), and also to induce the re-proliferation in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells in which growth has been suppressed (15Schwartz E.L. Maher A.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2683-2687PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of GM-CSF on the neutrophilic-differentiation of HL-60 cells remains unclear. The addition of G-CSF causes the activation of several signaling pathways in myelogenic cells, including the JAK and STAT pathway, as well as the Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade (16Avalos B.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 761-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in particular the rapid activation of STAT3 and STAT1 (17Tian S.S. Lamb P. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of MAP kinase has been reported in the cells that proliferate in response to G-CSF (18Bashey A. Healy L. Marshall C.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 949-959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nicholson S.E. Novak U. Ziegler S.F. Layton J.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nicholson et al.(19Nicholson S.E. Novak U. Ziegler S.F. Layton J.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that phosphorylation of MAP kinase was correlated with both proliferative response and JAK2 activation. On the other hand, the importance of p70 S6 kinase in cell cycle progression of numerous cells has been reported (20Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been studied whether or not G-CSF signaling cascade involves p70 S6 kinase. Furthermore, it also remains unclear how these signaling pathways coincide with the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil lineage cells. In the present study, we analyzed the G-CSF-dependent enhancement of differentiation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, and observed the cross-talk of G-CSF and GM-CSF on this differentiation. Furthermore, to clarify the molecular mechanism of the role of G-CSF on neutrophilic differentiation, G-CSF-dependent activations of STAT3, MAP kinase, and p70 S6 kinase were studied in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. Human recombinant G-CSF (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo Japan) and human recombinant GM-CSF (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka Japan) were obtained. Anti-STAT3 (monoclonal antibody (mAb), Transduction Lab., S21320), and anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (polyclonal antibody (pAb), New England Biolab Inc., 9131S), anti-serine 727-phosphorylated STAT3 (pAb, New England Biolab Inc., 9134S), and anti-phosphorylated MAP kinase (New England Biolab Inc., 9100) antibodies were purchased from the aforementioned companies. Anti-human C3bi receptor mAb was purchased from Nichirei Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Jackson Immuno Research Lab., Inc. (West Grove, PA). FITC-N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys (fMLP) was purchased from Peninsula Lab. Inc. (Belmont, CA). Horse heart ferricytochromec, fMLP, zymosan A, and bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase were obtained from Sigma. Zymosan particles were opsonized by gently mixing with freshly prepared guinea pig serum (50 mg of zymosan to 5 ml of serum) for 30 min at 37 °C. The zymosan particles were washed several times with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 122 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 16.7 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). The opsonized zymosan particles were suspended in HBS (50 mg/ml) and used as a stimulant for O⨪2 generation at a final concentration of 2.5 mg of zymosan equivalent/ml. HL-60 cells were kindly supplied by the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Cells were maintained in a RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C in moisturized air containing 5% CO2. To standardize the quality of cells throughout this series, frozen cells of the same lot were thawed every three months and used for experiments. Differentiation was initiated by dispersing the cells in a fresh culture medium containing 1.25% (v/v) Me2SO to make a final cell density of about 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. G-CSF and/or GM-CSF were added to the cell suspension 2 days after the addition of Me2SO. After culturing for 5 days, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min and were washed several times with HBS. The resultant cells were resuspended in HBS and kept in an ice-cold bath until used for analyses. The viability of the cells was evaluated by the trypan blue dye-staining exclusion method, and more than 95% viability was confirmed in HL-60 cells treated with or without differentiating agents. O2generation by differentiated cells was measured by ferricytochromec reduction assay (21Kakinuma K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 538: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The cells (1.0 × 106) were preincubated in a substrate solution (50 μm ferricytochrome c, 5 mmd-glucose, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 in HBS) for 10 min at 37 °C, and the assay was initiated by the addition of a stimulant. The rate of O⨪2 generation was measured by continuously recording the increase in absorbance at 550–540 nm using a Hitachi 557 double-beam spectrophotometer. In the assay with insoluble stimulants, such as opsonized zymosan particles, the assay mixture was constantly stirred by a windmill mixer as described previously (22.Kakinuma, K., Yamaguchi, T., Kaneda, M., Shimada, K., Tomita, Y., and Chance, B. (1979) 86, 87–95.Google Scholar). The expression of stimulant-receptors on the cell surface was examined by flow cytometry with a Cyto-ACE-15 Auto Cell Screener (JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan). For the detection of C3bi receptor, cells (106 cells/100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) were incubated with anti-human-Mac-1 monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed several times in PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 100 μl of PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were again washed several times with PBS and were finally suspended in an aliquot of PBS and subjected to flow cytometry. The FITC-labeled chemotactic peptide (FITC-fMLP) was utilized to estimate the expression of the fMLP receptor on the cell surface (23Van E.D.E. Simpson S.J. Bender J.G. Chenoweth D.E. J. Immun. 1990; 144: 1062-1068PubMed Google Scholar,24Leonard E.J. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Noer K. Kutvirt S. Van E.D. J. Immun. 1990; 144: 1323-1330PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 106 cells were incubated with 0.1 μm FITC-fMLP in HBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at 4 °C. For the evaluation of the specific binding of the peptide to the receptor, the cells were preincubated with 10 μm fMLP for 15 min at 4 °C, and then 0.1 μm FITC-fMLP was added. After the incubation with the FITC-labeled peptide, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min and washed twice with HBS containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA. The washed cells were suspended in 1 ml of HBS containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA and subjected to flow cytometry. Fifty nanograms/ml G-CSF and/or GM-CSF were added to Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, and then three cells were incubated for 5 to 60 min at 37 °C. After the appropriate incubation time, the cells were mixed with chilled PBS containing a mixture of phosphatase and protease inhibitors and were transferred into an ice bath. Then, the cells were sedimented and dissolved with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer to 107 cells/0.1 ml (25Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The extract of the cells was prepared by short time sonication and subjected to Western blot analysis of MAP kinase, p70S6 kinase, and STAT3. 10 to 30 μg of the extracted protein was separated onto an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Highbond ECLTM film; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies anti-ERK (1:2000, pAb prepared in rabbit), anti-p70 S6 kinase (1:2000, pAb prepared in rabbit), anti-STAT3 (1:2000), anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (1:1000) and anti-serine 727-phosphorylated STAT3 and then visualized with secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase and an ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to analyze nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3, after the incubation with G-CSF and/or GM-CSF, HL-60 cells were collected in a hypotonic buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors by differential centrifugation as previously reported (30deKoning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M.Y. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1993; 87: 1335-1342Crossref Google Scholar). After vortexing for 10 s, nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Nuclear fractions were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer containing Benzon nuclease. The nuclear extracts were subjected to Western blotting analysis with anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. The analysis of the alteration of STAT3 localization in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells by G-CSF and/or GM-CSF was examined by confocal laser-activated microscopy (ACAS ULTIMA, Meridian Instruments and Zeiss LSM410, Carl Zeiss Inc.). The cells were treated with 50 ng/ml G-CSF and/or GM-CSF for 30 or 60 min. After the incubation, the cells were fixed with an equal volume of 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then washed with PBS. After treatment with ethanol for 5 min, the fixed cells were incubated with anti-STAT3 (1:100, mAb) or anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 antibodies for 1 h and visualized with secondary antibody coupled to FITC. Cells were examined using an ACAS ULTIMA or Zeiss LSM410 microscope, with an extinction wavelength of 488 nm, emission of 530/30 nm. The neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells was initiated by incubation with 1.25% (v/v) Me2SO. Two days after the addition of Me2SO, 50 ng/ml G-CSF and/or 50 ng/ml GM-CSF were added to Me2SO-treated cells, and then the cells were incubated for 5 days. Fig. 1shows the O⨪2-generating activities of the differentiated HL-60 cells. The O⨪2 generation from the G-CSF-treated HL-60 cells in response to fMLP or OZ was found to be much higher than that of the cells treated with Me2SO alone, as reported previously (13Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Acrh. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the incubation with GM-CSF reduced the fMLP or OZ-induced O⨪2-generating ability of HL-60 cells. It was noted that GM-CSF markedly reduced the G-CSF-dependent enhancement of neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells in terms of O⨪2-generating ability. As previously reported (13Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Acrh. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), nondifferentiated HL-60 cells did not produce O⨪2 in the presence fMLP or OZ (data not shown). Expressions of the fMLP and OZ (C3bi) receptors on the surface of HL-60 cells during the neutrophilic differentiation were analyzed by flow cytometry. As previously reported (13Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Acrh. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the fluorescent signal representing the C3bi receptor remarkably increased in HL-60 cells from the treatment of Me2SO (data not shown). The expression of the C3bi receptor in the Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, however, was not altered by incubation with either G-CSF or GM-CSF. On the other hand, the expression of the fMLP receptor in these cells markedly changed after incubation with either G-CSF and/or GM-CSF (Fig.2). The expression of fMLP-receptor (fMLP-R) in Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells was characterized by both a high and a low level population, whereas the nondifferentiated cells expressed only a low level of fMLP-R, as previously reported (13Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Acrh. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The population of cells showing a high level of fMLP-R expression increased markedly after incubation with G-CSF. The enhancement of fMLP-R expression by G-CSF may coincide with G-CSF-dependent enhancement of O⨪2-generating ability. On the other hand, GM-CSF decreased the population of high level fMLP-R-expressing cells that were treated with Me2SO alone. Furthermore, in the presence of GM-CSF, G-CSF failed to enhance high level fMLP-R-expressing cells. These results, therefore, suggest that G-CSF augments the neutrophilic differentiation of Me2SO HL-60 cells, whereas GM-CSF inhibits neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Myelogenic cytokines, such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, are thought to modulate not only the differentiation but also the proliferation of myelogenic cells. We, therefore, examined the effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on the growth of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, both G-CSF and GM-CSF accelerated the proliferation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. Whereas the proliferation curve representing the presence of GM-CSF was much higher than that for the presence of G-CSF, the proliferation curve showing in the presence of both cytokines was similar to that for the presence of GM-CSF alone, indicating that the growth-promoting effects of either cytokine on Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells were not cumulative. The previously mentioned results indicate that G-CSF acts as an accelerator on the maturation of HL-60 cells to neutrophils, whereas this action is inhibited by GM-CSF. Accordingly, we examined the cross-talk of these cytokines in terms of the signal transduction pathways. Fig. 4 shows the effects of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF on the activation of MAP kinase and p70 S6 kinase. Within 5 min, GM-CSF clearly induced a mobility shift of MAP kinase, indicating the phosphorylation of MAP kinase. The GM-CSF-dependent MAP kinase activation gradually ceased within 30 min (Fig. 4 a). The phosphorylation of MAP kinase by GM-CSF was confirmed by Western blot using anti-phosphorylated MAP kinase antibody (Fig.4 b). An SDS-PAGE mobility shift assay indicated that GM-CSF also induced a delayed phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase relative to that of MAP kinase (Fig. 4 c). G-CSF, on the other hand, did not induce the activation of MAP kinase but caused a similar delayed activation of p70 S6 kinase. The addition of both G-CSF and GM-CSF caused the rapid activation of MAP kinase and the delayed activation of p70 S6 kinase. Next, we examined whether STAT3 is activated upon the addition of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF. As shown in Fig.5 b, G-CSF induced a tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, whereas GM-CSF alone did not. G-CSF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 continued for 30 min. These results are consistent with those of the G-CSF- and GM-CSF-coupled JAK-STAT pathways (16Avalos B.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 761-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrel A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sengupta et al. (27Sengupta T.K. Schmitt E.M. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9499-9504Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, which was induced by IL-6, was partially inhibited by GM-CSF. In the present experiment, G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was not affected by GM-CSF in the Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, as shown in Fig.5. Several investigators have reported that maximal activation of transcription by STAT3 requires both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (28Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen K.S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 29Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 30deKoning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M.Y. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Serine-phosphorylated STAT3 shows a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (32Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). GM-CSF induced the rapid SDS-PAGE mobility shift of STAT3. However, G-CSF caused a delayed SDS-PAGE mobility shift of STAT3. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the experiment using anti-serine 727-phosphorylated STAT3 antibody showed that GM-CSF caused rapid serine 727 phosphorylation in STAT3, which corresponded to the SDS-PAGE mobility-dependent assay; however, G-CSF did not induce the serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT3. STAT3 is thought to be activated at the plasma membrane by tyrosine phosphorylation and translocated into the nucleus to induce the transcription of target genes. We, therefore, analyzed the cytokine-dependent nuclear translocation of STAT3 in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells by using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6 a(G-CSF), G-CSF caused the translocation of STAT3 into nuclei within 60 min. It was, however, demonstrated that in the presence of GM-CSF, G-CSF failed to cause the nuclear translocation of STAT3, even when the STAT3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 5 b). Furthermore, GM-CSF alone did not alter the cellular location of STAT3. We therefore hypothesized that the activation of the GM-CSF-specific signal cascade disturbs the nuclear translocation of STAT3, and therefore examined the effect of MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, on STAT3 translocation. As shown in Fig. 6(PD-98059+G/GM-CSF), in the presence of PD98059, the addition of both G-CSF and GM-CSF caused the nuclear translocation of STAT3. G-CSF-dependent nuclear translocation of STAT3 was analyzed using anti-tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 pAb. As shown in Fig.6 b, whereas control cells and GM-CSF-treated cells did not show any response to anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 antibody, G-CSF resulted in translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. In the presence of GM-CSF, G-CSF prompted the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but failed to induce the translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 into a nuclear portion. In the presence of PD98059, upon the addition of both cytokines, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was translocated into a nuclear portion. On the other hand, a rapid mobility shift of STAT3 induced by GM-CSF was clearly inhibited by PD98059 (Fig.7 a). In the presence of either G-CSF alone or both cytokines, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 exhibited an SDS-PAGE mobility shift as compared with that in the presence of PD98059. In the presence of PD98059, the addition of G-CSF or both cytokines caused a delayed SDS-PAGE mobility-shift in tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3, suggesting that the G-CSF-dependent delayed serine (or threonine) phosphorylation may be catalyzed by kinases other than MAP kinase, or its downstream kinase. Furthermore, the SDS-PAGE mobility shift pattern of G-CSF-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 differed from that of STAT3 with G-CSF, suggesting that a small amount of STAT3 was phosphorylated to tyrosine residue upon the addition of G-CSF. Using an anti-serine 727-phosphorylated STAT3 antibody, GM-CSF induced a rapid serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT3, which was markedly inhibited by the addition of PD98059, whereas G-CSF alone did not induce the serine 727 phosphorylation, suggesting that the delayed serine (or threonine) phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by G-CSF may be a result other than from the serine 727 residue. In the presence of PD98059, the addition of GM-CSF did not induce the activation of MAPK (data not shown). To confirm the nuclear translocation of STAT3, we prepared a nuclear fraction from HL-60 cells and determined the content of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. As shown in Fig. 7 d, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was detected in the nuclear fraction in G-CSF-treated cells but not that in both cytokine-treated cells. Furthermore, in the presence of PD98059, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was detected in nuclear fractions in G-CSF-treated cells and both cytokine-treated cells. These results indicate that the GM-CSF inhibits G-CSF-dependent nuclear translocation and PD98059 blocks the inhibition. It is known that HL-60 cells possess the ability to differentiate into neutrophilic cells by treatment with Me2SO (8Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) or RA (9Breitman T.R. Selonic S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that G-CSF cannot itself induce neutrophilic differentiation in nondifferentiated HL-60 cells, but it can potentiate the differentiation into neutrophils initiated by Me2SO or RA (11Bollag W. Blood. 1991; 79: 87-91Google Scholar, 12Sakashita A. Nakamaki T. Tsuruoka N. Honma Y. Hozumi M. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Acrh. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the role of G-CSF in the development of functional maturation during the differentiation of HL-60 cells into neutrophilic cells has not been extensively elucidated. We confirmed that G-CSF enhanced the neutrophilic differentiation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Figs. 1 and2). However, whereas GM-CSF has been shown to be a potential inducer of monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells, including HL-60 cells (33Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the effect of GM-CSF on neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells remains unclear. In this paper, we showed that GM-CSF inhibited the neutrophilic differentiation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells in terms of O⨪2- generating ability and fMLP-R expression. Furthermore, the G-CSF-dependent enhancement of neutrophilic differentiation in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells was markedly inhibited by GM-CSF, suggesting that GM-CSF acts as an antagonist of G-CSF in regard to the neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells. As a result of this data, we postulated that a G-CSF-specific signal transduction pathway may be implicated in the enhancement of neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells. It has been reported that G-CSF activates STAT3 through the activation of JAK2, whereas GM-CSF activates STAT5 through the activation of JAK2 (17Tian S.S. Lamb P. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J.

In a study using dominant negative STAT3, Minami et al. (37Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) speculated that STAT3 activation is a critical step in gp130-mediated terminal differentiation and growth arrest in a myeloid cell line. In this paper, we showed that G-CSF activated STAT3 by phosphorylation of tyrosine residue, whereas GM-CSF alone did not. Sengupta et al. (27Sengupta T.K. Schmitt E.M. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9499-9504Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported that GM-CSF partially inhibited interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. In this study, the addition of GM-CSF did not inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. This discrepancy may be because of a difference of cell type-specific activation of STAT3. In the presence of GM-CSF, however, G-CSF failed to induce the nuclear translocation of STAT3, even though G-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. The inhibitory effect of GM-CSF on the nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was restored by the addition of PD98059 (Fig. 6 and 7). Through the activation of MAP kinase, GM-CSF induces the serine phosphorylation of STAT3, which interrupts the nuclear translocation of STAT3 in HL-60 cells. It remains unclear why the serine-phosphorylated STAT3 does not translocate into the nucleus in HL-60 cells, as it can in other cells (34Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar, 38Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Further research is required to clarify the molecular mechanism in the inhibition of nuclear-translocation of STAT3. GM-CSF inhibited the G-CSF-dependent enhancement of neutrophilic differentiation in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). We postulated that G-CSF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear-translocation of STAT3 may be associated with the promotion of neutrophilic differentiation in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells and that the inhibition of G-CSF-dependent neutrophilic differentiation by GM-CSF may be because of the interruption of nuclear translocation of STAT3, as discussed above. In regard to the effect of PD98059 on the differentiation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, our preliminary results indicated that the decrease in fMLP receptor expression by GM-CSF was restored by the addition of 100 μm PD98059. However, cell growth and O⨪2-generating activity were markedly inhibited by PD98059, both in the presence and absence of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF (data not shown). Thus, a different approach is necessary to clarify the role of MAP kinase on the inhibitory effect of GM-CSF. It was reported that the maximal activation of the transcription of STAT3 requires both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation; however, serine kinase(s) that is responsible for the phosphorylation of STAT3 has not yet been clarified (28Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen K.S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 29Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.J.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The proposed MAP kinase phosphorylation site, PXSP, is conserved among members of the STAT family, suggesting a role for MAP kinase in serine phosphorylation (28Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen K.S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar,29Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Other groups have suggested that H-7-sensitive serine kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of STAT3 (30deKoning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M.Y. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1993; 87: 1335-1342Crossref Google Scholar, 31Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman L.B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Whereas the addition of GM-CSF rapidly induced an SDS-PAGE mobility shift and serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT3 in either the presence or absence of G-CSF, G-CSF alone did not show the above reaction. On the other hand, G-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but not serine 727 (Figs. 5 and 7). The addition of PD98059 inhibited serine 727 phosphorylation induced by GM-CSF. In the presence of PD98059, G-CSF caused a delayed SDS-PAGE mobility shift of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. These results suggest that G-CSF induces serine (or threonine) phosphorylation, other than serine 727, in STAT3. Furthermore, both GM-CSF-dependent MAP kinase activation and serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT3 were observed by as early as 5 min. The GM-CSF-dependent mobility shift of STAT3 was markedly reduced by the addition of PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor (Figs. 4and 7). Therefore, it was suggested that GM-CSF-dependent serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is induced by the activation of MAP kinase in HL-60 cells. GM-CSF and G-CSF are thought to play an important role in the growth of myelogenic cells. As previously reported, we observed that G-CSF and GM-CSF augmented the cell number of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (15Schwartz E.L. Maher A.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2683-2687PubMed Google Scholar, 39Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Kogi M. Yamamoto Y. Hayakawa T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GM-CSF-dependent cell growth of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells was much higher than that of G-CSF. The enhancement of GM-CSF and G-CSF on the growth of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells was not cumulative. Therefore, it appears that the signaling pathway of GM-CSF-dependent cell growth in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells may also include the pathway of G-CSF. A number of hematopoietic growth factors, including GM-CSF, IL-3, and steel factor have been shown to activate the Ras MAP kinase pathway (40Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 41Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.J. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-p70 S6 kinase pathway in several cells has also been shown to be associated with the growth signals of many cytokines (20Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that GM-CSF induced a rapid electromobility shift in immunoreactive MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) and a time-delayed electromobility shift in immunoreactive p70 S6 kinase. On the other hand, G-CSF was shown to induce a time-delayed activation of p70 S6 kinase but not MAP kinase. When both GM-CSF and G-CSF were added to Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, the activation pattern of both MAP kinase and p70 S6 kinase were similar to that of GM-CSF alone. In conclusion, we postulate that the activation of both kinases provides maximum activation of cell growth in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. Furthermore, it appears that the activation of p70 S6 kinase in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells may be a mutual pathway for the G-CSF- and GM-CSF-dependent enhancement of cell proliferation. We thank Dr. John Blenis for helpful suggestions and for the generous gifts of anti-MAP kinase and p70 S6 kinase antibodies. We are grateful also to Dr. Kazuhiro Suzuki of our institute for valuable discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2085909406,"The vacuolar proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles is composed of two general sectors, a cytosolic, ATP hydrolytic domain (V1) and an intramembranous proton channel, V0. V1 is comprised of 8–9 subunits including polypeptides of 50 and 57 kDa, termed SFD (SubFifty-eight-kDa Doublet). Although SFD is essential to the activation of ATPase and proton pumping activities catalyzed by holoenzyme, its constituent polypeptides have not been separated to determine their respective roles in ATPase functions. Recent molecular characterization of these subunits revealed that they are isoforms that arise through an alternative splicing mechanism (Zhou, Z., Peng, S.-B., Crider, B.P., Slaughter, C., Xie, X.S., and Stone, D.K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5878–5884). To determine the functional characteristics of the 57-kDa (SFDα) 1The abbreviations used are: SFD, Sub-Fifty-eight-kDa Dimer, orDoublet 50/57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for function of the vacuolar proton pumps; rSFD, recombinant SFD; 1799, bis(hexafluoroacetonyl) acetone; bp, base pair; C12E9, polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; V-, vacuolar; V0, the bafilomycin-sensitive proton channel of V-type proton pumps; V1, the peripheral, catalytic sector of V-type proton pumps; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl-1- thio-β-d-galactopyranoside1The abbreviations used are: SFD, Sub-Fifty-eight-kDa Dimer, orDoublet 50/57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for function of the vacuolar proton pumps; rSFD, recombinant SFD; 1799, bis(hexafluoroacetonyl) acetone; bp, base pair; C12E9, polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; V-, vacuolar; V0, the bafilomycin-sensitive proton channel of V-type proton pumps; V1, the peripheral, catalytic sector of V-type proton pumps; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl-1- thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50-kDa (SFDβ) isoforms, we expressed these proteins in Escherichia coli. We determined that purified recombinant proteins, rSFDα and rSFDβ, when reassembled with SFD-depleted holoenzyme, are functionally interchangeable in restoration of ATPase and proton pumping activities. In addition, we determined that the V-pump of chromaffin granules has only the SFDα isoform in its native state and that rSFDα and rSFDβ are equally effective in restoring ATPase and proton pumping activities to SFD-depleted enzyme. Finally, we found that SFDα and SFDβ structurally interact not only with V1, but also withV0, indicating that these activator subunits may play both structural and functional roles in coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton flow. The vacuolar proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles is composed of two general sectors, a cytosolic, ATP hydrolytic domain (V1) and an intramembranous proton channel, V0. V1 is comprised of 8–9 subunits including polypeptides of 50 and 57 kDa, termed SFD (SubFifty-eight-kDa Doublet). Although SFD is essential to the activation of ATPase and proton pumping activities catalyzed by holoenzyme, its constituent polypeptides have not been separated to determine their respective roles in ATPase functions. Recent molecular characterization of these subunits revealed that they are isoforms that arise through an alternative splicing mechanism (Zhou, Z., Peng, S.-B., Crider, B.P., Slaughter, C., Xie, X.S., and Stone, D.K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5878–5884). To determine the functional characteristics of the 57-kDa (SFDα) 1The abbreviations used are: SFD, Sub-Fifty-eight-kDa Dimer, orDoublet 50/57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for function of the vacuolar proton pumps; rSFD, recombinant SFD; 1799, bis(hexafluoroacetonyl) acetone; bp, base pair; C12E9, polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; V-, vacuolar; V0, the bafilomycin-sensitive proton channel of V-type proton pumps; V1, the peripheral, catalytic sector of V-type proton pumps; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl-1- thio-β-d-galactopyranoside1The abbreviations used are: SFD, Sub-Fifty-eight-kDa Dimer, orDoublet 50/57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for function of the vacuolar proton pumps; rSFD, recombinant SFD; 1799, bis(hexafluoroacetonyl) acetone; bp, base pair; C12E9, polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; V-, vacuolar; V0, the bafilomycin-sensitive proton channel of V-type proton pumps; V1, the peripheral, catalytic sector of V-type proton pumps; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl-1- thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50-kDa (SFDβ) isoforms, we expressed these proteins in Escherichia coli.

In addition, we determined that the V-pump of chromaffin granules has only the SFDα isoform in its native state and that rSFDα and rSFDβ are equally effective in restoring ATPase and proton pumping activities to SFD-depleted enzyme. Finally, we found that SFDα and SFDβ structurally interact not only with V1, but also withV0, indicating that these activator subunits may play both structural and functional roles in coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton flow. Vacuolar, or V-type proton pumps acidify a wide array of intracellular compartments and are essential to functions of constitutive endocytotic and regulated secretory pathways. These H+ pumps are also found in the plasma membrane of polarized cells such as osteoclasts and renal tubular epithelial cells, where they function to acidify discrete extracellular compartments. In fact, V-pumps have been localized to virtually all intracellular compartments, except the nucleus and mitochondria, and their functions are equally diverse, ranging from promoting receptor-ligand dissociation in clathrin-coated vesicles and endosomes, to energizing neurotransmitter and catecholamine storage in synaptic vesicles and adrenal chromaffin granules (1Stevens T.H.

Key questions thus arise regarding the mechanisms by which these pumps are targeted to their cellular sites and how differential regulation of the enzymes is achieved in these disparate locales. Several regulatory elements of V-pumps have been described, including activator proteins (4Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25063-25067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zang K. Wang Z.Q. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9701-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chloride channels that operate in parallel with V-pump to dissipate the charge generated by these electrogenic pumps and thereby facilitate pH gradient formation (6Xie X.-S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) evidence for the roles of a 50- and 57-kDa polypeptide doublet, termed SFD (Sub Fifty-eight-kDa Dimer, orDoublet), in the activation of the V-pump of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) of bovine brain. These proteins were discovered in the course of our attempts to achieve biochemical resolution of components of the V-pump of CCV. This enzyme, like all V-pumps, is comprised of two general sectors, a multisubunit, cytosolic ATP hydrolytic domain (V1), and a multisubunit proton channel (V0). Biochemical and genetic studies have revealed that the V1 domain in eukaryotic organisms is composed of 7 core subunits (A-G), some of which are present in multiple copies (10Crider B.P. Andersen P. White A.E. Zhou Z. Li X. Mattsson J.P. Lundberg L. Keeling D.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Peng S.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10721-10728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although less well characterized, the V0 domain of the V-pump of CCV contains between 3–6 different subunits, ranging from a 116-kDa polypeptide (subunit a) to a small proteolipid (subunit c) (11Peng S.-B. Li X. Crider B.P. Zhou Z. Andersen P. Tsai S.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2549-2555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Attempts at defining the components of V1 (subunits A-G) and their functions revealed that an additional factor(s) was required for pump function, namely the polypeptides of SFD. When selectively depleted of these proteins, the V-pump of CCV, though assembled as a V1V0 complex, cannot support ATP hydrolysis or proton pumping. Purified SFD, when added to SFD-depleted pump, was shown to restore these functions (8Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From a molecular standpoint, we recently determined the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides of SFD, termed SFDα and SFDβ, respectively, arise from a single gene by an alternative splicing mechanism and that the SFDβ isoform has a smaller molecular mass because of an 18-amino acid deletion (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further characterization revealed that the SFD proteins have sequence homology to the VMA13 product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As is the case with SFD, loss of the VMA13 gene product yielded a yeast vacuolar proton pump that was assembled but inactive (12Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anrakau Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the activation properties of SFD had been previously ascribed by others (13Meyers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1592-31597Google Scholar) to AP50, a component of the AP2 complex which is responsible for the assembly of the clathrin coats of coated pits and vesicles (15Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Phan H.L. Finlay J.A. Chu D.S. Tan P.K. Kirchhausen T. Payne G.S.

DNA. 1988; 7: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our more recent work demonstrated that SFD, and in particular its 50-kDa component (SFDβ), is molecularly distinct from AP50 and that removal of AP50 from impure pump preparations had no effect on enzyme activity, whereas removal of SFDα and SFDβ accounted for the deactivation we had previously observed (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The current studies add final proof to the molecular identity of the SFD isoforms. Purified, recombinant SFDα and SFDβ are shown to restore ATPase and proton pumping activity to V-pump depleted of SFD. Moreover, we have identified a source of V-pump (chromaffin granules) that in its native form has only SFDα. When depleted of SFD, the chromaffin granule pump loses ATPase and proton pumping activities, and both are restored by addition of either SFDα or SFDβ. Finally, we have determined that SFD binds to both isolated V1andV0, thus providing evidence that it may function in a structural role of coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton pumping. Isolation of clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine brains (18Nandi P.K. Irace G. Van Jaarsveld P.O. Lippoldt R.E. Edelhoch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5881-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and preparations of liposomes from purified lipids (19Xie X.-S. Tsai S.J. Stone D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8913-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were performed as reported. Purification of the proton-translocating ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles was performed by sequential solubilization with C12E9, hydroxylapatite chromatography, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, and glycerol gradient centrifugations (20Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); purified H+-ATPase had a specific activity of 14–16 μmol of Pi·mg of protein−1·min−1. V0 was isolated from purified V-pump (21Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant subunit B (22Peng S.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16926-16931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared as described. Purified proton pump was depleted of SFD by treatment with Zwittergent 3–16, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation, as reported (8Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partial purification of the vacuolar proton pump of chromaffin granules was achieved by modification of the protocol used for preparation of the vacuolar proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles of bovine brain. Briefly, 500 mg of bovine chromaffin granule membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 20 ml of solubilization buffer, consisting of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% C12E9, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was removed and mixed with (NH4)2SO4 to achieve 45% final saturation. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05% C12E9, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA and was layered over a 13-ml, continuous 15–30% glycerol gradient prepared in the same buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40 rotor. Proton pump was harvested from the bottom one-third of the gradient in 1-ml fractions. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA sequencing ligase, and a nick translation kit were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; DNA sequencing reagents and enzymes and GeneAmp PCR reagent kit were from Perkin-Elmer-Cetus; E. coli strains DH5α and BL21 (DE3) pLys S and expression vector pET16b were from Novagen; radioactive reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; nitrocellulose membranes for plaque lift were from Millipore Corp.; and chemicals for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. Bovine adrenal chromaffin granule membranes were the generous gift of Dr. Joseph Albanesi (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). The coding region for bovine SFDα and SFDβ were amplified by PCR using the cloned cDNAs SFD-RT4 and SFD21 (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively, as templates and two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GGATCCGATGACCAAGATGGATATTCG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCGGAGATCCAAGGGAAGCCCT-3′) as primers, which were designed to contain BamHI restriction sites to enable cloning into the bacterial expression vector pET16b. The amplification reaction was performed in a thermal cycler using the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C and 5 min at 65 °C, for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR products were size-fractionated and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis; resulting fragments were identical to the parent cDNA sequences as determined by direct DNA sequencing. The PCR products and pET16b vector were separately digested withBamHI, and the desired digestion fragments were gel-purified and ligated by bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. Ligation products were used to transform E. coli DH5α. Plasmids recovered from independent clones yielded two expression vectors, pET16b-SFDα and pET16b-SFDβ, that were screened for the correct orientation by restriction analysis. Both of these plasmids were designed to express fusion proteins containing 10 neighboring histidine residues and a Factor Xa1 recognition site at the NH2 terminus. For expression of SFDα and SFDβ, E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLys S was transformed with expression vectors pET16b-SFDα or pET16b-SFDβ, respectively, and grown and induced with IPTG at 37 °C, as described (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). An 856-bp PCR product, originally used to isolate the cDNAs encoding SFDα (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was used to generate a 32P-labeled RNA probe with a MAXI-Script Sp6/T7 kit from Ambion. Designated amounts of bovine poly(A)+-enriched mRNA were subjected to agarose (1.2%) gel electrophoresis and were subsequently transferred to nylon filter. After baking at 80 °C for 1 h, the filters were prehybridized with 4× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml sheared, single-stranded salmon DNA, and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 3 h. Subsequently the filter was hybridized with RNA probe (0.3 × 106 cpm/ml) for 12 h at 65 °C. Filters were sequentially washed with 2× SCC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Washed filters were exposed overnight using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hyperfilm. RT-PCR was performed using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer. Bovine poly(A)+ RNA (0.1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using poly(dT)16 as primer, and PCR amplification was subsequently performed using Primer I (5′-CTGAGGAGAAGCAGGAGATG-3′) and Primer II (5′-GCATCAGCTGCAGACACCCG-3′). These primers were designed to yield a PCR product that included the 54-bp insertion site that distinguishes SFDα from SFDβ (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With SFDα transcript as template, these primers are predicted to yield a 450-bp PCR product, and with SFDβ transcript template, a 396-bp PCR product. PCR products were separated electrophoretically on 1% agarose gels and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,840 × gfor 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), and the cells were broken by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants, which contained most of the recombinant proteins, were collected and loaded on 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA columns. After loading, the columns were washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). The eluents were diluted 1:10 with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and loaded on a Mono-Q (5 mm × 5 cm) column. The column was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10% glycerol). Proteins were eluted with linear (0–400 mm) NaCl gradients prepared in 15 ml of binding buffer. The fractions (1 ml) contained as much as 10–20 mg of the recombinant proteins, with > 95% purity, as assessed by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and by the Bradford protein assay (25Bradford M.M Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For each assay, 0.5 pmol of SFD-depleted proton pump was mixed with designated amounts (0–2.5 pmols) of recombinant SFDα and/or SFDβ, and the final volume was brought to 10 μl with buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05% C12E9, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, reassembled pump was assessed for ATPase and/or proton pumping activities. Measurement of ATPase activity was assessed by the liberation of32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP. Reassembled pump (0.5 pmol/assay) was incubated with 5 μl of phosphatidylserine (0.5 mg/ml) at room temperature for 5 min. Reactions were initiated with addition of 200 μl of assay buffer, consisting of 50 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.0), 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mmNa3VO4, and 3 mm[γ-32P]ATP (200–400 cpm/nmol). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 1.25 N perchloric acid, and liberated 32Piwas extracted and counted as described (26Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2701-2703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For assessment of ATP-driven proton pumping, samples of reassembled proton pump (0.5 pmol/assay) were reconstituted into liposomes (300 μg/assay) prepared from purified lipids by the cholate-dilution, freeze-thaw method, as described (19Xie X.-S. Tsai S.J. Stone D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8913-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were diluted into 1.6 ml of pumping assay buffer consisting of 150 mmKCl, 10 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.15 mm Na3VO4, and 7 μm acridine orange. Proton pumping was assessed by ATP-dependent quenching of the absorbance of acridine orange and was measured in Amino DW2C dual wavelength spectrophotometer as ΔA492–540. Reactions were initiated by addition of 1.3 mm Na-ATP and 1 μm valinomycin and were terminated by addition of 1 μm 1799. The preparation of antibodies Q50 (specific to SFDα) and Q48 (directed against a common epitope of SFDα and SFDβ) were described previously (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Designated amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Protein A-purified Q50 or Q48 was incubated with filters at a 1:3000 dilution, and immunoreactivity was assessed by ECL using donkey, anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:4000 dilution. Our previous attempts to resolve the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides of SFD by conventional biochemical methods failed (8Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While this may have owed to the fact that SFD existed as a heterodimer, it was also possible that their copurification owed to the fact that the two proteins differed by only 18 amino acids (9Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, results of molecular mass determination by gel filtration chromatography were equivocal, perhaps because of the presence of residual amounts of detergent used for release of the polypeptide pair from holoenzyme. Key issues regarding the 50- and 57-kDa components of SFD are thus whether both components are required for pump functions, and if not, do differences exist in the functional properties of the two proteins. To explore these points, we expressed and purified recombinant forms of the two polypeptides, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown in panel A of Fig. 1 are the purified recombinant α (lane 3) and β (lane 5) components of SFD. Panels B andC are Western blot analysis of the two components. Inpanel B, antibody Q48, directed against an epitope common to SFDα and β, reacts with both species in lysates of E. coli transformed with expression vectors for the α (lane 2) and β (lane 4) forms of the polypeptide;lanes 3 and 5 reveal immunoreactivity of purified rSFDα and rSFDβ, respectively. Western blot analysis (panel C) using antibody Q50, directed against the unique 18-amino acid insert of SFDα demonstrates that the antibody recognizes rSFDα before (lane 2) and after purification (lane 3) from E. coli lysate; in contrast, the antibody does not recognize rSFDβ (lanes 4 and5). Of note was the finding that both rSFDα and rSFDβ were present as soluble proteins in E. coli lysates. This differed from our experience with production of recombinant forms of all other V1 subunits, each of which required detergents for solubilization, and many of which required denaturation with 8m urea to achieve dissolution of inclusion bodies that contained the recombinant proteins. To address whether SFDα or SFDβ had independent activities, or synergistic effects when used in combination, reconstitution experiments were performed using the recombinant SFD proteins and biochemically prepared proton pump that had been depleted of SFD. As shown in Fig. 2, proton pump depleted of SFD lacked significant Mg2+-activated ATPase activity. Reassembly of recombinant forms of SFD with SFD-depleted pump resulted in a saturable activation of MgATPase activity. No differences were detected with the use of rSFDα alone, rSFDβ alone, or equimolar mixtures of rSFDα and rSFDβ. Maximum restoration of MgATPase activity was achieved at a molar ratio of rSFD to SFD-depleted proton pump of 2. The final specific activity of reassembled enzyme was about 1.5 μmols of Pi·mg of protein−1·min−1. 2This is about one-tenth the specific activity of native enzyme (20Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is close to the specific activity obtained by reassembling biochemically prepared SFD with SFD-depleted proton pump. This reduced activity likely owes to treatment of the holoenzyme with Zwittergent 3–16 in preparation of SFD-depleted pump. We have found that this detergent is relatively toxic to enzyme function and is not easily removed because of its low critical micellar concentration. To further characterize the functional properties of rSFDα and rSFDβ, we performed reconstitution experiments in which the rSFD proteins were first reassembled with SFD-depleted pump, and the resulting holoenzyme was then reconstituted into liposomes and assayed for proton pumping activity. Shown in Fig.3 are the proton pumping activities of these preparations, as assessed by ATP-generated acridine orange quenching. SFD-depleted pump lacked activity (trace 1), whereas rSFDα (trace 2), rSFDβ (trace 3), and equimolar mixtures of rSFDα and rSFDβ (trace 4) activated protein pumping in SFD-depleted pump. In this particular experiment, proton pumping, as assessed by the initial rate of ATP-generated acridine orange quenching, was about 1.3-fold higher when a mixture of rSFDα and rSFDβ were used (trace 4), as compared with rates attained with a single isoform of SFD (traces 2 and 3). This, however, was not a consistent observation, and coupled with the results obtained in the experiments of Fig. 2, we find no compelling evidence at present that there exist functional differences between the two isoforms. Tissue distributions of the SFD isoforms were assessed by Northern blot analysis, as shown in Fig. 4. The highest copy number of transcripts was found in brain (lane 1) followed by kidney (lane 3) and lung (lane 4); much lower levels of SFD transcripts were detected in heart (lane 2). Because of the minor difference in molecular mass in the transcripts for SFDα and SFDβ, we performed RT-PCR to determine whether tissue differences in the transcript level of SFDα and SFDβ existed. As described in “Experimental Procedures,” primers were utilized that would predictably yield products of 450 bp for SFDα and 396 bp for SFDβ. Although transcripts for SFDα and SFDβ were found in all tissues, it appears that SFDβ is in relative abundance in brain (lane 2), whereas relatively more SFDα RT-PCR product was demonstrated in all other tissues examined. We next sought to determine whether proton pump preparations from sources other than brain contained both SFDα and SFDβ isoforms. As shown in Fig. 5, proton pump prepared from bovine brain (lane 1) contained roughly equimolar amounts of SFDα and SFDβ, whereas V-pump purified from bovine chromaffin granules (lane 2) had only the SFDα isoform, as determined by immunoblot analysis (panels B andC). This finding allowed us to examine by another approach whether any functional differences could be attributed to the isoforms, and we specifically sought to determine whether SFDβ could substitute for SFDα in the proton pump of chromaffin granules, which, in its native form, contains only SFDα. To test this possibility, we first depleted the purified chromaffin granule V-pump of SFD (Fig. 6) by treatment of holoenzyme with Zwittergent 3–16, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In panel A, SDS-PAGE reveals that the holoenzyme was found to migrate to its usual position in the glycerol gradient, as evidenced by the characteristic Coomassie stained bands of 70-, 58-, and 33-kDa, that can be visualized in lanes 3 and4. In contrast, an immunoblot performed with anti-SFD antibody (panel B) demonstrate that all immunoreactive protein was present"
https://openalex.org/W1985129022,"Src homology 2 (SH2) domains exist in many intracellular proteins and have well characterized roles in signal transduction. SH2 domains bind to phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-containing proteins. Although tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for protein-SH2 domain interactions, the binding specificity also derives from sequences C-terminal to the Tyr(P) residue. The high affinity and specificity of this interaction is critical for precluding aberrant cross-talk between signaling pathways. The p85α subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) contains two SH2 domains, and it has been proposed that in competition with Tyr(P) binding they may also mediate membrane attachment via interactions with phosphoinositide products of PI 3-kinase. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biosensor experiments to investigate interactions between the p85α SH2 domains and phosphoinositides or inositol polyphosphates. We reported previously a similar approach when demonstrating that some pleckstrin homology domains show binding specificity for distinct phosphoinositides (Salim, K., Bottomley, M. J., Querfurth, E., Zvelebil, M. J., Gout, I., Scaife, R., Margolis, R. L., Gigg, R., Smith, C. I., Driscoll, P. C., Waterfield, M. D., and Panayotou, G. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 6241–6250). However, neither SH2 domain exhibited binding specificity for phosphoinositides in phospholipid bilayers. We show that the p85α SH2 domain Tyr(P) binding pockets indiscriminately accommodate phosphoinositides and inositol polyphosphates. Binding of the SH2 domains to Tyr(P) peptides was only poorly competed for by phosphoinositides or inositol polyphosphates. We conclude that these ligands do not bind p85α SH2 domains with high affinity or specificity. Moreover, we observed that although wortmannin blocks PI 3-kinase activity in vivo, it does not affect the ability of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to bind to p85α. Consequently phosphoinositide products of PI 3-kinase are unlikely to regulate signaling through p85α SH2 domains.

These domains are commonly found in signal transduction proteins that regulate a variety of cellular processes, such as phospholipid metabolism, protein phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation, protein trafficking, and gene expression (1Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). SH2 domains mediate high affinity binding to phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) residues in proteins such as activated membrane receptors and cytosolic adaptor proteins. Three to five amino acids C-terminal to the target Tyr(P) residue bind to a groove on the SH2 domain surface and confer the specificity of interaction that is necessary to avoid aberrant signaling (2Piccione E.

The role of SH2 domains in Tyr(P)-dependent protein recruitment is critical for the assembly of active complexes of signaling proteins (4Pawson T.

The p85α/p110α Class IA phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) contains two SH2 domains in its regulatory p85α subunit (6Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A.

Upon cell stimulation, the SH2 domains bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated, membrane-bound growth factor receptors. As a result, p85α/p110α is recruited to the vicinity of its phosphoinositide substrates (7Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The p110α PI 3-kinase activity then produces 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. In this manner, p85α/p110α mediates a dramatic increase in the basal concentration of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane shortly after cell stimulation (8Carpenter C.L.

It is now clear that p85α/p110α phosphorylates phosphoinositides to produce second messengers, which control the membrane recruitment and activation of numerous signaling proteins, notably including regulators of apoptosis (10Downward J.

Many of the target proteins of these second messengers contain pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and have been shown to bind specifically to PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and/or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate in vitro and/orin vivo (13Frech M.

Indeed, numerous interactions between distinct phosphoinositides and PH domains have now been demonstrated and appear to be essential for the function of various cytoskeletal or signal transduction proteins (reviewed in Ref. 20Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, a few reports have suggested that PH domains are not unique targets of second messenger phosphoinositides produced by PI 3-kinase. It has been proposed that PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 can also bind to SH2 domains. These proposals followed the observation of an inverse correlation between the amount of p85α/p110α associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and the level of PI 3-kinase lipid products present in the cell (21Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Consequently, a model was proposed in which the PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 produced by PI 3-kinase activation could compete for Tyr(P)-bound p85α SH2 domains and directly result in the relocalization of p85α/p110α at the plasma membrane. Similarly, the production of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 may regulate additional proteins such as the tyrosine kinase Src and phospholipase C γ-1 (21Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in vitro the p85α C-terminal SH2 (C-SH2) domain can bind to PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 (21Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, it was not demonstrated that recombinant p85α C-SH2 domain can act as a faithful model of p85α activity. Indeed, we noted with intrigue that the reported interaction of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 with the p85α C-SH2 domain could be significantly inhibited by phenyl phosphate, but that such inhibition was not observed in the case of the reported interaction between PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and full-length p85α (21Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The work presented herein arose from our attempts to clarify these apparently conflicting observations and to resolve certain issues central to these models describing distinct phosphoinositide-SH2 domain interactions. Prerequisites for the models above are that the SH2 domains that interact with phosphoinositides must (a) demonstrate a significant binding affinity for these ligands and (b) discriminate between the numerous phosphoinositides present in the plasma membrane. Because we had access to appropriate reagents and assay techniques, we set out to determine whether the p85α SH2 domains indeed display clear binding specificity and affinity for distinct phosphoinositides. We report the first high resolution structural studies of model phosphoinositide-SH2 domain interactions, which we performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We also employed two sensitive biosensor assays; one to measure interactions between proteins and phospholipid bilayers containing phosphoinositides and another to measure directly the competition between Tyr(P)-containing ligands and phosphoinositides for binding to SH2 domains. In addition, we report in vivo studies in which we sought a correlation between the association of p85α with activated growth factor receptors or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and the intracellular level of PI 3-kinase products. The p85α C-SH2 domain (amino acids Glu-614–Arg-724) was expressed and purified as described previously (23Siegal G. Davis B. Kristensen S.M. Sankar A. Linacre J. Stein R.C. Panayotou G.

Stein (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London), and the protein was prepared and purified essentially as described previously (24Booker G.W. Breeze A.L. Downing A.K. Panayotou G. Gout I.

TransformedEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C to a culture density A 600 ∼ 0.8. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.2 mm. Cells were harvested after 4 h, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by a French press. For NMR spectroscopy and biosensor Tyr(P) competition assays, the GST moiety was removed by thrombin cleavage. In contrast, intact fusion protein was used in the liposome binding assays. Further protein purification was accomplished by gel filtration in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3.15N-isotopically enriched samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared as above except that cells were grown in a minimal M9 medium using 15NH4Cl (Isotec Inc.) as the sole nitrogen source.

The additional liposome components described were purchased from Sigma. For NMR spectroscopy, SH2 domain samples were prepared at 0.5 mm concentration in 600 μl. Interactions were monitored via spectra recorded during titration of the SH2 domain with 1.5-μl aliquots of test ligand (prepared at 20 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl). NMR experiments were performed at 15 °C on a Varian UNITY-plus spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz.

Sign discrimination in t1 was achieved using the States-time-proportional phase incrementation method. The HSQC spectra were acquired with 16 scans, 64 increments in t1, and sweep widths of 10000 Hz (1H) and 2400 Hz (15N). Three-dimensional15N-1H HSQC total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments were recorded to verify the published resonance assignments for the N-SH2 domain (31Hensmann M.

Phase-shifted, sine-squared shaped weighting functions and zero-filling were applied before Fourier transformation. NMR spectra were analyzed using XEASY (34Bartels C.H. Xia T. Billeter M.

Boucher, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK). Large unilamellar liposomes with a phospholipid composition approximating the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane were prepared as described previously (35Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E.

By weight, the liposomes contained 30% phosphatidylcholine, 15% sphingomyelin, 20% cholesterol, 15% phosphatidylethanolamine, 10% phosphatidylserine, and 10% of the phosphoinositide to be tested. Liposomes were used in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.466 mm CaCl2, 2.1 mmMgCl2. The basic operating procedures of the surface plasmon resonance BIAcore biosensor (BIACORE AB, Uppsala) have been published (36Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K.

The ability of immobilized GST fusion SH2 domains to bind to phosphoinositides in liposomes was examined using the method described previously (35Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J.

A precoated streptavidin biosensor chip (SA-5, BIACORE AB) was used to immobilize the N-terminal-biotinylated, Tyr(P) peptide N-biotinyl-DMSKDESVDY(P)VPMLDMK (Y(P) is phosphotyrosine). The Tyr(P) peptide was loaded in the buffer used throughout the assay: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Solutions of 0.5 μm N- or C-SH2 domain were injected over the surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C, and the maximum response was recorded. Competition experiments were performed by incubating the SH2 domains with a competitor ligand before injection. Efficacious competition resulted in a diminished response. Between injections, protein remaining bound to the biosensor was removed by a 5-μl pulse of 0.05% SDS solution. Data analysis of the competition measurements was performed with the BIAcore-2000 software package (BIACORE AB). In calculations of the half-maximal inhibitory constants (IC50), the control response from injection of SH2 domain over the biosensor surface lacking the Tyr(P) peptide was subtracted from the experimental response to yield the corrected response, R. Data was plotted as corrected response units versus concentration of competitor and were fitted to the following equation using a nonlinear least-squares analysis: R =R max/[1 + (C/IC50) P], whereR max is the response for SH2 binding in the absence of competitor, C is the concentration of competitor, and P is the Hill coefficient. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm dishes and serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum for 16 h. Cells grown on 150-mm dishes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with wortmannin (100 nm in Me2SO) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO and subsequently stimulated with recombinant PDGF-β (100 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C. The dishes were then placed on ice, washed once in ice-cold PBS buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and lysed for 20 min on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1%(w/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 7 mm diisopropylphosphofluoridate, 1 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 20 μmleupeptin, 18 μm pepstatin, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium molybdate). The cells were then scraped from the dishes and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and incubated with the relevant antibody with constant agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 10 μl of bead slurry/sample was then added, and the incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C on a wheel. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting or assayed for PI 3-kinase activity. PI 3-kinase activity was assayed on immunoprecipitates resuspended in 25 μl of 2× kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). PtdIns stored in CHCl3solution was dried, sonicated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and added to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The reactions (50-μl final volume) were started by the addition of 40 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P ]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 3.5 mmMgCl2. Kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. For phospholipid extraction, 200 μl of 1:1 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH was added. The organic phase was collected and re-extracted with 40 μl of 1:1 (v/v) 1n HCl/CH3OH. The samples were then dried, resuspended in 30 μl of CHCl3/ CH3OH 1:1 (v/v), and spotted onto prechanneled silica gel 60 TLC plates (Whatman) that had been pretreated in 1% (w/v) oxalic acid, 1 mmEDTA, H2O/CH3OH (60:40 (v/v) and baked for 15 min at 110 °C. The plates were developed in propanol, 2m acetic acid 65:35 (v/v), and the radioactive spots were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gels (7.5%) were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman Sciences) using a semi-dry blotter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were then blocked for 1 h in PBS buffer containing 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20000. The relevant primary antibodies were diluted in PBS buffer and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) and incubated with the membranes for 2 h. After extensive washing in PBS/Tween, the blots were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dako) at 1:2000 dilution. The membranes were then washed in PBS/Tween, and the bands were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the structural details of the interactions between the p85α SH2 domains and a range of candidate phosphoinositide and inositol polyphosphate ligands.15N-1H HSQC NMR spectra were recorded during titrations of 15N-labeled SH2 domain with unlabeled test ligands. It is well established that observations of chemical shift perturbations upon titration with a ligand can be a sensitive probe of the ligand binding site of a protein (37Otting G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 760-768Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Van Nuland N.A. Kroon G.J. Dijkstra K. Wolters G.K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During the titration, changes in 15N and 1H chemical shift values for each residue were monitored by measuring changes in the cross-peak positions of assigned resonances. For both p85α SH2 domains, the introduction of any of the phosphoinositide or inositol polyphosphate ligands tested resulted in significant chemical shift perturbations for a limited set of cross-peaks (Fig.1). For both the p85α N- and C-SH2 domains, it was observed that the overall pattern of chemical shift changes induced by the addition of the ligands are similar in both direction and magnitude. The small differences in the perturbation direction seen in the case of phenyl phosphate (Fig. 1, panels E and I) result from additional ring-current shift effects induced by its aromatic group. Most notably, there seem to be very few differences when comparing the effects of d-Ins (1,4,5)P3, d-Ins (1,3,4,5)P4,l-Ins (1,3,4,5)P4, or di-C6-PIP3. The results with d-Ins (1,4,5)P3 andl-α-glycerophospho-d-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate were also qualitatively similar to the data obtained with the other inositol polyphosphates (data not shown). By mapping of the chemical shift perturbation data onto the three-dimensional protein structures, the ligand binding sites of the p85α N- and C-SH2 domains were determined. In all cases, it was seen that the SH2 domain residues affected by the ligands are similar and are localized to a discrete region of the protein structure (Fig.2). The results obtained for di-C6-PIP3, the inositol polyphosphates, and phenyl phosphate show that all these ligands bind to the region corresponding to the Tyr(P) binding pocket seen in the high resolution structures of p85α SH2 domains (39Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 364-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Breeze A.L. Kara B.V. Barratt D.G. Anderson M. Smith J.C. Luke R.W. Best J.R. Cartlidge S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3579-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). From quantitative analysis of the chemical shift variation in the NMR studies, the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) of the interactions of the SH2 domains with di-C6-PIP3 and inositol polyphosphates were found to be between 0.5 and 1 mm. However, these averaged values contain ranging contributions from different residues involved in the binding and therefore are best considered as approximation estimates. The absence of chemical shift perturbations for the majority of SH2 domain resonances suggests that the ligands tested neither induced long range conformational changes nor resulted in local or global unfolding of the protein structure. Because the results from NMR spectroscopy showed that phosphoinositides and inositol polyphosphates can all bind to the Tyr(P) binding pockets of both p85α SH2 domains, an assay was performed to assess whether these interactions were sufficiently strong to displace Tyr(P)-containing ligands. A biosensor-based competition assay was used to measure the binding of p85α SH2 domains to an immobilized Tyr(P) peptide with the sequence DMSKDESVDY(P)VPMLDMK (Y(P) is phosphotyrosine). This phosphopeptide corresponds to the autophosphorylation site at Tyr751 of the PDGF-β receptor and is known to bind to both p85α SH2 domains with high affinity (K D ∼ 200 nm) (3Panayotou G. Gish G. End P. Truong O. Gout I. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Hiles I. Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosensor results revealed that when present in relatively high concentrations, di-C6-PIP3 or any of the inositol polyphosphate ligands tested can compete for the interaction between the p85α SH2 domains and the immobilized Tyr(P) peptide ligand. However, it was readily apparent that free Tyr(P) peptide was a much more effective competitor than any of the other ligands tested, by a factor ∼1000 (Fig. 3). By curve-fitting the data to obtain IC50 values for the interactions, it was observed"

Such morphological change is believed to play an important role in establishing malignant characteristics of cancer cells. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a converging downstream event of transforming activities of many oncogene products commonly found in human cancers. Intracellular calcium is known to regulate cellular morphology. In fibroblasts, Ca2+ influx is primarily controlled by two types of Ca2+ channels (T- and L-types). Here, we report that the T-type current was specifically inhibited in cells expressing oncogenically activated Ras as well as gain-of-function mutant MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase, a direct activator of MAPK), whereas treatment of ras-transformed cells with a MEK-specific inhibitor restored T-type Ca2+channel activity. Using a T-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, we further found that suppression of the T-type Ca2+channel by the activated MAPK pathway is a prerequisite event for the induction and/or maintenance of transformation-associated morphological changes.

Oncogenically transformed cells display many properties that are not observed in normal cells. One such transformed phenotype is the change in cell morphology. For example, the introduction of oncogenically activated Ras into fibroblasts induces a round-up or spindle-shaped morphology, which in turn disrupts the regulatory mechanisms controlling cell-cell contact and cell-substratum adhesivity and, thus, is believed to contribute to malignant (metastatic) phenotypes of cancer cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Andersson P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1980; 33: 109-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium is known to play an important role in establishment of cellular morphology. Early studies showed the calcium sensitivity of actin and actin-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Weeds A. Nature. 1982; 296: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), major cytoskeletal components (reviewed in Refs. 3Stossel T.P. Chaponnier C. Ezzell R.M. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, calcium ions regulate the formation of actin bundles and networks (5Yin H.L. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. J. Biol.

It has also been shown that ectopic expression of calmodulin, a major intracellular Ca2+-binding protein (reviewed in Ref. 7Kretsinger R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) or administration of calmodulin-antagonists disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis, leading to changes in cell morphology and cytoskeleton organization (8Rasmussen C.

Microinjection of villin, a Ca2+-regulated F-actin bundling and nucleating protein (reviewed in Refs. 9Mooseker M.S. Annu. Rev.

Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that calcium signaling is important for maintaining proper cell morphology. In fibroblasts, two major voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are present: L (long-lasting, large conductance)-type and T (transient)-type channels (12Chen C. Corbley M.J. Roberts T.M. Hess P. Science. 1988; 239: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Peres A. Zippel R. Sturani E. Mostacciuolo G. Pfluegers Arch. 1988; 411: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). L- and T-type channels are distinguished by differences in their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (reviewed in Refs.14Bean B.P. Annu. Rev.

Biomembr. 1998; 30: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The L-type channel requires strong depolarization for activation, shows high sensitivity to dihydropyridines, and inactivates slowly. In contrast, the T-type is a rapidly inactivating channel activated by weak depolarizations and is resistant to organic blockers of L-type channels but relatively sensitive to mibefradil. Because of the low fluctuation of membrane potential in fibroblasts, T-type channels are thought to impart a greater influence on fibroblast physiology than L-type (13Peres A. Zippel R. Sturani E. Mostacciuolo G. Pfluegers Arch. 1988; 411: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Okada Y. Doida Y. Roy G. Tsuchiya W. Inouye K. Inouye A. J. Membr.

In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts transformed by various oncogenes (i.e., v-ras, v-fms, or polyoma virus middle T oncogenes), T-type channel currents have been shown to be specifically suppressed (12Chen C. Corbley M.J. Roberts T.M. Hess P. Science. 1988; 239: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ras is a plasma membrane-localized GDP/GTP-binding protein that is active in the GTP-bound state and functions as an extracellular mitogenic signal transducer. Activating mutations of Ras results in constitutive signaling to downstream elements, leading to cellular transformation (reviewed in Refs. 22Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar and 23Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To date, three major effector pathways of Ras have been characterized in detail: the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pF, picofarads1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pF, picofarads pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and the Ral/GDS pathway (most recently reviewed in Refs. 24Khosravi-Far R.

We found that Ras mutants lacking the ability to activate the MAPK pathway failed to inhibit T-type Ca2+ channel current, whereas Ras mutants that activate only the MAPK pathway efficiently inhibit T-type channel activity. Moreover, the introduction of the constitutively active MEK results in inhibition of the T-type Ca2+ channel current. By use of the T-type channel blocker, mibefradil, we further found that the suppression of the T-type Ca2+ channel is essential for the induction and/or maintenance of spindle-shape transformation morphology in fibroblasts. Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (this medium will be referred to as complete medium hereafter) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Plasmids were transfected by the calcium phosphate method previously described (51Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes 24 h before transfection. The Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected with the following Ras mutant plasmids: 12V, 12V35S, 12V37G, 12V40C with pKOneo plasmid encoding a neomycin-resistance gene in a 20:1 molar ratio. The ras mutant genes were tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, and expression was controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Swiss 3T3 cells were also transfected with a plasmid encoding a gain-of-function MAPK kinase (MEK) mutant gene (ΔN3-S218E-S222D (52Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Van Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar)). Transfected cells were selected in medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml). In rasmutant-transfected cells, G418-resistant colonies were pooled. For cells transfected with the MEK mutant, G418 resistant colonies were subcloned. Ba2+ currents through endogenous voltage-dependent Ca2+channels expressed in cells stably transfected with 12V, 12V35S, 12V37G, 12V40C, and MEK were recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (53Hamill O.P. Marty A. Nehrer E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). All recordings were done at room temperature. Cells were incubated in a bath solution containing (20 mm BaCl2, 135 mmtetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). The patch electrodes were pulled and fire polished, after which they had an electrical resistance of ∼3 megaohms when filled with an internal solution containing (140 mml-aspartate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm pyruvate Na+, 5 mm oxaloacetate, 5 mm creatine, 10 mm HEPES/CsOH (pH 7.4)). Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier and analyzed using the pClamp (version 6.02, Axon instruments, Inc.) software. Whole cell capacitive transients were compensated on-line, and linear leakage currents were cancelled using a P/4 subpulse protocol. The data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz via a Lambaster interface (Axon instruments Inc., Burlingame, CA). L-type currents were elicited by ten 10-mV depolarizing test pulses between −20 to +70 mV from a holding potential of −30 mV, where T-type was completely inactivated. T-type currents were evoked by using ten 10-mV step pulses from −40 to +50 mV, with a holding potential of −80 mV in the presence of 1 μm nifedipine. Identity of L- and T-type currents were confirmed by their sensitivity to nifedipine and mibefradil, respectively. To prepare cell lysates, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in SDS-Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were sonicated, boiled for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The lysates were further denatured for 5 min at 95 °C in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). The proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) dry milk) at room temperature (20–22 °C). After multiple washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with primary polyclonal antibodies: anti-HA (clone Y-11, Santa Cruz), anti-MEK-1 (clone 12-B, Santa Cruz), or anti-phosphorylated MAPK (New England Biolab). The blots were then washed thoroughly with TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-antigen complex was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Because of the p53-dependent toxicity associated with overexpression of Ras, Swiss 3T3 cells stably transfected with human p53 mutant (Val at amino acid residue 143 was changed to Ala) were transiently transfected with ras mutant plasmids (25 μg/100-mm plate). Cells were then incubated in media supplemented with 1% FBS and appropriate Ca2+ channel antagonists. Five to 7 days after transfection, cells were fixed, and either Giemsa-stained or processed for immunostaining as described below. Transiently transfected cells grown on slides with 1% FBS and respective Ca2+ channel antagonist were washed with PBS and then fixed with 10% formalin. The cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with blocking solution (10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h and probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were washed three times with PBS. Cells were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) DNA dye for visualization of nuclei. To elucidate which downstream Ras signaling pathway(s) is involved in suppression of the T-type Ca2+ channel, Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected with four different Ha-ras mutants (12V, 12V35S, 12V37G, 12V40C) (39Rodriguez-Viciana P.

The 12V37G (Gly-12 → Val,Glu-37 → Gly) and 12V40C (Gly-12 → Val,Tyr-40 → Cys) mutants were identified by their ability to signal downstream effectors via a Raf-independent pathway. The downstream effector activated by the 12V37G mutant is the Ral/GDS pathway and that activated by the 12V40C mutant is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (48White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 cells transfected with these mutants tagged with influenza virus HA epitope were pooled and selected, and expression of the Ras mutants were examined by immunoblot analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig.1). All pooled cells expressed similar levels of transfected Ras proteins. Calcium channel currents were measured in the mutant Ras-expressing cells by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique using Ba2+ as the external charge carrier. Electrophysiological dissection of Ca2+ channels required that we take advantage of the different voltage dependence of channel gating between the L- and T-type channels. L-type currents were recorded using a holding potential of −30 mV, a voltage in which T-type channels are inactivated and 10-mV step pulses from −20 mV to +70 mV. Representative Ba2+ current (I Ba) traces of the control cells as well as 12V, 12V35S, 12V37G, and 12V40C Ras mutant-expressing cell lines are shown in Fig.2 (columns A andB), and the corresponding current-voltage relationships of peak I Ba density are shown in column C. L-type currents were detected in all the cell lines tested. The average L-type current density for control Swiss 3T3 cells was 3.21 ± 0.58 pA/pF (n = 9) and 2.82 ± 0.37 pA/pF (n = 12) for 12V, 2.33 ± 0.51 pA/pF (n = 8) for 12V40C, 1.68 ± 0.34 pA/pF (n = 12) for 12V35S, and 2.20 ± 0.37 pA/pF (n = 9) for 12V37G (Fig.3). The L-type channel current peaked at +30 mV, and there was no significant difference in the voltage dependence among the controls and mutant Ras expressors.Figure 3Current densities of L- and T-type Ca2+ channels of the control Swiss 3T3 cells and Ha-Ras effector domain mutant-expressing cells. The current density of each cell line was calculated from the results shown in Fig. 2 and presented as mean ±S.E. The statistical significance was analyzed using the Student's t test. The decrease of T-type Ca2+ currents in 12V and 12V35S Ras mutant-expressing cells is statistically significant (p < 0.05) as indicated by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To isolate T-type current, Ba2+ currents were elicited from a holding potential of −80 mV in the presence of the L-type channel blocker, nifedipine (1 μm). The control cells elicited a T-type peak I Ba with a current density of 0.62 ± 0.10 pA/pF (n = 5). The 12V37G mutant line had a current density of similar amplitude (0.55 ± 0.14 pA/pF (n = 5)), whereas the 12V40C line displayed a slightly higher T-type current density (0.87 ± 0.12 pA/pF (n = 8)). The 12V mutant had a T-type current density of 0.008 ± 0.003 pA/pF (n = 7) that was significantly less than that of the control (p < 0.001). Similar to 12V, diminished T-type current was observed in the 12V35S expressor, which had a T-type current density of peakI Ba of 0.005 ± 0.003 pA/pF (n = 12), which is also significantly less than that of the control (p < 0.001). The threshold current for the L-type channel activation in both the mutants and control cells was approximately −10 mV (Fig. 2, column C). The T-type currents in the control, 12V37G, and 12V40C cells were activated approximately at a threshold of −30 mV and peaked at +10 mV with no significant difference in their voltage dependence (Fig. 2,column C). The absence of T-type currents in both 12V- and 12V35S- expressing cells suggests that the activation of the MAPK pathway may be responsible for suppression of T-type Ca2+channel activity. Mibefradil is a T-type-selective Ca2+ channel antagonist (54Mehrke G. Zong X.G. Flockerzi V. Hoffman F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1483-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 55Mishra S.K. Hermsmeyer K. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 144-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such, we sought to determine the sensitivity of endogenous T-type Ca2+ channels to mibefradil in Swiss 3T3 cells. The treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with 1 μm mibefradil caused approximately 50% reduction in T-type Ca2+ channel currents (Fig. 4). In the presence of 3 μm mibefradil, T-type Ca2+ channel currents were completely abolished (Fig. 4), whereas there was no change in L-type channel currents (data not shown). Similar results have been previously reported for the recently cloned α1H T-type Ca2+ channel from heart (56Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Yang J. Satin J. Zhang Y. Daud A. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Perez-Reyes E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). To test whether the activation of the MAPK pathway is responsible for inhibition of the T-type Ca2+ channel, Swiss 3T3 cells were stably transfected with a gain-of-function MEK mutant (ΔN3-S218E-S222D (52Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Van Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar)). The expression of this MEK mutant results in constitutive activation of MAPK (52Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Van Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). The G418-resistant colonies were subcloned (3T3/MEK1 and -2), and subjected to immunoblot analysis for expression of MEK (Fig.5 A). Both 3T3/MEK1 and -2 expressed higher levels of MEK than the control Swiss 3T3 cells that were transfected with a vector plasmid. The 3T3/MEK1 and -2 cell lines were further tested for activation of MAPK by immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphorylated (activated) MAPK antibody (Fig. 5 B). As expected, activated MAPK was present in both MEK-transfected cell lines. The 3T3/MEK1 and 2 cell lines were tested electrophysiologically. Similar to 12V and 12V35S-expressing cell lines, the 3T3/MEK1 cells exhibited an L-type current density of 3.3 ± 0.39 pA/pF (n = 11) and a T-type density of 0.005 ± 0.003 pA/pF (n = 8). The latter was significantly less (p < 0.001) than control cells (Fig.6 D). We obtained similar recordings in the 3T3/MEK2 cells (data not shown). To further show that activation of the MAPK pathway is responsible for inhibition of T-type channels in ras-transformed cells, Swiss 3T3 cells expressing the 12V Ras mutant were pretreated with the MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (57Dudley D.T.

Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar) for 24 h. We found that the T-type Ca2+ channel currents recovered to the levels similar to that of control Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 6, column B) with a current density of 0.67 ± 0.2 pA/pF (n = 6) after PD98059 treatment (Fig. 6 D). Thus, we conclude that activation of the MAPK pathway is responsible for the T-type Ca2+ channel depression in ras-transformed cells. Activation of the MAPK pathway is common in cells transformed by many oncogene products and frequently observed in cancer cells (most recently reviewed in Ref. 59Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether inhibition of the T-type Ca2+ channel by the MAPK pathway would have a role in cellular transformation. It has been shown that Swiss 3T3 cells are transformed efficiently with oncogenically activated Ras (Ras 12V) when co-transfected with mutant p53 (60Eliyahu D. Michalovitz D. Eliyahu S.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1083-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of oncogenically activated Ras induces cell cycle arrest and cell death in a p53-dependent manner (62Hicks G.G. Egan S.E. Greenberg A.H. Mowat M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 64Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3858) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to use the Swiss 3T3 cell line stably transfected with the dominant negative mutant p53 (V143A), 3T3/p53(V143A). We found that the expression of mutant p53 did not affect the overall Ca2+channel activity because the 3T3/p53(V143A) cells exhibited both L- and T-type Ca2+ channel currents similar to those of control Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown). We then transiently transfected 3T3/p53(V143A) cells with the following Ras effector mutants: 12V, 12V37G, 12V40C, and 12V37G + 12V40C. The transfected cells were incubated under low growth conditions (1% serum) for ∼7 days. As expected, 12V-transfected cells showed a spindle morphology typical of transformed"

We examined the possible presence of self-inhibitory segments within the enzyme molecule for the purpose of developing anticaries measures through GTF inhibition. Twenty-two synthetic peptides derived from various regions presumably responsible for insoluble-glucan synthesis were studied with respect to their effects on catalytic activity. One of them, which is identical in amino acid sequence to residues 1176–1194, significantly and specifically inhibited both sucrose hydrolysis and glucosyl transfer to glucan by GTF-I. Double-reciprocal analysis revealed that the inhibition is noncompetitive. Scramble peptides, composed of the identical amino acids in randomized sequence, had no effect on GTF-I activity. Furthermore, the peptide is tightly bound to the enzyme once complexed, even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Kinetic analysis using an optical evanescent resonant mirror cuvette system demonstrated that the enzyme-peptide interaction was biphasic. These results indicate that the peptide directly interacts with the enzyme with high affinity and inhibits its activity in a sequence-specific manner. This peptide itself could possibly be an effective agent for prevention of dental caries, although its effectiveness may be improved by further modification.

Glucan synthesis catalyzed by glucosyltransferases (GTFs; sucrose 6-glucosyltransferase, EC2.4.1.5) 1The abbreviations used are: GTF, glucosyltransferase; GTF-I, insoluble-glucan synthesis glucosyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; QAE, diethyl[2-hydroxypropyl]aminoethyl1The abbreviations used are: GTF, glucosyltransferase; GTF-I, insoluble-glucan synthesis glucosyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; QAE, diethyl[2-hydroxypropyl]aminoethyl of the oral streptococci is critical in the development of dental caries. This is the first step in the formation of dental plaque, which mediates the aggregation of cariogenic microorganisms, which in turn leads to acid demineralization of the tooth enamel. Therefore, GTF activity is a potential up-stream target in the pathological cascade (1Loesche W.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 353-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuramitsu H.K. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 159-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). GTFs catalyze two sequential reactions: the cleavage of sucrose into fructose and an enzyme-bound glucosyl moiety (sucrase activity), and the subsequent transfer of the latter to the C-3/C-6 position of the glucose residue of glucan (transferase activity) or to water (3Russell R.R.B. Archs. Oral Biol. 1990; 35: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In accordance with these enzymatic properties, GTFs have two relatively independent structural domains, a catalytic domain comprised of the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein and a glucan-binding domain comprised of the remaining one-third (4Mooser G. Wong C. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 880-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these domains are common among GTFs found in streptococci and the sequences of the active sites are highly conserved (3Russell R.R.B. Archs. Oral Biol. 1990; 35: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Hanada N. Isobe Y. Aizawa Y. Katayama T. Sato S. Inoue M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each GTF exhibits distinct enzyme activity that differs in position of glucosyl linkage of product and/or primer requirement for catalytic activity (1Loesche W.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 353-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Russell R.R.B. Archs. Oral Biol. 1990; 35: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), a major causative organism of human dental caries, produces three GTFs,i.e. GTF-I (gtfB) and GTF-SI (gtfC), which catalyze primarily the synthesis of α-1,3-linked water-insoluble glucan and low molecular water-soluble glucan in a primer-independent manner, and GTF-S (gtfD), which catalyzes the synthesis of α-1,6-linked water-soluble glucan in a primer-dependent manner (6Aoki H. Shiroza T. Hayakawa M. Sato S. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 587-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hanada N. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hanada N. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption analysis of genes encoding these GTFs revealed that the synthesis of water-insoluble glucan is essential to the cariogenesis of S. mutans. (9Yamashita Y. Bowen W.H. Burne R.A. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3811-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTF-I is composed of 1475 amino acids with a signal peptide of 34 residues at the N-terminal (10Shiroza T. Ueda S. Kuramitsu H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4263-4270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence responsible for sucrose binding was proposed to be DSIRVDAVD (residues 446–454), and Asp451 was identified as one of the active centers for catalytic activity (11Mooser G. Hefta S.A. Paxton R.J. Shively J.E. Lee T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8916-8922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kato C. Nakano Y. Lis M. Kuramitsu H.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1184-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C-terminal glucan-binding domain consists of six highly homologous repeating units of approximately 65-amino acid residues each, and deletion analysis has revealed that the presence of more than three of these units is necessary for GTF to be able to catalyze glucan synthesis (13Kato C. Kuramitsu H.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 72: 299-302Crossref Google Scholar). However, details of the mechanism of catalytic action and structure-function relationships of GTF remain yet unknown. In the present study, we paid special attention to the fact that several enzymes, for example protein kinase C, have been reported to contain autoinhibitory sequences (14House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 15Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, peptides corresponding to the partial sequences of proteins can mimic the original function of the region and can be used to characterize the functional domains (16Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on these facts, we synthesized 19-mer peptides corresponding to various regions of GTF-I and examined their ability to modulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that a peptide, corresponding to residues 1176–1194, inhibits GTF-I activity in a sequence-specific manner and three other peptides, covering residues 902–943, increase GTF-I activity. We further report the examination of the interaction between GTF-I and the inhibitory peptide. Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase Merrifield method (18Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6574) Google Scholar) in a model 350 peptide synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY) and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a TSKgel column (ODS-Prep, Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan). The molecular masses of peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry (JMS.-HX-110A/110A, JEOL Co., Tokyo, Japan). GTF-I was prepared fromStreptococcus milleri transformant KSB8 cells expressing thegtfB gene (19Fukushima K. Ikeda T. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. milleri is a noncariogenic oral streptococcus variant that cannot synthesize extracellular glucans natively and therefore is more suitable than S. mutans for characterization of GTFs employing recombinant protein expression systems (19Fukushima K. Ikeda T. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kato C. Kuramitsu H.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 79: 153-158Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, the cells cultured anaerobically overnight at 37 °C were collected by centrifugation, washed, and sonicated in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for isolation of the cell-associated GTF-I. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used as crude GTF-I. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the transfer of 1.0 μmol of glucose from sucrose to glucan/min. For further purification, the crude enzyme solution was applied to a QAE column (Shimadzu, shim-pack, 1.4 ml) connected to a Shimadzu high performance liquid chromatography system. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–0.7 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The fraction eluted at the NaCl concentration of 0.65 m yielded a GTF-I single band on SDS-PAGE. For the following assay, the aliquots of the fraction were dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). For the binding experiment using an optical evanescent resonant biosensor, which requires a larger amount than for the above purpose, GTF-I was partially purified using a chromatofocusing column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After eluting most of the proteins with Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm histidine buffer (pH 6.0), the adsorbed protein including GTF-I was eluted with 1 m NaCl in 20 mm histidine buffer (pH 6.0) to recover a larger portion of the enzyme. For the following assay, the aliquots of the fraction were dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer including 150 mm NaCl (pH 6.0). To measure GTF-I activity, we employed a biochemical assay kit in view of the advantage of being able to examine sucrose hydrolysis and glucosyl moiety transfer to glucan separately. For the inhibition assay, 10 milliunits of GTF-I was preincubated in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml synthetic peptide in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 25 °C for 1 h or 4 °C overnight unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. The reaction was started by addition of sucrose and, after incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, was stopped by heating at 80 °C for 5 min. The amounts of glucose and fructose in the reaction mixture were measured by use of an F-kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The amount of fructose in the reaction mixture represents the level of sucrase activity, and the difference between the amount of free glucose and that of free fructose in the reaction mixture represents the amount of glucan, the level of total GTF-I activity (21Yamashita Y. Hanada N. Takehara T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6265-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the ratio of the amount of glucan to that of fructose represents the level of glucosyl transfer activity of GTF-I (transfer activity ratio). For activity staining, 50 milliunits of GTF-I was preincubated in the presence or absence of 500 μg/ml synthetic peptide in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 4 °C overnight, followed by addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) solubilization buffer to the reaction mixture and SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar), without heating of the samples to avoid heat denaturation of the enzyme. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gel was washed in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated in sucrose buffer containing 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.125% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmEDTA, and 0.01% Thimerosal, at 25 °C overnight. The synthesized glucan was observed as a white band on the polyacrylamide gel (6Aoki H. Shiroza T. Hayakawa M. Sato S. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 587-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-GTF-I antibody was raised against a synthetic 25-mer peptide, CGEFVTDRYGRISYYDANGERVRIN, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) as described previously (23Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This peptide corresponds to the C-terminal portion of GTF-I (10Shiroza T. Ueda S. Kuramitsu H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4263-4270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 milliunits of GTF-I was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis using anti-GTF-I antibody was performed as described previously (23Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptide was coupled to support matrix, Affi-Gel 10 gel (Bio-Rad) in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). The gel was preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation with crude GTF-I solution at 4 °C overnight in the presence or absence of 500 μg/ml peptide 14. The gel was washed by subjecting it to 10 min of agitation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation and discard of the supernatant, repeated 5 times. The gel was suspended in SDS-PAGE solubilization buffer and incubated at 100 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-GTF-I antibody as described above. An optical evanescent resonant mirror cuvette system (IAsys, Affinity Sensors, UK) was used to measure the interaction of peptide with GTF-I as described (24Edward R.P. Gill A. Pollard-Knight D.V.

The cuvette surface was inactivated by 1 m ethanolamine/HCl (pH 8.5) and blocked with bovine serum albumin. The association reaction of GTF-I to the immobilized peptide was started by addition of the enzyme into the cuvette, and the dissociation was by replacement of GTF-I with blank buffer. The traces of the association and dissociation process were analyzed using Fastfit analysis software supplied with the instrument. The pseudo first-rate constant, k on, was obtained for each concentration of the analyte protein. The slope of the plot of k on against the analyte protein concentration provides the value for the association rate constant,ka, and the intercept provides the value for the dissociation rate constant, kd. The affinity constant, KD,was calculated from the equation,KD =kd/ka (24Edward R.P. Gill A. Pollard-Knight D.V. Hoare M. Buckle P.E. Lowe P.A. Leatherbarrow R.J. Anal.

TableI shows the code numbers of the synthetic peptides, their amino acid sequences, the corresponding amino acid positions in GTF-I, their net charge, and their effects on GTF-I activity. We synthesized 19-mer peptides derived from various GTF-I regions highly conserved among GTFs of oral streptococci (3Russell R.R.B. Archs. Oral Biol. 1990; 35: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Hanada N. Isobe Y. Aizawa Y. Katayama T. Sato S. Inoue M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because we speculated that these regions were of structural and/or functional importance. The sequences of peptides 32, 33, 1, and 2 are located upstream of the active center of sucrose hydrolysis, those of peptides 13 and 14 are located in the glucan-binding domain at the C terminus, and those of the others are located between the active center for sucrose hydrolysis and the glucan-binding domain (Fig.1). The role of the region between the active center and the glucan-binding domain has not yet been reported on. Some peptides, including the one corresponding to the active site sequence, were not examined for their effects on GTF-I activity because of their low solubility in buffer solution. Of 22 peptides tested, peptide 14 (residues 1176–1194) had significant effects on GTF-I activity (Table I). Peptide 14 inhibited both sucrase activity and transferase activity of the enzyme, resulting in a marked reduction in the amount of glucan. No inhibitory effects of the peptides on hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities used for the biochemical assay were detected even at a higher concentration of the peptides than that used in Table I. On the other hand, peptides 23, 24, and 31, corresponding to residues 902–943, increased GTF-I activity by about 20–35%. These peptides primarily affected sucrase activity, whereas in the presence of these peptides the transferase activity ratio remained essentially unchanged.Table ISynthetic GTF peptides used in this study and their effects on GTF-I activityPeptide No.Amino acid residueSequenceNet chargeSucrase activityaGTF activity in the presence of 30 μg/ml of peptide.

Open table in a new tab Next, we examined the mechanisms of inhibition of GTF-I activity by peptide 14. GTF-I activity in the presence or absence of peptide 14 at various concentrations of sucrose was examined, and the results and deduced Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots are shown in Fig. 2. Peptide 14 inhibited both sucrase and GTF-I activities in a noncompetitive manner, indicating that peptide 14 interacted with enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex (Fig. 2, D and E). In the absence of peptide 14, about 70–80% of glucose moiety was transferred to glucan, and in the presence of peptide 14, only 25–30% of glucose moiety was transferred at any concentration of sucrose (Fig. 2 C). The secondary plots deduced from the double-reciprocal plots yielded an apparentK i of 10.5 μm for GTF-I activity (mean of three independent experiments, S.D. = 4.5). The inhibition of GTF-I activity by peptide 14 was dose-dependent, and the concentration of the inhibitor giving 50% inhibition (IC50) was about 3 μm (Fig.3).Figure 3Dose-dependent effect of peptide 14 on GTF-I activity. The effects of various concentrations of peptide 14 on GTF-I activity are shown. GTF-I was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of peptide, and the activity was measured as described above with 10 mm sucrose. The values are means of triplicate determinations, and the error bars indicate S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To rule out the possible involvement of other putative components which might interact with peptide 14 to affect GTF-I activity, we examined the effect of peptide 14 on purified GTF-I. The crude enzyme solution was applied to an anion exchange HPLC, and the fraction eluted at the NaCl concentration of 0.65 m yielded a GTF-I single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A), although GTF-I activities were eluted broadly at NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.25 m to 0.7 m (data not shown). We used this fraction as purified GTF-I to examine the effect of peptide 14, and peptide 14 inhibited the enzyme activity to a similar degree as shown with crude enzyme (Figs. 3 and 4 B). Furthermore, we synthesized two scramble peptides, pep14/sc1 and pep14/sc2, to evaluate the sequence specificity of the inhibition (Fig.5 A). The scramble peptides have the identical amino acid compositions as that of peptide 14, but the sequences are randomized (29Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, neither pep14/sc1 nor pep14/sc2 inhibited GTF-I activity. This result excluded the possibility that the inhibition was because of the net charge of the peptide and indicated that peptide 14 inhibited the GTF-I activity in a sequence-specific manner. We further examined the effects of peptide 14 by activity staining. The enzyme preincubated in the presence or absence of synthetic peptide was subjected to SDS-PAGE without heating of the samples, and after electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gel was incubated in sucrose buffer. As shown in Fig. 6 A, peptide 14 inhibited glucan synthesis by GTF-I on the polyacrylamide gel. pep14/sc1 had no effect on enzyme activity, consistent with the results in Fig. 5. In addition, we examined the interaction of GTF-I and peptide 14 using the support gel (Fig. 6 B). GTF-I was co-precipitated with peptide 14 coupled to the gel as revealed by Western blot analysis, whereas it was not co-precipitated with pep14/sc2. Furthermore, addition of excess free peptide 14 in the reaction solution resulted in the disappearance of co-precipitated GTF-I. Moreover, the interaction between GTF-I and peptide 14 was confirmed using an optical evanescent resonant mirror cuvette system (IAsys). GTF-I of various concentrations from 100 nm to 1 μm was examined for association/dissociation to peptide 14 immobilized on the aminosilane cuvette. We did not add the substrate into the enzyme solution in this experiment because the glucan product caused aggregation of the enzyme and would interfere with the analysis. As shown in Fig.7, the interaction was dependent on the enzyme concentration. The traces of the association and dissociation were analyzed using Fastfit analysis software. Analysis revealed that the interaction was biphasic and yielded first and second rate constants, k on(1)and k on(2). ka,kd, and KD obtained from the results of k on(1) were 8.2 × 104m−1s−1, 9.8 × 10−3 s−1, and 120 nm, respectively, and 8.3 × 103m−1s−1, 2.3 × 10−3 s−1, and 277 nm, respectively, from k on(2). These results strongly indicate that GTF-I and peptide 14 directly interacted in a biphasic manner, although the critical region of interaction of both was not identified, and that this complex could not be separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate during electrophoresis.Figure 7The interaction between GTF-I and immobilized peptide 14 on aminosilane surface cuvette. Peptide 14 was immobilized on aminosilane cuvette of an optical evanescent resonant mirror cuvette system. GTF-I of the indicated concentration was added into the cuvette and was replaced with blank buffer at the time indicated by the arrowhead. Association/dissociation of GTF-I to immobilized peptide 14 was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report, we have demonstrated that peptides derived from GTF-I affected the enzyme activity; those corresponding to residues 902–943 (peptides 23, 24, and 31) elevated GTF-I activity, and the one corresponding to residue 1176–1194 (peptide 14) inhibited GTF-I activity. Peptide 14 directly interacted with GTF-I in a biphasic manner to inhibit the enzyme activity (Figs. 4, 6, and 7), and this inhibition was noncompetitive with the substrate sucrose (Fig. 2). Furthermore, inhibition was in a sequence-specific manner, and the net charge of the peptide does not explain the inhibition because neither peptides with similar net charge (Table I) nor scramble peptides (Fig.5) were effective. Several proteinaceous inhibitors of α-amylase, a GTF-related enzyme, have been identified, for example tandemstat (30Vertesy L. Oeding V. Bender R. Zepf K. Nesemann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the complex of tandemstat and amylase cannot be separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (30Vertesy L. Oeding V. Bender R. Zepf K. Nesemann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), similar to the case for peptide 14 and GTF-I (Fig. 6 A). However, no marked amino acid sequence homology was found between tandemstat and peptide 14, and peptide 14 does not contain the consensus sequence WRY, which is typical of the amylase inhibitors that bind to the catalytic site (31Wiegand G. Epp O. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The residues 1176–1194, represented by peptide 14, are located in the second repeating unit in the glucan binding domain. Because the mode of inhibition by peptide 14 is noncompetitive (Fig. 2) and because the peptide is tightly bound to the enzyme once complexed (Fig. 6), this segment may play a crucial role in regulation of the enzyme activity. The binding experiments using IAsys demonstrated that the enzyme-peptide binding processes were composed of complex molecular-to-molecular interactions (Fig. 7). The double rate constants seem to represent intrinsic biomolecular interactions, such as some conformational changes occurring after the first binding or double binding site on the enzyme, rather than the steric hindrance (27Edwards P.R. Leatherbarrow R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Hall D.R. Gorgani N.N. Altin J.G. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We suppose that the second rate binding may be important for inhibition compared with the K i and IC50 values (Figs. 2, 3, and 7) although we do not have a rationale for the difference of these values at present. However, we have cogitated that the most possible reason for the difference is the lack of the substrate sucrose in the binding experiment using IAsys. The presence of sucrose should have some influences on the enzyme-peptide interactions in the noncompetitive inhibitory reactions (Fig. 2). Also, the difference could be because of immobilization of the peptide. How the ability of the peptide to inhibit GTF-I activity is related to the function of the region corresponding to it in the molecule remains to be elucidated. However, residues 902–943 are located in the most homologous region among streptococcal GTFs (3Russell R.R.B. Archs. Oral Biol. 1990; 35: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and also have sequence similarity to barley α-amylase (approximately 70% similarity in this region) (10Shiroza T. Ueda S. Kuramitsu H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4263-4270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ferretti J.J. Gilpin M.L. Russell R.R.B. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 8169-8174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting its functional importance. Therefore, it is possible that interactions of the synthetic peptides with the enzyme region in a homophilic manner may have resulted in modulated activity. Alternatively, these peptides may have interfered with conformational changes and/or intramolecular interaction induced in GTF catalytic process by mimicking the function of the enzyme region. Our results demonstrate the possibility that the use of a peptide derived from the enzyme would be effectual to modulate enzyme activity, as well as to identify the functional domains necessary for protein-protein interactions as previous studies have shown (16Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We expect that these peptides, besides clinical applications, could be strong tools to elucidate the structure-function relationships of GTF-I, which would provide us with clues to clarify why GTF is responsible for α-1,3/1,6-glucosidic linkage, whereas most α-glucosidase, including amylase, are responsible for α-1,4/1,6-glucosidic linkage. For both these purposes, we would also like to emphasize that the effectiveness of the peptide may be further improved by additional modifications such as acetylation, amidation, and amino acid substitution/addition. We are grateful to Drs. H. Kato and H. Takeuchi of our department, and Drs. Y. Yamakawa and N. Murai of our institute for valuable discussion. We also appreciate M. Aoyagi and T.

Carcinogenesis proceeds through a series of genetic alterations involving oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (1Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3713-3721PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fearon E.R.

It is also widely believed that carcinogenic initiation is caused by genetic mutation(s) induced by carcinogens. Initiated cells continue to exhibit various unusual phenomena leading to malignant neoplasia such as morphological transformation, immortalization (4Newbold R.F. Overell R.W. Connell J.R.

Neoplastic Development. 1. Academic Press, London1969: 49-89Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying such uncertain alterations associated with all stages in carcinogenesis are still unknown. In our previous work based on the cell transformation induced by U5 small nuclear RNA (U5) (11Hamada K. Kumazaki T. Mizuno K. Yokoro K. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The morphologically transformed cells went on eventually to produce tumorigenic cells, suggesting that RNA3S+ is capable of driving the normal cells into the neoplastic stage. Additionally, RNA3S+ suppressed the fibronectin protein synthesis in HeLa cells, supporting the idea that it is indeed a new type of transforming agent. We thus call an RNA+ having a transforming activity such as RNA3S+ “transforming RNA.” Based on these results, the transforming RNA might have the ability to perturb a regulatory system to maintain the normal cellular process. This transformation was critically dependent upon the polypurine sequence GGAGAGGAA in RNA3S+. Because the cells expressing the RNA3S without a poly(A) tail (RNA3S) exhibited only a very low frequency of the morphological transformation (14Hamada K. Mizuno K. Mutat. Res. 1992; 267: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the poly(A) tail is evidently involved in the enhancement of transformation. It is known that the cap of mRNA binds to an initiation factor, eIF-4E, with several other initiation factors to be anchored to the ribosome (15Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R. J. Biol.

Standart N. Cell. 1990; 62: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 18Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 19Tarun Jr., S.Z.

In fact, RNA3S+ in 3Y1 cells was found to be associated with polysomes (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined an effect of RNA3S+ on the rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation of pre-β-lactamase and luciferase (model secretory and nonsecretory proteins) mRNAs and found that RNA3S+suppressed the secretory rather than nonsecretory protein synthesis. Proteins with a secretory signal sequence are synthesized by polysomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Signal recognition particle (SRP) is made up of 7SL or SRP RNA (about 300 nucleotides) and six polypeptides (21Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 22Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and functions in targeting most secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes (23Walter P. Lingappa V.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 499-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). 7SL RNA has the Alu portion comprising approximately 100 nucleotides from the 5′ end and 45 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the RNA (24Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nature. 1984; 312: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In the mammalian translation system, secretory protein synthesis is paused transiently at multiple sites of ribosome-associated nascent polypeptides (25Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2617-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). With this fact, it has been postulated that a translational pause may be a convenient switch by which cells could adapt the secretory protein synthesis to the secretory needs of the cells (26Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We also present evidence that the oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), corresponding to the polypurine sequence in RNA3S+and its antisense sequence, directly contacted 28 S rRNA in ribosome and 7SL RNA in SRP, respectively, and differentially affected secretory protein synthesis. Finally, we discuss a possible involvement of the transforming RNA during the process of carcinogenesis. As described previously, the 3′ half of the U5 first stem structure (nucleotides 50–78 of U5) was designated RNA3S, and its antisense counterpart was designated RNA3A (14Hamada K. Mizuno K. Mutat. Res. 1992; 267: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Synthetic cDNAs, corresponding to these RNAs, were inserted at the SmaI site of a polylinker region in pGEM3 (Promega) to give pG3S and pG3A (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The BamHI-SacI fragments from the pG constructs were then inserted at the same sites of the polylinker region in pSP64(poly(A)) (Promega) to create pS3S and pS3A that express RNA3S or RNA3A with a poly(A) tail (RNA3S+ or RNA3A+) by SP6 RNA polymerase. Similarly, pS3SG and pS3SM were constructed to express RNA3SG+ and RNA3SM+, in which the polypurine sequence in RNA3S+ was altered to GGGGG- GGGG and CCUCUCCUU, respectively, by using p3SG and p3SM as described previously (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The RNA+ sequences used in this study are shown in Table I. The cDNA sequence of RNA3S is contained in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM with accession number AB021173.Table IRNA sequences used for the in vitro translation assayRNA3SGAUUUCCGUGGAGAGGAACAACUCUGAGURNA3AACUCAGAGUUGUUCCUCUCCACGGGAAAUCRNA3SGGAUUUCCGUGGGGGGGGGCAACUCUGAGURNA3SMGAUUUCCGUCCUCUCCUUCAACUCUGAGU Open table in a new tab Plasmid DNAs were linearized at a site beyond the SP6 promoter and cDNA insert. A 20-μl reaction contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 1 unit/μl ribonuclease inhibitor (Takara), 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 12 μm of UTP, 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 μg of plasmid DNA, and 1 unit/μl SP6 RNA polymerase (Takara) (27Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4042) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and the DNA templates were digested with 2 units RNase-free DNase I (Takara)/μg DNA at 37 °C for 15 min. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3m- sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. For the synthesis of a capped RNA transcript, a reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 0.05 mm GTP, and 0.5 mm m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G(RNA cap structure analogue; New England Biolabs). The RNAs synthesized were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Nonsecretory luciferase (28Wood K.V. deWet J.R. Dewji N. DeLuca M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and secretory pre-β-lactamase (29Muller M. Ibrahimi I. Chang C.N. Walter P. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11860-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mRNAs and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes were obtained from Promega, and nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Standard translation was carried out in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μl of lysate, 2 μl of translation mix, 0.1m potassium acetate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 μg of luciferase mRNA, and 2 μg of pre-β-lactamase mRNA at 30 °C (30Pelham H.R. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Translation products (2–3 μl) were boiled for 3 min in 20 μl of sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) (83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (stacking gel: 4.5% acrylamide, 0.12% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS; separating gel: 15% acrylamide, 0.4% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS) in running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS). The gels were fluorographed as described previously (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The intensities of luciferase (62 kDa) and pre-β-lactamase (31.5 kDa) bands were quantitated in help of the Desk scan II and software of NIH image 1.55f. Synchronized translation was carried out in a manner as described previously (25Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2617-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because full-length polypeptide chains of pre-β-lactamase appeared after 5–6 min of synthesis and those of luciferase were detected after 9–10 min of synthesis when the translation was programmed with 0.08 μg of pre-β-lactamase mRNA and 0.02 μg of luciferase mRNA/μl of translation (data not shown), the synchronization time of 3 min below the minimal time required for completion of the translation was employed in the following experiments. Translation was initiated for 3 min, at which time further initiation was inhibited by the addition of RNA cap analogue, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, to a final concentration of 4 mm (32Rothman J.E. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The gels were fluorographed. Another translation uses a tRNA-mediated protein labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) when a very small amount of protein translated is to be detected. Proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) at 100 V for 3 h, cooling the buffer. The transferred proteins were detected according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensities of luciferase and pre-β-lactamase bands were quantitated as described above. Synthetic ODNs were obtained from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). The reticulocyte lysate was incubated with an ODN in the presence of ribonuclease H (RNase H; Takara) at 37 °C for 60 min. RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar) and analyzed in polyacrylamide or agarose gels after heating in a loading buffer containing 7 m urea at 65 °C for 5 min. The ODN sequences used for this assay are shown in Table II.Table IIODN sequences used for the RNaseH cleavage assay3S-9ntGGAGAGGAA2AM-9ntGGAGAGAAA3A-9ntTTCCTCTCC3SM1–9ntGAAGAGGAA3SM2–9ntGGAGAAGAA2A-9ntGAAGAGAAAGA-9ntGAGAGAGAGG-9ntGGGGGGGGG Open table in a new tab RNA was electrophoresed on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. After electroblotting, a nitrocellulose filter was hybridized with a riboprobe as described previously (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To determine the 7SL RNA sequence by using the SMART methods (CLONTECH), a GpppG cap and a poly(A) were added to the gel-purified RNA at the 5′ end and the 3′ end, respectively. First, 1 μg of the gel-purified RNA was incubated with 2 units of poly(A) polymerase (Takara) in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mmATP for 60 min at 37 °C and precipitated with ethanol after the phenol/chloroform extraction. The poly(A) RNA was further incubated with 2 units of guanylyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 30 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 6 mm KCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 30 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara), and 40 μm GTP for 45 min at 37 °C. The cDNA of capped poly(A) RNA was synthesized by reverse transcription at 37 °C for 60 min in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 pm random hexamer, 1 μm(oligo(dT)30N1N (N = A, G, C, or T; N1 = A, G, or C)), 1 μm SMARTTMoligonucleotide, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 6 mmMgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm dNTP, and 20 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Life Technologies, Inc.). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the resulting single-stranded cDNA was carried out by using the following primers: 5′ primer, GAGAATTCTACGGCTGCGAGAAGACGACAGAA, and 3′ primer, N N1(dT)30GGAATTCGA at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min for 21 cycles. After digestion withEcoRI and BamHI, the final products were gel-purified, cloned into the same sites of pGEM3, and sequenced. The rabbit 7SL cDNA sequence has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM with accession number AB021174. Cloning of a partial cDNA of rabbit 7SL RNA was carried out by using a 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by using 0.5 μg of the gel-purified RNA as described previously (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of the anchor-ligated cDNA was performed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 50 mm each dNTP, 200 nm each of 7SL-P1 (TGCTCCGTTTCCGACCTGGGCCGGT; the sequence complementary to nucleotides 184–208 of 7SL RNA) and anchor primers, and 2 units of Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). The mixture was run at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. The first PCR products were used in a nested PCR reaction with a set of anchor primer and 7SL-P2 (GCGGATCCTCACCCCTCCTTAGGCAACCTGGTG; sequence complementary to nucleotides 159–183 of 7SL RNA) primers at 94 °C for 45 s, 66 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. After digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, the final products were cloned into the same sites of pGEM3 and sequenced. RNA was end-labeled in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) at 37 °C for 30 min. Total RNA was extracted from lysate and hybridized with 105 cpm of riboprobe for 12 h at 45 °C in a 30-μl mixture containing 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.7, 0.4 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Samples were then digested with 3 μg of RNase A and 5 units of RNase T1 in 300 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 30 min (27Melton D.A. Krieg P.A.

Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 207-209Google Scholar). After the treatment with 200 μg/ml proteinase K and 1% SDS at 37 °C for 20 min, RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol precipitated with 10 μg of tRNA, and electrophoresed in a 6% sequencing gel. To examine an effect of RNA3S+ on the translation of pre-β-lactamase and luciferase mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we synthesized RNA3S+, RNA3A+(antisense RNA3S+), and RNAPL+ (transcript from the pSP64(poly(A)) polylinker region) that had a cap structure at the 5′ end and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. These RNA+sequences are shown in Table I. The synthesized RNA+s were added into the standard translation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A dose-effect test showed that 0.2 μg of RNA3S+/μl of translation suppressed most efficiently the overall protein synthesis, reducing the amounts of luciferase and pre-β-lactamase by about 55 and 65%, respectively, at 30 min of incubation when compared with those with RNAPL+ alone (Fig.1 A). Upon translation with RNA3S+, RNA3A+, and RNAPL+, RNA3S+ suppressed most significantly the translation (Fig.1 B). Compared with the translation with RNAPL+, the amounts of luciferase and pre-β-lactamase synthesized with RNA3S+ were reduced by about 60 and 70%, respectively, at 60 min of incubation. RNA3A+ and RNAPL+ also appeared to suppress the translation when compared with the control. To see an effect of the cap and poly(A) tail in RNA3S+ on the translation, we synthesized three types of RNA3S with different structures: capped RNA3S with a poly(A) tail, uncapped RNA3S with a poly(A) tail, and uncapped RNA3S without a poly(A) tail. Of these RNAs, only the capped RNA3S with a poly(A) tail (RNA3S+) significantly suppressed the translation (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that RNA3S requires both the cap and poly(A) tail to exert its function.Figure 1Translation of pre-β-lactamase and luciferase mRNAs within vitro synthesized RNA3S + . RNA3S+, RNA3A+, and RNAPL+ were synthesized by using SP6 RNA polymerase from pS3S, pS3A, and pSP64 linearized withEcoRI. Aliquots (3 μl) were removed at the indicated times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and scanning densitometry as described. The gel patterns of luciferase and pre-β-lactamase synthesized and their intensities are shown in each experiment. A, dose-effect test. Mixtures of RNA3S+ and RNAPL+ were added at the indicated amount into a 20-μl translation. Set 1, 4 μg of RNA3S+; set 2, 2 μg of RNA3S+ and 2 μg of RNAPL+; set 3, 1 μg of RNA3S+ and 3 μg of RNAPL+;set 4, 4 μg of RNAPL+. The other translation products (25–30 kDa) that were not due to luciferase and pre-β-lactamase were due to labeled peptidyl-tRNA resulting from translation of fragments of globin mRNA (35Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), because they appeared in a reaction containing no added mRNA. Additionally, nonspecific bands (33–62 kDa) might be due to aberrant initiation of luciferase translation and endogenous methionine-binding lysate proteins (35Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).Marker, prestained SDS-PAGE standards (Bio-Rad). Gel patterns (left side) and intensities (right side).

These translation experiments were repeated with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the previous study, RNA3SG+, in which the polypurine sequence was changed from GGAGAGGAA to GGGGGGGGG, exhibited the transforming potential similar to that of RNA3S+ (13Hamada K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RNA3SM+, which has the CCUCUCCUU in place of the polypurine sequence in RNA3S+, lost the potential completely. We also examined the effects of RNA3SG+ and RNA3SM+ (Table I) on the translation. As shown in Fig.1 D, RNA3SG+ also suppressed the pre-β-lactamase synthesis, whereas RNA3SM+ did not suppress it. We noted that RNA3S+ and RNA3SG+preferred to affect the secretory rather than nonsecretory protein synthesis, depending upon their polypurine sequences. From the above data, the polypurine sequence might contact directly an integral RNA in polysomes. We thus prepared the ODN, 3S-9nt (GGAGAGGAA), and searched the lysate for such an RNA. An ODN-directed RNase H cleavage assay has been useful for identifying the RNA sequences that are accessible for base pairing with DNA molecules. Total RNA was recovered from the lysate treated with 3S-9nt in the presence of RNase H and analyzed in gels. As shown in Fig. 2 A, 3S-9nt mediated the cleavage of 28 S rRNA in a dose-dependent manner, generating some cleavage products. This suggests that 3S-9nt is specific to the cleavage. 4 μg of 3S-9nt/10 μl of lysate were required to degrade all the target RNAs. Neither 3S-9nt alone nor RNaseH alone affected 28 S rRNA. A similar assay was performed by using 3A-9nt (TTCCTCTCC) that was the antisense 3S-9nt ODN. In a nondenaturing gel analysis (Fig. 2 B), 3A-9nt appeared to mediate the cleavage of an RNA species (designatedRNAX in Fig. 2 B) located between 18 S rRNA and 5.8 S rRNA, generating a new band RNA (RNAx in Fig.2 B). From the separating gel pattern of cytoplasmic RNA as reported previously (36Ullu E. Murphy S. Melli M. Cell. 1982; 29: 195-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is suggested that RNAX might be 7SL RNA and thus RNAx the cleavage product of 7SL RNA. We determined the sequence of RNAX in a manner as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both a cap and a poly(A) tail were added to the gel-purified RNAX. After reverse transcription of the modified RNAX followed by PCR amplification of the resulting cDNAs, products were cloned into a plasmid and sequenced. As shown in Fig. 2 C, RNAX was identified as 7SL RNA, exhibiting a 98.3% homology with the human 7SL DNA sequence. To confirm that RNAx is a cleavage product of 7SL RNA, we carried out a Northern blot hybridization. We constructed several plasmids containing the partial 7SL cDNA fragments by using the reverse transcription products of the gel-purified RNAx. One of those plasmids, pG7SL7 contained the cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 110–183 of 7SL RNA but not the Alu sequence. Thus, pG7SL7 produces an antisense partial 7SL cRNA specific to 7SL RNA. Again, the cleavage products were analyzed in a denaturing gel (Fig.2 D). RNAX from the 3A-9nt-treated lysate appeared as a broader and lower intensive band (lanes 7–9 and11 in Fig. 2 D). RNAx appeared in the nondenaturing gel was just visible in the denaturing gels. In Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2E), both RNAX and RNAx (lanes 7–9 and11 in Fig. 2 E) indeed hybridized with the antisense 7SL7 cRNA. In addition, 3A-9nt was found to mediate the cleavage of 7SL RNA dose-dependently. Neither 3A-9nt alone nor RNaseH alone affected 7SL RNA. These results suggest that 3S-9nt and 3A-9nt contact specifically 28 S rRNA in the ribosome and 7SL RNA in SRP, respectively, which are known to be engaged in secretory protein synthesis (38Siegel V. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The three distinct activities of SRP (signal recognition, elongation arrest, and translocation promotion) reside in separate domains (39Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We thus determined the site of 7SL RNA in contact with 3A-9nt. First, the gel-eluted RNAx was, without an alkaline phosphatase treatment, incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of polynucleotide kinase and analyzed in a sequencing gel. As shown in Fig. 3 A, RNAx accepted the radioactive phosphate, suggesting that RNAx lost the 5′ site of 7SL RNA. The smear pattern (indicated by arrows) suggests that RNAx might be a mixture of the partial 7SL RNAs resulting from the RNaseH digestion and still have a structure. It was estimated to be more than at least 230 nucleotides in length. Out of the plasmids containing partial 7SL DNA fragments as described above, pG7SL2 that contains the cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 44–183 of 7SL RNA was used to prepare a riboprobe in the following RNase protection assay. Fig. 3 B shows the sequencing gel of 7SL2 DNA and its sequence. The antisense 7SL2 cRNA was hybridized with total RNA from the 3A-9nt-treated lysate. After the digestion with RNase A and RNase T1, samples were analyzed in a sequencing gel (Fig. 3 C). As expected, the contact site of 7SL RNA displayed a nibbling pattern, demonstrating the ODN-directed RNaseH digestion. Because 7SL2 RNA is 139 nucleotides in length, the site was found to be GAGG"
