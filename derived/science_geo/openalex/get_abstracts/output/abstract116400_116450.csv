https://openalex.org/W2032514624,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-κB through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-κB and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-κB activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-κB activation. Thus, these two TNFR1–TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD."
https://openalex.org/W2085033687,"The AML1–CBFβ transcription factor is the most frequent target of chromosomal rearrangements in human leukemia. To investigate its normal function, we generated mice lacking AML1. Embryos with homozygous mutations in AML1 showed normal morphogenesis and yolk sac–derived erythropoiesis, but lacked fetal liver hematopoiesis and died around E12.5. Sequentially targeted AML1−/− ES cells retained their capacity to differentiate into primitive erythroid cells in vitro; however, no myeloid or erythroid progenitors of definitive hematopoietic origin were detected in either the yolk sac or fetal livers of mutant embryos. Moreover, this hematopoietic defect was intrinsic to the stem cells in that AML1−/− ES cells failed to contribute to hematopoiesis in chimeric animals. These results suggest that AML1-regulated target genes are essential for definitive hematopoiesis of all lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2075013504,"We have identified two distinct mechanisms initiating the adhesion of flowing platelets to thrombogenic surfaces. The intergrin alpha IIb beta 3 promotes immediate arrest onto fibrinogen but is fully efficient only at wall shear rates below 600-900 s-1, perhaps because of a relatively slow rate of bond formation or low resistance to tensile stress. In contrast, glycoprotein Ib alpha binding to immobilized von Willebrand factor (vWF) appears to have fast association and dissociation rates as well as high resistance to tensile stress, supporting slow movement of platelets in continuous contact with the surface even at shear rates in excess of 6000 s-1. This eventually allows activated alpha IIb beta 3 to arrest platelets onto vWF under conditions not permissive of direct binding to fibrinogen. The coupling of these different functions may be crucial for thrombogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2080273350,"Binding of α factor to Ste2p, a G protein–coupled plasma membrane receptor, activates a signal transduction pathway and stimulates endocytosis of the receptor–ligand complex. Ligand binding also induces ubiquitination of the Ste2p cytoplasmic tail. Protein ubiquitination is required for stimulated endocytosis of Ste2p, as internalization is 5- to 15-fold slower in ubc mutants that lack multiple ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In a C-terminal truncated form of Ste2p that is rapidly ubiquitinated and endocytosed in response to ligand binding, a single lysine to arginine substitution in its cytoplasmic tail eliminates both ubiquitination and internalization. Thus, ubiquitination of Ste2p itself is required for ligand-stimulated endocytosis. We propose that ubiquitination mediates degradation of receptor–ligand complexes, not via the proteasome, but by acting as a signal for endocytosis leading to subsequent degradation in the lysosome/vacuole."

https://openalex.org/W2117532375,"Motor neuron differentiation is accompanied by the expression of a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, Islet1 (ISL1). To assess the involvement of ISL1 in the generation of motor neurons, we analyzed cell differentiation in the neural tube of embryos in which ISL1 expression has been eliminated by gene targeting. Motor neurons are not generated without ISL1, although many other aspects of cell differentiation in the neural tube occur normally. A population of interneurons that express Engrailed1 (EN1), however, also fails to differentiate in Isl1 mutant embryos. The differentiation of EN1+ interneurons can be induced in both wild-type and mutant neural tissue by regions of the neural tube that contain motor neurons. These results show that ISL1 is required for the generation of motor neurons and suggest that motor neuron generation is required for the subsequent differentiation of certain interneurons."

https://openalex.org/W1982789641,"Cysteine proteases of the interleukin 1β Converting Enzyme (ICE)/CED-3 family have been implicated in the effector process of apoptosis in several systems, including Fas-mediated apoptosis. We have recently isolated and partially characterized a protease present in extracts from anti-Fas antibody treated Jurkat T cells that promotes apoptotic changes in isolated nuclei (Schlegel, J., Peters, I., and Orrenius, S.(1995) FEBS Lett. 364, 139-142). We now show that this protease cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with high efficiency and specificity. Both PARP proteolysis and the proapoptotic effects of the protease are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of a selective inhibitor of apopain (CPP32), while an inhibitor of IL-1β converting enzyme is much less effective, requiring micromolar concentrations for the inhibition of the isolated protease. Kinetic analysis of the isolated protease reveals kinetic constants similar to those reported for apopain. The isolated protease is recognized by antibodies specific for CPP32/apopain but not by an anti-ICE antibody. Furthermore, a selective inhibitor of apopain prevents Fas-induced apoptosis in intact Jurkat T cells. We therefore conclude that CPP32/apopain is activated in Fas-induced apoptosis.

Apoptosis is an important and well controlled form of cell death observed under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. Inappropriate apoptosis may be involved in many diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, immune deficiency and autoimmune disorders, leukemias, lymphomas, and other malignancies. Therefore, the control of apoptosis is an important potential target for therapeutic intervention (1.Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar, 2.Martin S.J.

Recent work has indicated the involvement of a protease belonging to the ICE/CED-3 family in Fas-mediated apoptosis(9.Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A.

Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Google Scholar). In the absence of 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), this proteolytic activity was inhibited by several serine protease inhibitors, iodoacetamide and VAD-FMK, while E64 was not inhibitory(14.Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Google Scholar). This inhibitor profile is consistent with the protease being a member of the ICE/CED-3 family(6.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G.

In the present work we demonstrate that this protease, which appears to play a crucial role in Fas-induced apoptosis, is not ICE itself but another member of the ICE/CED-3 family, namely CPP32/apopain. The human leukemic T cell line, Jurkat, was obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37°C. Anti-human Fas antibody (IgM, clone CH-11) was purchased from AMS Biotechnology, Sweden. RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and low-melting-point agarose were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland, UK). All other chemicals were from local suppliers and of the highest available grade of purity. Jurkat T cells (20 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated at 37°C with anti-human Fas antibody. At the indicated time points, aliquots of the incubation were centrifuged, and the isolated cells were washed with ice-cold medium and resuspended in S-buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 (300 × 106 cells/ml). 6-μl aliquots of the resuspended cells were used for analysis of DNA degradation by conventional agarose electrophoresis and pulsed field electrophoresis as described(14.Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Google Scholar, 16.Weis M. Schlegel J. Kass G.E.N. Holmström T.H. Peters I. Eriksson J. Orrenius S. Chow S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 699-708Google Scholar). The rest of the cells was lysed with four cycles of freezing and thawing. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g to pellet the membranous fraction. A further centrifugation step for 30 min at 120,000 × g yielded a supernatant fraction consisting mainly of cytosolic proteins. The [35S]PARP and [35S]pro-IL-1β cleavage activity of the extracts obtained was measured as described elsewhere (6.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J.

Immunoblot analysis of the extracts after SDS-gel electrophoresis was done using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the p12 and p17 subunits of CPP32/apopain. Rat thymocyte nuclei were prepared as described(14.Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Google Scholar). Using a recently published in vitro system(13.Chow S.C. Weis M. Kass G.E.N. Holmström T.H. Eriksson J.E. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 134-138Google Scholar, 14.Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Google Scholar, 18.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar), thymocyte nuclei were incubated in S-buffer (see above) plus 2 mM DTT at 37°C with the isolated protease from Jurkat cells undergoing Fas-induced apoptosis in the presence or absence of inhibitors. After 70 min, the reaction was stopped and the samples were divided for analysis by field inversion gel electrophoresis and conventional agarose electrophoresis as described in (14.Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells (10 × 106/ml) were preincubated at 37°C for 1 h with 120 μM Ac-YVAD-CHO, 120 μM Ac-DEVD-CHO, or 120 μM Ac-DEVD-COOH before incubation with anti-Fas antibody (0.75 μg/ml) for an additional 2 h. Aliquots of the incubated cells were used to monitor membrane integrity by trypan blue exclusion. After 2 h of incubation with anti-Fas antibody, the cells were isolated by centrifugation, washed, and analyzed for DNA fragmentation as described (16.Weis M. Schlegel J. Kass G.E.N. Holmström T.H. Peters I. Eriksson J. Orrenius S. Chow S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 699-708Google Scholar). In cytosolic extracts prepared from anti-Fas-treated Jurkat T cells, elevation of a PARP cleavage activity is an early event first detectable 15 min after adding an anti-Fas antibody to the cells (Fig. 1a). By comparison, fragmentation of nuclear DNA into high molecular weight fragments starts at about 30 min (Fig. 1d), while the formation of internucleosomal DNA fragments cannot be detected earlier than 45 min after antibody addition (not shown). We could not detect any proteolytic activity capable of cleaving pro-IL-1β in extracts taken at different time points during incubation with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 1b), even at high concentrations of the extracts (not shown). Furthermore, these cells contained no ICE protein that could be recognized by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation (not shown). This clearly argues against the involvement of ICE itself in Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. However, the early elevation of a proteolytic activity that cleaves PARP (Fig. 1a) implies the involvement of another enzyme of the ICE family, apopain (17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Google Scholar)), an ICE-like protease reported to cleave PARP(17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar, 18.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar). This protease is synthesized as a 32-kDa precursor (p32) that is proteolytically activated to form a mature enzyme composed of 17-kDa (p17) and 12-kDa (p12) subunits(17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). Immunoblots using antibodies specific for the p17 and p12 subunits of apopain show the presence of the dormant 32-kDa precursor in untreated Jurkat cells (Fig. 1c). Following anti-Fas activation, this precursor was rapidly broken down into active apopain (Fig. 1c) coincident with the onset of the PARP cleavage activity. The precursor was initially processed to p12 and a 20-kDa intermediate (p20) (detectable by 30 min), followed by slower conversion of p20 to p17. Both p20 and p17 have catalytic activity as shown by their ability to be labeled with a biotinylated irreversible DEVD-acyloxymethyl ketone active site probe of apopain with biotinylation found as early as the 15-min time point (not shown). The proapoptotic protease isolated from anti-Fas-treated Jurkat T cells was found to contain primarily p12 and p17 (Fig. 1c), indicating that apopain was the protease that had been purified. The fact that the 32-kDa CPP32-precursor of apopain is converted so quickly to the subunits that comprise active apopain, with maximal activation of apopain occurring within 60 min after anti-Fas treatment of the cells (Fig. 1a and Table 1), might explain why Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells is that much faster than other model systems of apoptosis.Tabled 1 When the partially purified protease (which was unable to cleave pro-IL-1β) was tested for its ability to cleave PARP in the presence of selective inhibitors, the apopain inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (4.Carson D.A. Ribeiro J.M. Lancet. 1994; 341: 1251-1254Google Scholar) (Ki,CPP32 < 1 nM) gave complete inhibition at 5 nM whereas the ICE inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO (6.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar) (Ki,ICE = 0.76 nM) was inactive at 5 μM and only partially effective at 50 μM (Fig. 2a). Measurement of the ability of the isolated protease to induce apoptotic changes in thymocyte nuclei using a reconstituted in vitro system revealed similar results. The ICE inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO was only partially inhibitory on the protease at concentrations as high as 50 μM, but the apopain inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO gave at 8 nM a partial and, at 100 nM, total inhibition of nuclear degradation (Fig. 2, b and c). In line with these results, the cowpox virus serpin CrmA, a potent inhibitor of ICE (20.Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Google Scholar) (Ki < 4 pM) but not of apopain (no inhibition at more than 1000 times higher concentrations(17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar)) did not interfere with either the PARP cleavage activity or the nuclear degradation activity of the partially purified protease at concentrations up to 0.1 μM (not shown). These results provide further evidence that CPP32/apopain is activated in Fas-mediated apoptosis. A kinetic analysis of the extracts obtained from Fas-treated Jurkat T cells and the partially purified protease using a continuous fluorometric assay for apopain with the substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar) (Table 1) confirmed that the proapoptotic protease from anti-Fas-treated Jurkat T cells was apopain. The catalytic and inhibitor constants obtained for the isolated protease were virtually identical with those of purified apopain (Table 1). A quantitative analysis of the samples of the time course using a fluorometric assay indicated that significant active apopain was generated within 15 min following anti-Fas treatment (Table 1). To test the ability of the inhibitors used in this study to block Fas-induced apoptosis in whole cells, we preincubated Jurkat T cells with the ICE inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO, the apopain inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, and, as a further control, the corresponding peptide lacking the aldehyde group (Ac-DEVD-COOH) which does not affect apopain activity (17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). Ac-DEVD-CHO at a concentration of 120 μM was found to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, whereas Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-COOH were without effect (Fig. 3). Since the cells showed a viability of >95% during the entire experiment (as assessed by trypan blue exclusion; not shown), the inhibitory effect of Ac-DEVD-CHO was not due to cytotoxic effects, but rather to the inhibition of apopain. Trypan blue uptake is associated with postapoptotic necrosis and a late event in this experimental model occurring well after oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (>3 h) (16.Weis M. Schlegel J. Kass G.E.N. Holmström T.H. Peters I. Eriksson J. Orrenius S. Chow S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 699-708Google Scholar). In summary, our results provide strong evidence that apopain (CPP32) is activated in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Since apopain is a key enzyme initiating apoptotic events in other systems as well(17.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.R. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar, 18.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar), pharmacological modulation of this protease may be of clinical importance in many diseases involving inappropriate apoptosis. Finally, we cannot exclude that additional ICE-like proteases are activated in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Although we failed to demonstrate any activation of ICE itself in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells, previous work has suggested that ICE may be involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis in other cell types(9.Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Google Scholar, 10.Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are required to resolve this discrepancy.

Upon isolation of Sec13p–ProtA, nucleoporins were still associated, but the major copurifying band was a 150 kDa protein, showing that Sec13p occurs in two complexes. Disruption of any of the genes encoding Nup84p, Nup85p, or Nup120p caused defects in nuclear membrane and nuclear pore complex organization, as well as in poly(A)+ RNA transport. Thus, the Nup84p complex in conjunction with Sec13-type proteins is required for correct nuclear pore biogenesis."

Here, we study C. tentans hrp36, an abundant protein in the BR particles, and establish that it is similar to the mammalian hnRNP A1. By immunoelectron microscopy it is demonstrated that hrp36 is added to BR RNA concomitant with transcription, remains in nucleoplasmic BR particles, and is translocated through the nuclear pore still associated with BR RNA. It appears in the giant BR RNA–containing polysomes, where it remains as an abundant protein in spite of ongoing translation."

https://openalex.org/W1984783168,"We show that the high in vitro transcription efficiency of yeast RNA pol III is mainly due to rapid recycling. Kinetic analysis shows that RNA polymerase recycling on preassembled tDNA•TFIIIC•TFIIIB complexes is much faster than the initial transcription cycle. High efficiency of RNA pol III recycling is favored at high UTP concentrations and requires termination at the natural termination signal. Runoff transcription does not allow efficient recycling. The reinitiation process shows increased resistance to heparin as compared with the primary initiation cycle, as if RNA polymerase was not released after termination. Indeed, template competition assays show that RNA pol III is committed to reinitiate on the same gene. A model is proposed where the polymerase molecule is directly transferred from the termination site to the promoter."

Here we report that in cells lacking Suv3p, there is an ∼50-fold increase in the excised form of the group I intron ω of the mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene. Surprisingly, little mature 21S rRNA accumulates in those cells; instead, unligated 21S rRNA exons appear. Intron overaccumulation could lead to spliced exon reopening via a reaction known to be catalyzed by group I introns in vitro. We also show that Suv3p is a functional component of a novel mitochondrial NTP-dependent 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity that can degrade group I intron RNAs. These findings account for group I intron overaccumulation in cells lacking Suv3p and define a novel function for putative RNA helicases in direct RNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2007605657,"Nonreplicative transposition by Tn10/IS10 involves three chemical steps at each transposon end: cleavage of the two strands plus joining of one strand to target DNA. These steps occur within a synaptic complex comprising two transposon ends and monomers of IS10 transposase. We report four transposase mutations that individually abolish each of the three chemical steps without affecting the synaptic complex. We conclude that a single constellation of residues, the “active site,” directly catalyzes each of the three steps. Analyses of reactions containing mixtures of wild-type and catalysis-defective transposases indicate that a single transposase monomer at each end catalyzes the cleavage of two strands and that strand transfer is carried out by the same monomers that previously catalyzed cleavage. These and other data suggest that one active site unit carries out all three reactions in succession at one transposon end."

https://openalex.org/W1540947167,"Reactive aldehydes generated during lipid peroxidation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as well as other inflammatory diseases. A potential catalyst for such reactions is myeloperoxidase, a hemeprotein secreted by activated phagocytes. We now report that activated neutrophils utilize the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system to convert L-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Production of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde was nearly quantitative at physiological concentrations of L-tyrosine and chloride. Aldehyde generation required myeloperoxidase, H2O2, L-tyrosine, and chloride ion; it was inhibited by the H2O2 scavenger catalase and by the heme poisons azide and cyanide. Phorbol ester- and calcium ionophore-stimulated human neutrophils likewise generated p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde from L-tyrosine by a pathway inhibited by azide, cyanide, and catalase. Aldehyde production accounted for 75% of H2O2 generated by optimally stimulated neutrophils at plasma concentrations of L-tyrosine and chloride. Collectively, these results indicate that activated phagocytes, under physiological conditions, utilize myeloperoxidase to execute the chloride-dependent conversion of L-tyrosine to the lipid-soluble aldehyde, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, in near quantitative yield. Moreover, like aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation, amino acid-derived aldehydes may exert potent biological effects in vascular lesions and other sites of inflammation."

INTRODUCTIONDiacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) 1The abbreviations used are: DGPPdiacylglycerol pyrophosphatePAphosphatidate. is a novel phospholipid metabolite recently identified from the plant Catharanthus roseus by Wissing and Behrbohm(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). DGPP contains a pyrophosphate group attached to diacylglycerol (Fig. 1). This compound was previously observed by several workers (2.Heim S. Bauleke A. Wylegalla C. Wagner K.G. Plant Sci. 1987; 49: 159-165Google Scholar, 3.Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 268-278Google Scholar, 4.Memon A.R. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14817-14821Google Scholar) as the phospholipid product of a lipid kinase reaction in plants that was not identified correctly(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). It is now known that DGPP is synthesized from PA and ATP through the reaction catalyzed by the novel enzyme PA kinase(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). PA kinase is a ubiquitous membrane-associated enzyme found in the plant kingdom(5.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar). The enzyme has been purified from suspension-cultured C. roseus cells (5.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar) and characterized with respect to its enzymological and kinetic properties(6.Wissing J.B. Kornak B. Funke A. Riedel B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 903-909Google Scholar).Metabolic labeling studies using C. roseus have shown that DGPP is rapidly metabolized by a membrane-associated phosphatase, which has been named DGPP phosphatase. 2B. Riedel, W.-I. Wu, G. M. Carman, and J. B. Wissing, manuscript in preparation. DGPP phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of DGPP to form PA and Pi.2 In addition to being present in plant cells, DGPP phosphatase activity is also present in membrane fractions of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver.2 Whereas it is unclear what role DGPP plays in phospholipid metabolism and cell growth, PA, the product of the DGPP phosphatase reaction, plays a major role in lipid metabolism. PA is the precursor of all phospholipids and triacylglycerol(7.Kennedy E.P. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W.A. Lipids and Membranes: Past, Present and Future. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 171-206Google Scholar, 8.Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Google Scholar). In addition, PA regulates the activity of several lipid-dependent enzymes (9.Bae-Lee M. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7221-7226Google Scholar, 10.Moritz A. DeGraan P.N.E. Gispen W.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Google Scholar). Thus, the discovery of DGPP phosphatase activity in a wide range of organisms suggests that this enzyme may play an important role in phospholipid metabolism and cell growth.A purified preparation of DGPP phosphatase is required for defined studies on the mechanism and regulation of this novel enzyme of phospholipid metabolism. Owing to its amenable molecular genetic system, we are using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model eucaryote to study DGPP phosphatase. We report in this paper the purification of DGPP phosphatase to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme was characterized with respect to its enzymological and kinetic properties. Moreover, we demonstrated that S. cerevisiae synthesized DGPP via the PA kinase reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals were reagent grade.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar). PA phosphatase was purified from S. cerevisiae as described by Lin and Carman(22.Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Google Scholar). The total membrane fraction (22.Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Google Scholar) of S. cerevisiae was used for the assay of PA kinase activity.Preparation of DGPP Standard and Labeled SubstratesDGPP standard was synthesized enzymatically from PA and ATP using purified C roseus PA kinase as described by Wissing and Behrbohm(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). Purified PA kinase was also used to prepare 32P-labeled DGPP. [α-32P]DGPP was synthesized from [32P]PA and ATP. [β-32P]DGPP was prepared from PA and [γ-32P]ATP. 32P-Labeled DGPP was purified by thin-layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-treated plates using the solvent system chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50:15:13:12:4). [32P]PA was synthesized from diacylglycerol and [γ-32P]ATP using E. coli diacylglycerol kinase(23.Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Google Scholar). Labeled PA was purified by thin-layer chromatography using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4).ElectrophoresisPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (24.Davis B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Google Scholar) was performed at 5°C in 6% slab gels containing 0.5% Triton X-100. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) was performed with 9% slab gels. Molecular mass standards were phosphorylase b (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa). Proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with silver(26.Merril C.R. Dunau M.L. Goldman D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 201-207Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays and Product IdentificationThe optimal conditions for assay of DGPP phosphatase activity were determined in detail with purified enzyme. DGPP phosphatase activity was measured by monitoring the release of water-soluble 32Pi from 0.1 mM [β-32P]DGPP (10,000-20,000 cpm/nmol) in 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 2 mM Triton X-100, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Purified DGPP phosphatase was routinely diluted 2,000-fold for enzyme assays. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 N HCl in methanol. Chloroform (1 ml) and 1 M MgCl2 (1 ml) were added, the system was mixed, and the phases were separated by 2 min of centrifugation at 100 × g. Ecoscint H (4 ml) was added to a 0.5-ml sample of the aqueous phase, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Alternatively, DGPP phosphatase activity was measured by monitoring the formation of [32P]PA from [α-32P]DGPP (10,000-20,000 cpm/nmol) under the assay conditions described above. The chloroform-soluble phospholipid product of the reaction, PA, was analyzed with standard PA and DGPP by thin-layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-treated plates using the solvent system chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50:15:13:12:4). The positions of the labeled phospholipids on the chromatograms were determined by autoradiography. The amount of labeled phospholipids was determined by scintillation counting.PA kinase activity was measured with 40 mM imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 6.1), 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM NaF, 5 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mM MnCl2, 6.9 mM Triton X-100, 0.6 mM PA, 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (100,000 cpm/nmol), and 0.3 mg/ml membrane protein(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar, 5.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar). NaF, β-glycerol phosphate, and MnCl2 were included in the reaction mixture to inhibit phosphatase reactions. The 32P-labeled chloroform-soluble phospholipid product of the reaction, DGPP, was analyzed with standard DGPP by thin-layer chromatography as described above for the DGPP phosphatase assay.PA phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) was measured with 50 mM Tris maleate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Triton X-100, 0.1 mM [32P]PA, and enzyme protein(27.Carman G.M. Lin Y.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Google Scholar). A unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min unless otherwise indicated. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein.Protein DeterminationProtein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Buffers that were identical to those containing protein samples were used as blanks. Protein concentration of samples after Mono Q chromatography was determined by scanning densitometry of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein was monitored during purification on columns by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.Preparation of Triton X-100/Phospholipid-mixed MicellesPhospholipids in chloroform were transferred to a test tube, and solvent was removed in vacuo for 40 min. Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles were prepared by adding Triton X-100 to dried lipids. The total phospholipid concentration in Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles did not exceed 15 mol % to ensure that the structure of the mixed micelles were similar to the structure of pure Triton X-100(29.Lichtenberg D. Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 285-304Google Scholar, 30.Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Acct. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 251-258Google Scholar).Analysis of Kinetic DataKinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the EZ-FIT enzyme kinetic model fitting program (31.Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Google Scholar). EZ-FIT uses the Nelder-Mead Simplex and Marquardt/Nash nonlinear regression algorithms sequentially and tests for the best fit of the data among different kinetic models.Mass Analyses of DGPP and PAPhospholipids were extracted from cells using method IIIB described by Hanson and Lester (32.Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Google Scholar) and dried in vacuo. The solvent mixture used in method IIIB is 95% ethanol/water/diethylether/pyridine/ammonium hydroxide (15:15:5:1:0.018). The sample was dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water (15:15:5). Samples were subjected to analytical normal phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 5-μm Kromasil silica column (150 × 4.6 mm, inner diameter) equilibrated with chloroform/methanol/30% ammonium hydroxide (80:19.5:0.5). Elution was carried out using a 14-min linear gradient (0-30%) of methanol/water/30% ammonium hydroxide (80:19.5:0.5) followed by holding the same solvent at 30% for an additional 14 min. The identity of DGPP was determined by comparing its elution profile with that of authentic DGPP (1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar) using an evaporative light scattering detector. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used throughout. The cellular concentration of DGPP was calculated relative to the concentration of the major phospholipids in the extract. The cellular concentration of PA was determined as described previously(33.Wu W. Lin Y.-P. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13830-13837Google Scholar).Purification of DGPP PhosphataseAll steps were performed at 5°C.Step 1: Preparation of Cell ExtractThe cell extract was prepared from 200 g (wet weight) of cells by disruption with glass beads with a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in buffer A (50 mM Tris-maleate (pH 7.0), 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) as described previously(21.Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min.Step 2: Preparation of MicrosomesMicrosomes were isolated from the cell extract by differential centrifugation(21.Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Google Scholar). Microsomes were washed and resuspended in buffer B (50 mM Tris-maleate (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). These membranes were routinely frozen at −80°C until used for purification.Step 3: Preparation of Triton X-100 ExtractMicrosomes were suspended in buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The suspension was incubated for 1 h on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. After the incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h to obtain the Triton X-100 extract (supernatant).Step 4: DE53 ChromatographyA DE53 column (2.5 × 20.5 cm) was equilibrated with buffer C (50 mM Tris-maleate (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). The Triton X-100 extract was applied to the column at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. The column was washed with one column volume of buffer C followed by elution of DGPP phosphatase activity in 6-ml fractions with nine column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.25 M) in buffer C. The peak of DGPP phosphatase activity eluted from the column at the beginning of the NaCl gradient. The most active fractions containing activity were pooled and used for the next step in the purification scheme.Step 5: Affi-Gel Blue ChromatographyAn Affi-Gel Blue column (2.0 × 16 cm) was equilibrated with buffer C. DE53-purified enzyme was applied to the column at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The column was washed with one column volume of buffer C followed by two column volumes of buffer C containing 0.3 M NaCl. DGPP phosphatase activity was eluted from the column in 3.5-ml fractions with 10 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0.3-0.9 M) in buffer C. The peak of DGPP phosphatase activity eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration between 0.3 and 0.4 M. The most active fractions were pooled and the enzyme preparation was desalted by dialysis against buffer D (10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100).Step 6: Hydroxylapatite ChromatographyA hydroxylapatite column (1.5 × 8.5 cm) was equilibrated with buffer D. The desalted Affi-Gel Blue-purified enzyme was applied to the column at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The column was washed with one column volume of buffer D, and DGPP phosphatase activity was eluted from the column in 2-ml fractions with 20 column volumes of a linear potassium phosphate gradient (10-150 mM) in buffer D. Two peaks of DGPP phosphatase activity eluted from the column. The first peak (peak I) of activity eluted from the column at the beginning of the gradient. The second peak (peak II) of activity eluted at a phosphate concentration of about 24 mM. The most active fractions from each peak were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C.Step 7: Mono Q I ChromatographyA Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) was equilibrated with buffer C. Hydroxylapatite-purified enzyme from peak I was applied to the column at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. The column was washed with two column volumes of buffer C. DGPP phosphatase activity was eluted from the column in 1-ml fractions with 40 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.3 M) in buffer C. The peak of DGPP phosphatase activity eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of about 0.12 M. Fractions containing activity were pooled and stored at −80°C. The purified enzyme was completely stable for at least 2 months.Step 8: Mono Q II ChromatographyA second Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) was equilibrated with buffer C. Hydroxylapatite-purified enzyme from peak II was applied to the column at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. The column was washed with two column volumes of buffer C. DGPP phosphatase activity was eluted from the column in 1-ml fractions with 40 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.3 M) in buffer C. The peak of DGPP phosphatase activity eluted from the column at the beginning of the NaCl gradient. Fractions containing activity were pooled and stored at −80°C. The purified enzyme was completely stable for at least 2 months.DISCUSSIONWe undertook the purification of DGPP phosphatase from S. cerevisiae to facilitate well defined studies on the biochemical regulation of this novel enzyme of phospholipid metabolism. Purification of DGPP phosphatase required the solubilization of the enzyme from microsomal membranes with Triton X-100 followed by conventional chromatography steps performed in the presence of Triton X-100. The presence of Triton X-100 in the buffers used for enzyme purification was required to prevent aggregation of this integral membrane protein. The hydroxylapatite chromatography step resulted in two distinct peaks of DGPP phosphatase activity. Each peak of activity was purified separately by Mono Q chromatography. The seven-step purification procedure reported for the enzyme from hydroxylapatite peak I resulted in a DGPP phosphatase preparation that was essentially homogeneous as evidenced by native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DGPP phosphatase was identified in this preparation as a 34-kDa protein. Overall, DGPP phosphatase was purified 33,333-fold relative to the activity in the cell extract to a final specific activity of 150 μmol/min/mg. The enzyme from hydroxylapatite peak II was purified 24,666-fold over the activity in the cell extract to a final specific activity of 111 μmol/min/mg. This near homogeneous enzyme preparation also contained the 34-kDa protein, which was associated with DGPP phosphatase activity. The reason for the different chromatographic properties of the two DGPP phosphatase preparations is unclear. Additional studies are required to address these differences. The molecular mass of native DGPP phosphatase in Triton X-100 micelles cannot be determined until the interaction of the enzyme with detergent has been quantitated(40.Tanford C. Nozaki Y. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Google Scholar).The fold purifications and final specific activities of the DGPP phosphatase preparations described here were higher than any other phospholipid-dependent enzyme purified from S. cerevisiae (reviewed in (8.Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Google Scholar) and (39.Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar)). That such a high degree of purification was required to obtain purified DGPP phosphatase indicated that the abundance of this enzyme in S. cerevisiae was relatively low when compared with other phospholipid-dependent enzymes.Pure DGPP phosphatase derived from hydroxylapatite peak I was used for the biochemical characterization of the enzyme. The enzyme had a broad pH optimum and required Triton X-100 for maximum activity. The enzyme did not have a divalent cation requirement, and activity was insensitive to Na2EDTA. Divalent cations, especially Mn2+ ions, potently inhibited DGPP phosphatase activity. DGPP phosphatase was also inhibited by NaF but was relatively insensitive to thioreactive compounds. Pyrophosphate and, to a lesser extent, ADP (which contains a pyrophosphate group) inhibited DGPP phosphatase activity. We did not test whether these compounds were substrates for DGPP phosphatase. Pyrophosphate is the specific substrate for inorganic pyrophosphatase in S. cerevisiae(41.Bailey K. Webb E.C. Biochem. J. 1944; 38: 394-398Google Scholar, 42.Heppel L.A. Hilmoe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 192: 87-94Google Scholar). DGPP phosphatase differed from inorganic pyrophosphatase in that inorganic pyrophosphatase is a cytosolic enzyme, which is dependent on Mg2+ ions for activity(41.Bailey K. Webb E.C. Biochem. J. 1944; 38: 394-398Google Scholar, 42.Heppel L.A. Hilmoe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 192: 87-94Google Scholar).DGPP phosphatase catalyzed the dephosphorylation of the β phosphate of DGPP yielding PA and Pi. DGPP phosphatase activity was not inhibited by its product PA. This lack of product inhibition was consistent with the length of time in which the reaction was linear and the enzyme catalyzing the near quantitative conversion of DGPP to PA. Whereas the enzyme was not inhibited by PA, DGPP phosphatase catalyzed the dephosphorylation of PA. The dephosphorylation of PA was subsequent to the dephosphorylation of the β phosphate of DGPP. Moreover, the dephosphorylation of PA by DGPP phosphatase was potently inhibited by DGPP. DGPP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to PA and the Ki value for DGPP was similar to the Km value for DGPP (Table 3). Taken together, these results suggested that the DGPP and PA binding sites on the enzyme were the same.Tabled 1DGPP phosphatase activity followed surface dilution kinetics (35.Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Google Scholar) using Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles. The role of Triton X-100 in the assay of phospholipid-dependent enzymes is to form a mixed micelle with the phospholipid substrate and, therefore, provide a surface for catalysis(35.Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Google Scholar). Indeed, DGPP phosphatase activity was dependent on the surface concentration of DGPP. The reaction of the dephosphorylation of PA also followed surface dilution kinetics. However, in contrast to the typical kinetic behavior (saturation kinetics) the enzyme exhibited toward DGPP, the dependence of activity on the surface concentration of PA was cooperative.DGPP was clearly the preferred substrate for pure DGPP phosphatase based on the relative values for VMAX and Km (Table 3). Moreover, the specificity constant (VMAX /Km) for DGPP was 10-fold higher than that for PA (Table 3). Although the cellular concentration of DGPP was 16-fold lower than that of PA (Table 3), an argument can be made for DGPP being the the preferred substrate for the enzyme in vivo. PA, at a concentration 20-fold higher than that of DGPP, did not inhibit DGPP phosphatase activity, and DGPP potently inhibited the enzyme's ability to catalyze the dephosphorylation of PA. Moreover, the Ki value for DGPP was very close to its cellular concentration (Table 3). Our studies, however, do not rule out the possibility that the enzyme could use PA as a substrate in vivo.The enzyme in S. cerevisiae which is responsible for the dephosphorylation of PA is PA phosphatase(22.Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Google Scholar). PA phosphatase has been purified and extensively characterized from S. cerevisiae(22.Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Google Scholar, 33.Wu W. Lin Y.-P. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13830-13837Google Scholar, 38.Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 166-170Google Scholar, 43.Morlock K.R. McLaughlin J.J. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3586-3593Google Scholar, 44.Quinlan J.J. Nickels Jr., J.T. Wu W. Lin Y.-P. Broach J.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18013-18020Google Scholar, 45.Wu W.-I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29495-29501Google Scholar). DGPP phosphatase differed from PA phosphatase with respect to molecular mass, substrate specificity, cofactor requirement, and sensitivity to thioreactive agents. For example, PA phosphatase requires Mg2+ ions for activity and is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide(22.Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Google Scholar, 43.Morlock K.R. McLaughlin J.J. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3586-3593Google Scholar).If DGPP phosphatase was to play an important role in phospholipid metabolism, it was important for us to demonstrate that DGPP was synthesized in S. cerevisiae. Indeed, we demonstrated that S. cerevisiae possessed PA kinase activity and DGPP was identified in growing cells. PA kinase activity (7 pmol/min/mg) in S. cerevisiae was very low when compared with the activity (3.3 nmol/min/mg) in membranes from C. roseus(5.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar). This low level of activity may be a reflection of a low level of PA kinase expression, the product's rapidly hydrolyzation by DGPP phosphatase, and/or not knowing the correct assay conditions for the enzyme. Additional studies are needed to characterize PA kinase activity in S. cerevisiae. DGPP was previously not identified in S. cerevisiae. In previous studies (reviewed in (39.Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar)), a relatively large percentage of unidentified phospholipids have been labeled as “others.” Perhaps DGPP was a minor phospholipid among the unidentified phospholipids described in previous studies. DGPP accounted for only 0.18 mol % of the major phospholipids in S. cerevisiae. The identification of DGPP was dependent on the procedure used to extract phospholipids. Method IIIB of Hanson and Lester (32.Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Google Scholar) was the best method to extract DGPP. This method is commonly used for the extraction of polar lipids such as polyphosphoinositides and sphingolipids(32.Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Google Scholar). This method also minimizes creation of artifacts such as lysolipids(32.Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of DGPP was 3-fold lower than the Km value (0.55 mol %) for DGPP. Thus, DGPP phosphatase activity would be expected to be very sensitive to changes in the cellular concentration of DGPP.It is unclear what roles DGPP and DGPP phosphatase play in phospholipid metabolism. One could speculate that DGPP is the precursor of the PA used for phospholipid synthesis or neutral lipid synthesis, DGPP is the precursor of the PA which acts as a signaling molecule, and/or DGPP itself is a signaling molecule. The activity of DGPP phosphatase could regulate the levels of DGPP and PA in the cell. Since DGPP phosphatase also dephosphorylated PA, the enzyme may play a role in regulating diacylglycerol levels. The studies reported here provide the foundation for future molecular genetic studies directed toward understanding the roles DGPP and DGPP phosphatase play in phospholipid metabolism and cell growth. INTRODUCTIONDiacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) 1The abbreviations used are: DGPPdiacylglycerol pyrophosphatePAphosphatidate. is a novel phospholipid metabolite recently identified from the plant Catharanthus roseus by Wissing and Behrbohm(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). DGPP contains a pyrophosphate group attached to diacylglycerol (Fig. 1). This compound was previously observed by several workers (2.Heim S. Bauleke A. Wylegalla C. Wagner K.G. Plant Sci. 1987; 49: 159-165Google Scholar, 3.Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 268-278Google Scholar, 4.Memon A.R. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14817-14821Google Scholar) as the phospholipid product of a lipid kinase reaction in plants that was not identified correctly(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). It is now known that DGPP is synthesized from PA and ATP through the reaction catalyzed by the novel enzyme PA kinase(1.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Google Scholar). PA kinase is a ubiquitous membrane-associated enzyme found in the plant kingdom(5.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar). The enzyme has been purified from suspension-cultured C. roseus cells (5.Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Google Scholar) and characterized with respect to its enzymological and kinetic properties(6.Wissing J.B. Kornak B. Funke A. Riedel B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 903-909Google Scholar).Metabolic labeling studies using C. roseus have shown that DGPP is rapidly metabolized by a membrane-associated phosphatase, which has been named DGPP phosphatase. 2B. Riedel, W.-I. Wu, G. M. Carman, and J. B. Wissing, manuscript in preparation. DGPP phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of DGPP to form PA and Pi.2 In addition to being present in plant cells, DGPP phosphatase activity is also present in membrane fractions of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver.2 Whereas it is unclear what role DGPP plays in phospholipid metabolism and cell growth, PA, the product of the DGPP phosphatase reaction, plays a major role in lipid metabolism. PA is the precursor of all phospholipids and triacylglycerol(7.Kennedy E.P. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W.A. Lipids and Membranes: Past, Present and Future. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 171-206Google Scholar, 8.Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Google Scholar). In addition, PA regulates the activity of several lipid-dependent enzymes (9.Bae-Lee M. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7221-7226Google Scholar, 10.Moritz A. DeGraan P.N.E. Gispen W.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13172-13178Google Scholar) and has mitogenic effects in animal cells (13.Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Tilly B.C. Verlaan I. Bierman A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Google Scholar, 14.Yu C.-L. Tsai M.-H. Stacey D.W. Cell. 1988; 52: 63-71Google Scholar, 15.Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Google Scholar). Thus, the discovery of DGPP phosphatase activity in a wide range of organisms suggests that this enzyme may play an important role in phospholipid metabolism and cell growth.A purified preparation of DGPP phosphatase is required for defined studies on the mechanism and regulation of this novel enzyme of phospholipid metabolism. Owing to its amenable molecular genetic system, we are using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model eucaryote to study DGPP phosphatase. We report in this paper the purification of DGPP phosphatase to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme was characterized with respect to its enzymological and kinetic properties. Moreover, we demonstrated that S. cerevisiae synthesized DGPP via the PA kinase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2082325881,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is a linear homopolymer of α-2,8-linked sialic acid residues whose expression is developmentally regulated and modulates the adhesive property of the neural adhesion molecule, N-CAM. Recently, hamster and human cDNAs encoding polysialyltransferase (PST-1 for the hamster enzyme and PST for the human enzyme) were cloned, and by using the human cDNA it was demonstrated that the expression of PSA in N-CAM facilitates neurite outgrowth (Nakayama, J., Fukuda, M.N., Fredette, B., Ranscht, B., and Fukuda, M.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 92, 7031-7035; Eckhardt, M.A., Mühlenhoff, M., Bethe, A., Koopman, J., Frosch, M., and Gerardy-Schahn, R.(1995) Nature 373, 715-718.) Although these studies demonstrated that PST-1 and PST synthesize PSA in cultured cells, it was not shown that they could catalyze the polycondensation of α-2,8-linked sialic acid on a glycoconjugate template containing α-2,3-linked sialic acid. Here we demonstrate that PSA formation by PST is independent from the presence of N-CAM in vivo. We then develop an in vitro assay of PSA synthesis using glycoproteins other than N-CAM as acceptors and a soluble PST as an enzyme source. The soluble PST, produced as a chimeric protein fused with protein A, was incubated with rat α1-acid glycoprotein, fetuin or human α1-acid glycoprotein as acceptors together with the donor substrate CMP-[14C]NeuNAc. Incubation of fetuin with the soluble PST, in particular, resulted in a high molecular weight product that was susceptible to PSA-specific endoneuraminidase. Polysialylated products were not formed when α-2,3-linked sialic acid was removed from the acceptor fetuin before incubation. These results establish that a single enzyme, PST, alone can catalyze both the addition of the first α-2,8-linked sialic acid to α-2,3-linked sialic acid and the polycondensation of all α-2,8-linked sialic acids, yielding PSA.

https://openalex.org/W2003838908,"Calcium release from intracellular stores occurs in a graded manner in response to increasing concentrations of either inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or caffeine. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this quantal release phenomenon, [Ca2+] changes inside intracellular stores in isolated single smooth muscle cells were monitored with mag-fura 2. Following permeabilization with saponin or α-toxin the dye, loaded via its acetoxymethyl ester, was predominantly trapped in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Low caffeine concentrations in the absence of ATP induced only partial Ca2+ release; however, after inhibiting the calcium pump with thapsigargin the same stimulus released twice as much Ca2+. When the SR Ca2+-ATPase was rendered non-functional by depleting its “ATP pool,” submaximal caffeine doses almost fully emptied the stores of Ca2+. We conclude that quantal release of Ca2+ in response to caffeine in these smooth muscle cells is largely due to the activity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase, which appears to return a portion of the released Ca2+ back to the SR, even in the absence of ATP. Apparently the SR Ca2+-ATPase is fueled by ATP, which is either compartmentalized or bound to the SR. Calcium release from intracellular stores occurs in a graded manner in response to increasing concentrations of either inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or caffeine. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this quantal release phenomenon, [Ca2+] changes inside intracellular stores in isolated single smooth muscle cells were monitored with mag-fura 2. Following permeabilization with saponin or α-toxin the dye, loaded via its acetoxymethyl ester, was predominantly trapped in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Low caffeine concentrations in the absence of ATP induced only partial Ca2+ release; however, after inhibiting the calcium pump with thapsigargin the same stimulus released twice as much Ca2+.

Our data reveal that the base-induced native to unfolded transition of the protein is accompanied by a volume decrease of 0.014 cm3 g−1 and a compressibility decrease of 3.8 × 10−6 cm3 g−1 bar−1. These results allow us to conclude that, relative to a fully unfolded conformation, the base-denatured state of cytochrome c has only 70 to 80% of its surface area exposed to the solvent. Recently, we reported a similar result for the acid-denatured state of cytochrome c. Thus, insofar as solvent exposure is concerned, both the base- and the acid-induced unfolded states of cytochrome c retain some order, with 20 to 30% of their surface areas remaining solvent-inaccessible. We discuss the implications of this result in terms of defining potential intermediate states in protein folding pathways.—Chalikian, T. V., Gin- dikin, V. S., Breslauer, K. J.

Natural hIL5 is a disulfide-linked, homodimeric glycoprotein with 115 residues per chain. The high resolution crystal structures of both Escherichia coli-expressed (Milburn et al., 1993) and Drosophila-expressed hIL5 (Johanson et al., 1995) have revealed a core of two four-helix bundles. Each four-helix bundle resembles the four-helix bundle seen in IL2 (Bazan and McKay, 1992), IL4 (Smith et al., 1992), and GM-CSF (Diederichs et al., 1991). However, the bundle organization in IL5 is unique in that helix D of one monomer combines with helices A, B, and C of the second monomer, and vice versa. In the two-bundle structure, the A and D helices form one face, the B and C helices a second. The organization of structural features on each face is palindromic, as observed for restriction sites in DNA. human interleukin 5 granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor single chain and wild type human interleukin 5, respectively (soluble) human interleukin 5 receptor α chain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction. Human IL5 receptor is composed of two different chains, denoted α and β (Tavernier et al., 1991). The α chain is specific for IL5 (Murata et al., 1992) and has a Kd in the 0.1-1 nM range depending on the assays and receptor forms examined (Li et al., 1996). In contrast, the β chain of hIL5R is not cytokine-specific but is shared with the receptors for IL3 and GM-CSF (Tavernier et al., 1991) and appears needed for signal transduction. A soluble form of hIL5 receptor α chain (shIL5Rα), which has only the extracellular domain of IL5Rα, also has been described. This binds to hIL5 with nanomolar affinity (Tavernier et al., 1991; Johanson et al., 1995). Despite the dimeric nature of IL5, a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between shIL5Rα and hIL5 has been reported (Devos et al., 1993; Johanson et al., 1995). New insights into the binding mechanism of IL5 to its receptor are emerging with the availability of high resolution structure and mutagenesis techniques. Data from hybrid constructs of mouse/human IL5 suggest that the carboxyl-terminal 36 residues of IL5 interact directly with the IL5Rα and confer species specificity (McKenzie et al., 1991). By Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the carboxyl-terminal region of hIL5, we found previously that Glu-110 and Trp-111 contribute significantly to receptor binding (Morton et al., 1995). In addition, mutation of residues (Glu-89 and Arg-91) in the loop between helices C and D have been found to affect binding to IL5Rα (Tavernier et al., 1995; Graber et al., 1995). All of these residues cluster around the interface between the two 4-helix bundles of hIL5 and appear to constitute a central patch for binding to a single molecule of hIL5Rα (Morton et al., 1995). In contrast, residue Glu-13, which is at the distal ends of the IL5 dimer away from the helix bundle interface, was suggested to interact with the β chain of IL5R, since mutation at this position resulted in loss of biological activity but did not affect the binding affinity to the α chain (Tavernier et al., 1995; Graber et al., 1995). While emerging data suggest models for the topography of receptor binding sites in hIL5, a more defined understanding is impeded by the homodimeric nature of the protein. Because of this, mutagenesis of wild type hIL5 inevitably has resulted in symmetrical changes in side chains on both sides of the 4-helix bundle interface. It is thus unclear whether one or both of the residues found to be important participate equally in receptor binding and, furthermore, whether the topology of binding is different for hIL5Rα versus hIL5Rβ. One way to overcome this limitation is asymmetric mutagenesis. Here, we report construction of an active single chain form of hIL5 dimer, denoted sc IL5, and its use to construct asymmetric mutations at residues Glu-110, Trp-111, Arg-91, and Glu-13. Construction of the COS expression vector pCDNIL5 containing the hIL5 coding sequence was described before (Morton et al., 1995). For construction of the sc IL5 gene, a DraIII/BglII linker containing the amino-terminal 5 amino acids of hIL5 and 2 glycine residues was mixed with a BglII/SacI fragment (14 kilobases) from pCDNIL5, and the mixture was ligated into pCDN-IL5 which had been digested with DraIII and SacI. The product of the 3-piece ligation, called pCDN-IL5(sc), encodes sc IL5, a monomeric protein containing two tandem hIL5 sequences joined by a 2-amino acid linker, Gly-Gly. The sequence of this construction was verified directly by the dideoxy method using the DyeDeoxy terminator kit from Applied Biosystems. Site-directed mutagenesis was first carried out on pCDN-IL5 by “cassette mutagenesis” (Wells et al., 1985). To make a single site mutagenesis in sc IL5, the mutant pCDN-IL5 was digested with BglII and ligated with the 350-base pair BglII fragment of pCDN-IL5(sc). To make double mutations in single chain hIL5, PCR mutagenesis (Landt et al., 1990) was used to mutate the residue on the amino-terminal half site of sc IL5. The template for the PCR reaction is pCDN-IL5. The resulting PCR fragment was then ligated into the BglII site of mutant pCDNIL5(sc) in which the corresponding residue on the carboxyl-terminal half site had been previously mutated. Presence of the desired mutations and absence of PCR mistakes were verified by DNA sequencing. Kinetic and equilibrium constants for the interaction between hIL5Rα and different forms of hIL5 were measured using an IAsys optical biosensor (Fisons) in an assay similar to that described previously (Morton et al., 1995). Briefly, the non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody 24G9 (Ames et al., 1995) was first immobilized onto the sensor surface. The expressed hIL5 from COS supernatants was anchored noncovalently but tightly to the non-neutralizing antibody. The binding of various concentrations of shIL5Rα to the attached hIL5 was then measured. All mutants studied here were found to bind to the anchoring antibody as tightly as wt hIL5 and dissociated only very slowly from the antibody within the time of each run of the assay. The very slow dissociation had no significant affect on the binding analysis (Morton et al., 1995). Biological activity was measured using a subclone of the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 (subclone TF-1.28), which is highly responsive to recombinant hIL5. For assay, cells were cultured in RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% heat-treated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plates with 96 round-bottomed wells were seeded with 5000 cells/well and incubated for 48 h in triplicate in the presence of serially diluted wt IL5 or sc IL5. Cultures were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham) for the final 4 h and processed for scintillation counting. Data were fitted to a 4-parameter logistic curve (Grafit 3.0), and EC50 values were calculated. Results are given as the mean of at least 3 determinations. Coefficients of variation were between 5 and 25%. Concentrations of wt IL5, sc IL5, and mutants were determined by Western blot analysis (Johanson et al., 1995) and by quantitative IL5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the monoclonal antibodies 24G9 and TRFK-5 (R & D Systems). The crystal structure of hIL5 has shown that the carboxyl terminus of one hIL5 monomer is very close to the amino terminus of the second monomer (Milburn et al., 1993). Also, both the amino and carboxyl termini of hIL5 are exposed to the solvent and are very flexible (Milburn et al., 1993; Johanson et al., 1995). Therefore, we joined the two hIL5 monomers together covalently with a peptide linker. Since Gly residues are flexible and often found in protein β-turns (Chou and Fasman, 1978), we engineered a single chain hIL5 (sc IL5) by connecting two hIL5 monomers with a Gly-Gly linker (Fig. 1A). sc IL5 and wt IL5 were expressed in COS cells, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-hIL5 antiserum (Morton et al., 1995). As shown in Fig. 1B, sc IL5 had the same molecular mass (∼34 kDa) as that of the wt IL5 under nonreducing conditions. The levels of expression of wt IL5 and sc IL5 were similar. Under reducing conditions, sc IL5 still ran as a dimer (34 kDa) while wt IL5 was reduced to two monomers (∼17 kDa) (Fig. 1B). The fact that hIL5 and sc IL5 had the same molecular masses under nondenaturing conditions indicated that both forms were glycosylated similarly and that no intermolecular disulfide bonds had formed in sc IL5. Binding of shIL5Rα to antibody-anchored wt IL5 or sc IL5 was measured using a sandwich biosensor assay (Fig. 2). The linear portions of the association and dissociation phases of sensorgrams for a series of shIL5Rα concentrations were analyzed to give kon and koff, as described previously (Morton et al., 1995). As summarized in Table 1, the kon and koff rates of sc IL5 were very close to those of wt IL5. The Kd values of sc IL5 and wt IL5 were also similar (4.2 nM and 4.4 nM, respectively). This indicates that the single chain form of hIL5 retains full binding activity to the hIL5 receptor α chain.Tabled 1 The binding of COS-expressed sc IL5 and wt IL5 to the full length IL5Rα was also compared by competition for binding of 125I-IL5 to Drosophila cell membranes containing expressed IL5Rα (Johanson et al., 1995). Single chain IL5 was equally as effective as wt IL5 in inhibiting the binding of 125I-IL5 to the cell membranes (data not shown), consistent with the biosensor data, suggesting that sc IL5 and wt IL5 can bind to the same site(s) of full-length IL5Rα with similar affinity. The ability of sc IL5 to induce signal transduction was measured by cell proliferation. Single chain IL5 showed activity comparable to that of wt IL5 in the TF-1 cell assay (Table 1). Overall, there were no major differences in either receptor binding or bioactivity of single chain and wild type IL5. The design of active sc IL5 made feasible asymmetric IL5 mutagenesis. We chose several residue positions for such mutations in this study to exemplify the approach. The mutations chosen were based on the crystal structure of IL5 and previous results showing a role in receptor binding or signal transduction (Devos et al., 1993; Johanson et al., 1995; Graber et al., 1995; Tavernier et al., 1995; Morton et al., 1995). These residues included Glu-110, Trp-111, and Arg-91 for IL5Rα binding and Glu-13 for signal transduction but not receptor α chain binding. When Ala residues were substituted in these positions symmetrically in the wt IL5 system, receptor binding and signal transduction activities were observed as shown in Table 1. The results with the symmetrical mutants were consistent with previously reported data (Morton et al., 1995). Similar overall properties were observed (Table 1) for symmetrical mutants made with sc IL5 for G110A and W111A, sc IL5 (G110A (a, b)) and sc IL5 (W111A (a, b)), respectively, although the extents of decrease in receptor binding and bioactivities were less for the sc IL5 mutants. The effects of asymmetric Ala mutagenesis in sc IL5 for Glu-110, Trp-111, Arg-91, and Glu-13 are shown in Table 1. In all cases, with the exception of Glu-13, single site mutations in the b domain of sc IL5 led to small but finite decreases (∼50%) in shIL5Rα binding activity compared with wt IL5. However, for each mutation, the reduction in binding affinity for the asymmetric construct was 4-19-fold less than that obtained with the corresponding double mutant (for example, sc IL5 (Glu-110 (b)) versus sc IL5 (Glu-110 (a, b))). Consistent with the binding affinity data, asymmetric mutagenesis of Glu-110, Trp-111, or Arg-91 all resulted in an increased EC50 value compared with that of sc IL5, but these values were 4-30-fold less than those obtained with the corresponding double mutants. Mutagenesis of Glu-13 in sc IL5 did not affect IL5Rα binding activity, as expected from earlier-reported results (Tavernier et al., 1995; Graber et al., 1995), but did cause a marked decrease in biological activity. The effect on activity of the single site E13A mutant in sc IL5 was nearly 10-fold less than that with the corresponding double mutant in wt IL5. Finally, we also formed two asymmetric double mutants in the sc IL5 system, namely (E13A (a), G110A (b)) and (E13A (b), G110A (b)). In the former, the mutations were in one 4-helix bundle, while in the latter, the two mutations were in different bundles. In both cases, the effects on IL5Rα binding were similar to that seen in the asymmetric E110A-alone mutants, while the decrease in bioactivity was far greater when each bundle contained one mutation than when one bundle had both while the other had none. In this study, we constructed a tethered dimer of hIL5 with a two-Gly linker. This single chain hIL5 has properties very similar to native hIL5 dimer in both receptor α chain binding and biological activity. Single chain hIL5 offers an opportunity to study the effect of changes in one of the two monomers, and hence one of the two 4-helix bundles, on properties of hIL5. Since hIL5 has a 2-fold palindromic symmetry and binds to shIL5Rα with a 1:1 stoichiometry, we were interested in investigating whether the IL5Rα binding site is formed by one or both monomers and how the topography of binding sites for receptor α and β chains could lead to signal transduction. Previous mutagenesis studies have mapped the IL5Rα binding site to residues near the central symmetry axis of the dimer, with residues Glu-110, Trp-111, and Arg-91 being the most important (Tavernier et al., 1995; Graber et al., 1995; Morton et al., 1995). Accordingly, we made asymmetric mutations at these positions on sc IL5. Our data do not fit well to a simple half-site reactivity model, since mutants with residues changed only on one monomer did not have complete wt activity (all showed ∼50% lower affinity). Also, the increased Kd values caused by these mutations were mainly due to an increase in the dissociation rate koff (Table 1). This is not expected for a half-site reactivity model, since the interaction face between ligand and receptor should remain the same for an ideal half-site model. However, each of the single-site mutants showed a much weaker decrease in IL5Rα binding than the double-site mutants. This result argues against the possibility that residues on both monomers are equally involved in IL5Rα binding. Our data are consistent with a model in which residues from both monomers form a central shared patch to interact with IL5Rα while the asymmetric receptor α chain uses structural elements from this patch asymmetrically to stabilize the IL5-IL5Rα complex. However, we do not believe it possible to conclusively define the detailed way in which α chain binding occurs from this first asymmetric mutagenesis study. Even less can be ventured for β chain binding from the E13A mutants, since we do not yet know the stoichiometry of the IL5-IL5Rβ interaction. A significant caveat in any interpretation of our asymmetric mutagenesis data is that we cannot be certain to what extent mutations may affect the folded structure of sc IL5. At least for the E110A and W111A mutants, several observations argue that gross conformational changes are unlikely. 1) Symmetrical mutants for these residues in wt IL5 have stabilities similar to that of native sequence wt IL5 (Morton et al., 1995). 2) Single chain IL5 had receptor binding and signal transduction activities equivalent to those of native sequence wt IL5. 3) The asymmetric mutants in sc IL5 for E110A and W111A were likely no more perturbed structurally than the double mutants. Furthermore, all of the mutants reported here were found to bind to the monoclonal antibody 24G9; this antibody appears to be conformationally dependent since it does not bind to reduced and alkylated hIL5 (data not shown). Hence, it is likely that the sc mutants we have made so far are not grossly unfolded. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out more subtle conformational changes as a factor in altered functional properties. This must await more deliberate structural analysis of purified mutants, a planned objective of future work. In conclusion, we have designed an IL5 system for asymmetric mutagenesis and have exemplified the approach of asymmetric mutagenesis with sc IL5. The results obtained suggest a model for IL5-IL5Rα receptor recognition in which residues from both 4-helix bundle domains contribute to the binding of a single molecule of IL5Rα, possibly by formation of a central patch as suggested previously (Morton et al., 1995). However, the receptor may use this symmetrical patch asymmetrically to stabilize the IL5-IL5Rα complex due to the asymmetry of the receptor molecule. It remains for further mutagenesis and, importantly, structural analysis of key mutants, to deduce a more refined and certain understanding of binding site topography for IL5Rα and ultimately the way this topography leads to signal transduction through IL5Rβ. We thank Ann Breen and Robert Hertzberg for performing the radioligand assay of sc IL5 with the full-length IL5Rα. We are grateful to Ganesh Sathe, Joyce Mao, and Stephanie Van Horne for their assistance with oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1604451007,"Although the cAMP-dependent (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) usually participate in unrelated biological processes, their enzymological properties are decidedly similar. Based upon the multitude of comparative studies conducted to date, it appears that these two enzymes exhibit very similar peptide substrate specificities. Furthermore, most inhibitors that have been reported for PKG serve in a nearly equal capacity for PKA. Consequently, the task of distinguishing between these enzymes, especially under in vivo conditions, has proved to be daunting. However, we have recently found that PKA will only phosphorylate non-amino acid residues whose alpha-configuration corresponds to that found in L-amino acids, whereas PKG will catalyze the phosphorylation of residues corresponding to both L- and D-amino acids (Wood, J., Mendelow, M., Yan, X., Corbin, J.D., Francis, S.H., and Lawrence, D.S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 174-179). Based on these results, we have designed a potent affinity label for PKG (KI = 21.1 +/- 4.7 microM), that has no measurable activity toward PKA. This represents the first example of an peptide-based inactivator that fully distinguishes between these two closely related enzymes. These results suggest that a similar strategy may provide highly specific inactivators for other protein kinases as well."
https://openalex.org/W2165596882,"A facilitated diffusion mechanism has been proposed to account for the kinetic efficiency with which restriction endonucleases are able to locate DNA recognition sites. Such a mechanism involves the initial formation of a nonspecific complex upon collision of the protein with the DNA, with the subsequent diffusion of the protein along the DNA helix until either a recognition site is located or the protein dissociates into solution. Protein translocation may be facilitated by either sliding along the DNA, hopping to nearby sites, or intersegment transfer over larger distances. Previous analyses of the manner in which restriction enzymes cleave DNA substrates did rule out the latter mechanism. To discriminate between protein sliding or scanning and protein hopping, we designed a unique DNA template with three overlapping, mutually exclusive recognition sites for the BssHII endonuclease. Analysis of the cleavage pattern demonstrated efficient usage of both external sites, whereas the centrally located site was not efficiently cleaved. These results confirm that linear diffusion of the BssHII enzyme occurs by scanning along the DNA. Furthermore, the scanning enzyme was found to stop and cleave at the first site encountered. Thus, a sliding restriction endonuclease recognizes cleavage sites with high fidelity, without skipping of potential sites.

Thus, a sliding restriction endonuclease recognizes cleavage sites with high fidelity, without skipping of potential sites. It is unlikely that site-specific DNA-binding proteins locate their target site by simple three-dimensional diffusion or trial-and-error mechanism (reviewed in (1.von Hippel P.H. Science. 1994; 263: 769-770Google Scholar)). In many cases, proteins use a nonspecific DNA binding affinity to remain attached to the DNA, where it moves freely and rapidly along the length of the DNA in search of specific target sequences. This mechanism will reduce the dimensionality of the search process and consequently speed up the rate of target location. Several mechanisms for the facilitated transfer of protein along a DNA ligand have been proposed(2.Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Google Scholar). These include a sliding mechanism along the DNA and several types of dissociation-reassociation processes (e.g. hopping over short distances or intersegment transfer). This translocation reaction is interrupted either by location of and binding to the specific target site or by dissociation of the protein from the DNA molecule. The sliding or scanning mechanism has been observed for several DNA-interacting proteins like the Escherichia coli lac repressor (reviewed in (3.von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Google Scholar)), RNA polymerase(4.Wheeler A.R. Woody A.-Y. M. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3322-3330Google Scholar, 5.Kabata H. Kurosawa O. Arai I. Washizu M.

Chem. 1989; 265: 17422-17427Google Scholar). Despite their abundant use in molecular biology, only a few restriction endonucleases have been studied seriously as DNA-binding enzymes. The best understood of the type II restriction enzymes is the EcoRI endonuclease(7.Jack W.E. Terry B.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4010-4014Google Scholar, 8.Langowski J.

Diffusion mechanisms along the DNA helix contour have been proposed to account for the kinetic efficiency with which this protein is able to locate its recognition and cleavage sites. Similar diffusion/sliding/scanning mechanisms have been proposed for the HindIII and BamHI endonucleases, as well as for the BamHI methylase enzyme(10.Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Google Scholar, 11.Nardone G. George J. Chirkjian J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12128-12133Google Scholar). Knowledge on the DNA search mechanism of restriction enzymes is based primarily on kinetic studies, combined with a detailed analysis of the cleavage pattern with circular and linear DNA templates containing one or more cleavage sites. These experiments demonstrated that the EcoRI enzyme has more leeway to find the cleavage sites if the sites are centrally located on a linear DNA rather than near an end (9.Ehbrecht H-J. Pingoud A.

This finding is consistent with the involvement of bidirectional diffusion, facilitated by a nonspecific endonuclease-DNA interaction, in the path by which the EcoRI protein locates substrate sites. Furthermore, this endonuclease was demonstrated to act processively over distances up to several hundred base pairs. Thus, evidence for the involvement of positionally facilitated diffusion (sliding) during DNA search by EcoRI endonuclease appears quite compelling, but a contribution of positionally uncorrelated mechanisms (e.g. intersegment transfer) cannot be ruled out completely. Likewise, kinetic analyses of the lac repressor-operator system demonstrated that sliding was the dominant mechanism under the experimental conditions used(12.Winter R.B. Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6961-6968Google Scholar), but different experimental approaches have led to the suggestion that intersegment transfer may also be involved(13.Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 263-282Google Scholar). We have investigated some aspects of the DNA site selection mechanism for the BssHII endonuclease using a novel approach with a unique DNA template containing multiple, mutually exclusive recognition sites. The 11.6-kilobase pLAI plasmid (14.Peden K. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Google Scholar) contains a single BssHII site (GCGCGC or GC3) that was used to construct the GC5 derivative. In short, the DNA was linearized with BssHII, and sticky ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme in the presence of dNTPs, followed by religation of the blunt ends. The GC5 mutation was verified by sequence analysis. Both GC3 and GC5 forms were subcloned as XbaI-ClaI fragment in the Bluescript KS+ vector, yielding the 3.8-kilobase plasmid Blue-5′LTR (15.Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3830-3840Google Scholar). BssHII, HindIII, XhoI, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from commercial sources (BssHII from Boehringer Mannheim, 10 kilounits/ml). Linearized plasmids (approximately 100 ng) were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (typically 3000 Ci/mmol). Standard BssHII cleavage reactions were performed in buffer A (33 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 66 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) at 50°C for 1 h with 32P-labeled DNA and 2 units of endonuclease. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5 volume of formamide-loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 85°C, and separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels. We designed a DNA sequence containing three identical but overlapping recognition sites for a restriction endonuclease. The rationale of this design is that cleavage of one site will destroy the other two recognition sites, which allows one to measure the cleavage efficiency of individual sites in a non-kinetic type of experiment. In order to create an overlap of three identical restriction sites, one is restricted to palindromes consisting of dinucleotide repeats. For 6-mer recognition sites there are only four candidate sequences: ATATAT, TATATA, CGCGCG, and GCGCGC. No restriction enzymes with specificity for the former three sites are currently known. This leaves GCGCGC or GC3, recognized by the BssHII enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus H3, as a unique restriction site to perform this type of analysis. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of a multimerized GC5 sequence containing three overlapping BssHII sites numbered I, II, and III. Cleavage of either one of these BssHII sites results in destruction of the other two recognition motifs (Fig. 1). In other words, the three BssHII sites are mutually exclusive, which allows one to analyze the site selection mechanism by inspection of the digestion pattern upon complete digestion with excess enzyme. If the BssHII enzyme locates cleavage sites by tediously testing all possible 6-mers in the target DNA (trial-and-error), the three sites should be recognized with approximately equal efficiency. In contrast, if the BssHII enzyme transfers along the DNA in a positionally correlated manner, the enzyme should sample and cleave the external sites I and III before the internal site II is being recognized. Because usage of one site will preempt any further cleavage, the latter mechanism predicts that the external sites I and III will be preferentially cleaved. Initial tests were performed with a Bluescript-derived test plasmid (Fig. 1, Blue-5′LTR) containing either one or three BssHII sites (GC3 and GC5). The GC3 and GC5 plasmid was first linearized with either HindIII or XhoI, 32P-end labeled, and subsequently treated with BssHII. The cleavage products were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2a). The HindIII-labeled GC3 control sample produces two BssHII-HindIII fragments of 180 and 694 bp 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). (lane 2). In GC5, the smallest of the two fragments is heterogeneous in size due to cleavage at one of the three BssHII sites (lane 4). The fragments of 180, 182, and 184 bp correspond to cleavage at BssHII site I, II, or III, respectively. In the XhoI-labeling experiment, GC3 produces 52- and 134-bp fragments (lane 6, the 52-bp fragment can be seen with shorter electrophoresis times, see e.g.Fig. 2b, lanes 1-5). The GC5 construct produces a mixture of 134-, 136-, and 138-bp fragments (Fig. 2a, lane 12) that correspond to BssHII cleavage at site III, II, or I, respectively. The individual bands were quantitated in order to calculate the relative efficiency of BssHII cleavage. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 and demonstrate that the internal site II is not efficiently recognized/cleaved by the BssHII enzyme. These results were obtained under standard BssHII digestion conditions at 50°C, but similar digestion patterns were observed in reactions at 37°C (data not shown).Figure 3:Schematic presentation of the cleavage efficiency at BssHII sites I, II, and III. The data are from the gel shown in Fig. 2a, but similar results were obtained on at least four different occasions (see e.g.Fig. 2b). Medium gray column, site I; light gray column, site II; dark gray column, site III.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) base pair(s). The major BssHII cleavage product with the XhoI-linearized plasmid is the smallest 134-bp fragment. Although this is thought to reflect efficient recognition of site III, we cannot formally exclude that it is in fact the result of additional BssHII activity after initial cleavage at sites I and/or II (nibbling of the end). This hypothetical possibility seems unlikely because the same site III is preferred in the HindIII experiment, where it produces the largest (184 bp) of three possible fragments. To further rule out this scenario, we analyzed DNA samples at early and late time points after addition of the BssHII enzyme (Fig. 2b, lanes 1-5). It is obvious that the ratio of cleavage sites I:II:III cleavage remains constant over the whole incubation period. Similar results were obtained in a kinetic analysis of the HindIII-linearized plasmid (lanes 6-10). Restriction enzymes have been reported to display a substantial preference for more centrally located recognition sites on linearized DNA templates(9.Ehbrecht H-J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Google Scholar, 10.Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Google Scholar). This effect can be understood in terms of the initial contact between the enzyme and flanking, nonspecific DNA segments. It is clear that this process is restricted for cleavage sites located close to an end of linear DNA. Because the GC5 motif is asymmetrically located on the linearized Blue-5′LTR plasmid, one expects the more centrally located sites to be favored by virtue of the lengthy DNA flanks. For instance, the XhoI-treated DNA has a short 134-bp arm for nonspecific enzyme binding to serve site III, whereas site I is flanked by 3710 bp (Fig. 1). Likewise, there is pronounced asymmetry in the HindIII-cleaved template, with 3664 and 180 bp flanking sites III and I, respectively. Consistent with the idea of a positional effect, we did repeatedly observe a somewhat higher cleavage efficiency of site I versus site III in the XhoI samples compared with the HindIII samples (Fig. 3). However, two experimental conditions are likely to restrict the magnitude of this effect in our assays. First, length dependence will only be apparent if DNA-enzyme association is rate-limiting for the enzymatic turnover, which is usually achieved by employing sufficiently dilute solutions of enzyme. In contrast, we used excess restriction enzyme to digest the DNA template with mutually exclusive BssHII sites. Second, we note that the asymmetry in the flanking DNA arms is transient only because of the presence of additional BssHII sites in the Blue-5′LTR vector (Fig. 1). For instance, cleavage at these BssHII sites will reduce the size of the 3664-bp arm in HindIII-linearized DNA to 186 bp (Fig. 1, 134 + 52 bp). We further investigated the mechanism of BssHII action on a circular DNA template. The Blue-5′LTR vectors could not be used for this test because of the additional BssHII sites flanking the polylinker region. We therefore used the pLAI-type plasmid (Fig. 1) with the unique GC3 or GC5 sequence. The two plasmids were first digested to completion with BssHII, followed by HindIII digestion and end labeling of the fragments. The control GC3 produces two BssHII-HindIII fragments of discrete length (180 and 374 bp, Fig. 2a, lane 10). Cleavage of the GC5 variant is expected to produce a distinct set of fragments (either 180 + 378, 182 + 376, or 184 + 374 bp upon cleavage at site I, II, or III, respectively). The digestion mixture was resolved on polyacrylamide gel (lane 12), and individual bands in the 180-bp region were quantitated (Fig. 3). The BssHII cleavage characteristics with the circular GC5 plasmid are very similar to results obtained with the linearized plasmids. The combined results indicate that the centrally located site II is not efficiently cleaved by the enzyme, which is consistent with the “accurate scanning” mechanism. Two additional comments should be made. First, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that site II is relatively inactive because it is in a “bad” sequence context. Certain restriction enzymes show preferential cleavage of some sites in the same plasmid substrate. Most dramatic effects have been observed for a distinct group of restriction endonucleases (NarI, NaeI, and SacII) that like BssHII recognize sites composed entirely of G and C bases. 21995 New England Biolabs catalogue. This group of restriction enzymes was demonstrated to require the simultaneous interaction with two copies of the recognition sequence before cleavage occurs(16.Kruger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3997-4008Google Scholar, 17.Conrad M. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9707-9711Google Scholar). However, other GC hexamer-recognizing enzymes (SmaI, ApaI) do not exhibit such marked site preference.2 Kinetic analysis of BssHII cleavage of the three non-overlapping sites in plasmid Blue-5′LTR GC3 indicates that BssHII does not exhibit a marked site preference (see e.g.Fig. 2b and data not shown). Furthermore, the unique BssHII site in pLAI-GC3 is efficiently cleaved (not shown), suggesting that BssHII does not belong to the group of restriction endonucleases that require at least two simultaneously bound substrate sites for their activation. A second remark concerns the accuracy of DNA site selection during the scanning process. If scanning of the BssHII enzyme was inaccurate with respect to recognition of the GCGCGC site, the enzyme would frequently slip over the first site encountered (that is the external site I or III), and this would increase the frequency with which internal site II is reached and cleaved. Apparently, the search capacity of the sliding enzyme is extremely accurate such that the majority of enzyme will recognize, stop, and cleave at the first site encountered (either site I or III). In other words, the BssHII enzyme does read each 6-mer it passes with high fidelity. This finding is striking if we realize that the sliding rate of a restriction enzyme has been reported to be approximately 7.3 × 106 base pairs/s(9.Ehbrecht H-J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Google Scholar). In order for the enzyme to accurately read all 6-mers along the way, this would translate into 7.3 × 106 discrete diffusion steps/s.

https://openalex.org/W1864499029,"Our previous work has shown that the Escherichia coli groES14 and groES15 mutations result in reduced GroE chaperone machine function. By selecting for restoration of the ability of those mutant groES alleles to suppress the thermosensitivity of bacteria bearing the dnaA46 mutation, we isolated a number of intra- and extragenic suppressors that increase in vivo GroE chaperone function. One of the intragenic suppressors has been mapped to a segment that codes for the GroES mobile loop, previously shown to be indispensable for proper GroES/GroEL interaction. Two extragenic suppressors have been mapped to a groEL segment, previously identified by mutational analysis as coding for an important functional region of the GroEL protein. Our results should contribute to our eventual understanding of the structure-function relationships of the universally conserved GroE chaperone machine."
