https://openalex.org/W2039987663,"Field studies have indicated that bolas spiders attract male moth prey, apparently by mimicking the odor of female moth sex pheromones. Three moth sex pheromone compounds, (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate, (Z)-9-tetradecenal, and (Z)-11-hexadecenal, were identified in volatile substances emitted by hunting adult female Mastophora cornigera spiders. These compounds are components of pheromone blends that attract some of this spider's moth prey species."

Questions in such surveys may be either ""open"" or ""closed."" Two experiments are reported that demonstrate the difficulty of inferring not only absolute levels but even relative orderings of public choices from either type of question, although such questions can be used more successfully to study temporal change or variations across social categories."
https://openalex.org/W2003292588,"Which species affect one another, how intensely, and the mechanisms of those effects are crucial data for understanding how ecological communities work. Tropical islands without lizards, the major top predators, have about ten times as dense web spider populations as those with lizards; processes responsible for this effect were experimentally simulated by removing lizards from randomly selected mainland plots. Spider densities in removal plots averaged 2.5 times as high as controls. Spider survival, prey abundance, and prey consumption were all negatively affected by lizards. Contrary to most studies, predator removal caused an increase in the number of spider species."
https://openalex.org/W2050665737,"Analysis of isozyme variability demonstrates that bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) has a diploid genetic system and expresses solely disomic inheritance patterns. Electrophoretic data indicate that genetically variable progeny are produced in natural populations after intergametophytic mating rather than by a process involving recombination between duplicated unlinked loci. Although some enzymes are encoded by more than one locus, this has resulted from subcellular compartmentalization of isozymes, and there is no evidence of extensive gene duplication resulting from polyploidy. The conclusions reached in this report differ from those which propose polyploidy as an adaptive mechanism for maintaining genetic variability in Pteridium and other homosporous pteridophytes."

This change required stronger music wire. Although these changes coincided with the introduction of the first mass-produced steel (iron alloyed with carbon), carbon was not found in samples of antique iron harpsichord wire. The wire contained an amount of phosphorus sufficient to have impeded its conversion to steel, and may have been drawn from iron rejected for this purpose. The method used to select pig iron for wire drawing ensured the highest possible phosphorus content at a time when its presence in iron was unsuspected. Phosphorus as an alloying element has had the reputation for making steel brittle when worked cold. Nevertheless, in replicating the antique wire, it was found that lowcarbon iron that contained 0.16 percent phosphorus was easily drawn to appropriate gauges and strengths for restringing antique harpsichords."

https://openalex.org/W2007914441,"Thanks to drastic cost cutting in the past 2 years, US enrichment plants now have the lowest cost production in the world, but US prices are still higher than those of overseas competitors because the business is paying for past mistakes. The most serious difficulty is that the Department of Energy (DOE), which owns and operates the US enrichment enterprise, is paying more than $500 million a year to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for electricity it once thought it would need but no longer requires. Another is that billions of dollars were spent in the 1970s and early 1980s to build new capacity that is now not needed. As a result, the enrichment enterprise has accumulated a debt to the US Treasury that the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates at $8.8 billion. This paper presents the background and current debate in Congress about the difficulties facing the enrichment industry. In the midst of this debate over the future of the enterprise, the development of the next generation of enrichment technology is being placed in jeopardy. Known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation, or AVLIS, the process was viewed as the key to the long-term competitiveness of US enrichment. Asmore » the federal deficit mounted, however, funding for the AVLIS program was cut back and the timetable was stretched out. The US enrichment program has reached the point at which Congress will be forced to make some politically difficult decisions.« less"
