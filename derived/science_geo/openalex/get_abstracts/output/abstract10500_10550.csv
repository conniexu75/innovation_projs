https://openalex.org/W2062099855,"Antibodies specific for the skeletal muscle structural protein α-actinin are used to localize this protein by indirect immunofluorescence in nonmuscle cells. In cultured nonmuscle cells, α-actinin is localized along or between actin filament bundles producing an almost regular periodicity. The protein is also detected in the form of fluorescent plaques at some ends of actin filament bundles, as well as in a filamentous form in some overlap areas of cells. In spreading rat embryo cells, α-actinin assumes a focal distribution which corresponds to the vertices of a highly regular actin filament network. The results suggest that α-actinin may be involved in the organization of actin filament bundles, in the attachment of actin filaments to the plasma membrane, and in the assembly of actin filaments in areas of cell to cell contact."

https://openalex.org/W2169255375,"All types of double-stranded RNA (DSRNA) tested inhibit protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The inhibition is characterized by its strongly biphasic kinetics, and can be enhanced by preincubation of the lysate with dsRNA in the absence of protein synthesis. Only properly and extensively matched dsRNA (greater than about 50 base pairs) has this property; no form of DNA, single-stranded RNA or even RNA-DNA hybrids act as inhibitors in this way. The cause of the inhibition appears to be a failure of initiator tRNA to associate with native ribosomal subunits in the initiation process (Darnbrough, C., Hunt, T., and Jackson, R. J. (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 48, 1556-1564). We have shown that this block is not accompanied by stable association of dsRNA with the ribosomes. There are several reasons to believe that the mechanism of action of dsRNA may be complex with the possible involvement of at least one catalytic step. First, the lysate is inhibited by levels of dsRNA at which ribosomes are present in 100-fold excess over base pairs of dsRNA present. Second, high concentrations of dsRNA (greater than 10 mug per ml) are not inhibitory, but can in some, but not all experiments, reverse the inhibition caused by lower levels of dsRNA. Third, a lysate which has been inhibited by dsRNA, when mixed with a fresh lysate will inhibit synthesis in the mixture much more severely than would be expected from the concentration of dsRNA now present. These results indicate that low levels of dsRNA promote the formation of an inhibitor which may exist in two forms: one that is reversible by high levels of dsRNA and one that is irreversible."

https://openalex.org/W1544482700,"Bacteriophage T4-coded gene 32-protein is an essential component of the T4 replication and recombination systems. Alberts and co-workers (Alberts, B.M., Amodio, F.J., Jenkins, M., Gutmann, E.D., and Ferris, F.L. (1968) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 33, 289-305) have shown that the major physiological activity of the protein involves preferential and cooperative binding to single-stranded DNA. In this paper, the physiochemical parameters characterizing this melting protein system are quantitatively determined. Boundary sedimentation velocity experiments are used to measure the interaction of gene 32-protein with native DNA. The binding is shown to be non-cooperative and involves an overlapping site size (nh) of approximately 10 nucleotide residues (or approximately 5 nucleotide pairs). In analogy with the ribonuclease results (Jensen, D.E., and von Hippel, P.H. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 7198-7214), the logarithm of the association constant (Kh) is found to be linerarly related to log [Na+]. The binding of gene 32-protein to denatured (single-stranded) DNA involves appreciable distortion of the polynucleotide backbone from the unliganded conformation; binding totally unstacks the bases of both ribose- and deoxyribose-containing polynucleotides at 10 degrees, and results in a hyperchromic change exceeding that which can be induced by heating. This hyperchromism induced in poly(dA) on binding gene 32-protein under low salt (tight binding) conditions is used to determine a value of nc (the single-stranded DNA site size) of approximately 6.7 nucldotide residues per protein. In addition, gene 32-protein binding to single-stranded polynucleotide induces an unusual circular dichroic spectrum characterized principally by a marked decrease in the magnitude of the positive CD band centered at approximately 265 nm. This spectral change is attributed to significant uncoupling of the transition moments of the vicinal bases of the single-stranded polynucleotide on gene 32-protein binding, in accord with the ultraviolet hyperchromism observed. Binding of gene 32-protein to double helical DNA has virtually no effect on the spectral properties of this conformation..."

The precursor molecule is 130 nucleotides long. Twenty-two extra nucleotides, starting with pppGp, precede the mature sequence at its 5' terminus. At least 1 extra uridine residue can be found at the 3' terminus. The precursor to 4.5 S RNA is cleaved in vitro by RNase P to generate a 5' end identical to that of the mature 4.5 S RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1574555295,"Functional half-life measurements of the bacteriophage T4 gene 32 messenger RNA indicate that this mRNA is extremely stable. Regulation of gene 32 expression at the transcriptional level cannot account for the rapidity with which P32 synthesis can be repressed. Furthermore, derepression of P32 synthesis occurs in the presence of rifampicin, a drug which inhibits transcriptional initiation. In addition, T4-infected cultures in which P32 expression is repressed possess almost as much gene 32 mRNA as derepressed cultures. We conclude that expression of the T4 gene 32 protein is regulated at the level of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2121378518,"We report here the formation of plasmid multimers in E. coli. Multimers are covalently closed, circular molecules composed of tandem repeats of the monomer plasmid. Multimer formation occurs at high frequency in rec+, recB-C-, and recF- hosts. Multimer formation is not detected in recA- hosts and occurs at reduced frequency in recB-C-F- hosts. We conclude that multimer formation is mediated by a single reciprocal recombination event occurring at homologous regions on the two plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W1601298028,"The gene 32 protein of the bacteriophage T4 plays an important role in genetic recombination, DNA repair, and DNA replication; the protein functions in these processes by virtue of a strong binding capacity for single-stranded DNA. During infections of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage carrying amber of temperature-sensitive mutations in gene 32, the altered gene 32 protein (that is, the amber fragment of the missense polypeptide) is synthesized at greatly elevated rates. During infections by phages that are mutant in other genes (and wild type in gene 32), gene 32 expression is coupled to the quantity of single-stranded DNA produced during the infection. The data are consistent with a model in which the gene 32 protein binds preferentially to all available single-stranded DNA. When all available single-stranded DNA is complexed with gene 32 protein, free gene 32 protein represses its own synthesis. The high level expression of altered gene 32 proteins (amber fragments or missense polypeptides) is a direct consequence of the proposed autoregulation."

https://openalex.org/W1897190662,"The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of bacteriophage T4-coded gene 32-protein is found to be partially quenched on binding a variety of mono-, oligo-, and polynucleotides. This phenomenon is exploited to partially map the nucleic acid binding site of the protein. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the protein peaks at about 347 nm, compared to 359 nm for the fully solvated model fluorophore, N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide. Nucleotide binding, or collisional quenching by iodide ion, reduces the intensity of the fluorescence, with little or no peak shift. Small ligands, ranging in size from ribose- and deoxyribose-phosphate to tetranucleotides, quench the fluorescence by 2 to 6%; larger ligands quench from 20 to 35% of the intrinsic protein fluorescence. Iodide quenching experiments subjected to Stern-Vollmer analysis suggest that the binding of short nucleotide-containing ligands brings about a conformational change in the protein, fully exposing a tryptophan side chain to the solvent environment. The fluorescence of this tryptophan is fully quenched by the binding of d(Ap)2, but is largely unaffected by the binding of d(ApA) or d(pA)2, indicating both that this (tryptophan) reporter residue is located in the nucleic acid binding site and that binding is polar, i.e. polynucleotide chains of only one orientation are complexed. Long oligonucleotides fully quench the fluorescence of this binding site tryptophan. At high salt concentration (2 M NaCl), gene 32-protein forms self-limited dimers (Carroll, R.B., Neet, K.E., and Goldthwait, D.A. (1972) Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 2741-2744; (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 91, 275-291). These dimers, in either high salt or in low salt after cross-linking, fail to bind nucleotides, suggesting that dimer formation partially occludes the nucleic acid binding site and thus that these dimers are probably not involved as intermediates in cooperative protein binding to the DNA. On the other hand, dimerization apparently results in a conformational change which fully exposes the reporter tryptophan to iodide quenching. These results are used to formulate a model of some of the nucleic acid-protein and protein-protein interactions involved in the cooperative binding of gene 32-protein to single-stranded DNA."

The nondisplaceable pool probably represents secretory granules, while the displaceable pool may be located in the β-cell membrane. Kinetic studies with isotopically labeled islets suggest that only the displaceable pool participates in the short-term coupling of the glucose stimulus with secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1969152897,"tRNA isolated from two different yeast super-suppressor strains translates a known nonsense mutation in vitro, whereas tRNA from a closely related nonsuppressing strain does not. Suppression was assayed by translation of RNA isolated from an amber coat mutant of bacteriophage Qβ (GB11) in a protein-synthesizing system derived from mouse tissue culture cells (L cells). Suppressed forms of Qβ coat protein synthesized in vitro were quantitatively detected by a specific immunoprecipitation assay. The L-cell protein-synthesizing system also responds to E. coli suppressor tRNA. This indicates that the biochemical mechanism for nonsense suppression is very similar in yeast and E. coli. These findings also provide additional evidence that the amber codon (UAG) functions as one of the mammalian chain-terminating codons. Since the suppression assay utilizes protein-synthesizing components isolated from mammalian cells, it should prove useful in the search for mammalian nonsense suppressors."

https://openalex.org/W2040559319,"Temperature-sensitive mutants of E. coli have been isolated which restrict the growth of strains of bacteriophage T4 which are dependent upon the function of a T4-coded amber or ochre suppressor transfer RNA. One such mutant restricts the growth of certain ochre but not amber suppressor-requiring phage. Analysis of the T4 tRNAs synthesized in this host revealed that many nucleotide modifications are significantly reduced. The modifications most strongly affected are located in the anticodon regions of the tRNAs. The T4 ochre suppressor tRNAs normally contain a modified U residue in the wobble position of the anticodon; it has been possible to correlate the absence of this specific modification in the mutant host with the restriction of suppressor activity. Furthermore, the extent of this restriction varies dramatically with the site of the nonsense codon, indicating that the modification requirement is strongly influenced by the local context of the mRNA. An analysis of spontaneous revertants of the E. coli ts mutant indicates that temperature sensitivity, restriction of phage suppressor function, and undermodification of tRNA are the consequences of a single genetic lesion. The isolation of a class of partial revertants to temperature insensitivity which have simultaneously become sensitive to streptomycin suggests that the translational requirement for the anticodon modification can be partially overcome by a change in the structure of the ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1601225851,"The interaction of 6-(phenylhydrazino)-pyrimidines and Bacillus subtilis DNA polymerase III was examined in experiments exploiting agarose gel filtration of mixtures of drug, DNA, and purified enzyme. 6-(p-Hdroxyphenylhydrazino)-uracil and 6-(p-hydroxyphenylhydrazino)-isocytosine were used as model inhibitors; both drugs induced the formation of a distinct polymerase-DNA complex. Comples formation required the inhibitory, hydrazino forms of the drugs and a form of DNA suitable as a primer-template for DNA polymerase III. dGTP and dATP, which respectively, competitively antagonize the inhibitory effects of the uracil and isocytosine derivatives, antagonized in an equally specific manner the respective capacities of these compounds to induce complex formation. Experiments exploiting both wild type and drug-resistant, mutant polymerases indicated that drug concentrations required for the half-maximal induction of complex formation were nearly identical with the apparent inhibitor constants (Ki) determined independently by kinetic analysis of enzyme inhibition. These results and those of experiments exploiting defined homopolymer-oligomer combinations as template-primers support a model of inhibitor action in which arylhydrazinopyrimidine forms a reversible, ternary complex with the enzyme and an appropriate timplate pyrimidine residue in an area adjacent to the 3-hydroxyl primer terminus."

This information provided a means of testing, in vivo, an early hypothesis suggesting that cycloheximide inhibited the initiation as well as elongation steps of protein synthesis. Our data suggest that initiation of protein synthesis in yeast may be inhibited by low concentrations of cycloheximide which do not significantly affect polypeptide chain elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2020559947,"A 2000 base pair (bp) DNA fragment can be excised from sea urchin (S. purpuratus) histone gene repeat units with restriction endonuclease Eco R1. This DNA, which has been cloned in a bacterial plasmid, is known to encompass two of the five histone genes. The fragment has a single endonuclease Hind III cleavage site in one of the genes and a Hae III cleavage site in the other gene. We now report the nucleotide sequences of 62 bp adjacent to the Hind III site and 42 bp adjacent to the Hae III cleavage site. The results identify the cloned DNA as histone genes, show that it codes for histone proteins H2A and H3, and locate and orient H2A and H3 genes with respect to restriction endonuclease sites in the repeat unit."
https://openalex.org/W1679028109,"The effects of insertion of the major coat protein of f1 bacteriophage into Escherichia coli membranes were investigated. The relative level of phosphatidylethanolamine decreased due to the failure to accumulate phosphatidylethanolamine when the cellular levels of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were increasing. This decreased accumulation was correlated with a 4-fold reduction in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. A 10- to 20-fold increase in cardiolipin content resulted from both a 3-fold increase in cardiolipin synthesis and a decrease in cardiolipin turnover. As long as cell division and protein synthesis continued, the number of cardiolipin molecules per coat protein molecules in the bacterium attained a constant value. The coat protein had little effect of phosphatidylglycerol synthesis. This data suggests that the coat protein froms a specific association with cardiolipin in the host membranes. Additional evidence suggests that cardiolipin also may facilitate the entry of coat protein into membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1605935351,"Dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli exists as two species, which show large differences in their affinities for trimethoprim and for pyrimethamine. The two species are present in approximately equal proportions. Each possesses one binding site per mol with dissociation constants (KD) of 14 and 1400 nM, respectively, for the binding of trimethoprim in the binary complex, and of 5 and 47 nM for the pyrimethamine binary complex. In the formation of the ternary complex with NADPH, trimethoprim bound to dihydrofolate reductase as if all the enzyme existed as a single species with a KD for trimethoprim of 1.9 nM. Formation of the trimethoprim NADPH ternary complex thus involves strong cooperative effects, and interconversion of the two species. The binding of pyrimethamine in the ternary complex was indistinguishable from its binding in the binary complex, showing neither the cooperative effects, nor the interconversion of the two species observed with trimethoprim. The species with a low KD for trimethoprim and pyrimethamine could be isolated by selective proteolysis. It was quite stable, but could be converted to a mixture of the original species via formation of the ternary complex with trimethoprim, as predicted from the binding data. The results are interpreted in terms of a model in which the two species can be interconverted only via the formation of a common ternary complex, which can be formed after the binding of trimethoprim or dihydrofolate, but not pyrimethamine. The model is shown to be consistent with all data from the measurements of both binding and inhibition by both ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1511106045,"ADP-glucose synthase (EC 2.7.7.27) was purified to homogeneity from SG5-504, Aa mutant strain of Escherichia coli B. It had a molecular weight of approximately 2 X 10(5) and four identical subunits. In the presence of its allosteric activator, fructose-1-6-P2, the mutant enzyme formed oligomers with several times the tetramer molecular weight, as revealed by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel filtration column chromatography. Enzyme purified from a wild type strain, AC70R1, did not exhibit the activator-induced oligomerization. Catalytically, the mutant enzyme had a 2-fold higher affinity for activator and a 2- to 3-fold lower affinity for the allosteric inhibitors 5'-adenylate and KH2PO4 than the wild type. The two enzymes appeared identical in subunit molecular weight, amino acid composition, COOH-terminal amino acid, and the first 27 residues of the NH2-terminal sequence. Subtle structural differences were revealed by chemical modification of specific residues. Compared to wild type, the mutant enzyme had 1 cysteine/subunit more accessible to modification by Ellman's reagent. SG5-504 enzyme was inactivated more slowly than AC70R1 enzyme by phenylglyoxal and by trinitrobenzenesulfonate. These results reflected an altered conformation of the SG5-504 enzyme molecule. The unique ability of it to oligomerize in the presence of activator may be the result of a single amino acid substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1654225167,"Tetrahymena grown in poorly aerated cultures have a greater capacity to utilize oxygen than cells grown in relatively well aerated cultures. Paradoxically, the oxidation of (1-14C)-glucose was inhibited, while oxidation of (2-14C)pyruvate and (2-14C)glyoxylate was enhanced in cells grown under relatively anaerobic conditions. Total glycogen content measured after 17 hours of growth was increased 30 to 60% in cells grown partially anaerobically. In 1-hour incubations at the end of this time, the capacity to incorporate label into glycogen from (1-14C)pyruvate and (2-14C)glyoxylate was increased several fold. The ratio of adenosine di- and triphosphates was nearly identical in the cells grown under different conditions of oxygenation, indicating that this ratio may not play a major role in regulating these changes. After 17 hours of growth in cultures of different depths, cells were also incubated with a mixture of acetate, pyruvate, and octanoate, with one substrate labeled at a time in such a way that (1-14C)-acetyl-CoA is generated at the initial step in the metabolism of each. These results were interpreted in terms of a previously developed three-compartment model of acetyl-CoA metabolism. Glyconeogenesis from peroxisomal and mitochondrial precursors was increased in cells grown in low oxygen tension, with the greater contribution coming from the peroxisomes. Oxidation of acetate and pyruvate was increased under these conditions, but appearance of (1-14C)-acetate label in glutamate was decreased. Lipogenesis from labeled peroxisomal precursors was also increased in cells grown under relatively low oxygen tension. After a shift down in O2 tension there is a rapid rise in glyconeogenesis from the peroxisomes which levels off after about 4 hours, whereas the rate of oxidation in the Krebs cycle increases steadily for at least 8 hours following the transition to relatively anaerobic conditions. In response to a shift up in O2 tension there is a decline in peroxisomal glyconeogenesis which continues for 8 hours, whereas the rate of oxidation in the Krebs cycle does not begin decreasing until about 4 hours after the increase in O2 tension. Thus the flux of (1-14C)acetyl-CoA changes according to a different temporal pattern in mitochondria as compared to peroxisomes, and in each compartment the sequence of changes in response to a shift up in O2 tension is not the mirror image of the sequence in response to a shift down."

https://openalex.org/W1509808697,"The dye tetraiodofluorescein (TIF) was found to be an effective inhibitor of yeast hexokinase. It is a competitive inhibitor relative to MgATP2- and a noncompetitive inhibitor of glucose binding, a kinetic pattern consistent with the previously proposed random kinetic mechanism. TIF interacts directly with the native dimeric protein to give a difference spectrum with a maximum at 543 nm. Monomeric protein (produced by addition of 0.6 M NaCl) interacts with TIF to give a slightly altered difference spectrum, with the gammamax at 545 nm. The difference spectrum of the dimeric form is not perturbed by the addition of substrates but the absorbance with the monomer is lowered by MgATP2-. The Kd for MgATP2- was estimated to be 7 nM for monomeric hexokinase. These results suggest that results of previous binding studies with hexokinase at high concentrations which have been interpreted as being at variance with kinetic studies are due likely to different conformations of the protein under different experimental conditions."
