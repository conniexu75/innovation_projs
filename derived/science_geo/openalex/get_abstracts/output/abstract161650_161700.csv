https://openalex.org/W2027375557,"The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is a key substrate for cell migration in tissues during inflammation, wound healing, and neoplasia. Unlike other matrix components, hyaluronan (HA) is turned over rapidly, yet most degradation occurs not locally but within distant lymph nodes, through mechanisms that are not yet understood. While it is not clear which receptors are involved in binding and uptake of hyaluronan within the lymphatics, one likely candidate is the lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 recently described in our laboratory (Banerji, S., Ni, J., Wang, S., Clasper, S., Su, J., Tammi, R., Jones, M., and Jackson, D.G. (1999)J. Cell Biol. 144, 789–801). Here we present evidence that LYVE-1 is involved in the uptake of hyaluronan by lymphatic endothelial cells using a new murine LYVE-1 orthologue identified from the EST data base. We show that mouse LYVE-1 both binds and internalizes hyaluronan in transfected 293T fibroblasts in vitro and demonstrate using immunoelectron microscopy that it is distributed equally among the luminal and abluminal surfaces of lymphatic vessels in vivo. In addition, we show by means of specific antisera that expression of mouse LYVE-1 remains restricted to the lymphatics in homozygous knockout mice lacking a functional gene for CD44, the closest homologue of LYVE-1 and the only other Link superfamily HA receptor known to date. Together these results suggest a role for LYVE-1 in the transport of HA from tissue to lymph and imply that further novel hyaluronan receptors must exist that can compensate for the loss of CD44 function.

Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar,2Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). By comparison with other macromolecules of the extracellular matrix, HA undergoes rapid turnover with a half-life of ∼24 h (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, most degradation occurs not locally, but within distant lymph nodes. During this process, tissue HA enters the afferent lymphatic vessels and is transported with the lymph fluid to the draining lymph nodes where ∼90% of the glycosaminoglycan is degraded by unknown mechanisms (3Fraser J.R. Kimpton W.G. Laurent T.C. Cahill R.N. Vakakis N. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 41-53PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining 10–15% of the HA exits via the efferent lymphatics to the blood vasculature where it is rapidly endocytosed by the liver sinusoid endothelial HA receptor (5Yannariello-Brown J. McGary C.T. Weigel P.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a 300-kDa heterotrimeric complex of α, β, and γ subunits that clears not only HA but also chondroitin and heparan sulfate from the circulation (6Zhou B. Oka J.A. Singh A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While it is clear that HA can rapidly permeate the lymphatics in skin and other tissues (7Brown T.J. Alcorn D. Fraser J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the mechanisms responsible for its transport across lymphatic endothelium, and the receptors involved in its uptake and transport within lymphatic vessels are all unknown. The majority of HA-binding proteins (8Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 9Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) identified to date belong to the Link protein superfamily, defined by the presence of a conserved HA-binding domain known as the Link module (10Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is a unit of ∼100 amino acids that contains four conserved cysteine residues interspersed with tracts of both hydrophobic and charged residues. The three-dimensional structure of the Link module closely resembles that of the C-type lectin fold, comprising two β sheets flanked by two short α helices and stabilized by two disulfide linkages enclosing a central hydrophobic core (12Kohda D.

Proteins. 2000; 39: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expressed on a variety of cell types, the CD44 molecule engages in multivalent HA binding that is tightly regulated by glycosylation, so-called “inside-out” signaling and receptor clustering/oligomerization (20Lesley J.

Although inactive on normal circulating leukocytes, CD44 can be induced to bind HA in response to inflammatory cytokines (25Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6184-6194PubMed Google Scholar, 26Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. Cell Immunol. 1999; 193: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Binding to HA is thought to direct the extravasation of leukocytes in inflamed tissues, where CD44 engages HA induced on or below the surface of vascular capillary endothelial cells (28Mikecz K. Brennan F.R. Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 29De Grendele H.C. Estess P. Picker L.J. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp.

Howells N. Hofmann M. Kohler G. Schopf E. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Simon J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Yet the unique involvement of CD44 in the aforementioned processes has been called into question by the demonstration that homozygous CD44−/− mice contain no obvious defects in either the vascular or lymphatic systems (33Schmits R. Filmus J. Gerwin N. Senaldi G. Kiefer F. Kundig T. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Catzavelos C. Rak J. Furlonger C. Zakarian A. Simard J.J. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Mak T.W.

These factors have highlighted the likelihood that novel HA receptors must occur within the immune system and elsewhere and have prompted a search for such candidates within the human genome. Recently we identified a novel Link superfamily HA receptor termed LYVE-1 (LYmphatic VesselEndothelial HA receptor-1) from a homology search of the human EST data base and showed its expression was exclusive to lymphatic endothelial cells within normal adult tissues (35Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). These initial studies revealed that the human LYVE-1 molecule binds HA with a high degree of specificity and suggested a role for the receptor in sequestering HA on the luminal surface of lymphatic vessels. To explore such possibilities in an animal model (see also Refs. 36Mandriota S. Jussila L. Jeltsch M. Compagni A. Baetens D. Prevo R. Banerji S. Huarte J. Montesano R. Jackson D.G. Orci L. Alitalo K.

Woodhead Publishing,in press, Abington, Cambridge2001Google Scholar) we have isolated a murine LYVE-1 orthologue and here we describe its detailed characterization together with sequence comparisons that predict important similarities with the related CD44 molecule. Intriguingly, we have found that mouse LYVE-1 mediates internalization of HA and is located on both the luminal and abluminal faces of lymphatic endothelial cells. The implications of these findings for the function of LYVE-1 in vivo are discussed.

Rak J. Furlonger C. Zakarian A. Simard J.J. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Mak T.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 2217-2233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bred on the C57Bl/6 background and wild-type C57Bl/6 controls were obtained from the MRC Center for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, UK. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the organs dissected and formalin-fixed by Dr. Ian Dransfield, (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom). These were prepared for microscopy as described below. The amino acid sequence of human LYVE-1 was used to search for murine homologues within the mouse EST data base using the NCBI BlastSearch tool via the TBlastN program. The search yielded four overlapping ESTs, AI006667,AI391129, AI226003, and AA8820234, which together encoded a contiguous open reading frame of 957 base pairs bearing significant homology to the human sequence. The coding sequence and flanking 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were then amplified from mouse lung cDNA in a two-stage PCR reaction using nested primers as follows. In the first round of amplification (1 min 94 °C, 2 min 57 °C, 4 min 72 °C, 33 cycles), the primers 190F (GTCTCCCTTACTGCGGGTGG) and 1407R (CTCTCTGGTCTGCTGTGAGCC) were used (nucleotides numbered as in Fig.1 A) with 1 μl of mouse lung cDNA (41Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Bell J.I. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12235-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs and 2.5 units of Pyrococcus furiosus(Pfu) DNA polymerase. In the second round of amplification, 4 μl of the first round product was used as template in a similar reaction using the primers 229F Hind (CGCGAAGCTTGGGATCTGCACAATGCTCCAG) and 1231R Not (AGAGAAAAGGGCGGCCGCTTGCCTCGTGTGCACTTTCTCC). The restriction sites in each case are underlined. After digestion withHindIII and NotI, the PCR product was ligated into HindIII/NotI cut pRcCMV. The cloned construct was then sequenced on both strands to confirm its integrity.Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of murine LYVE-1 and comparison with the human orthologue. Panel A shows nucleotide (nucleotides 1–1440) and deduced amino acid sequence from the 1516-base pair mouse LYVE-1 cDNA identified by BlastSearching the mouse EST data base and subsequently cloned from mouse lung cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The predicted N-terminal leader and C-terminal transmembrane anchor areunderlined and two motifs for potentialN-glycosylation are boxed. Panel B shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences for mouse LYVE-1, human LYVE-1, and human CD44 generated with the GCG programs Pileup and PrettyPlot with similar residues highlighted in yellow. The solid blue line indicates the consensus Link module. Key cysteine residues are highlighted and indicated by colored circles. These are as follows; the four highly conserved structural cysteines of the Link module (red); the two conserved flanking cysteines essential for folding and function of CD44 Link (green); a conserved cysteine within the transmembrane anchor implicated for receptor dimerization and HA-binding in CD44 (violet) and a seventh free cysteine unique to LYVE-1 (blue). Conserved residues within the LYVE-1 Link module equivalent to those implicated in CD44 HA-binding are highlighted with orange arrowheads. In addition, a conserved tract of basic residues downstream of the Link module in mouse and human LYVE-1 and a similar tract in CD44 that forms an extension to the HA-binding domain are highlighted with pink arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Northern blot containing a variety of normal mouse tissue RNAs (2 μg of poly(A)+mRNA/lane) was purchased from CLONTECH and hybridized in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) with a probe encompassing the extracellular domain of mouse LYVE-1 (694 base pairs) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random hexamer-primed labeling (Merck). Blots were washed according to the manufacturer's instructions in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min followed by autoradiography. After stripping in 0.5% SDS (100 °C), blots were re-probed with human β-actin cDNA (supplied by the manufacturer). The extracellular domain of mouse LYVE-1 including the cleavable N-terminal leader (residues 1–228, MLQHTS … FKNEAAG in Fig. 1 B) was amplified from mouse stomach cDNA (41Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Bell J.I. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12235-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by nested PCR. Reactions (1 μl of cDNA template) were performed as described above for full-length LYVE-1 using the primers 190F (GTCTCCCTTACTGCGGGTGG) and 994R (CAGCCAGCACAGCGGCAGC; 1 min 94 °C, 1 min 59 °C, 3 min 72 °C, 33 cycles) followed by the primers 229F Hind (CGCGAAGCTTGGGATCTGCACAATGCTCCAG) and 923R Bam (GGTCGGGATCCCCAGCTGCTTCGTTCTTGAATG; 1 min 94 °C, 1 min 57 °C, 3 min 72 °C, 33 cycles) using 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (nucleotides numbered as in Fig. 1 A). After digestion withHindIII and BamHI the PCR product was ligated into HindIII/BamHI cut pCDM7Ig vector yielding a construct encoding the first 228 amino acids of mouse LYVE-1 fused to the Fc region of human IgG1. The cloned construct was sequenced on both strands to confirm integrity. For expression and purification of the Fc fusion protein, the construct was transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate and transfectants grown in UltraCHO medium (Bio-Whittaker) for 3 days prior to harvesting the culture supernatant. After adjustment of the pH by the addition of 0.05 volumes of 2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a column (1-ml bed volume) of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) eluted with 0.1m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0. Fractions containing Fc fusion protein were neutralized by the addition of 0.05 volume of 2m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and the purity confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. High molecular weight HA was biotinylated by a modification of the method of Yu and Toole (42Yu Q. Toole B.P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 122-128PubMed Google Scholar) exactly as described previously (35Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Conjugation of HA with FITC was carried out using the method of De Belder and Wik (43de Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydrate Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Binding of mouse LYVE-1 fusion protein to immobilized HA was tested in 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp) as described previously (35Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Plates were coated by overnight incubation with 1 mg/ml HA in coating buffer (15 mm sodium carbonate and 34 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.3). Wells were blocked for 2 h in PBS, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and subsequently incubated with purified mouse LYVE-1 Fc fusion protein (62.5–1000 ng/ml) in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Human LYVE-1 Fc (35Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) and intracellular adhesion molecule-2 Fc fusion proteins were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. After washing (3 times with PBS, once with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), bound fusion protein was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:4000; Pierce) followed byo-phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma). Subsequently, absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a Bio-Rad microplate reader. Competition experiments with free glycosaminoglycans including HA, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and heparan sulfate were performed by preincubating the mouse LYVE-1 Fc fusion protein (10 μg/ml) with the appropriate glycosaminoglycan (3.13–100 μg/ml) for 30 min in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The mixtures were subsequently added to 96-well HA-coated plates and bound fusion protein was detected as described above. For binding of LYVE-1 to soluble HA, 96-well plates were first coated overnight with either mouse or human LYVE-1 fusion protein or a control syndecan-2 Fc fusion protein (62.5–1000 ng/ml in coating buffer) followed by blocking and washing as described above. The wells were then incubated with biotinylated HA (5 μg/ml) in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (with or without a 20-fold molar excesss of unlabeled HA as a control for specificity) and bound biotinylated-HA detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (1:500; DAKO) witho-phenylenediamine as substrate. Binding was measured as the absorbance at 490 nm. For binding of HA to LYVE-1-transfected cells (see below), these were incubated (20 min, 25 °C) in PBS, pH 7.5, containing FITC-conjugated HA (25 μg/ml), 0.1% azide, and 5% fetal calf serum followed by washing (×3) in PBS alone. Cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, mounted with fluorescent mounting medium, and viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with epifluorescent illumination. Human 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with full-length mouse or in some cases human LYVE-1 (35Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) in pRcCMV (2 μg/well) using calcium phosphate precipitation. For flow cytometric analysis of ligand internalization, triplicate wells were incubated with FITC-HA (1–10 μg/ml) alone or in the presence of a 500-fold molar excess of unconjugated HA (control) for 0–5 h at 37 °C. After appropriate time intervals, cells were washed briefly with ice-cold PBS and detached by suspension in ice-cold PBS, 5 mm EDTA with gentle pipetting. One-half of each detached cell sample was then fixed directly in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (to determine total HA accumulation) and the other digested with papain (0.5 mg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C to remove cell surface LYVE-1·HA complexes followed by fixation (to determine internalized HA). The efficiency of LYVE-1 cleavage under the latter conditions was assessed by staining cells before and after papain treatment with polyclonal anti-mouse LYVE-1 (1/500) followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig. In each case fluorescence was quantitated by flow cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson FacScan. For analysis of HA internalization by immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were prepared as described for flow cytometry except that cell surface LYVE-1 was stained using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig rather than a phycoerythrin conjugate. Slides were then viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescent illumination. For analysis of LYVE-1/HA internalization by confocal microscopy, transfectants were incubated (5 h, 37 °C) with FITC-HA (10 μg/ml) and antibodies to either mouse or human LYVE-1 (diluted 1/500). Cells were then fixed (10 min, room temperature) in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% (w/v) saponin, in PBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% fetal calf serum (30 min, room temperature) prior to the addition of Texas RedTM anti-Ig conjugate. Slides were viewed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with argon and green helium/neon lasers. Rabbits were immunized by subcutaneous injection with purified mouse LYVE-1 fusion protein (100 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by two further injections in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 14-day intervals. Antiserum was tested in ELISAs by assessing reactivity with immobilized mouse LYVE-1 fusion protein or CD44Fc fusion protein as a negative control. Sera were then subjected to affinity chromatography on human IgG-agarose to deplete antibodies directed against the Fc portion of the immunogen. Female Balb/c mice were injected (× 2) intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of a 1:1 emulsion of Freund's incomplete adjuvant in PBS, pH 7.5, at 2-week intervals as described in Ref. 44Mancardi S. Stanta G.

Two weeks after the second injection, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lymphangiomas which developed on the abdominal surfaces of the diaphragm and in the liver resected for fixation and staining as described below. Tissues were removed from female Balb/c mice or C57B16 homozygous CD44−/− knockout mice, fixed in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin wax. Prior to staining, sections were dewaxed and rehydrated by successive incubation in CitroclearTM (2 × 5 min) 100% industrial methylated spirit (2 × 5 min), 50% industrial methylated spirit (5 min), and water (5 min). Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave treatment (95–100 °C, 10 min) in 0.1 m Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 9.0. Sections were then blocked by incubation in PBS, 5% fetal calf serum for 5 min and treated with a peroxidase quenching agent (DAKO) for 5 min prior to incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse LYVE-1 (1:400) for 45 min. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with anti-rabbit Ig peroxidase conjugate (Envision kit, DAKO) for a further 45 min and developed with diaminobenzidine (DAKO) before counterstaining with hematoxylin. All incubations were performed at room temperature. For double-immunofluorescent staining, tissues (Balb/c mice) were snap frozen in liquid N2, cut into thin sections using a cryotome and fixed in acetone (room temperature, 10 min) prior to incubation with polyclonal anti-mouse LYVE-1 and rat anti-mouse CD34 (10 μg/ml). Sections were then treated with a mixture of Texas RedTM-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:50) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (1:200). Slides were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Vectashield), and viewed under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. For fluorescent staining of LYVE-1-transfected 293T cells, these were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 (1/400) in PBS, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1% azide for 30 min prior to washing in PBS and re-incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1/100). For immunoelectron microscopy, sections of formaldehyde-fixed mouse small intestine (see above) were washed (3 times) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and cut into 2-mm cubes. These were then incubated (room temperature, overnight) with LYVE-1 polyclonal serum (1/100 dilution), washed, and stained with either immunogold or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig. Samples were post-fixed in osmium tetroxide in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin. Thin sections were cut and examined in a JEOL 1200EX electron"
https://openalex.org/W1974993651,"Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis, is feedback-inhibited at the transcriptional level by hydrophobic bile acids. Recent studies show that bile acids are physiological ligands for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Activated FXR indirectly repressesCYP7A1 transcription through induction of small heterodimer protein (SHP-1). In this study, we provide evidence that bile acids rapidly down-regulate CYP7A1 transcription via activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP-1 is also a direct target of activated c-Jun. In primary rat hepatocyte cultures, taurocholate (TCA) strongly activated JNK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-α, a potent activator of JNK, also rapidly activated JNK and down-regulated CYP7A1 mRNA levels. Overexpression of dominant-negative JNK1 or a transactivating domain mutant of c-Jun significantly blocked the ability of TCA to down-regulateCYP7A1 mRNA. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type c-Jun (c-Junwt) enhanced the repression ofCYP7A1 by TCA. Moreover, overexpression of c-Junwt resulted in increased SHP-1 promoter activity. Mutation of a putative AP-1 (c-Jun) element suppressed c-Jun-mediated activation of the SHP-1 promoter construct. These results indicate that the bile acid-activated JNK pathway plays a pivotal role in regulatingCYP7A1 levels in primary rat hepatocytes.

Bile acid biosynthesis can proceed via either the “neutral” (classic) or the “acidic” (alternative) pathway (1Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The end products of cholesterol degradation via these pathways are the two primary bile acids, cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid. It is well established that bile acids undergoing enterohepatic circulation feedback repress their own biosynthesis (2Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D176-D193Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In experimental animals and in humans, the expansion of the bile acid pool by bile acid feeding suppresses bile acid biosynthesis, whereas the depletion of the bile acid pool by biliary diversion or bile acid sequestrant feeding increases bile acid biosynthesis. The first and rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral bile acid biosynthetic pathway, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1),1 is the most highly regulated step in this feedback inhibitory loop (3Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar); however, other genes encoding bile acid biosynthetic enzymes are also under dynamic control by the bile acid pool (4Vlahcevic Z.R.

Although the activated FXR/RXR heterodimer repressed CYP7A1promoter activity (14Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no IR-1 element has been identified in the CYP7A1 promoter. Recent studies show that activated FXR induces the expression of small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP-1) protein, an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a DNA-binding domain (19Lu T.T. Makishima M.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that elevated SHP-1 protein levels prevent activation of CYP7A1 transcription by heterodimerizing with LRH-1 (CPF or FTF), a positive transcription factor required for maximalCYP7A1 transcription. Finally, studies with FXR “knock-out” mice showed that these animals were defective in bile acid regulation of a number of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis and transport, including CYP7A1 (7Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). However, several genes regulated by bile acids were not altered in the FXR null mice. In the current study, we provide evidence for a “cell signaling model” of bile acid regulation of CYP7A1. We have previously reported that bile acids activate different isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) in a time (minutes)- and concentration (10–100 μm)-dependent manner (21Stravitz R.T. Rao Y.P. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Jarvis W.D. Hylemon P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G293-G303PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1359-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of PKC by phorbol esters repressed CYP7A1transcriptional activity (22Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1359-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well accepted that activated PKC contributes to the activation of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades, including the extracellular-signal regulated (ERK) pathway and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (23Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown in vitro and in vivo, that both bile acids and phorbol esters can activate the PKC/Raf-1/ERK1,2 pathway and regulate expression of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and the early growth response genes (24Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2240-2248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brady L.M. Beno D.W. Davis B.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which activates the JNK signaling pathway, can repress the mRNA and activity of CYP7A1 (26Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, evidence exists supporting the hypothesis that activation of signaling cascades may also be important in the regulation of CYP7A1 and other genes by bile acids. However, it is unclear which signaling pathways activated by bile acids may be important in the regulation ofCYP7A1 and how the bile acid-activated signaling pathways interact with FXR to regulate overall bile acid biosynthesis. The studies reported herein demonstrate that bile acids rapidly down-regulate CYP7A1 gene transcription via a JNK/c-Jun-dependent mechanism. We also provide evidence that the SHP-1 promoter is a direct target of activated c-Jun, suggesting “cross-talk” occurs between the bile acid-activated JNK signaling cascade and FXR in sensing bile acid levels in primary rat hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocyte monolayer cultures were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) using the collagenase-perfusion technique of Bissell and Guzelian (28Bissell D.M. Guzelian P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture dishes in serum-free William's E medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 μm), thyroxine (1 μm), and insulin (100 nm). Before plating, cells were judged to be greater than 90% viable using trypan blue exclusion. Cells were routinely incubated for 22 h at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, and either prewarmed bile acids or TNFα was added in the indicated concentrations. After treatments, hepatocytes (1.3 × 106 cells/35-mm dish) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by homogenization in cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.05% SDS, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, and 40 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Cell supernatants (500 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 2–3 h. The immune complexes were isolated by the addition of Protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed (10 min) sequentially with lysis buffer, phosphate-buffered saline, and kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). JNK activity was determined by incubating the washed immunoprecipitates in a reaction mixture containing 40 μl of kinase assay buffer, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of recombinant GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–169) for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed, and the radioactivity incorporated in GST-c-Jun determined by laser scanning the autoradiograms. This assay was performed similarly to the JNK activity assay described above. After treatments, cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg each of rabbit anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the immunoprecipitates were washed as described above. ERK activity was determined in a reaction mixture identical to that described for JNK, except for the substrate (0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein). Reactions were terminated by spotting 30 μl of supernatant reaction mixture onto phosphocellulose discs and washing the discs four times (10 min each) in 180 mmphosphoric acid. The radioactivity incorporated in the substrate was determined by scintillation counting. Expression vectors encoding for dominant-negative JNK1 (pCMV-dnJNK1), dominant-negative MKK4 (pCMV-dnMKK4), or wild-type c-Jun (pCMV-c-Junwt) (29Auer K.L. Contessa J. Brenz-Verca S. Pirola L.

Freshly isolated hepatocytes at 50% confluency were cultured for 4 h prior to transfections. Using polystyrene tubes, 1 μg (35-mm dish) or 7 μg (100-mm dish) of either control plasmid (pCMV) or the plasmid encoding for the gene of interest was incubated with poly-l-lysine-coupled virus in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl) solution in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. After 30 min, additional poly-l-lysine (Sigma Chemical Co.,Mr 29,300) (1.3 μg of poly-l-lysine/μg of DNA) in HBS was added, and the complexes were incubated for another 30 min. The DNA-conjugated virus was added to the hepatocytes at a multiplicity of infection of 300. The cells were incubated for 22–24 h to allow for the expression of the gene products and experimental additions were made thereafter. Primary rat hepatocytes were plated on 150-mm culture dishes for 24 h under culture conditions as described above. After 24 h, the cultures were infected with unpurified recombinant adenovirus encoding for dominant-negative c-Jun mutant (TAM67) (33Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of 1–10 plaque-forming units/cell. All experiments were compared with control (null) virus infection. After 3 h of infection, the virus was removed and replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were allowed to incubate for an additional 24 h. Experimental additions were made 24 h after the media change. Total RNA was prepared from cultured hepatocytes using the guanidinium thiocyanate CsCl centrifugation. CYP7A1 mRNA levels were determined by RNase protection assay as described previously (34Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat cyclophilin mRNA was used as an internal control. The rat SHP promoter firefly luciferase construct (bases −441 to +19) was kindly provided by Dr. Steven A. Kliewer (Glaxo Wellcome, NC). FXR expression plasmid (pCMV-rFXR) was a gift from Dr. Gregorio Gil (Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University). Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative AP-1 binding site in the rat SHP promoter luciferase construct was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with the ΔratAP1 (bases −298 to −256, 5′-CCCTGTTTATACACTTGtcagATCCGATAAAGGGCATCCAGGC-3′) primer. The mutated construct was sequenced prior to use to verify DNA sequence fidelity. Primary rat hepatocytes were seeded into 24-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well) in growth medium (William's E supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 μmdexamethasone, and 1 μm thyroxine) and incubated for 6 h. Hepatocytes were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each well received 100 ng of the rSHP-luciferase construct, 2 ng of pRL-TK construct (a plasmid containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter upstream from the Renilla luciferase gene), to normalize for transfection efficiencies, and 30 ng of either pCMV-lacZ (control promoter plasmid), pCMV-rFXR, or pCMV-c-Junwt. After 16 h, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cells were treated with taurocholate (TCA) (50 μm) for 24 h prior to harvesting. Dual luciferase output (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) was quantified with a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold), and the results are expressed as an index of relative light units. Data were analyzed by Student'st-test. Level of significance was set at p< 0.05. Bile acids have been reported to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and interleukin-1 in macrophages (27Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). TNFα has been reported to down-regulate CYP7A1 in the liver (26Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In numerous cell lines, TNFα has been shown to potently activate the JNK cascade (35Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). In this context, we wanted to determine whether bile acids might also activate the JNK cascade in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and down-regulate CYP7A1. To achieve this, primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with taurine-conjugated bile acids (50 μm) for 90 min prior to cell harvest. The two isoforms of JNK (JNK1 and JNK2) were then immunoprecipitated, and the JNK kinase activity was determined using GST-c-Jun as the substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 A shows that the addition of TCA to hepatocytes increased JNK activity by ∼4-fold. TCA caused a time-dependent increase in JNK activity with peak activation occurring at 90 min followed by a rapid decline in activity (Fig. 1 B). A dose-response curve indicated that concentrations of as low as 12.5 μm TCA resulted in detectable JNK activation and that maximal stimulation of JNK activity occurred between concentrations of 100 and 200 μm (Fig.1 C). Taurodeoxycholate and taurochenodeoxycholate, the two other relatively hydrophobic bile acids, also stimulated JNK activity by ∼1.5- to 2-fold, whereas tauroursodeoxycholate, a hydrophilic bile acid, had virtually no effect. It should be noted that the degree of JNK activation by different bile acids paralleled their ability to repress CYP7A1 mRNA levels in primary rat hepatocytes (36Stravitz R.T. Hylemon P.B. Heuman D.M. Hagey L.R. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.T. Hofmann A.F. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13987-13993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of hepatocytes with TNFα (2 ng/ml) also caused a rapid increase (∼2-fold) in JNK activity (Fig.2 A). Moreover, TNFα also rapidly (2 h) down-regulated (70–80%) CYP7A1 mRNA levels in primary rat hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B).CYP7A1 mRNA levels rebounded with longer incubations, suggesting that TNFα did not induce apoptosis under our culture conditions. Previous reports in the literature have shown that bile acids can sequentially activate the ERK1/2 cascade (Raf-1/MEK1,2/ERK1,2) (24Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D.J. J.

In addition, data from our laboratory showed that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic bile acids could rapidly activate the ERK cascade in primary rat hepatocytes (37Stravitz R.T Vlahcevic Z.R Hylemon P.B Paumgartner G. Stiehl A. Gerok W. Keppler D. Leuschner U. in Falk Symposium 108: Bile Acids and Cholestasis. 3. Academic Publishers, Boston1999: 39-50Google Scholar). Studies were therefore carried out to determine if the ERK cascade was involved in the bile acid-dependent down-regulation ofCYP7A1. Primary rat hepatocytes were pretreated (30 min) with PD98059 (50 μm), a specific inhibitor of MEK1 activation, which prevents activation of downstream ERK1 and ERK2. Next, DCA (50 μm) was added to the cells for 20 min, and ERK1/ERK2 activity was determined. As shown in Fig.3 A, pretreatment with PD98059 prevented activation of the ERK pathway by DCA. Furthermore, PD98059 failed to block the down-regulation of CYP7A1 mRNA by DCA (50 μm, 6 h) (Fig. 3 B). PD98059 alone had no effect on CYP7A1 mRNA levels. This result indicates that activation of the ERK pathway does not result in the feedback repression of CYP7A1 by bile acids in primary rat hepatocytes. The data presented above suggest that the JNK pathway may be important in the down-regulation ofCYP7A1 by bile acids and TNFα. To test this hypothesis, we employed dominant-negative mutants of MKK4 (kinase upstream of JNK1,2) and JNK1 to block the ability of TCA to activate the endogenous JNKs. A plasmid expressing either dominant-negative MKK4 (pCMV-dnMKK4), dominant-negative JNK1 (pCMV-dnJNK1), or the control plasmid (pCMV) was transfected into hepatocytes using a poly-l-lysine-conjugated adenovirus system. After 24-h incubation, hepatocytes were treated with 50 μm TCA for 90 min, and the cells were harvested. As expected, in control plasmid-infected cells, TCA treatment stimulated JNK1 activity (Fig.4 A). However, stimulation of JNK1 activity by TCA was almost completely blocked in cells overexpressing the dominant-negative mutants of MKK4 or JNK1. We next tested the ability of TCA to down-regulate CYP7A1 mRNA in hepatocytes expressing the dominant-negative JNK1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the dominant-negative JNK1 significantly blocked the ability of TCA to down-regulate CYP7A1 mRNA, suggesting a role for the JNK pathway in the rapid bile acid-mediated repression of CYP7A1. Stimulation of the JNK pathway by extracellular stimuli results in the activation of the immediate-early transcription factor c-Jun. To assess the role of c-Jun in bile acid-mediated repression of CYP7A1transcription, we transfected hepatocytes with a wild-type c-Jun expression construct (pCMV-c-Junwt) using a poly-l-lysine-conjugated adenovirus system. In parallel experiments, hepatocytes were also infected with a recombinant adenovirus to express dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67). TAM67 is deleted in the N-terminal domain (amino acids 3–122) of c-Jun and is incapable of being transactivated by JNK. Hepatocytes were treated 24 h after infection with either media control or 50 μm TCA, and the effect of TCA on CYP7A1 mRNA levels was determined 18 h later. TCA treatment of control-infected hepatocytes repressed CYP7A1 mRNA levels by ∼60%. This TCA-mediated down-regulation of CYP7A1 mRNA levels was further enhanced in cells overexpressing wild-type c-Jun (Fig.5 A). In contrast, overexpression of TAM67 resulted in an increase of ∼2- to 3-fold in the basal levels of CYP7A1 mRNA as compared with cells infected with a control (null) virus (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, expressing a dominant-negative c-Jun also significantly blocked the ability of TCA to down-regulate CYP7A1 mRNA (Fig.5 C). These experiments strongly support a role for c-Jun as the rapid mediator of CYP7A1 regulation by bile acids. Previous work has demonstrated that bile acids down-regulate CYP7A1 gene expression by activating the nuclear hormone receptor FXR (14Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the mechanism by which activated FXR repressed CYP7A1transcription is through induction of the gene encoding SHP-1 protein (19Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 20Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D.

The data presented above suggests that bile acids regulateCYP7A1 transcription by activating the transcription factor c-Jun. This observation raised the question whether in addition to FXR, SHP-1 expression was also up-regulated by activated c-Jun. To test this hypothesis, the proximal 500–600 bp of the mouse, rat, and human SHP-1 promoters were examined for potential c-Jun (AP-1) binding sites. A highly conserved AP-1 binding site was identified ∼250–300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in the SHP-1 promoter of all three species (Fig. 6 A). To test if the SHP-1 promoter was regulated by c-Jun, primary rat hepatocytes were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for wild-type c-Jun (pCMV-c-Junwt) and a luciferase reporter construct under the control of the rat SHP-1 promoter. In a parallel experiment, an FXR expression plasmid (pCMV-rFXR) was co-transfected with the SHP-1 luciferase promoter construct as a positive control for these studies. Following transfection, cells were incubated with TCA (50 μm) for 24 h and harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 6 B, overexpression of FXR induced SHP-1 promoter activity ∼ 2-fold in the presence of TCA. Similarly, TCA treatment of cells transfected with the c-Jun expression plasmid also resulted in an increase of ∼2-fold in SHP-1 reporter activity. Mutating the AP-1 site eliminated the c-Jun responsiveness of the SHP promoter. These data provide strong evidence that bile acids stimulate SHP-1 transcription in an AP-1-dependent manner in primary rat hepatocytes. The conversion of cholesterol to bile acids via the neutral pathway is regulated at the level of CYP7A1 gene expression. Several groups have demonstrated the feedback inhibition ofCYP7A1 transcription in response to increasing concentrations of bile acids (9Horton J.D. Cuthbert J.A. Spady D.K. J. Biol.

Moreover, it was shown that hydrophobic bile acids are more potent repressors of CYP7A1mRNA than hydrophilic bile acids (11Pandak W.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Heuman D.M. Redford K.S. Chiang J.Y. Hylemon P.B.

In total, these data suggest that bile acids can regulate their own biosynthesis and that they may do so by either binding to a specific nuclear hormone receptor and/or by activating one or more signaling cascades in the liver. A major breakthrough in understanding the regulation of gene expression by bile acids came with the discovery that FXR is activated by bile acids (13Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 14Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D.

Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). It was shown that both conjugated and unconjugated bile acids could bind to and activate FXR at physiological concentrations (10–100 μm). Studies with FXR “knock-out” mice revealed that a number of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis are regulated by FXR, namely, CYP7A1, CYP8B1, intestinal bile acid binding protein (I-BABP), canalicular bile salt excretory pump (BSEP), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), and hepatic basolateral transporterNTCP (7Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). FXR can regulate gene expression by either a direct or an indirect mechanism. FXR induces gene expression by binding to an FXR-response element (IR1-motif) in the promoters of target genes (16Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In contrast, the bile acid-responsive elements (BAREs) in the promoters of the CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes lack a functional FXR binding site (17Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Weinberger C. Stroup D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10918-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 18del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that FXR induces the expression of the SHP-1 protein (19Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K.

SHP-1 repressesCYP7A1 transcription by inhibiting the activity of LRH-1, a positive transcription factor that binds to the BARE region in theCYP7A1 promoter. Consistent with this model are the findings that FXR null mice fail to feedback repress CYP7A1 and are defective in the bile acid induction of SHP-1. In the current study, we provide evidence that feedback repression ofCYP7A1 by bile acids is also mediated by activation of the JNK signaling cascade. We show that the JNK cascade is rapidly activated by bile acids, specifically TCA, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the rank order of potency for bile acid induction of the JNK pathway mirrors their ability to repress CYP7A1 mRNA levels in primary hepatocytes (36Stravitz R.T. Hylemon P.B. Heuman D.M. Hagey L.R. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.T. Hofmann A.F. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13987-13993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, hydrophobic bile acids have been recently shown to induce the expression of cytokines TNFα and interleukin-1 in macrophages (27Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Induction of these cytokines has been correlated with the down-regulation of CYP7A1 mRNA and activity in intact animals (26Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the current investigation, we demonstrate that activation of the JNK signaling pathway by TNFα rapidly down-regulates CYP7A1 mRNA levels in primary rat hepatocytes. The role of the JNK pathway in mediating the inhibitory effects of bile acids on CYP7A1 expression is supported by the observation that overexpression of dominant-negative JNK1 blocked the ability of TCA to activate JNK and to down-regulateCYP7A1 mRNA (Fig. 4). In human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 and in human adenocarcinoma cells, treatment with bile acids enhanced the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a transcription factor substrate of JNK and a component of the classic AP-1 heterodimer (38Qiao D. Chen W. Stratagoules E.D. Martinez J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15090-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Zhang F. Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In these cells, bile acids stimulated gene transcription by enhancing the AP-1 transcriptional activity and DNA binding to promoter constructs. In contrast, in the present study, overexpression of wild-type c-Jun enhanced the repression ofCYP7A1 by TCA (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, overexpression of TAM67, a non-transactivable mutant of c-Jun, significantly blocked the ability of TCA to repress CYP7A1 mRNA. Interestingly, the basal levels of CYP7A1 mRNA were 2- to 3-fold higher in TAM67-overexpressing cells compared with null virus-infected cells (Fig. 5 B). Together, these observations indicate that activated c-Jun acts as a repressor of CYP7A1mRNA in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. Previous reports in the literature and the data presented in this study suggest that bile acids entering the hepatocyte activate both FXR and the cell signaling cascades. It is of interest to note that both FXR and the JNK pathway are activated by similar concentrations of bile acids (10–100 μm). Therefore, how does bile acid-activated FXR and -activated c-Jun both interact to coordinately regulate CYP7A1 gene expression in the hepatocyte? Our data indicate that activated c-Jun induces SHP-1 promoter activity (Fig.6 B). In this regard, a consensus AP-1 binding site was identified in close proximity to the FXR binding site in the mouse, rat, and human SHP-1 promoters. Mutations in the AP-1 binding site abolished bile acid responsiveness of the rat SHP-1 promoter. Thus, we believe that activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway by bile acids results in the induction of SHP-1 expression. SHP-1, in turn, interacts with LRH-1 and indirectly represses CYP7A1 transcription (Fig.7). However, we do not exclude additional mechanisms of c-Jun-mediated bile acid repression of CYP7A1. It is possible that activated c-Jun might also directly interact with LRH-1 or another positive transcription factor required forCYP7A1 gene expression. Finally, it is possible that LRH-1 might be a substrate of activated JNK. In this regard, it has been recently reported that both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and JNK phosphorylate RXR, altering its functional properties (40Lee H.Y. Suh Y.A. Robinson M.J. Clifford J.L. Hong W.K. Woodgett J.R. Cobb M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our combined results suggest that bile acids activate the JNK/c-Jun cascade in primary rat hepatocytes. Activation of this protein kinase cascade is involved in the down-regulation ofCYP7A1 by bile acids. We hypothesize that activation of this pathway provides the hepatocytes with another “sensing mechanism” for detecting bile acid levels as well as stress signals. Together, FXR and the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway allow the hepatocytes great flexibility in responding to both intra- and extracellular signals for maintaining bile acid homeostasis in the liver. We thank Emily Gurley, Pat Bohdan, and Elaine Studer for their invaluable technical help. We also thank Drs. D. J. Mangelsdorf and Gregorio Gil for critical review of the manuscript."

However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the substrate selectivity of MKP-1 is unknown. In addition, it has been suggested that the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcription factor is a physiological non-MAP kinase substrate for MKP-1. We have used the yeast two-hybrid assay to demonstrate that MKP-1 is able to interact selectively with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38α, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) MAP kinase isoforms. Furthermore, this binding is accompanied by catalytic activation of recombinant MKP-1 protein in vitro, and these end points show an absolute correlation with MKP-1 substrate selectivity in vivo. In contrast, MKP-1 does not interact with STAT1. Recombinant STAT1 does not cause catalytic activation of MKP-1; nor does MKP-1 block tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in vivo.Both binding and catalytic activation of MKP-1 are abrogated by mutation of a conserved docking site in ERK2, p38α, and JNK1 MAP kinases. Within MKP-1, MAP kinase binding is mediated by the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of the protein. However, mutation of a conserved cluster of positively charged residues within this domain abolishes the binding and activation of MKP-1 by ERK2 and p38α but not JNK1, indicating that there are distinct binding determinants for these MAP kinase isoforms.

In addition, a number of less well characterized members of the MAP kinase family have been identified such as BMK1/ERK5, ERK7, and ERK3 (4Zhou G. Bao Z.-Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

MAP kinase pathways relay, amplify, and integrate complex signals in order to elicit appropriate biological responses. In mammalian cells, these include cellular proliferation, differentiation, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. These responses are associated with significant alterations in the pattern of cellular gene expression, and transcription factors are a major target of MAP kinase signalingin vivo (7Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To phosphorylate these proteins, activated MAP kinases translocate to the cell nucleus, a process that is generally associated with prolonged activation of the MAP kinase (8Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 108: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Therefore, the magnitude and duration of MAP kinase activation are critical determinants of biological outcome, and regulatory mechanisms governing the activation of MAP kinase are of key importance in both physiological and pathological cell functions. The duration and magnitude of MAP kinase activation can be regulated at many points within the signal transduction pathway. However, it is now clear that the MAP kinase itself is a major target for regulation through the action of specific protein phosphatases. MAP kinase activation is dependent on the phosphorylation of both the threonine and tyrosine residues of the TXY motif found within the “activation loop” of the kinase. Since phosphorylation of both residues is required for activity, dephosphorylation of either residue is sufficient for inactivation. This can be achieved by protein-tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases, or dual specificity (threonine/tyrosine) protein phosphatases. It is now clear that dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) play an important role in regulating the activity of MAP kinases (9Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Thus far, nine distinct MKPs have been identified and characterized. These are MKP-1 (CL100) (10Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A.

The first group, typified by MKP-1 and PAC1, are nuclear enzymes that are encoded by growth factor and stress-inducible genes (10Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 14Rohan P.J. Davis P. Mostaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The second group, typified by MKP-3, are predominantly cytosolic enzymes and are not encoded by immediate early genes (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 25Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that certain dual specificity MKPs display marked substrate selectivity for different MAP kinase isoforms in vitro and in vivo. MKP-3 is ∼100-fold more active toward ERK2 than p38α (SAPK2a) in vitro (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this substrate selectivity is also observed in vivo (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 29Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The specific dephosphorylation of ERK2 by MKP-3 is accompanied by the formation of a tight physical complex between the two proteins (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This binding is mediated by the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of MKP-3, and removal of this domain abrogates substrate selectivityin vivo (30Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this binding event also results in the catalytic activation of MKP-3 in vitro as revealed by a 30-fold increase in the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze the chromagenic substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (31Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Catalytic activation mirrors substrate selectivity in vivo, since stress activated MAP kinase isoforms were unable either to bind to or increase the catalytic activity of MKP-3. The closely related enzymes MKP-X (Pyst2) and MKP-4 also undergo catalytic activation upon binding to ERK2 (25Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), indicating that this may be a general mechanism by which all members of this family of MKPs are regulated. However, MKP-5, a recently characterized MKP, both binds to and inactivates p38 (SAPK2), but recombinant p38 protein does not catalytically activate MKP-5 in vitro (28Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The inducible nuclear phosphatase MKP-1 (CL100) was originally characterized as an ERK2 phosphatase in vitro and in vivo (11Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 13Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently demonstrated to have activity against JNK (SAPK1) and p38 (SAPK2) both in vitroand in vivo (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M.

Despite this, nothing is known about the molecular basis for the substrate selectivity of MKP-1. Wild-type MKP-1 does not appear to be able to form a physical complex with ERK2 in vivo (12Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and it is not known if MKP-1 is subject to catalytic activation by mitogen- and stress-activated MAP kinasesin vitro. In addition, the results of experiments using antisense mRNA to suppress the expression of MKP-1 indicate that a regulatory tyrosine residue within the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein is dephosphorylated by MKP-1 in vivo, thus raising the possibility that there may be physiological non-MAP kinase substrates for this enzyme (35Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the substrate selectivity of MKP-1 is governed by its ability to form physical complexes with ERK2, JNK1, and p38α MAP kinase isoforms in vitro and in vivo and that complex formation is accompanied by catalytic activation of MKP-1. In contrast, STAT1 is unable to bind to MKP-1 or to catalytically activate the enzyme; nor does overexpression of MKP-1 cause tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT1 in vivo. Mutation of a conserved docking site within MAP kinases that is used by activators, regulators, and substrates of these enzymes abrogates both binding and catalytic activation of MKP-1. Within MKP-1, MAP kinase binding is mediated by the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of the phosphatase. However, mutation of a conserved cluster of positively charged residues within this domain abrogates binding and catalytic activation only by ERK2 and p38α and not JNK, indicating that MAP kinase interactions may be mediated by distinct binding sites. We conclude that the substrate selectivity of MKP-1 is governed by specific protein-protein interactions coupled with catalytic activation of the phosphatase, and our results strongly suggest that these interactions are restricted to the MAP kinase family of proteins. The plasmids pSG5.MKP-1, pSG5.MKP-1CS, pSG5.p38α, pSG5.JNK1, and pSG5.ERK2 containing a single copy of either the Myc (9E10) epitope tag or the HA (12CA5) epitope tag have been previously described (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The IFN-γ-responsive reporter, p(IRF-1.GAS)6tkΔ[−39]lucter, and the ptkΔ[−39]lucter reporter were kindly provided by Dr. S. Goodbourn. The plasmids (MLVGALELK, which encodes the C-terminal activation domain of Elk-1 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain; G5E4Luc, a GAL4-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid; pAG-(1–147), which encodes the DNA binding domain of GAL4 alone; and pJATLac, which encodes β-galactosidase) were kindly provided by Dr N. Jones. All other plasmid constructs are described in the Supplemental Material. GAL4 DNA binding domain and activation domain fusion plasmids were transformed into the yeast strains PJ69–2A and Y187, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Semiquantitative analysis of two-hybrid interactions was performed using a β-galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). To ensure that all protein-kinase interactions were detected, binding capability was assessed using each kinase isoform expressed as GAL4 DNA-binding domain and activation domain fusions where possible. Wild-type MKP-1 and MKP-1M were expressed in Escherichia coli(BL21DE3[pLysS]), purified, and refolded as described previously for wild-type MKP-1 (10Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). His-tagged STAT1Δ and ERK2D319N were expressed in E. coli and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1× 2 liters DB2 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol). For detection of Myc epitope-tagged proteins in COS-1 cells, lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), transferred to a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), and immunoblotted with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 as previously described (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). For detection of endogenous phosphorylated STAT1α, immunoblotting was performed with an anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) polyclonal antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Phosphatase activities and catalytic activation of MKP-1 was measured using pNPP hydrolysis at 25 °C as previously described (25Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rates of pNPP hydrolysis were determined using Microplate Manager III, version 1.57 (Bio-Rad). The activities of Myc (9E10) epitope-tagged or HA (12CA5) epitope-tagged ERK2, JNK1, p38α, p38γ, and p38δ immunoprecipitated from COS-1 cells using either 9E10 or 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies, respectively, were assayed as described previously (25Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using a standard calcium phosphate method as previously described (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Reporter gene assays for the detection of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were performed using the Dual-Light system according to the manufacturer's instruction (Tropix Inc.). A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to determine the specificity and selectivity of interactions between MKP-1 and a comprehensive panel of nine distinct mitogen- and stress-activated MAP kinase isoforms in vivo. Binding was determined by the activation of GAL4-dependent ADE2/HIS3/lacZreporters. Activation of HIS3 and ADE2 was assessed by selection on synthetic dropout medium deficient for histidine and adenine. The strength of the interactions was quantified in a β-galactosidase assay. Full-length wild-type MKP-1 was shown to specifically interact with ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, and a kinase-negative form of p38α (Fig.1 A). A very weak interaction was detected with ERK5, while no interaction was seen with ERK3, ERK7, p38γ, or p38δ. MKP-1 interacted with ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, and p38α with a rank order of binding strength as follows: JNK1 ≫ ERK2 = p38α > ERK1 (Fig. 1 B). We consistently find that ERK1 has a lower binding affinity for MKP-1 when compared with ERK2, and this is also the case when the ERK-specific phosphatase MKP-3 is used as bait in these assays (data not shown). The specificity of these protein-protein interactions was unaltered using a catalytically inactive mutant (Cys258 to Ser) form of MKP-1 (MKP-1CS); however, the strength of binding was somewhat increased (∼2-fold) (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis using GAL4-specific antibodies (CLONTECH) verified expression of each of the MAP kinase fusion proteins used in the screen (data not shown). It has been demonstrated previously for a subfamily of dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatases, which includes MKP-3 (Pyst1), Pyst2 (MKP-X), and MKP-4, that binding to ERK2 results in a dramatic increase in the catalytic activity of these enzymes in vitro (25Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity of bacterially expressed MKP-1 (2.5 μg) toward pNPP was investigated to determine whether the selective binding of MKP-1in vivo to ERK2, JNK1, and p38α was mirrored by catalytic activation in vitro. The phosphatase activity of MKP-1 was specifically increased in the presence of 10 μg of recombinant ERK2, JNK1, and p38α (Fig. 2). ERK5, which interacted only weakly with MKP-1 in our two-hybrid screen, caused a small but reproducible increase in activity (∼1.6-fold). In contrast, no significant catalytic activation was observed upon the addition of recombinant ERK3, p38γ, or p38δ. The strength of the interactions between MKP-1 and these kinase isoforms in vivo directly parallels the level of catalytic activation observed in this in vitro assay. The phosphatase activity of MKP-1 was only moderately stimulated by p38α and ERK2 (∼2-fold), whereas JNK1, which was shown to interact most strongly with MKP-1 in vivo, enhanced activity by up to 5-fold. Incubation of MKP-1 (2.5 μg) with increasing amounts of these MAP kinases (up to 20 μg) showed that the activation of MKP-1 was dose-dependent (Fig.3, A–C) and at least in the case of p38α was saturable (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, Myc (9E10) epitope-tagged MKP-1 expressed in mammalian cells and immunoprecipitated using an anti-9E10 monoclonal antibody also exhibited phosphatase activity toward pNPP. Furthermore, an identical pattern of catalytic activation in the rank order JNK1 ≫ ERK2 = p38α was observed (Fig. 4). To ensure that this activity was not mediated by the presence of associated proteins co-immunoprecipitated with MKP-1, the catalytically inactive MKP-1CS form was also expressed in COS-1 cells. In contrast to the wild-type protein, immunoprecipitated MKP-1CS exhibited no measurable phosphatase activity (Fig. 4).Figure 3Catalytic activation of MKP-1 by ERK2, JNK1, and p38α is dose-dependent.Time-dependent hydrolysis of pNPP by 2.5 μg of recombinant MKP-1 at 25 °C was monitored by change in optical density at 405 nm either alone or in the presence of the indicated amount of either ERK2 (A), JNK1 (B), or p38α (C). Assays were performed in triplicate, and the results of representative experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4MKP-1 immunoprecipitated from COS-1 cells is active and undergoes catalytic activation. COS-1 cells were transfected with 5 μg of a plasmid expression vector encoding either Myc-tagged wild-type MKP-1 or a catalytically inactive mutant (MKP-1CS). Following transfection, cells were lysed, and MKP-1 protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitated MKP-1 was then assayed for pNPP hydrolysis either in the absence or presence of ERK2, JNK1, or p38α as indicated. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the results of representative experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since MKP-1 exhibited a restricted ability to both bind to and be catalytically activated by different mitogen- and stress-activated MAP kinase isoforms, we set out to determine if these properties reflect the substrate selectivity of MKP-1 in vivo. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding Myc (9E10) epitope-tagged MKP-1 and HA (12CA5) epitope-tagged ERK2, JNK1, p38α, p38γ, or p38δ. Transfected cells were then exposed to an appropriate stimulus to induce kinase activation, either serum (ERK2) or anisomycin (JNK1, p38α, p38γ, and p38δ). MAP kinases were then immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody and assayed directly for kinase activity using an appropriate substrate, either myelin basic protein (ERK2 and p38 isoforms) or ATF2 (JNK1). The data clearly show that expression of MKP-1 specifically inhibits the kinase activity of ERK2, JNK1, and p38α but has no effect upon the activities of p38γ or p38δ (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the resistance of both p38γ and p38δ to inactivation by MKP-1 was maintained in titration experiments where even higher amounts (up to 20 μg) of MKP-1 were transfected and expressed (data not shown). Taken together, these in vivo and in vitrofindings demonstrate that highly specific interactions between MKP-1 and the MAP kinases ERK2, JNK1, and p38α are associated with significant stimulation of MKP-1 phosphatase activity. Furthermore, only those MAP kinase isoforms that are able to bind and cause catalytic activation of MKP-1 are in vivo substrates for this dual specificity phosphatase. We have demonstrated previously that MKP-1 is unable to catalyze the dephosphorylation of a variety of non-MAP kinase proteins in vitro (11Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent report that STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was specifically prolonged in the presence of an MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide suggested that this transcription factor was also regulated by MKP-1 (35Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization and subsequent transcriptional activity of STAT1 is regulated primarily by tyrosine phosphorylation; thus, dephosphorylation by a nuclear phosphatase would result in its inactivation. However, using two-hybrid analysis, we have shown that MKP-1 is incapable of interacting with STAT1α in vivo(Fig. 6 A). This finding was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation studies in vitro (data not shown). Furthermore, recombinant STAT1α (up to 20 μg) was incapable of increasing the phosphatase activity of MKP-1 toward pNPP (Fig. 6 B), and overexpression of Myc epitope-tagged MKP-1 in COS-1 cells"

This is particularly obvious in the obese state in which long term disequilibria in energy balance produces massive fat cell hypertrophy. Enlarged fat cells isolated from obese animals or humans exhibit modified metabolic properties and do not respond to hormones as do adipocytes from lean controls. For example, they develop insulin resistance (1Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 2Chlouverakis C. Hojnicki D.

These characteristics could be secondary to the hormonal and metabolic changes linked to obesity but could also be due to cell hypertrophyper se and thus be part of an adaptative mechanism in relationship with the status of energy stores in adipose tissue. Results from previous studies summarized below lead us to propose a role for cholesterol as a signaling molecule for fat cell hypertrophy. Cholesterol accumulates in large quantities in a non-esterified form within the adipocyte lipid droplet (for review see Ref. 6Krause B.R. Hartman A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 97-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proportionally to the triglyceride content (7Kovanen P.T. Nikkila E.A. Miettinen T.A. J. Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schreibman P.H. Dell R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 986-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence also suggest that concomitantly with the enlargement of the triglyceride stores, adipocyte cholesterol is redistributed from the plasma membrane to the lipid droplet. First, a decrease in plasma membrane cholesterol, associated with increased fluidity, has been reported in hypertrophied adipocytes (9Guerre-Millo M. Guesnet P. Guichard C. Durand G. Lavau M. Lipids. 1994; 29: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Second, plasma membrane cholesterol content decreases during the differentiation of 3T3F442A preadipocytes to lipid-loaded adipocytes, further suggesting that massive accumulation of intracellular triglycerides alters the distribution of intracellular cholesterol (10Storch J. Shulman S.L. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10527-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we have shown that the transcription factor SREBP-2 that is sensitive to membrane cholesterol depletion is selectively induced in enlarged adipocytes from obese Zucker rats (11Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is mainly involved in the control of cholesterol metabolism (for review see Ref. 12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

In the case of membrane cholesterol depletion, the SREBP-2 pathway activates genes controlling cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase genes) and uptake (LDL receptor gene) and autoregulates its own synthesis (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus an increased content of active SREBP-2 protein in nuclear extracts from obese rat fat cells is the signature of a relative cholesterol-depleted state of the adipocyte plasma membrane, concomitant with ongoing cholesterol accumulation in the lipid droplet of enlarged fat cells. It is now becoming obvious that cholesterol can no longer be considered only as a structural component of plasma membranes; it also actively participates in the regulation of cell physiology. The importance of cholesterol as a key component of the regulation of signal transduction through membrane lipid-ordered micro-domains (14Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar) and of the regulation of gene expression through cholesterol-activated transcription factors (12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) is now well established. The aim of this work was then to examine whether cholesterol could be a link between adipocyte cell size and the changes in its metabolic activity as seen in obese states. As a first approach we manipulated adipocyte cholesterol status and investigated its consequences on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and gene profiling. Our results indicate that alteration of membrane cholesterol in adipocytes modifies the phenotype of the cells into one partly resembling that of an “obese” fat cell, including changes in hormone sensitivity and secretion of adipocyte-derived products. Fat cells were isolated from subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissue of 1-month-old rats by collagenase treatment as described (16Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For short term cholesterol depletion, isolated cells were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer solution without bovine serum albumin, and cyclodextrins (0–5 mm) loaded or not with cholesterol (40 mg/g) were added. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was aspirated, and cells were used for further studies. In some experiments, small (35-μm diameter) and large (50-μm diameter) adipocytes were obtained after collagenase treatment of epididymal adipose tissue of 2-month-old lean rats followed by several filtrations through 30-μm Nytex. 3T3-L1 cells (a kind gift of Dr. J. Pairault, Paris, France) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Eurobio) and antibiotics. At confluence, differentiation was induced by adding methyl-isobutylxanthine (100 μm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and insulin (1 μg/μl) for 2 days. Then cells were allowed to differentiate either in standard conditions (10% serum and insulin) or in cholesterol-depleted medium. Cholesterol-depleted medium contained insulin, 10 μm mevastatin (Sigma), and 10% lipoprotein-deficient fetal bovine serum prepared as described (17Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) from the batch used for standard conditions. In some experiments, cholesterol (1 μg/ml) in ethanol solution was added to cells cultured in depleted conditions. The final ethanol concentration in the culture medium did not exceed 0.1% v/v. Differentiated cells were harvested at day 7 following confluence. The fat cell suspension was diluted four times in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (0.1 mmKHCO3, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5), vigorously shaken, and then centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant below the fat cake was collected and centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was suspended in 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 After treatment with cyclodextrins, 0.5-ml triplicate aliquots of isolated adipose cells were incubated in plastic vials at 37 °C with 2 ml of Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing 5 mm glucose and 0.25 μCi of [U-14C]d-glucose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of various insulin concentrations. The flasks were gassed with 95% CO2, 5% O2 and capped with a stopper equipped with a central well. After 2 h at 37 °C, the incubation was ended by addition of 0.3 ml of hyamine to the well and 0.5 ml of 6 n sulfuric acid to the medium. CO2 production was estimated by counting radioactivity in the central well by liquid scintillation. Membrane preparations were used in Western blots and probed with GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 antibodies as previously described (18Hainault I. Guerre-Millo M. Guichard C. Lavau M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted as described by Folch (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) from total cell lysates or membrane preparations. Dried lipids were resuspended in isopropanol, and determination of free cholesterol and triglycerides was performed using F-CHOL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Peridochrom TG GPO-PAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. Protein concentration in membrane preparations was assessed as described by Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted as described (21Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, inguinal adipose tissue from Zucker rats, epididymal adipose tissue from fat mice, or isolated fat cells from retroperitoneal adipose tissue of ob/ob mice. Northern blots were performed as previously described (22Guichard C. Dugail I. Le Liepvre X. Lavau M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For RT-PCR purposes, cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of RQI DNase I-treated (Promega) total RNA using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Design of specific primers was done using either the Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or Oligo (MedProbe) softwares. The complete list of gene-specific primers is provided as supplemental data. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed starting with 50 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA, with 200 nm sense and antisense primers (Genset) in a final volume of 25 μl using the Sybr Green PCR core reagents in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative quantitation for a given gene, expressed as fold variation over control (untreated cells), was calculated after normalization to 18 S ribosomal RNA and determination of the difference between CT (cycle threshold) in treated and control cells using the 2-CT formula (23PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems. (1999) Bulletin 2.Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression of control RNA was used as an interplate calibrator. Individual CT values are means of triplicate measurements. Experiments were repeated three to five times. Statistical significance was assessed by paired t test analysis or analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls comparison tests (Statistica, StatSoft Inc.).p < 0.05 was considered to be the threshold of statistical significance. We have reported previously (11Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that the mature cleaved form of SREBP-2 is present in higher amounts in the nucleus of enlarged adipocytes from obese Zucker leptin receptor-deficient rats, suggesting an alteration in cholesterol metabolism in those cells. To examine whether such a feature is unique to adipocytes from Zucker rats or is a general characteristic of the obese state, we measured the expression of SREBP-2 and its target genes (LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase genes) in two other models of obesity: the carboxypeptidase E-deficient fatcpe−/− mouse and the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse. Fig. 1 shows that the induction of SREBP-2 itself and of its target genes is clearly present in Zucker fa/fa rats, fatcpe−/− mice, and ob/ob mice. It is noteworthy that this alteration is not limited to particular adipose tissue localization, because subcutaneous inguinal or abdominal perigonadal sites were examined. Moreover, isolated adipocytes were used in ob/ob mice, indicating that the adipocyte component, rather than some other cell types in adipose tissue, was responsible for the induction of SREBP-2 and its target genes. Thus activation of the SREBP pathway appears as a common characteristic of obese fat cells. This raises the possibility that cholesterol distribution might be altered in enlarged fat cells, independently of the metabolic and hormonal milieu. To test this possibility, we measured membrane cholesterol content in two fat cell populations of different size isolated from the same lean rat fat pad. Epididymal fat pads of 10–12-week-old rats were chosen because of their intrinsic large heterogeneity in individual adipose cell size. Using filtration techniques, we obtained two cell populations with a 10-μm difference in their diameter (Fig. 2 A), which represents a 1.7-fold difference in cell surface area (5000 ± 195 versus 8500 ± 362 μm2 in small and large fat cells, respectively). In these two populations, the larger fat cells exhibit a 42% reduction in membrane cholesterol:protein ratio (Fig. 2 B), a value similar to the 48% decrease reported for plasma membranes from subcutaneous adipocytes isolated from obese rats compared with those from lean rats (9Guerre-Millo M. Guesnet P. Guichard C. Durand G. Lavau M. Lipids. 1994; 29: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the absolute amount of membrane cholesterol per cell would be similar because of the 1.7-fold increase in cell surface. Nevertheless, this would correspond in large cells to a dilution in membrane cholesterol, sensed as true cholesterol depletion. Indeed, as for the obese versus lean rat adipocyte system, we observed a 2-fold increase in SREBP-2 mRNA levels in largeversus small adipocytes (expression measured in triplicate in an RNA pool from small and large adipocytes, respectively: 0.77 ± 0.08 versus 1.86 ± 0.2 arbitrary units after normalization by 18 S ribosomal RNA). Taken together, these data indicate that a cholesterol-depleted state of membranes accompanied by activation of the SREBP-2 transcription factor is a common feature of hypertrophied adipocytes.Figure 2Cholesterol content of membranes from large and small adipocytes isolated from the same adipose fat pad. Small and large fat cells were obtained from epididymal adipose tissue of 10–12-week old lean rats by differential flotation.

Significant statistical differences (paired t test analysis) were found between large and small adipocytes (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the next series of experiments, we examined whether mimicking in normal adipocytes the membrane cholesterol depletion of enlarged adipocytes modifies the metabolic activity of the former in a way similar to that found in the latter. We studied the insulin response of glucose metabolism, one of the parameters characteristically altered in hypertrophied adipocytes from obese animals or humans. We used methyl-β-cyclodextrin as the cholesterol-depleting agent because it induces rapid cholesterol removal from the plasma membrane by acting as an extra cellular acceptor, an effect extensively studied in various cell types (for review see Ref. 24Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the effect of a 1-h treatment of rat fat cells isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue with increasing concentrations of methyl-β-cyclodextrins. The membrane cholesterol concentration of adipocytes is decreased by cyclodextrin treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). A significant depletion occurs at 1 mm cyclodextrin, and approximately half of the membrane cholesterol is removed at the highest concentration tested (5 mm). If cyclodextrins are loaded with cholesterol prior to incubation, adipocyte membrane cholesterol is not decreased, but rather increased. This demonstrates that membrane cholesterol depletion is indeed related to the cholesterol-trapping properties of cyclodextrins. Fig. 3 B shows the insulin response of glucose metabolism in the adipocytes treated for 1 h with cyclodextrins. Maximal insulin stimulation of untreated control fat cells leads to a 3–4-fold stimulation of glucose oxidation rate, as previously observed (25Guerre-Millo M. Leturque A. Girard J. Lavau M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, glucose incorporation into CO2 did not change significantly in cells treated with increasing concentrations of methyl-β-cyclodextrins (data not shown). However, treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrins induced a marked reduction of insulin maximal stimulation proportional to their concentration. This effect was clearly related to cholesterol depletion, because a normal insulin response persisted when adipocytes were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrins previously loaded with cholesterol. There is a clear-cut decrease in the maximal response to insulin of glucose oxidation in the cyclodextrin-treated adipocytes when compared with the two other experimental conditions. In contrast, insulin sensitivity is not different, as seen from Fig. 3 C, where results are expressed as a percent of the maximal insulin effect. The extent of cholesterol depletion at 1 mm cyclodextrin leading to the effect on insulin response was in the same range as that described in enlarged fat cells from obese rodents (40–50%). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that cholesterol depletion of fat cell membranes can influence hormonal response of adipocytes and induce a state of insulin resistance characteristic of the enlarged adipocyte. Another distinctive feature of the enlarged fat cell from obese animals or humans is an altered pattern of gene expression, leading to sustained metabolic changes. In another series of experiments, we thus investigated whether changes in cholesterol content could influence the gene expression profile in adipocytes. Because this requires long term studies, we addressed this question in vitro in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In this system, we used a standard protocol in which sterol depletion was induced by addition of an inhibitor of sterol synthesis (compactin) in the culture medium, in the absence of exogenous cholesterol supply (lipoprotein-deficient fetal bovine serum). Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells lasted for 4 days. Under these conditions, cells showed no obvious morphologic changes. The triglyceride content of cells grown in the depleting medium showed only a slight and non-significant decrease as compared with those grown under standard conditions (2153 ± 231 μg versus 3004 ± 730 μg/dish, respectively). In contrast, as expected, total cell cholesterol was decreased 3-fold in conditions of sterol depletion versusstandard medium (39 ± 4.8 μg versus 134 ± 26 μg/dish, respectively; p < 0.05). One obvious consequence of this cholesterol depletion should be an activation of the SREBP-2 pathway. We then assessed the expression of the three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in sterol-depleted medium (Fig.4 A). Our results show that in cells differentiated under standard conditions, SREBP-1a mRNA is present with the lowest abundance; SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 mRNA are expressed at 6- and 4-fold higher levels, respectively. Importantly, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in sterol-depleted medium, SREBP-2 mRNA was induced 3–4-fold, with no significant change for SREBP-1a mRNA and a slight decrease in SREBP-1c mRNA. Thus, sterol depletion resulted in a switch from SREBP-1c to SREBP-2 as the major SREBP isoform expressed in these cells. As expected, this was accompanied by an up-regulation (5–10-fold) of SREBP-2 target genes (Fig. 4 B) in cells differentiated in sterol-depleted medium, which could be reversed by addition of cholesterol. These results confirm that our cholesterol depletion mimics in these 3T3-L1 cells the depletion observed in enlarged adipocytes. We then used this system to investigate on a wider scale the effect of cholesterol depletion on adipocyte gene expression profile. For this purpose, we examined the expression of 35 adipocyte genes using quantitative RT-PCR. Table I shows that a wide range of variations could be observed in sterol-depleted conditions versus standard medium (from a 10-fold induction to 5-fold reduction). For five genes (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, FAS, TNF-α, CAAT enhancer-binding protein α, and HMG-CoA reductase genes), Northern blot analysis was performed, which always confirmed the variations measured in real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 5). In Table I, among the genes whose expression is unaffected by sterol depletion are many genes important for the mature adipocyte phenotype and function. These include the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and key genes of adipocyte differentiation such as CAAT enhancer-binding protein α and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ genes. This further establishes that sterol depletion in our experiments did not alter an ongoing adipogenic program. In cholesterol-depleted cells, in addition to the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase genes, the expression of seven genes was up-regulated, including genes encoding adipocyte-secreted products like angiotensinogen, TNF-α, and interleukin-6, but also genes encoding proteins involved in intracellular cholesterol metabolism like SR-BI and caveolin 2 (TableI). Two of the up-regulated genes, the gene encoding the glucose transporter GLUT 1 and the gene encoding the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase, are involved in glucose utilization. Three of the genes, including the gene encoding a cholesterol transporter, ABC1, the gene encoding a glucose transporter, GLUT 4, and surprisingly the gene encoding a protein involved in mitochondrial metabolism, UCP3, were down-regulated. We ensured that some of the variations in gene expression, observed here by Taqman analysis of mRNAs, were followed by parallel changes at the protein level. Fig.6 shows a Western blot analysis of GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 in total membranes of 3T3-L1 cells. It demonstrates that the effects of cholesterol depletion on GLUT mRNAs (decreased GLUT 4 and increased GLUT 1 expression; see Table I) were also evident at the level of the total number of glucose transporters in membranes. This set of experiments establishes that cholesterol depletion has effects on gene expression, which are not related to genes involved only in cholesterol metabolism.Table IEffect of sterol depletion on adipocyte gene expressionGeneRatio (depleted vs. standard)S.D.Genes positively regulated by sterol depletionAngiotensinogen7.01.38TNF-α4.73.71Interleukin-63.40.91SR-BI3.51.96Caveolin-22.60.78GLUT-12.60.28Fatty acid synthase2.30.63Genes negatively regulated by sterol depletionABC10.50.13GLUT-40.30.19UCP30.20.07Unaffected genesG3PDH1.91.46α2-adrenergic receptor1.90.59Caveolin 11.80.47PPAR-γ1.81.05Perilipin1.80.62PAI-11.70.71SCD-11.60.82aP21.50.11Hormone-sensitive lipase1.50.38UCP21.40.91β3-adrenergic receptor1.20.78Actin1.11.09VLDL receptor1.10.03C/EBP-β1.10.44Insulin receptor1.10.74Leptin1.11.02CD36/FAT1.10.93Id21.00.48GAPDH1.00.39Lipoprotein lipase0.90.15Id30.90.30C/EBP-α0.70.32Total RNA was extracted from 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in standard conditions or sterol-depleted medium as above. mRNA levels were assessed by real-time RT-PCR as described.

Stimulating agents such as viruses, cytokines, and lipopolysaccharides promote dissociation of inactive NF-κB/IκB complexes, allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus and bind DNA. NF-κB binds to cis-acting κB sites in the promoters and enhancers of key cellular genes. Active, DNA-binding forms of NF-κB are dimeric complexes, composed of various combinations of members of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides (p50, p52, c-Rel, v-Rel, RelA (p65), and RelB). In addition to regulating immune and inflammatory responses, NF-κB suppresses apoptosis (17Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 18Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 19Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). Mice that lack the RelA/p65 gene die embryonically from extensive apoptosis within the liver (17Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by IFN protects cells from killing through the apoptotic pathway (16Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13631-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation and activation by the introduction of a mutant form of IκB that acts as a super-repressor enhance apoptotic killing by IFN. We evaluated the role that PI-3K and its downstream target, the serine-threonine kinase Akt/PKB, play in IFN-signaling. We identify an IFN signaling pathway that protects cells against proapoptotic agents. IFN receptor signaling through the STAT3 docking site on the IFNAR1 chain leads to NF-κB activation, which involves the sequential activation of PI-3K and Akt. STAT3, PI-3K, and Akt are indispensable for IFN-dependent cell survival (antiapoptotic) signals generated through NF-κB. Recombinant human IFN-α (IFNCon1), provided by Amgen, was assayed by protection against the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on human fibroblasts, using the National Institutes of Health human IFN-α standard for reference. Anti-Rel and IκBα antibodies were generously provided by Dr. N. Rice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Human Daudi cells were maintained in static suspension cultures at 2–15 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% defined calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). For experiments, cells were suspended at 0.5–1 × 108 cells/ml in medium before the addition of IFN or other agents. High-efficiency, transient transfection of cells (107) was accomplished by electroporation (capacitance, 300 microfarads; 250 V) with 500 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 20 μg of plasmid DNA for each sample. Using a green fluorescent protein construct, we found that transfection efficiency of Daudi cells is >90%, as determined by confocal microscopy. Δp85 is a p85 mutant in which 35 amino acids from residues 479–513 are deleted, and 2 amino acids (Ser-Arg) are inserted (21Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ano A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.

Nuclei were extracted with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.85, 250 mmsucrose, 0.4 m KCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.75 μg/ml benzamidine), and extracts were frozen and stored at −80 °C (15Yang C.H.

For EMSA, the nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′) derived from a NF-κB binding sequence in the immunoglobulin gene promoter (25Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To define the presence of specific Rel proteins, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 1:50 dilution of anti-Rel antibodies at 25 °C for 0.5 h and then subjected to EMSA. Gels were quantitated by PhosphorImage autoradiography. For reporter gene assays, COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected by electroporation with the pUX-CAT 3XHLAκB CAT reporter construct (24Oliviera I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushiam K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the appropriate expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were treated with IFNCon1 (5,000 units/ml) for 15 min and assayed for CAT activity. After thin-layer chromatography, radioactivity was measured by PhosphorImage autoradiography."
https://openalex.org/W2054480779,"We examined the role of heterotrimeric G protein signaling components in insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) action. In HIRcB cells and in 3T3L1 adipocytes, treatment with the Gαi inhibitor (pertussis toxin) or microinjection of the Gβγ inhibitor (glutathioneS-transferase-βARK) inhibited IGF-I and lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated mitogenesis but had no effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF) or insulin action. In basal state, Gαi and Gβ were associated with the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), and after ligand stimulation the association of IGF-IR with Gαi increased concomitantly with a decrease in Gβ association. No association of Gαi was found with either the insulin or EGF receptor. Microinjection of anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody specifically inhibited IGF-I mitogenic action but had no effect on EGF or insulin action. β-Arrestin-1 was associated with the receptors for IGF-I, insulin, and EGF in a ligand-dependent manner. We demonstrated that Gαi, βγ subunits, and β-arrestin-1 all play a critical role in IGF-I mitogenic signaling. In contrast, neither metabolic, such as GLUT4 translocation, nor mitogenic signaling by insulin is dependent on these protein components. These results suggest that insulin receptors and IGF-IRs can function as G protein-coupled receptors and engage different G protein partners for downstream signaling.

Heptahelical receptors are another broad class of membrane receptors, and this receptor class is often referred to as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), because they exert their biologic effects by interacting with a family of heterotrimeric G protein signaling molecules (10Watson S. Arkinstall A. The G-protein Linked Receptor Facts Book. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar, 11Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin.

Although it is often thought that the RTKs and heptahelical/GPCRs represent structurally and functionally different classes of receptor types, recent evidence indicates that this may not be strictly the case (13Dhanasekaran N.

For example, it has now been established that specific heptahelical receptor biologic responses, such as activation of MAP kinase (16Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y.

Further, several reports have appeared that show a strict dependence of insulin receptor and IGF-I signaling on heterotrimeric G proteins (9Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H.B. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Luttrell L.M. Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Evidence exists to indicate that the IGF-I receptor requires a heterotrimeric G protein containing Gαi for some of its biologic effects. Thus, treatment with pertussis toxin (an inhibitor of Gαi-mediated signaling) blocks IGF-I-induced activation of MAP kinase, and inhibition of Gβγ function also impairs MAP kinase signaling from the IGF-I receptor (25Luttrell L.M. Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work from our laboratory has shown that Gαq/11 plays a key role in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and stimulation of glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In these studies, we showed that the IR physically associates with and phosphorylates Gαq/11 and that this G protein is necessary for insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. In addition, a constitutively active form of Gαq/11 was able to mimic the effects of insulin by stimulating GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport on its own (9Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H.B. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, one can suggest that the term GPCR is a broader functional definition, rather than a structural one referring to heptahelical receptors specifically. Because of the extensive structural homology between the IR and IGF-IR, we have now directly studied the involvement of different G protein signaling components in these RTK action pathways. β-Arrestin-1 and horseradish peroxidase- conjugated phosphotyrosine (RC-20) antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit, anti-mouse antibodies, protein A/G-plus agarose, IR, IGF-IR, Gβ, Gαi antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Laboratories (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody (F349) was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Mueckler (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Mouse monoclonal phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and rabbit monoclonal phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody was from Promega(Madison, MA). Sheep IgG, tetramethyl rhodamine isothocyanate (TRITC)- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti- rabbit, -mouse, -goat, and -sheep IgG antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.

Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P) were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HIRcB cells, which are rat 1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human form of the IR, were maintained as previously described (26McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

NIH/3T3 cells, established from NIH Swiss mouse embryo cultures, were grown in DMEM with 4.5 g/l glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum, Co.), in a 10% CO2environment. Cultures were never allowed to become completely confluent. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were maintained in DMEM with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS, in a 10% CO2 environment. 3T3-L1 were differenciated 2 days post-confluency by the addition of the same media containing 500 μm isobutylxanthine, 25 μm dexamethasone, and 4 μg/ml insulin. After 3 days, the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FCS, 5 mm glucose, glutamax, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Seven days after the addition of the differentiation medium, the cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 8 × 105 cells/dish. The medium was changed every second day until use, 10–12 days post-differentiation. Approximately 90% of the cells exhibited large lipid droplets indicative of adipocytes. 24 h prior to the start of experiments, cells were given fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS, 5 mm glucose without antibiotics. HIRcB cells were grown on 6 well plates to 50–70% confluency and then starved in serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml insulin, 100 ng/ml IGF-1, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), or 10 μm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). 12 h later, BrdU was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. Cells were then fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated with rat anti-BrdU antibody followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-rat IgG. Results were analyzed on an Axiphot fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Positive cells in Fig. 1 represent the ratio of a total population of cells in a given area (nucleus stained cells using blue Dye) compared with cells which incorporate BrdU corresponding to a new DNA synthesis. Cells were injected and photographed as previously described (27Haruta T.A. Morris A.J. Rose D.W. Nelson J.G. Mueckler M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Cells were starved in serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium for 24 h. 1 h after the microinjection, cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml insulin, 100 ng/ml IGF-I, 10 ng/ml EGF, or 10 μm LPA. 12 h later, BrdU incorporation was performed as already described. For GLUT4 translocation experiments, 3T3L1 adipocytes were trypsinized on day 7 post-differentiation and reseeded on acid-washed coverslips in preparation for microinjection on days 10–12. Microinjection of the various reagents was carried out using a semiautomatic Eppendorf microinjection system. All reagents for microinjection were dissolved in microinjection buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl. Antibodies were coinjected into the cytoplasm of the cell with 5 mg/ml sheep IgG to allow identification of the injected cells. Immunostaining of GLUT4 was performed as previously described (28Vollenweider P. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Cormont M. Marchand-Brustel Y.L. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3T3L1 adipocytes were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% FCS in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with anti- GLUT4 antibody in PBS with 2% FCS overnight at 4 °C. After washing, GLUT4 and injected IgG were detected by incubation with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody, respectively. Immunofluorescence observed by microscope was used to evaluate the results. Injected cells were scored as positive for GLUT4 translocation if they were observed to have a ring of fluorescence at the cell periphery. In all counting experiments, the observer was blinded to the experimental condition of each coverslip. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed, and permeabilized with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST buffer). After incubation in blocking buffer (5% normal horse serum in TBST buffer) for 60 min at room temperature, cells were exposed to the anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumine TBST buffer overnight at 4 °C (1:400 dilution). After washing, phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase was detected by incubation with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or rabbit IgG secondary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumine TBST buffer (1:250 dilution). Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies react specifically with phosphorylated MAP kinase and do not cross-react with nonphosphorylated MAP kinase by Western blotting. HIRcB cells or 3T3L1 adipocytes plated in 6-well dishes were treated as described in figure legends. After stimulation, cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a solubilizing buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm PyroPO4, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin. Cells lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, the supernatants (25–50 μg of protein/lane) were denatured by boiling for 3 min in Laemmli's sample buffer in reduced or nonreduced conditions (with or without 100 mm dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol) and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants (200–350 μg of total protein) were incubated with primary antibody as indicated in each experiments for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein A/G-plus agarose, washed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer and boiled for 3 min in Laemmli's sample buffer containing (or not) 100 mm dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol and resolved by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) by using Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specified antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody, proteins were visualized by ECL detection (Pierce). Before the uptake, 12 days post-differenciation 3T3L1 adipocytes were placed in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with KRPH buffer (5 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumine) and either untreated or stimulated as described in figure legends. Glucose transport was determined by the addition of 0.1 mm 2-deoxyglucose containing 0.2 μCi ofl-[3H]deoxyglucose as described previously (29Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific uptake was assessed by the addition of 0.1 mml-glucose containing 0.2 μCi ofl-[3H]glucose. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by aspiration, and extraneous glucose was removed by four washes with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH and uptake was assessed by scintillation counting. Samples were normalized for protein content by Bradford protein assay. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Results were analyzed by using Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Fig.1 A depicts the effects of PTX treatment of HIRcB cells on ligand-stimulated BrdU incorporation mediated by insulin, IGF-I, EGF, or LPA. IGF-I- and LPA-induced BrdU incorporation was blocked by PTX treatment, whereas insulin or EGF stimulated BrdU incorporation was not affected. These results indicate that the pathways for IGF-I- and LPA-stimulated DNA synthesis require Gαi signaling, whereas insulin- and EGF-stimulated mitogenic signaling do not. Luttrel et al. (25Luttrell L.M. Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have shown that Gβγ subunits are necessary for IGF-I-induced MAP kinase activation. Thus, in our conditions, we assessed the role of Gβγ in growth factor-stimulated mitogenesis. We utilized a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the C-terminal portion of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (GST-βARK), which binds to and sequesters Gβγ subunits and behaves as a dominant negative inhibitor of Gβγ signaling (30Garcia-Higuera I. Mayor Jr., F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We microinjected GST-βARK into HIRcB cells and measured insulin, IGF-I, LPA, and EGF stimulated BrdU incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, microinjection of GST-βARK blocks IGF-I- and LPA-induced BrdU incorporation but not that induced by insulin or EGF. As seen in Fig.2 A, Gαiimmunoprecipitated with the IGF-I receptor in the basal state, and the amount of receptor-associated Gαi increased markedly after IGF-I stimulation. No association of Gαi with either the insulin receptor or EGF receptors was found in HIRcB cells (Fig. 2 A). Time course studies showed that the IGF-I-induced association between Gαi and IGF-IR proceeds with a maximum from 2 to 5 min (Fig. 2, B and C). Total Gαi expression in cell lysates was the same at all time points (Fig. 2, A and B). Because tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown for Gαi, we determined whether or not Gαi-tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced by IGF-I treatment. HIRcB cells were stimulated with IGF-I for various periods, followed by phosphotyrosine antibody or Gαiantibody immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with Gαi or phosphotyrosine antibodies, respectively. IGF-I did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαi (data not shown). To further assess Gβγ subunit involvement in the mitogenic effect of IGF-I, we investigated whether endogenous Gβ subunits interact with the IGF-I receptor. Immunoprecipitation studies show an association between the IGF-IR and Gβ, which decreased 35% in response to IGF-I (maximum decrease at 2 min) (Fig. 2, D andE). Total Gβ expression in cell lysates was the same at all time points (Fig. 2 D). The process of receptor internalization plays an essential role in receptor-mediated mitogenic signaling (31Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar,32Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H.

Because it has been shown that β-arrestin-1 is necessary for GPCR and IGF-IR internalization (33Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 34Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that this protein was involved in the mitogenic effects elicited by the receptors coupled to Gαi. We inhibited endogenous β-arrestin-1 function by single cell microinjection of anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody, followed by measurement of BrdU incorporation. As shown in Fig. 3, microinjection of the β-arrestin-1 antibody into NIH3T3 cells inhibited DNA synthesis in response to IGF-I and LPA but not to insulin or EGF. Overexpressed β-arrestin-1 can interact with IGF-I receptors in HEK 293 cells (36Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and, therefore, we determined whether endogenous levels of β-arrestin-1 could interact with endogenous IGF-IRs in our system. As shown in Fig.4 (A and B), in the basal state, β-arrestin-1 is associated with the IGF-IR, and this association increases >2 fold at 5 min of IGF-I stimulation. β-Arrestin-1 was also observed in anti- IR immunoprecipitates, and the time course of this association was similar to that observed for the IGF-IR (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, β-arrestin-1 also immunoprecipitated with the EGFR, but the time course of association was more rapid and transient (Fig. 4,E and F). Using 3T3 L1 adipocytes that express endogenous levels of IRs and IGF-I Rs, we studied the involvement of Gαi, Gβγ, or β-arrestin-1 in the metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin and IGF-I. To accomplish this, we measured insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. As shown in Fig.5 (A and B), PTX pretreatment did not inhibit the effects of insulin on glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation. We also determined whether β-arrestin-1 was involved in this action of insulin using anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody microinjection followed by insulin stimulation and immunofluorescence staining for GLUT4 translocation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, inhibition of β-arrestin-1 function had no effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. As we previously reported (37Imamura T. Ishibashi K.I. Dalle S. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33691-33695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we also show in this system that GST-βARK microinjection did not inhibit insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, our results show that, in 3T3L1 adipocytes, there is no involvement of a Gαi/Gβ pathway or β-arrestin-1 in insulin signaling leading to glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. We also measured insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activity in these same cells, and these experiments were performed in two ways. First, we assess phospho-MAP kinase immunoblots of cell lysates. Secondly, we developed a single cell assay for microinjected cells by immunostaining of coverslips with the same antibody to determine the percentage of cells positive for phospho MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 5(C and D), MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by IGF-I was blocked by PTX pretreatment, whereas insulin stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation was unaffected. To determine whether Gβγ subunits and β-arrestin-1 were involved in insulin or IGF-I signaling leading to MAP kinase phosphorylation, we microinjected GST-βARK and anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody and measured MAP kinase phosphorylation by immunofluorescence staining of cells. Microinjection of GST-βARK and anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody inhibited IGF-I-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation but not that induced by insulin (Fig. 5, Eand F). These results clearly indicate that in 3T3L1 adipocytes, IGF-I signaling leading to MAP kinase phosphorylation requires Gαi, Gβ, and β-arrestin-1, whereas insulin-induced MAP kinase signaling does not. These results also show that these reagents (PTX, GST-βARK, and anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody) were effective at inhibiting IGF-I induced MAP kinase activation in these cells, indicating that the lack of effect on insulin metabolic actions was specific. Because 15% of the endogenous IGF-I receptors form hybrids with the transfected human insulin receptors in HIRcB cells (38Seely B.L. Reichart D. Takata Y. Yip C. Olefsky J.M.

They have distinct functions in transcription. Because the three CDKs target only serine 5 in the heptad repeat of model CTD substrates containing various numbers of repeats, we tested the hypothesis that the kinases differ in their ability to phosphorylate CTD heptad arrays. Our data show that the kinases display different preferences for phosphorylating individual heptads in a synthetic CTD substrate containing three heptamer repeats and specific regions of the CTD in glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins. They also exhibit differences in their ability to phosphorylate a synthetic CTD peptide that contains Ser-2-PO4. This phosphorylated peptide is a poor substrate for CDK9 complexes. CDK8 and CDK9 complexes, bound to viral activators E1A and Tat, respectively, target only serine 5 for phosphorylation in the CTD peptides, and binding to the viral activators does not change the substrate preference of these kinases. These results imply that the display of different CTD heptads during transcription, as well as their phosphorylation state, can affect their phosphorylation by the different transcription-associated CDKs.

These CDKs can hyperphosphorylate the CTD of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and therefore are CTD kinases (1Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The CTD of mammalian pol II consists of 52 heptad repeats with the consensus sequence1YSPTSPS7, which is especially well-conserved in the first half (N-terminal) of the CTD. Of the phosphorylatable amino acid residues, serine 5 is the most conserved, with only one threonine replacement, indicating that it is likely to have a crucial role in the function of the CTD. Pol II CTD is highly phosphorylatedin vivo, mostly at serine (positions 2 and 5) but also at threonine and tyrosine (2Dahmus M.E. Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated CTD is correlated with transcription initiation and elongation, whereas the holoenzyme and preinitiation complexes contain pol II with hypophosphorylated CTD (3Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, replacing either serine 2 or serine 5 with alanine in each of this organism's 26 CTD heptad repeats causes lethality (4West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The functions of these kinases correlate with different stages of transcription. CDK7 is a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH and is the kinase that phosphorylates pol II CTD after the preinitiation complex is formed (5Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). CDK7 is the catalytic member of a three-subunit complex called CAK (CDK-activating kinase) composed of CDK7/cyclin H and MAT-1 (6Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P.

Cell. 1995; 83: 47-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CAK is also a subassembly of TFIIH (8Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: O7-10PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison between the kinase activity of CAK and TFIIH revealed differences in substrate specificity: CAK shows a strong preference for CDK2, consistent with its function in the cell cycle, but cannot hyperphosphorylate pol II; TFIIH hyperphosphorylates pol II, but CDK2 is a very poor substrate for this form of CDK7 (9Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). TFIIH also phosphorylates transcription factors TBP, TFIIE, and TFIIF, whereas free CAK phosphorylates only TBP (5Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Rossignol M.

Hence, the composition of the complexes that contain CDK7 modulates its substrate preferences.Human CDK8/cyclin C is found in a variety of pol II holoenzyme complexes (11Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R.

Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol.

Martin M.E. Lees E. Ricciardi R.P. Berk A.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The functions of the various CDK8-containing complexes are not fully understood. E1A and VP16 target the human SrB/Mediator and stimulate transcription in vitro (14Boyer T.G. Martin M.E. Lees E. Ricciardi R.P. Berk A.J.

On the contrary, NAT (negative regulator of activated transcription) is probably a subcomplex of pol II holoenzyme and can interact with pol II to repress activated transcription by phosphorylating pol II (17Sun X.

The Tat-bound P-TEFb complex that contains only cyclin T1 is also referred to as TAK (Tat-associated kinase). It is well established that P-TEFb is necessary for the transition of pol II into productive elongation in both human and Drosophila systems (24Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Tat enhances the function of P-TEFb by further increasing pol II CTD phosphorylation (25Isel C. Karn J. J. Mol.

Preinitiation complexes formed on the HIV-1 promoter contain CDK9 (as well as CDK7), which stays with pol II throughout the elongation process (25Isel C. Karn J. J. Mol.

The role of CDK9 in the preinitiation complex is not yet understood, however. Tat does not increase phosphorylation of the CTD by CDK7 in the initiation complex (25Isel C. Karn J. J. Mol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but the basis for their distinct roles in transcription remains unclear. To elucidate the specificity of the CTD kinases, we compared the activity of natural complexes of each kinase with different CTD substrates. Although they phosphorylate purified pol II similarly, we observed differences in the phosphorylation pattern of various GST-CTD substrates. Most striking is their display of heptad preference when phosphorylating a model peptide, CTD3, containing three heptads. CDK8 is the most indiscriminate whereas CDK7 and CDK9 show preferences toward different heptads. An important distinction was revealed using a phosphorylated CTD peptide substrate. Serine 2-phosphorylated CTD4 is a poor substrate for CDK9 whereas CDK7 and CDK8 are equally active with CTD4 and CTD4–2P. The natural CDK complexes, as well as CDK8 and CDK9 complexes bound to viral activators E1A and Tat, respectively, target only serine 5 for phosphorylation. Binding to the viral activators did not change the substrate preference of these kinases. These results suggest that the differential functions of the three CTD kinase complexes reflects distinct modes of recognition of pol II as a substrate.DISCUSSIONWe compared the substrate specificity of natural complexes of the cyclin dependent kinases 7, 8, and 9 from human cells. Using substrates containing different numbers of CTD heptad repeats, we uncovered differences in substrate preference among these kinases. Specifically, by using CTD3 peptides we showed that CDK7 prefers to phosphorylate serine 5 in the first and second heptad over the third heptad, CDK9 prefers to phosphorylate serine 5 in the first heptad over the other two, and CDK8 has no preference for either heptad. Moreover, although CDKs 8 and 9 prefer to phosphorylate the highly conserved N-terminal region of the CTD, CDK7 phosphorylates it uniformly. Finally, none of the kinases efficiently phosphorylates serine 5-phosphorylated CTD peptide, and CDK9 (but not CDKs 7 and 8) strongly discriminates against serine 2-phosphorylated CTD peptide. We postulate that the three CDKs exhibit heptad preference when they phosphorylate pol II CTD. Selective modification of pol II CTD, before and during transcription, may serve as a regulatory device allowing the specific interaction of various proteins with the CTD to promote or inhibit mRNA transcription.Differences in Substrate Specificity among the Three KinasesTaking advantage of differences in gel mobility between the singly phosphorylated specific heptads of CTD3, we demonstrated that the three kinases exhibit different heptad preferences within the CTD. The heptad preference displayed by CDK7 (in purified TFIIH complexes) was noted previously (30Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is possible that these differences in heptad preference are related to differences in the activation segments of the three kinases. The crystal structure of CDK2-cyclin A3 shows that the activation segment is involved in binding the substrate after phosphorylation of the conserved threonine in the T loop (49Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Although both CDK7 and CDK9 retain this threonine residue, it is replaced by aspartic acid in CDK8, which is the most promiscuous of these three CDKs with respect to heptad selectivity.Kinetic experiments indicated that the initial phosphorylation event(s) of pol II CTD by P-TEFb are slow but additional phosphates are incorporated quickly to reach the IIo position (48Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The pattern of phosphorylation of GST-CTD by recombinant CDK9 bound to GST-cyclin T1 (50Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and by CDK9 immunocomplexes (Fig. 1 C) is consistent with this observation. Hence it seems that CDK9 prefers to phosphorylate pol II CTD that is partially phosphorylated, consistent with its function at the elongation stage after initial phosphorylation of pol II CTD by TFIIH. By contrast, the pattern of GST-CTD phosphorylation by CDK7 complexes, leading to an array of phosphorylated molecules, suggests no preference for unphosphorylated or partially phosphorylated CTD. A similar pattern of GST-CTD phosphorylation was observed with CDK7 immunoprecipitated holoenzyme (51Ossipow V. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Schibler U. Cell. 1995; 83: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of full-length GST-CTD by CDK8 did not give rise to the hyperphosphorylated form, suggesting that the rest of the pol II large subunit has an effect on the enzyme activity. This idea is strengthened by the observation that CDK8 is tightly associated with pol II in the holoenzyme (41Rickert P. Seghezzi W. Shanahan F. Cho H. Lees E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2631-2640PubMed Google Scholar).Comparing the efficiency of the three CTD kinases for phosphorylating the N- and C-terminal portion of the pol II CTD revealed further differences between the enzymes in substrate specificity. The first half of the CTD, which is essential for transcriptional activity from many promoters (52Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is a good substrate for all three kinases. On the other hand, the C-terminal portion of the CTD, which is required for cell survival (53Meininghaus M. Chapman R.D. Horndasch M. Eick D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24375-24382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although not in transient expression assays (52Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), provides discrimination among the kinases. This region is strongly phosphorylated only by CDK7 and contains many heptads in which serine 7 is substituted with lysine, threonine, or asparagine. Studies with CTD4 mutants containing serine 7 substitutions indicated that the lysine residues comprise the principal determinant of the preference of recombinant CDK7·cyclin H·MAT-1 complexes for GST-CTD-(30–53) (31Rickert P. Corden J.L. Lees E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In our hands, the efficiency of phosphorylation by CDK8 and -9 was not greatly influenced by any of the CTD4 peptide substitutions (data not shown), indicating that these position 7 differences are not sufficient to explain the kinases' ability to distinguish between the two halves of the CTD.Target Specificity of CDK7, -8, and -9 ComplexesOur CTD peptide assays reinforce the view that serine 5 in the CTD heptad is the only target of phosphorylation by immunocomplexes of CDK7, -8, and -9 as well E1A-bound CDK8 complexes and TAK complexes (32Ramanathan Y. Reza S.M. Young T.M. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5448-5458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Corroborative data have been obtained by others using mutant CTD peptides and GST-CTD fusion proteins (5Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A.

Biol. 1999; 288: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, based on an indirect assay, it has been reported that CDKs 8 and 9, but not CDK7, can phosphorylate the CTD on serine 2 (17Sun X. Zhang Y. Cho H. Rickert P. Lees E. Lane W. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These conclusions were drawn from immunoblotting data obtained with two monoclonal antibodies made against tyrosine-phosphorylated cell proteins (54Warren S.L. Landolfi A.S. Curtis C. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the antibodies were not generated specifically against phosphorylated serine 2 or 5, the interpretation of results derived from use of these antibodies may not be straightforward. Strictly, the results obtained with CTD mutants show that serine 5 is necessary for CTD phosphorylation, leaving open the possibility that serine 2 can be phosphorylated only subsequent to serine 5 phosphorylation. Our results with serine 5-phosphorylated CTD peptides argue against this possibility, but additional reagents and experiments are needed to resolve the issue with certainty.As mentioned above, pol II is found in vivo to be phosphorylated on serine 2 in the CTD heptad as well as on serine 5. The capping of mRNA, which occurs shortly after initiation is accomplished via the interaction of the capping enzyme with the phosphorylated form of pol II CTD (55Ho C.K. Sriskanda V. McCracken S. Bentley D. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9577-9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The guanylyltransferase component of the capping apparatus binds peptides that are phosphorylated on either serine 2 and 5, but only the latter stimulates guanylyltransferase activity (35Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results indicate that the fate of mRNA elongation, which is dependent on P-TEFb may be influenced by the state of CTD phosphorylation. One possible model is that shortly after promoter escape there is transcriptional pausing (24Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 56Krumm A. Hickey L.B. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) during which pol II CTD is preferentially dephosphorylated at serine 2 residues, then phosphorylated at serine 5 by P-TEFb, allowing resumption of elongation and capping. Recently, a CTD phosphatase (FCP1) that can dephosphorylate RNA pol IIO in transcription elongation complexes was described (57Cho H. Kim T.K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The correlation between elongational pausing and cap formation has been demonstrated in vivo withDrosophila heat shock genes (58Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Significance of Distinct Activities of CDK7, -8, and -9CTD phosphorylation is connected with mRNA splicing (59McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and 3′-end formation (60Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar) as well as transcription (3Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and capping (61McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). It has been envisioned that the CTD acts as a platform for factors involved in RNA synthesis and processing. These processes are regulated by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the CTD, mediated by multiple CTD kinases as well as CTD phosphatases (57Cho H. Kim T.K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 62Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Greenblatt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14300-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Only one CTD phosphatase from human cells has been identified thus far, as well as a yeast homologue (65Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C. Gileadi O. Jansma D.B. Jennings E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CTD phosphorylation is regulated in a temporal fashion (45Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In light of our findings, it is likely that CTD phosphorylation is also regulated on the level of substrate specificity. Hence, the differential recognition of heptad arrays by the CTD kinases will affect the structure and exposure of regions of the CTD. At any given time in the dynamic process of mRNA transcription and processing, different protein complexes are bound to the CTD, and these will also affect its heptads' exposure and structure. Moreover, the action of CTD phosphatases could affect heptad recognition by the CDKs. For example, remodeling of the CTD by removing the phosphate from serine 2 may be one way in which cells control the capping of mRNA and productive elongation. The three cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9,1 have an established connection with transcription machinery and are regulated by constitutively expressed cyclins. These CDKs can hyperphosphorylate the CTD of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and therefore are CTD kinases (1Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The CTD of mammalian pol II consists of 52 heptad repeats with the consensus sequence1YSPTSPS7, which is especially well-conserved in the first half (N-terminal) of the CTD. Of the phosphorylatable amino acid residues, serine 5 is the most conserved, with only one threonine replacement, indicating that it is likely to have a crucial role in the function of the CTD. Pol II CTD is highly phosphorylatedin vivo, mostly at serine (positions 2 and 5) but also at threonine and tyrosine (2Dahmus M.E. Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated CTD is correlated with transcription initiation and elongation, whereas the holoenzyme and preinitiation complexes contain pol II with hypophosphorylated CTD (3Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, replacing either serine 2 or serine 5 with alanine in each of this organism's 26 CTD heptad repeats causes lethality (4West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of these kinases correlate with different stages of transcription. CDK7 is a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH and is the kinase that phosphorylates pol II CTD after the preinitiation complex is formed (5Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). CDK7 is the catalytic member of a three-subunit complex called CAK (CDK-activating kinase) composed of CDK7/cyclin H and MAT-1 (6Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2133817555,"We previously have reported that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is stimulated by adhesion of human chondrocytes to anti-β1-integrin antibodies or collagen type II in vitro. These mechanisms most likely prevent chondrocyte dedifferentiation to fibroblast-like cells and chondrocyte death. To investigate whether this pathway plays an essential role for the differentiation, phenotype, and survival of chondrocytes, we blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) (MEK), a kinase upstream of the kinase Erk by using U0126. Exposure of chondrocytes to U0126 caused activation of caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis with an antibody specific for dually phosphorylated Erk shows that collagen type II induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was specifically blocked by U0126 in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that treated chondrocytes were caspase-3 positive. In treated chondrocytes, the cleavage of 116-kDa poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase resulted in the 85-kDa apoptosis-related cleavage fragment and was associated with caspase-3 activity. Analysis by electron microscopy showed typical morphological signs of apoptosis, such as crescent-shaped clumps of heterochromatin, and a degraded pericellular matrix. Thus, these results indicate that the MEK/Erk signal transduction pathway is involved in the maintenance of chondrocytes differentiation and survival. These data stimulate further investigations on the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in human chondrocytes.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a key role in embryogenesis, immunological competence and tissue homeostasis for cell removal and can distinguished biochemically and morphologically from cell necrosis, which is a passive, energy-independent form of cell death. Chondrocyte degradation and death occurs in enchondral ossification as well as in age-associated athropathies such as osteoarthritis (1Roach H.I. Erenpreisa J. Aigner T. J.

It is known that many cell types including chondrocytes require integrin mediated interactions with the extracellular matrix to survive, differentiate, and proliferate (6Svoboda K.K.H. Microsc. Res.

It is well known that one of the early reactions occurring in the cell after the damage of its DNA is the activation of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), a nuclear enzyme present in eukaryotes. Several lines of evidence show that PARP is involved in different cellular functions including DNA repair (11Durkacz B.W. Irwin J. Shall S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

During apoptosis, clumps of heterochromatin and nuclear fragmentation appear and PARP is one of the earliest proteins to be specifically cleaved from 116 kDa to two fragments of ∼85 and 25 kDa (16Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res... 1993; 53: 3976-3985Google Scholar). A group of cysteine proteases called “caspases” play a central role in apoptosis. They are synthesized as proenzymes, containing an N-terminal prodomain. Activation occurs by cleaving this prodomain at a specific aspartic acid cleavage site that is localized between the prodomain and each subunit of the caspase. One caspase can process and activate the other in a cascade reaction beginning by initiator caspases, which interact with specific adaptor proteins. Initiator caspases activate effector caspases (e.g. caspase-3, -6, and -7) either directly or indirectly that cleave a number of structural and regulatory proteins including DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor)/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNases, PARP, lamine, and cytokeratines (17Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res... 2000; 256: 27-33Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p44 (Erk1) and p42 MAPK (Erk2) are important mediators of cellular responses to intracellular signaling proteins. MEK1 and MEK2 regulate the activity of Erk1/2 by phosphorylating threonine and tyrosine residues, and further upstream MAPK kinase kinases (Raf) regulate the activity of MEK by phosphorylation of two serine residues. The activated Erk1/2 then translocates into the nucleus and regulates the activities of several nuclear transcription factors (18Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

Furthermore, it is known that the MEK/Erk signaling pathway is involved in the cell growth and differentiation in many cell types. However, the role of MEK/Erk signaling pathway in chondrocyte function and differentiation is at present not fully understood. Therefore, in this study, we examined the essential role of Erk pathway on chondrocyte differentiation and survival by treating chondrocytes with the inhibitor U0126, which has been shown to specifically block mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase (MEK), the kinase upstream of Erk (23Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 18623-18632Google Scholar). Upon treatment with U0126, chondrocytes undergo apoptosis, suggesting that a functional death-mediating signaling cascade is associated with the extracellular matrix protein. Inhibition of MEK with inhibitors is a relatively new approach to clarify the role of these kinases in cellular functions.

Collagen type II, trypsin, pronase, and collagenase were purchased from Sigma (Munich, Germany). IGF-I was purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Dual-system-APAAP-complex was purchased from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). Primary cultures of chondrocytes were prepared from human cartilage as described previously in detail (7Shakibaei M. John T. de Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 615-623Google Scholar). Briefly, human articular cartilage specimens (from femoral heads obtained during joint replacement surgery for femoral neck fractures) were collected in Ham's F-12 medium. Cartilage slices were digested with 1% pronase and then with 0.2% collagenase. After rinsing in growth medium (Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: 50/50, 10% fetal calf serum, 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 50 μg/ml gentamicin), a single cell suspension was obtained. The cells were cultured in alginate beads as described previously in detail (24Shakibaei M. de Souza P. Cell Biol. Int... 1997; 21: 75-86Google Scholar). To dissolve the alginate for subsequent separation of the cells, the alginate beads were placed in 55 mm sodium citrate in 0.15m NaCl. Coverslips coated with collagen type II (500 μg/ml in 0.02 N acetic acid at 4 °C overnight), were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with serum-free medium at 37 °C for 1 h prior to use. Human chondrocytes isolated from alginate beads were washed three times with serum-free medium. After counting, the cells were diluted to 1.5 × 106/ml in serum-free medium, cultured on prepared coverslips for 30 min, and then stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml). A specific positive effect of collagen type II and IGF-I has been shown, on the stabilization, differentiation, survival, and adhesion of chondrocyte in vitro (7Shakibaei M. John T. de Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 615-623Google Scholar). After washing, the attached chondrocytes were treated with U0126 (1 μm) or left untreated. The cultures were investigated after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 h by light microscopy. The number of cells was determined by scoring cells from three different microscopic fields. These assays were performed in triplicate, and the results are provided as mean values with standard deviations from three independent experiments. The U0126-treated or untreated cultures as described above were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% tannic acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Subsequently, they were post-fixed in a 2% OsO4 solution. After dehydration in the ascending alcohol series, the specimens were embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and investigated under a transmission electron microscope Zeiss EM10. A detailed description of the technique used for the following experiments has been published previously (25Shakibaei M. de Souza P. Merker H.J. Cell Biol. Int... 1997; 21: 115-125Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed for 10 min. After counting, the cells were diluted to 1.5 × 106/ml in serum-free medium, plated on dishes coated with collagen type II stimulated with IGF-I and then treated with U0126 (0.1, 1, 10 μm) for 1 h or left untreated. After rinsing, the cells were immunolabeled as follows: 1) incubation with serum (1:20 in Tris buffer) at room temperature for 10 min; 2) incubation with primary antibodies (anti-active caspase-3 and normal rabbit IgG 1:30) in a moist chamber overnight at 4 °C; 3) rinsing; 4) incubation with mouse-anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:50) at room temperature for 30 min; 5) rinsing; 6) incubation with dual system bridge antibodies (1:50) for 30 min at room temperature; 7) rinsing; 8) incubation with dual system-APAAP-complex (1:50) for 30 min at room temperature; 9) rinsing; 10) new fuscin staining for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the specimens were washed and dried, covered with Kaisers glycerin/gelatin and examined under a Zeiss Axiophot 100 light microscope. A detailed description of the culture technique used for the following experiments has been published previously (7Shakibaei M. John T. de Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 615-623Google Scholar). Briefly, chondrocytes were harvested from alginate cultures and washed three times with serum-free medium. After counting, the cells were diluted to 1.5 × 106/ml in serum-free medium, plated on dishes coated with collagen type II, and then treated with U0126 (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 μm) for 1 h or left untreated. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 0.01% aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min. For immunoblotting, equal amounts of total proteins were separated on 10% or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes in blocking buffer, membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were finally washed five times in blocking buffer, twice in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5 containing 0.05 m MgCl2 and 0.1 mNaCl; specific binding was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate (p-toluidine salt; Pierce) as substrates and quantitated by densitometry. Protein determination was done with the bicinchoninic acid system (Pierce) using BCA as a standard. The results are expressed the means ± S.D. of a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. The means were compared using Student's t test assuming equal variances. Statistical significance was atp < 0.05. Human chondrocytes were cultured on collagen type II-coated Petri dishes, serum starved, stimulated with IGF-I and then either treated with U0126 or left untreated for the indicated times. The chondrocytes grown on collagen type II without U0126 exhibited a round to oval shape and numerous small ridge-like or cuspidal surface processes from the beginning of cultivation onwards (Fig.3 A). The chondrocytes grown on collagen type II with U0126 showed cell detachment, loss of cell processes, and membrane shrinkage. The number and density of the chondrocytes cultivated on collagen type II and in the absence of U0126 was significantly higher than those cultivated on collagen type II and treated with U0126. After a culture period of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 h, the total number of treated chondrocytes grown on collagen type II was reduced by about 13% (p = 0.06), 35% (p = 0.009), 42% (p = 0.01), 55% (p = 0.008), 64% (p = 0.006), 66% (p = 0.002), and 71% (p = 0.005) compared with those cultivated on collagen type II and in the presence of IGF-I (Fig.1).Figure 1Effects of U0126 on chondrocyte adhesion to collagen type II. Serum-starved human chondrocytes were cultured on glass coverslips coated with collagen type II stimulated with IGF-I and then treated with U0126 or left untreated in serum-free medium for 14 h. The adherent chondrocytes were quantified every hour by scoring cells from three different microscopic fields. The attachment assay revealed that chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II in absence of U0126 show a significantly higher density of chondrocyte adhesion from the beginning of cultivation compared with those cultivated on collagen type II with treatment with U0126. The mean values and S.D. from three independent experiments are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 2A shows an untreated human chondrocyte cultured on collagen type II and stimulated with IGF-I. Typical cartilage cells were mainly round to oval, contained a well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, a large Golgi apparatus, and other organelles or structures, such as mitochondria and small vacuoles. The nucleus was large and round, with minimal heterochromatin. The cells formed a pericellular freshly matrix, which was closely attached to the cell membrane. Cytoplasmatic processes were present. In contrast, a representative chondrocyte from an U0126-treated culture (Fig. 2 B) had a cellular morphology typical of apoptosis, with nuclear changes including chromatin condensation into dense areas along the nuclear membrane and nuclear fragmentation. The cellular membrane was irregular (bleb formation), and cytoplasmic vacuoles (dilatation of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) can be seen. Human chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II with exposure to IGF-I undergo apoptosis after treatment with U0126. Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies against cellular factors involved in apoptosis showed that treated chondrocytes were active caspase-3 positive (Fig.3). In addition, to verify that the U0126-induced increase of chondrocyte apoptosis is dose-dependent, serum-starved human chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II were treated with various concentrations of U0126 (0.1, 1, 10 μm) and immunolabeled with anti-active caspase-3 antibodies. The results showed a marked dose-dependent increase in induction of activated caspase-3 in chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II after 1 h (Fig. 3,B–D). In contrast, control cultures of chondrocytes treated with IgG maintained their nuclear morphology throughout the culture period (Fig. 3 A). The total number of caspase-3 positive chondrocytes grown on collagen type II, treated with IGF-I was increased in the presence of 0,1 μm U0126 by about 27% (p = 0.0076), of 1 μm U0126 by 55% (p = 0.094), and of 10 μm U0126 by about 74% (p = 0.095) compared with those cultivated on collagen type II, treated with IGF-I and in the absence of U0126. It has been shown that a reduction in the Erk signaling pathway stimulates the apoptotic pathway in different cell types (26Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 1997; 7: 67-74Google Scholar). For this reason, we examined whether the inhibition of Erk1/2 activity plays a role in transmitting the apoptotic signals in human chondrocytes. Anti-pan Erk1/2 antibody recognizes both inactive and active forms of Erk1/2 and indicates the expression level of total Erk1/2. Anti-phospho-Erk1/2 recognizes only phosphorylated Erk1/2 and indicates the activation of Erk1/2. Western blot analysis with anti-activated Erk1/2 from chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II stimulated with IGF-I in the presence of 1 μm U0126 demonstrated a significant decrease in Erk phosphorylation (44-kDa band completely abolished), compared with chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II stimulated with IGF-I and in the absence of U0126 (Fig.4 B). In contrast, Western blot analysis with a pan-Erk antibody, which recognizes both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Erk1 and 2, did not change in response to U0126 treatment (Fig. 4 A). Densitometric analysis of the results from immunoblotting performed in triplicate from adhesion of IGF-I-treated chondrocytes to collagen type II with antibodies against phospho-Erk1/2 showed that in the presence of 0.1 μm U0126 the relative Erk1/2 proteins expression had fallen by 43%/51% (p = 0.002/p = 0.01), in the presence of 1 μm U0126 the relative Erk1/2 proteins expression had fallen by 89%/99,9% (p = 0.0063/p = 0.0048), and in presence of 10 μm U0126 the relative Erk1/2 proteins expression had fallen by 97%/99.9% (p = 0.0019/p = 0.0031) (compared with adhesion of untreated chondrocytes to collagen type II). Cleavage of the 116-kDa polypeptide PARP to its characteristic 85-kDa fragment is considered as a marker of apoptosis (27Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell.. 1995; 81: 801-809Google Scholar, 28Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Strohm M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 40974-40980Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis with antibody against PARP reveals that PARP proteolysis increased in chondrocytes cultured on collagen type II stimulated with IGF-I and treated with various concentrations of U0126 (Fig.5). Densitometric analysis of the results showed a significant increase in proteolysis of PARP in response to as little as 0.1 μm U0126. PARP cleavage activity increased with increasing concentration of U0126 in culture. Taken together, these results indicate that the proteolysis of PARP by U0126 is dose-dependent. Signaling by integrins or transmembrane G proteins leads to activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway. Erk1/Erk2, a downstream kinase of MAPK pathway, regulates the expression of various transcription factors. Activation of MAPK pathway may be a mechanism by which integrins regulate gene expression (6Svoboda K.K.H. Microsc. Res. Tech... 1998; 43: 111-122Google Scholar). This study addresses the important role of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway in the stimulation of human chondrocyte differentiation. In a previous study (7Shakibaei M. John T. de Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 615-623Google Scholar), we could show that activation of MAPK pathway regulates the activity of a number of intracellular signaling proteins through phosphorylation. We demonstrated that collagen binding integrins and activated IGF-I receptor coimmunoprecipitate with intracellular signaling adaptor proteins such as Src-homology collagen, and this common target forms the Src-homology collagen/Grb2/Erk-complex leading to Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway activation (7Shakibaei M. John T. de Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 615-623Google Scholar). We suggested that this mechanism most likely prevents chondrocyte dedifferentiation to fibroblast-like cells and chondrocyte death. To investigate the consequences of inhibition of MAP kinase pathway, we used a specific inhibitor of the MAPK signaling pathway, U0126, which can inhibit the phosphorylation and activation of the Erk1/Erk2 in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated that specific inhibition of Erk1/Erk2 resulted in activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in human chondrocytes in vitro. Therefore the specific inhibition of Ras-mitogen activated kinase leads to apoptosis because activation of caspase-3 and cleaving of PARP are common features of apoptosis (27Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell.. 1995; 81: 801-809Google Scholar, 28Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Strohm M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 40974-40980Google Scholar). After 1 h of treatment with U0126, we found caspase-3 labeling in the nucleus of chondrocytes. In fact, it is suggested according to recent experiments that pro-caspase-3 is localized in mitochondria and cytoplasm but activated caspase-3 is localized in cytoplasm and nucleus (29Samali A. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett... 1998; 431: 167-169Google Scholar, 30Mancini M. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 140: 1485-1495Google Scholar). Caspase-3 has been reported to be translocated to the nucleus during apoptosis (31Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ... 1999; 6: 644-651Google Scholar). It is known that activated caspase-3 cleaves PARP into an NH2-terminal 24-kDa fragment containing the DNA-binding domain and an about 85-kDa COOH-terminal fragment containing the automodification and catalytic domains, and PARP cleavage seems to be characteristic of later “irreversible” stages of apoptosis (32Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M. Exp. Cell Res... 1997; 232: 313-321Google Scholar). This was used to distinguish apoptotic and necrotic cell death (15Shah G.M. Shah R.G. Poirier G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1996; 229: 838-844Google Scholar). According to other investigators (32Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M. Exp. Cell Res... 1997; 232: 313-321Google Scholar), the PARP cleavage product was accompanied by the reduction of intact PARP. Caspase-3, in its activated form is the main cause of apoptotic modification, such as PARP degradation. Intact PARP inhibits endonucleases that cleave DNA during apoptosis (33Tanaka Y. Yoshihara K. Itaya A. Kamiya T. Koide S.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1984; 259: 6579-6585Google Scholar). At the moment, one can only speculate about the particular mechanisms leading to caspase-3 activation. As mentioned above Erk1/Erk2 translocates into the nucleus and regulates the activities of several nuclear transcription factors. Inhibition of Erk1/Erk2 prevents translocation of it into the nucleus, because of that the expression of genes that code for proapoptotic proteins may increase or genes that code for antiapoptotic proteins may be repressed. Interruption of the MAPK pathway by inhibition of Erk1/Erk2 may also prevent the inactivation of proapoptotic factors as previously described (34Gebauer G. Peter A.T. Onesime D. Dhanasekaran N. J. Cell. Biochem... 1999; 75: 547-554Google Scholar). Indeed, they have further reported that apoptosis correlated with a reduced activity of Erk signaling for ovarian granulosa cells. A group of proteins regulating apoptosis are members of the Bcl2 superfamily, which comprises a large number of pro- and antiapoptotic molecules mainly located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and therefore partly inducing mitochondrial changes, e.g.cytochrome c release (35Zhai D. Huang X. Han X. Yang F. FEBS Lett... 2000; 472: 293-296Google Scholar, 36Yang J. Liu X. Kapil B. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science (Wash D. C.).. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Google Scholar). The ratio of pro- (Bax, Bak, Bid, Bad … ) versus antiapoptotic (Bcl2, Bclxl, Bclw …), Bcl2 superfamily members determines how cells respond to death signals (35Zhai D. Huang X. Han X. Yang F. FEBS Lett... 2000; 472: 293-296Google Scholar). In osteoarthritic cartilage the expression of Bcl2 is lower than in healthy cartilage (37Kim H.A. Lee Y.J. Seong S.C. Choe K.W. Song Y.W. J. Rheumatol... 2000; 27: 455-462Google Scholar). Bcl2 is also down-regulated in serum-free cultured human articular chondrocytes (38Horton W.E. Feng L. Adams C. Matrix Biol... 1998; 17: 107-115Google Scholar) and in articular chondrocytes in transgenic mice lacking the expression of type II collagen (39Yang C. Li S.-W. Helminen H.J. Khillan J.S. Bao Y. Prockop D.J. Exp. Cell Res... 1997; 235: 370-373Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that pathological conditions that cause degradation of cartilage may induce apoptosis (40Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo F. Arthritis Rheum... 1998; 41: 284-289Google Scholar, 41Hollander A.P. Pidoux I. Reiner A. Rorabeck C. Bourne R. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest... 1995; 96: 2859-2869Google Scholar). It seems that chondrocyte apoptosis is involved in several cartilage diseases,e.g. osteoarthritis (37Kim H.A. Lee Y.J. Seong S.C. Choe K.W. Song Y.W. J. Rheumatol... 2000; 27: 455-462Google Scholar, 40Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo F. Arthritis Rheum... 1998; 41: 284-289Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (42Kim H.A. Song Y.W. Arthritis Rheum... 1999; 42: 1528-1537Google Scholar), chondrodysplasias, and chondrosarkomas (38Horton W.E. Feng L. Adams C. Matrix Biol... 1998; 17: 107-115Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis may also result from the inappropriate response of chondrocytes to catabolic and anabolic stimuli from mitogens, i.e. growth factors and hormones (43Wang F.-L. Connor J.R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Kumar S. Zou C. Lark M.W. Gowen M. Nuttal M.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage.. 2000; 8: 161-169Google Scholar). The effects of particular growth factors (e.g. IGF-I) are mediated by MAPK pathway (7Shakibaei M. John T. de Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 615-623Google Scholar). It was found that the mRNA of a special protein Egr-1 (early growth response-1) was significantly down-regulated in samples from osteoarthritic cartilage. The Egr-1 protein binds to a specific GC-rich sequence in the promotor region of many target genes hence regulating their expression (43Wang F.-L. Connor J.R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Kumar S. Zou C. Lark M.W. Gowen M. Nuttal M.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage.. 2000; 8: 161-169Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that interruption of integrin/extracellular matrix interactions especially between integrins and collagen type II results in apoptosis of chondrocytes (10Cao L. Lee V. Adams M.E. Kiani C. Zhang Y. Hu W. Young B.B. Matrix Biol... 1999; 18: 343-355Google Scholar, 39Yang C. Li S.-W. Helminen H.J. Khillan J.S. Bao Y. Prockop D.J. Exp. Cell Res... 1997; 235: 370-373Google Scholar). It is important to know the apoptosis pathways of chondrocytes because inhibition of chondrocyte apoptosis may be of therapeutic value after cartilage injury and in arthritis. Apoptosis is also important in physiological conditions such as chondrogenesis and during enchondral ossification. It was recently reported (44Lee K.K. Tang M.K. Yew D.T. Chow P.H. Yee S.P. Schneider C. Brancolini C. Dev. Biol... 1999; 207: 14-25Google Scholar) that growth-arrest-specific gene 2 (gas 2) might play an important role in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. They observed further that exactly at the same time when mesenchymal cells of mouse limb bud interdigital tissues die by apoptosis, the gene product of gas 2 was cleaved by caspases and suggested that caspase-3 might be involved in gas 2 cleavage. Expression of gas 2is coupled to increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, it has been suggested that apoptosis of chondrocytes during development may control chondrocytes number in cartilage tissue (45Farnum C.E. Wilsman N.J. J. Orthop. Res... 1989; 7: 654-666Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that chondrocytes underwent apoptosis after treatment with U0126, a novel inhibitor of MEK1/2, suggesting that MAP kinase pathway has a regulatory function in chondrocytes differentiation and survival. We are indebted to Dr. A. Scheid for reviewing the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2072372914,"The serine/threonine kinase Mst1, a mammalian homolog of the budding yeast Ste20 kinase, is cleaved by caspase-mediated proteolysis in response to apoptotic stimuli such as ligation of CD95/Fas or treatment with staurosporine. Furthermore, overexpression of Mst1 induces morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in human B lymphoma cells. Mst1 may therefore represent an important target for caspases during cell death which serves to amplify the apoptotic response. Here we report that Mst1 has two caspase cleavage sites, and we present evidence indicating that cleavage may occur in an ordered fashion and be mediated by distinct caspases. We also show that caspase-mediated cleavage alone is insufficient to activate Mst1, suggesting that full activation of Mst1 during apoptosis requires both phosphorylation and proteolysis. Another role of phosphorylation may be to influence the susceptibility of Mst1 to proteolysis. Autophosphorylation of Mst1 on a serine residue close to one of the caspase sites inhibited caspase-mediated cleavage in vitro. Finally, Mst1 appears to function upstream of the protein kinase MEKK1 in the SAPK pathway. In conclusion, Mst1 activity is regulated by both phosphorylation and proteolysis, suggesting that protein kinase and caspase pathways work in concert to regulate cell death."

Mutant but not wild-type human PS1 (i) lowered the excitotoxic threshold for kainic acid in vivo, (ii) facilitated hippocampal long-term potentiation in brain slices, and (iii) increased glutamate-induced intracellular calcium levels in isolated neurons. Prominent higher calcium responses were triggered by thapsigargin and bradykinin, indicating that mutant PS modulates the dynamic release and storage of calcium ions in the endoplasmatic reticulum. In reaction to glutamate, overfilled Ca2+ stores resulted in higher than normal cytosolic Ca2+ levels, explaining the facilitated long-term potentiation and enhanced excitotoxicity. The lowered excitotoxic threshold for kainic acid was also observed in mice transgenic for mutant human PS2[N141I] and was prevented by dantrolene, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum.

Presenilins (PS) contain 6 to 8 transmembrane domains and are predominantly confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar toCaenorhabditis elegans sel-12 andspe-4, PS might function in signal transmission and intracellular transport (5Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H.

This duality is not explained by an increased production of Aβ, the proposed primary defect in EOFAD, although perturbation of intracellular fluxes of calcium ions could be the main problem in sporadic AD (9Mattson M.P.

The profound repercussions for diagnosis and therapy of the exact mechanisms in AD are evident. To study the pathological mechanismin vivo, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress human mutant PS. Very unlike humans, EOFAD mutant PS1 or PS2 transgenic mice show no strong phenotype or pathological defects. Only in combination with human APP do mutant PS increase the production of Aβ, resulting in more amyloid plaques earlier in life (4Selkoe D.J.

This finding enforced our ongoing analysis of PS1 and PS2 transgenic mice, focusing on glutamate-mediated neurotransmission, thought to be compromised in AD patients (25Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied three paradigms that yield converging and convincing evidence for disrupted neuronal calcium ion homeostasis by mutant PS. The seizure threshold for the excitotoxin kainic acid (KA) was lower, whereas neuronal damage in the hippocampus was prevented by dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium ion release from the ER. Standard hippocampal LTP was normal in PS1 transgenic mice as opposed to APP transgenic mice (26Moechars D. Dewachter I. Lorent K. Reverse D. Baekelandt V. Naidu A. Tesseur I. Spittaels K.

The doses of KA injected intraperitoneally were established in preliminary experiments to elicit seizures reproducibly with only moderate neuronal damage. Mice were observed for 2 h postinjection, and the frequency and intensity of seizures were rated in seven stages: lethargy, rigid posture, head bobbing or circling, clonic seizure, rearing alone or with falling, tonic-clonic seizures, and death. Pretreatment with dantrolene (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal) was for 30 min prior to injection of KA (30Berg M. Bruhn T. Frandsen A. Schousboe A. Diemer N.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Histology for hippocampal damage was done 24 h after KA injection on perfused and fixed brains (4% paraformaldehyde) dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl violet for hippocampal damage and scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (31Morrison R.S. Wenzel H.J. Kinoshita Y. Robbins C.A. Donehower L.A.

Sections were scored blind and independently by two investigators. Transverse vibratome sections (400 μm) were at all times bathed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid,i.e. 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.24 mmKH2PO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Electrophysiological recordings, done at least 3 h after dissection to allow recovery, were made with bipolar tungsten microelectrodes to stimulate Schaeffer's collaterals. Evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded in CA1 with low resistance (2 megohm) glass microelectrodes filled with 2m NaCl. Test stimuli were 0.1-ms constant voltage pulses delivered every 30 s at an intensity sufficient to evoke an ∼33% maximal response. LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation either 2 trains of 1-s pulses of 100 Hz separated by 20 s with each pulse 0.2 ms (strong stimulation), or a single train of 0.4 s, 100 Hz, with each pulse 0.1 ms (weak stimulation). The slope of fEPSP (mV/ms) was averaged from four consecutive responses. Paired-pulse facilitation was measured by the relative ratio of the slope of the second to the first fEPSP. Neurons from adult mouse hippocampi (32Kay A.R. Wong R.K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1986; 16: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) were dissociated from sections (200 μm) incubated at 32 °C in oxygen-saturated buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm PIPES, 25 mm glucose (pH 7.0) containing 0.8 mg/ml trypsin) for 90 min. Slices were rinsed, triturated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with fire-polished glass pipettes, and plated on polylysine-coated coverslips. Neurons were allowed to attach, and the medium was replaced by HEPES-buffered saline used for dye loading and recording. Primary hippocampal neurons from newborn mice were plated on astrocyte monolayers treated with the antimitotic agents 5-flouro-2-deoxyuridine (8.1 mm) and uridine (20.4 mm). Astrocyte feeder layers were prepared from the spinal cords of newborn mice by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation with trypsin. Cells were suspended in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were plated (3 × 103 cells/well) in 4-well cluster plates on coverslips coated with polylysine and collagen. Hippocampi from newborn mice were dissociated with papain (25 units/ml) activated with cysteine (2 mm) in DMEM for 60 min at 37 °C before transfer to DMEM with fetal calf serum (5%), N2 supplement, and antibiotics. Cells were triturated and plated on astrocyte feeder layers. After attachment (3–6 h after plating), the medium was changed to neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.). Experiments were performed on neurons cultured for 19–21 days in Locke's buffer, i.e. 154 mmNaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Cytoplasmatic calcium was measured by fluorescence ratio imaging with acetoxymethyl-fura 2 (fura-2/AM). For dye loading, cells on coverslips were incubated in Locke's buffer with Fura-2/AM (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and imaged under an upright microscope. Average intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual neurons was calculated from fluorescence using a digital imaging system (Till Photonics, Munich, Germany). Measurements were acquired at 1–3-s intervals at dual excitation wavelengths, and digital fluorescence images were constructed. [Ca2+]i was determined for each pixel in the frame with fluorescence intensities over a given threshold and using the relation [Ca2+]i =K d[(R −R min)/(R max −R)](F0/Fs) (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M.

For each construct, 2–6 independent founders were generated, and the selection of strains was based on human transgene mRNA and protein levels in brain (results not shown). Human PS transgenic proteins were present at levels similar to endogenous murine PS1 in wild-type mouse brain, indicating that saturating replacement was effective (see Refs. 1Dewachter I.

KA elicited significant higher seizure activity for the same dose in 3 independent strains of mutant transgenic mice, i.e. 2 strains of PS1[A246E] and the PS2[N141I] strain.

Although β2-integrins play an indisputable role in adhesion of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) to endothelium, we show here that β1- and β3-integrins but not β2-integrin are essential for the adhesion to and migration on extracellular matrix molecules of the endothelial cell basement membrane and subjacent interstitial matrix. Mouse wild type and β2-integrin null PMN and the progranulocytic cell line 32DC13 were employed in in vitro adhesion and migration assays using extracellular matrix molecules expressed at sites of extravasation in vivo, in particular the endothelial cell laminins 8 and 10. Wild type and β2-integrin null PMN showed the same pattern of ECM binding, indicating that β2-integrins do not mediate specific adhesion of PMN to the extracellular matrix molecules tested; binding was observed to the interstitial matrix molecules, fibronectin and vitronectin, via integrins α5β1 and αvβ3, respectively; to laminin 10 via α6β1; but not to laminins 1, 2, and 8, collagen type I and IV, perlecan, or tenascin-C. PMN binding to laminins 1, 2, and 8 could not be induced despite surface expression of functionally active integrin α6β1, a major laminin receptor, demonstrating that expression of α6β1 alone is insufficient for ligand binding and suggesting the involvement of accessory factors. Nevertheless, laminins 1, 8, and 10 supported PMN migration, indicating that differential cellular signaling via laminins is independent of the extent of adhesion. The data demonstrate that adhesive and nonadhesive interactions with components of the endothelial cell basement membrane and subjacent interstitium play decisive roles in controlling PMN movement into sites of inflammation and illustrate that β2-integrins are not essential for such interactions."

Therefore, we investigated the direct function of osteopontin in bone resorption using an organ culture system. The amount of 45Ca released from the osteopontin-deficient bones was not significantly different from the basal release from wild type bones.

Osteoclastic bone resorption is a key event in the pathophysiology of osteopenic diseases such as osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism. Osteoclastic bone resorption involves a number of sequential events, including differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. These processes are regulated both by key cytokines and hormones interacting with various cell surface receptors and by interactions of osteoclast precursors with osteoblasts/stromal cells (1Hofbauer L.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 141: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Roodman G.D. Exp.

The αvβ3 integrin is a major receptor on the osteoclast that can interact with RGD sequence-containing ligands such as osteopontin and vitronectin (4Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). It possibly promotes osteoclast attachment to bone and, when engaged by either immobilized or soluble ligands, stimulates signaling pathways that regulates osteoclast migration and function. Bone matrix consists of about 90% type I collagen and about 5% noncollagenous proteins. Among these noncollagenous proteins, at least five proteins, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and vitronectin, contain RGD sequences that can be recognized by some integrins (5Rodan S.B.

These noncollagenous bone proteins are candidate ligands for the αvβ3 integrin expressed on the osteoclasts. In vitro data suggest that the β3 integrin subunit is involved in the attachment of osteoclasts to osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, whereas the β1 integrin subunit is responsible for the attachment of these cells to fibronectin (9Engleman V.W. Nickols G.A. Ross F.P. Horton M.A. Griggs D.W. Settle S.L. Ruminski P.G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2284-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).

The signaling pathways stimulated by the integrin lead to modulation of cytoskeletal reorganization via regulatory molecules such as gelsolin (12Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Silva M. Alvarez U.

Ridall A.L. McKee M.D. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 167-181Google Scholar), the immune system (16Weber G.F. Cantor H.

Rec. 1996; 245: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the role of osteopontin in bone has not yet been fully elucidated. Recently, osteopontin-deficient mice and osteopontin/vitronectin double-null mutant mice have been created (27Rittling S.R. Matsumoto H.N. McKee M.D. Nanci A. An X.R. Novick K.E. Kowalski A.J.

Although these animals show normal development, we recently found that the lack of osteopontin makes osteopontin-deficient mice resistant to ovariectomy-induced bone resorption in vivo, in an established animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis (29Yoshitake H.

However, the mechanism through which osteopontin deficiency protects bone is not understood. Namely, whether osteopontin deficiency directly causes a reduction in bone resorption or not has yet been known. To elucidate the mechanism of osteopontin action, we investigated bone resorption in organ cultures in which osteoclastic activity was stimulated by PTH. 1The abbreviations used are:PTHparathyroid hormoneRANKLreceptor activator of NF-κB ligandM-CSFmacrophage-colony stimulating factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineα-MEMα-modified minimum essential mediumFBSfetal bovine serumRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reactionCASCRK-associated substrateTRAPtartrate-resistant acid phosphataseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasebpbase pair(s) parathyroid hormone receptor activator of NF-κB ligand macrophage-colony stimulating factor phosphate-buffered saline α-modified minimum essential medium fetal bovine serum reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction CRK-associated substrate tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase base pair(s) Recombinant soluble RANKL was provided by Snow Brand Milk Products Co.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine M-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human PTH was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and was dissolved in 1 mm acetic acid containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Co.-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The osteopontin-deficient mice were produced as described by Rittling et al. (28Liaw L. Birk D.E. Ballas C.B. Whitsitt J.S. Davidson J.M. Hogan B.L. J. Clin Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Either wild type or osteopontin-deficient mice at the ages of 3–10 months in a background of 129/S3 × C57BL/6 F2 were mated, and 17- or 18-day pregnant (dated from time of sperm-positive vaginal smears) mice were injected with 50 μCi of45Ca (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) as calcium chloride as described previously (31Witty J.P. Foster S.A. Stricklin G.P. Matrisian L.M. Stern P.H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 24 h later, the 18- or 19-day post coitum embryos were removed, and the radii and ulnae were dissected out under a binocular microscope. The cartilaginous ends of the long bones were cut off, and the shafts were rinsed in PBS with antibiotics. The bone shafts were cultivated on pieces of filter membrane (Millipore) placed in a 96-well plate (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) containing 50 μl of α-modified minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 5% serum prepared from the mother mice of the corresponding genotype. The bones were preincubated for 1day, and then they were subsequently cultured in fresh media for 6 days under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, at 37 °C with one change of the half of medium on day 3. In each experiment, bones from the right and left side of the embryos were collected. The bone from one side was used as an experimental group and treated with either PTH (10−7m) or soluble RANKL (100 ng/ml) plus M-CSF (10 ng/ml), and the other was used as untreated control. When the culture terminated, the amount of 45Ca released from the bones into the medium was measured by counting the radioactivity in the medium. The radioactivity in the media was quantified using a scintillation counter. Although fetal bovine serum (FBS) has been used in the organ culture system, we replaced FBS with mouse serum obtained from the mothers at the time of sacrifice; this was to exclude the influence by the possible presence of osteopontin in FBS. Therefore, the radioactivities in the mother's serum used for the cultures were also examined to estimate the background levels. The bone-resorbing activity was estimated using the culture media taken on day 6 of the organ cultures according to the following formula. Typically, the amount of radioactivity in the mother mouse's serum was less than 10% of the amount released from the bone as follows: 45Ca released into 50 μl of medium = (45Ca activity in 20 μl of sample medium × 2.5 − 45Ca activity in 2.5 μl (5%) serum sample). Values in calcium 45 counts in dpm at the 6-day period of contralateral side limb bones, which were treated with vehicle, were defined as 100%. The equation is as follows. The calcium 45 counts in dpm at the 6-day period from bone cultures treated with PTH or RANKL were divided by the calcium 45 counts released into the cultures of vehicle-treated bone specimens. The bones cultured in the presence or absence of RANKL and M-CSF for 6 days were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by soft x-ray examination using FUJI industrial FR film (Minami-Asigara City, Kanagawa, Japan). The distance between the anode to film was set to be 540 mm, and the exposure time, current, and voltage were 120 s, 3 mA, and 15 kV, respectively. The radiographs of the bones were subjected to densitometry, which was based on the digitalization of the image pixels whose intensity was coded on the gray scale with 256 levels (corresponding to 8 bits) using a digital image processor. The threshold was set at level 50 of the 256 gray scale. The number obtained by integration of the counts of the levels of the density scales (over 50) was divided by the area of bone to yield bone density. To make sure that the comparisons of relative bone density by digital morphometric analysis was not influenced by the differences in bone density at different anatomical sites, we have compared the entire bone of the forelimbs of the mice used for the organ cultures for this quantification. Thus, in doing this type of analysis, the x-ray picture of the whole cultured bone was taken, and the density of the whole cultured bone was measured. The values for that density were normalized against the size (area) of the bones. Spleens from 12-month-old osteopontin-deficient mice or wild type mice were used as described (32Lee M.Y. Lottsfeldt J.L. Fevold K.L. Blood. 1992; 80: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to make a suspension of spleen cells in α-MEM containing 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, spleen cells were squeezed out through the opening of the capsule made at the distal end of the spleen, were subjected to pipetting, and were spun down to form a pellet. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold double-distilled water for less than 10 s to remove reticulocytes, immediately resuspended in 10 ml of medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and spun down. The cells were resuspended again in FBS-supplemented medium and filtered through a cell strainer before estimating the viable cell number based on trypan blue exclusion method using one volume of an aliquot of the cell suspension mixed with 3 volumes of the dye solution. Spleen cells at 3.5 × 105 cells/cm2 were plated into 6-well plates (Corning Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) and were cultured in the presence of 30 ng/ml soluble RANKL and 10 ng/ml M-CSF. Cells were maintained (under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, at 36 °C) in 4.0 ml of α-MEM/FBS for up to 11days. Following incubation for the appropriate period, the cultures were fixed and stained histochemically for the osteoclast-associated enzyme TRAP (30Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K.

A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar). TRAP-positive multinucleated (cells containing more than three nuclei) cells were counted at 100× magnification in 40 rectangular fields of 41.6 mm2 in each of the wells. In separate cultures, spleen cells were cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml soluble RANKL and 30 ng/ml M-CSF on dentin slices placed in a 96-well plate in the media supplemented with 5% wild type serum or osteopontin-deficient mice serum. Some cells were subjected to RNA isolation and PCR analyses. For immunofluorescence examinations, spleen cells were prepared as described (32Lee M.Y. Lottsfeldt J.L. Fevold K.L. Blood. 1992; 80: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured on glass coverslips. On the next day of the plating, the cells on the coverslips were rinsed with PBS twice and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were rinsed with PBS twice and were subjected to membrane permeabilization for 2 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. After rinsing with PBS twice, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding of antibodies. Then the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1:200 dilution of anti-CAS or Src antibodies followed by the treatment with second antibodies conjugated with Alexa to visualize the fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence (33Furuya K. Nakamoto T. Shen Z.J. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Hirai H. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cells were subsequently stained for actin-fibers by using rhodamin-phalloidin (Molecular Probe Inc.) and were also stained for TRAP. At the end of the culture period of PTH experiments, bones were rinsed in PBS, fixed for 7 days in 4% paraformaldehyde acid, and decalcified by 10% EDTA, pH 7.4, for 3 days. Serial sections were prepared from paraffin blocks at 7-μm thickness and were stained for TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) activity, with Alcian blue for counter-staining. The TRAP-positive cells with more than three nuclei were counted using fifteen 7-μm-thick serial sections from each bone. Each of the fifteen sections was taken at five-section intervals from a total of 75 sections per bone. The total number of osteoclasts per bone was obtained by summing the number in all fifteen sections. For RANKL experiments, both mononuclear and multinucleated TRAP(+) cells were counted. RT-PCR reactions were carried out according to the standard method using 10× PCR buffer (Takara, Japan), 1.25 mm dNTP, primer 3, primer 4, cDNA, and Taqpolymerase. Based on preliminary experiments, the cycle number was optimized to be 35 cycles. PCR primers for osteopontin and GAPDH were as follows. OPNEX6, 5′-TCCAATGAAAGCCATGACC-3′; OPNUNT6, 5′-GAAGAGTGAGTGAATCTGC-3′. The bands of osteopontin were 331 bp. The GAPDH primer was purchased from system Science Co. (Hokkaido, Japan). GAPDH Sense. 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; GAPDH antisense, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The bands were examined after fractionation in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The statistical significance of the data was evaluated by using Fisher's protected least significant difference or Mann-Whitney's U test. We examined whether organ cultures of bones derived from osteopontin-deficient fetal mice differed from those from wild type mice with respect to their response to PTH, which is known to activate bone resorption by osteoclasts (31Witty J.P. Foster S.A. Stricklin G.P. Matrisian L.M. Stern P.H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar). The basal levels of45Ca release from the organ cultures of the wild type and osteopontin-deficient bones were similar. As reported previously, PTH treatment increased resorption of the wild type fetal bones by about 40% as judged by the amount of 45Ca release (Fig.1). In contrast, 45Ca release from the osteopontin-deficient bones in organ culture was not enhanced by the treatment with PTH. PTH binds to receptors expressed on osteoblasts and/or stromal cells and enhances expression of membrane-bound RANKL, which in turn binds to its receptor, receptor activator of NFκB, on osteoclasts or their precursors, to enhance osteoclast development and/or osteoclast activity (35Lacey D.L.

It is also known that PTH suppresses osteopontin expression in osteoblasts (38Noda M. Rodan G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether absence of bone resorption resulting from osteopontin deficiency was between PTH and RANKL expression or downstream of RANKL. Soluble RANKL in combination with M-CSF promoted development of TRAP(+) cells in osteopontin-deficient spleen cells at levels comparable to those in wild type cells (Fig. 2). Therefore, osteopontin deficiency does not affect osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL. To examine the effect of osteopontin deficiency on RANKL-induced bone resorption, we tested whether RANKL stimulated bone resorption by measuring 45Ca release in the organ culture assay. Treatment for 6 days with soluble RANKL in combination with M-CSF enhanced 45Ca release by about 40% in wild type bones. In contrast, treatment with soluble RANKL and M-CSF did not increase45Ca release from the osteopontin-deficient bones (Fig.3).Figure 345Ca release from forelimb bones induced by RANKL/M-CSF does not occur in the absence soluble of OPN.45Ca-labeled bones were cultured in the presence of 30 ng/ml RANKL and 10 ng/ml M-CSF or vehicle for 6 days, and the levels of 45Ca in the medium were measured.

Theasterisk indicates a significant difference from the control, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate morphologically the effect of soluble RANKL and M-CSF on bones in organ culture, soft x-ray pictures of the bones were taken and bone density was quantitatively determined. The bone density of untreated group was similar between control wild type and the control osteopontin-deficient bones. The density of wild type bones was decreased by the treatment with soluble RANKL and M-CSF. However, the density of osteopontin-deficient bones was not affected by the treatment with soluble RANKL and M-CSF (Fig.4, A and B). These observations substantiated those obtained in 45Ca release assays. To obtain insight into the mechanism underlying the defect in45Ca release resulting from osteopontin-deficiency at cellular levels, we conducted a histological examination of the bones cultured for 6 days in the presence or the absence of PTH (Fig.5A). We counted TRAP-positive cells that were observed in the forelimb bones. The number of TRAP-positive cells containing three or more nuclei was similar between wild type and osteopontin-deficient bones when cultured in the absence of PTH. In wild type bones, the number of TRAP-positive cells was higher in the bones treated with PTH than that in the control (Fig.5B). However, no such increase in the number of TRAP-positive cells was observed in osteopontin-deficient bones even after culture in the presence of PTH (Fig. 5B). Similarly, RANKL treatment increased TRAP-positive cells in wild type but not in osteopontin-deficient bones in organ culture (data not shown). To estimate the effect of wild type serum, which would contain soluble osteopontin on TRAP(+) MNC formation, we cultured wild type or osteopontin-deficient spleen cells on dentin slice in the presence of soluble RANKL and M-CSF in medium dentin slices contain osteopontin (26McKee M.D. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this setting, the presence of osteopontin in wild type spleen cells cultured in the medium supplemented with wild type serum allowed RANKL-induced development of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells more efficiently than osteopontin-deficient spleen cells cultured in the medium supplemented with osteopontin-deficient mice serum (Fig.6). These observations suggest that osteoclastic precursors exist in osteopontin-deficient bone tissue but require osteopontin either from themselves and/or from the serum to mature into TRAP-positive multinucleated cells. We further tested whether RANKL regulates the expression of osteopontin gene in spleen cells. As indicated in Fig.7, RANKL and M-CSF treatment suppressed osteopontin gene expression. This is a specific effect, because GAPDH levels were not altered by the treatment with RANKL and M-CSF. This observation suggests the presence of a negative feedback system possibly to keep the balance of bone resorption. Finally, we investigated the expression and localization of signaling molecules known to be involved in regulation of osteoclastic function. The expression of Src and CAS and their intracellular localization as well as actin cytoskeleton pattern were similar between the wild type and osteopontin-deficient osteoclasts developed from the spleen cells treated with RANKL and M-CSF (Fig.8). Our experiments indicate that PTH-induced bone resorption does not occur in osteopontin-deficient bones. Although previous ovariectomy experiments indicated that osteopontin-deficiency protected bone against bone resorption, the mechanism of this protection was not clear. Our organ culture data clearly indicate that bone resorption induced by PTH in the local milieu of bone does not occur in the absence of osteopontin, indicating that the protection of bone against bone resorption was via a direct action of osteopontin in bone but not an indirect systemic effect. PTH exerts its regulatory effects on calcium homeostasis in part by stimulating the release of calcium from bone (31Witty J.P. Foster S.A. Stricklin G.P. Matrisian L.M. Stern P.H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar). This PTH-stimulated bone resorption involves at least two cell types: osteoblasts and osteoclasts (34Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar, 40Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1981; 33: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The binding of PTH to its receptors on osteoblasts initiates several events that activate osteoclasts and stimulate bone resorption (34Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar, 40Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1981; 33: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). These include enhancement of RANKL expressions, which promote both the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast precursors and the activation of mature osteoclasts (41Kong Y.Y. Yoshidam H. Sarosi I. Tan H.L. Timms E. Capparelli C. Morony S. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Van G Itie A. Khoo W. Wakeham A. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Mak T.W. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M.

We therefore investigated which PTH-induced events were deficient in the absence of osteopontin. We observed that soluble RANKL with M-CSF did not increase45Ca release in osteopontin-deficient bones, indicating that the critical point where osteopontin is required lies downstream of RANKL action. We further investigated the cellular basis for the mechanism of protection against bone resorption by osteopontin deficiency and found that, in parallel to the requirement for osteopontin in bone resorption induced by PTH in a bone organ culture system, the increase in osteoclast number in the bones in organ cultures in response to PTH treatment also required osteopontin. We also observed that osteopontin-deficient spleen cells or bone marrow cells could give rise to osteoclasts in vitro in the presence of vitamin D (27Rittling S.R. Matsumoto H.N. McKee M.D. Nanci A. An X.R. Novick K.E. Kowalski A.J. Noda M. Denhardt D.T. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) or RANKL and M-CSF (Fig. 2). The osteoclasts developed from either wild type or osteopontin-deficient spleen cells by the treatment with RANKL revealed similar expression and localization of signaling and attachment molecules including Src, CAS, vinculin, and actin. These results indicate that the development of osteoclasts per seis not impaired in osteopontin-deficient bones; rather the specific signaling pathways activated by PTH and RANKL, resulting in an increase in the number of osteoclasts in bone, are inhibited in the absence of osteopontin in these organ cultures. This notion was also supported by the reduction in the RANKL-induced TRAP(+)-MNC formation on the dentin slice in the osteopontin-deficient spleen cells cultured in the serum lacking osteopontin. supplemented with either wild type mouse serum or osteopontin-deficient mouse serum. Crossing combinations of the genotypes of spleen cells and those of serum may yield further information on the roles of osteopontin from the different sources. Human serum osteopontin levels range from 16 to 64 ng/ml according to Harris (39Bautista D.S. Saad Z. Chambers A.F. Tonkin K.S. O'Malley F.P. Singhal H. Tokmakejian S. Bramwell V. Harris J.F. Clin. Biochem. 1996; 29: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and our semi-quantitative measurements of mouse serum have yielded similar results (data not shown). It appears that, either as a solid phase (osteopontin coating the slide) or as a soluble protein, exogenous osteopontin can assist the formation of TRAP+ cells from osteopontin-deficient spleen cells via RANKL treatment. Therefore, endogenous production of osteopontin may not be necessary to develop TRAP+ cells at least in such in vitro situation, where osteoclastogenesis is fully activated by the presence of relatively high concentrations of RANKL and M-CSF. As mentioned above, analysis on the mechanism that requires osteopontin to convey PTH signal to induce final bone resorption revealed that osteopontin is not required in the pathway between PTH and RANKL but rather downstream of RANKL, because RANKL activation of bone resorption in the organ cultures was also impaired. Thus our current hypothesis is that PTH-induced RANKL signaling resulting in either an increase in osteoclast number and/or activation is disrupted by the absence osteopontin. To estimate the activity of osteopontin-deficient TRAP-positive cells, we examined pit formation on hydroxyapatite-coated slide glass after stimulation with 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 and dexamethasone. Significant reduction (p < 0.05) was observed in the number of pits in the case of osteopontin-deficient TRAP-positive cells compared with wild type (Y. Muguruma and M. Noda, data not shown) in two out of four independent experiments. These observations suggest that osteopontin is required for the activity of osteoclasts as well. Obviously, it is possible that the effect on resorption needs a more detailed analysis on bone or dentin to better determine whether the observed change in hydroxyapatite removal represents true changes in resorption or another change in cell dynamics such as motility and phagocytic activity. In the bone organ culture environment, which was used in our experiments, bone matrix does not contain osteopontin. Therefore, it is still possible that the absence of osteopontin in bone matrix may prevent rudimentary osteoclastic precursors derived from blood from homing and residing in bone tissue (while the bones were in the body). Because osteopontin-deficient mice have been reported to grow without any retardation, it is possible that chondroclasts, which are responsible for the resorption of calcified cartilage matrix, may be functioning normally. Based on our observation on the defects in PTH-induced bone resorption in osteopontin-deficient bones in organ culture, it is possible that osteoclasts, which resorb bones, may be more susceptible to the osteopontin deficiency in the case of situations with accelerated bone resorption. If the growth plate chondroclasts may not be affected by the absence of osteopontin, it may provide differential properties to bone and cartilage with regard to its effects on the two resorbing cells, i.e. chondroclasts and osteoclasts, respectively. It is intriguing to compare in vivo and in vitrosituations in osteopontin-deficient mice. Bone resorption appears to be normal in osteopontin-deficient mice at birth. In the organ cultures of osteopontin-deficient mice bones, PTH and RANKL signaling were not able to develop TRAP-positive multinucleated cells. It appears that certain molecules supplied from the tissues outside bones could compensate for the lack of osteopontin in in vivo situation. However, in organ cultures, such supply of compensatory molecules from tissues outside bones may not be available. Thus, as shown in the present data, osteopontin-deficient bones cannot respond to PTH and RANKL with regard to the development of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells as well as calcium 45 release. Our data also suggest that RANKL treatment suppressed osteopontin expression in spleen cell cultures, suggesting the presence of a certain negative feedback system. In conclusion, our observations indicate that osteopontin is directly required for bone resorption activated by PTH-RANKL axis via increasing the number of osteoclasts in the microenvironment of bone."

Applications of these findings to the design of potential CaM inhibitors are discussed. Understanding detailed molecular mechanisms that govern macromolecular interactions represents one of the major goals of structural biology. One of the important prerequisites for success in this line of research depends on the choice of an appropriate biological system. Calcium-dependent target recognition by calmodulin might be an ideal model system, because of its well characterized nature and its central role in cellular metabolism. Calmodulin (CaM)1 is a small, acidic, eukaryotic Ca2+-binding protein of 148 amino acid residues that is arranged into two lobes of similar size and structure (1Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol.

Each lobe consists of two EF hand helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs, and thus CaM is capable of binding two Ca2+ ions per lobe, four in total. NMR solution structures of apo-CaM reveal that Ca2+ binding leads to significant structural rearrangements of the CaM molecule (3Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1995; 2: 768-776Google Scholar, 4Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1995; 2: 758-767Google Scholar). The alignment of the helices within each lobe changes upon Ca2+ binding, resulting in the exposure of two methionine-rich hydrophobic “patches,” one in each lobe (5Vogel H.J. Zhang M. Mol. Cell Biochem... 1995; 149–150: 3-15Google Scholar, 6Yuan T. Ouyang H. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 8411-8420Google Scholar). These hydrophobic patches enable CaM in the Ca2+-loaded form (Ca2+-CaM) to interact with a number of intracellular proteins and enzymes that are involved in a wide variety of different biochemical processes (7Means A.R. VanBerkum M.F. Bagchi I. Lu K.P. Rasmussen C.D. Pharmacol. Ther... 1991; 50: 255-270Google Scholar, 8Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol... 1994; 72: 357-376Google Scholar, 9Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci.. 1998; 7: 270-282Google Scholar). CaM-binding sequences are generally 15–25 amino acids long with little amino acid sequence homology, but the majority do have the propensity to form an amphipathic α-helix with one or two aromatic or bulky hydrophobic “anchor” residues (often tryptophans) located on the hydrophobic face (10Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct... 1995; 24: 85-116Google Scholar, 11O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1990; 15: 59-64Google Scholar, 12Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J... 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar). Binding of a target peptide to Ca2+-CaM occurs via distinct conformational changes upon which the Ca2+-CaM molecule wraps around the peptide, forming a globular complex (13Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science.. 1992; 256: 632-638Google Scholar, 14Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science.. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Google Scholar, 15Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science.. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Google Scholar). This is enabled by the unwinding of the central linker region of CaM, which is actually quite flexible in solution (16Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry.. 1988; 27: 909-915Google Scholar, 17Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Google Scholar). The peptide, which is unstructured in the unbound state, forms an α-helix upon binding to CaM, and residues on the hydrophobic face of the peptide, especially the anchor residues, interact extensively with the hydrophobic patches of CaM. All interactions between CaM and the peptide are through amino acid side chains, which is unique for a protein-protein complex. It is curious how so many different target sequences with relatively little sequence homology can be bound by CaM with such high affinity. A primary reason no doubt has to be hydrophobic effects, because of the well known importance of the hydrophobic patches of CaM and their interaction with the hydrophobic face of target sequences. “Classical” hydrophobic interactions involve the favorable burial of nonpolar groups from the contact with water and are considered to be entropic in nature (18Kauzmann W. Adv. Protein Chem... 1959; 14: 1-63Google Scholar). However, in a recent calorimetric study, it was shown that binding of a CaM target peptide from smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) is driven by enthalpic not entropic factors (19Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 266: 1050-1062Google Scholar). It could be that the increase in solvent entropy is offset by other phenomena, such as the loss of mobility of some amino acid side chains (20Siivari K. Zhang M. Palmer III, A.G. Vogel H.J. FEBS Lett... 1995; 366: 104-108Google Scholar, 21Lee A.L. Kinnear S.A. Wand A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 2000; 7: 72-77Google Scholar) or the loss of backbone entropy in the target peptide as it forms an α-helix in the complex (22Yuan T. Walsh M.P. Sutherland C. Fabian H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 1446-1455Google Scholar). Enthalpic effects must also play a key role, and these could include van der Waal's interactions among the hydrophobic residues in the complex, as well as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between acidic residues on CaM and basic residues on the target peptide. Because of the promiscuous nature of CaM in its ability to bind such a wide range of target sequences, it is quite possible that the relative contribution of the various factors involved in binding could be different for different target peptides. Thus, a detailed calorimetric investigation of the binding of many different peptides to CaM is warranted. Because of the vast amount of knowledge and the pivotal importance of CaM/target recognition in eukaryotic cells, a more complete understanding of the detailed mechanism of Ca2+-dependent CaM/peptide interactions can lay down the foundation for design of specific targets and inhibitors for this and other related systems. In this paper we report the results of the direct calorimetric measurements of thermodynamics of complex formation of nine different peptides with Ca2+-CaM. These peptides were derived from the CaM-binding sequences of CaM-dependent protein kinase I (23Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Vogel H.J. Arch. Biochem.

The peptides studied are illustrated in Fig. 1. Analysis of the thermodynamic data for CaM-peptide complex formation allowed us to shed more light on the nature of physical forces underlying Ca2+-CaM/target interactions.

Melittin (MEL) was purchased from Sigma. The peptides corresponding to the CaM binding sequence of cerebellar nitric-oxide synthase (cNOS), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI), caldesmon (CaD-A, CaD-A*, CaD-B1, and CaD-B2), and the C terminus of melittin (MLC) were commercially synthesized at the Core Facility for Protein/DNA Chemistry at Queens University (Kingston, Canada). The sequences of these are shown in Fig. 1. All peptides were additionally purified on Sephasyl-Peptide C18 12 μ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) reverse-phase column attached to the AKTA system using 0–100% acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (34Richardson J.M. McMahon K.W. MacDonald C.C. Makhatadze G.I. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 12869-12875Google Scholar). The purity of peptides was >95% as judged by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. For the titrations of Ca2+-CaM with all but PDE and CaD-A* peptides, the stock solutions were dialyzed extensively against at least two changes of corresponding PIPES buffer containing 5 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, pH 7.0. In the case of the CaMKI peptide, additional experiments were performed in buffers that contained 5 mmimidazole, sodium cacodylate, or MOPS, pH 7.0, supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2. The PDE and CaD-A* peptides contain cysteine residues potentially capable of forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. To keep PDE and CaD-A* in the reduced form, these peptides were incubated for 2 h in 50 mm Tris pH 7.5 buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol followed by dialysis against 5 mmPIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, buffer containing the reducing agent 1 mm tris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine. For PDE and CaD-A* titration experiments, CaM was also dialyzed against thetris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine-containing buffer. Spectrapor CE dialysis membranes with a 1000-Da molecular mass cut-off were used for dialyses. The concentrations of stock solutions of CaM and peptides after dialysis were measured spectrophotometrically. The following molar extinction coefficients have been used: CaM, 2,900 m−1cm−1 at 276 nm; CaMKI, PDE, MEL, MLC, CaD-A, and CaD-A*, 5690 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm; and cNOS, 386 m−1 cm−1 at 258 nm. The extinction coefficients were calculated according as described (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem... 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar) taking into account the corrections for light scattering (36Winder A.F. Gent W.L. Biopolymers.. 1971; 10: 1243-1251Google Scholar). Methylation of the cysteine residue of the CaD-A* peptide was performed using methyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate, as described (37Torchinski Y.M. Sulphur in Proteins. Pergamon Press, New York1980Google Scholar). The degree of modification was checked by the reaction with the Cys-specific reagent 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 412 nm. The reaction mixture was subjected to chromatography on Sephasyl-Peptide C18 12μ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) reverse-phase column on an AKTA system using 0–100% acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The overall procedure for ITC experiments was similar to that described previously (38Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 33601-33608Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of the peptide solution at concentrations between 0.5 and 1.3 mm were injected into the cell containing Ca2+-CaM. The concentration of CaM in the cell varied between 0.01 and 0.06 mm depending on the magnitude of the observed heat effects. In the case of melittin, the titration was reversed, i.e. melittin at concentration 0.016 mm was in the cell, and CaM at concentration 0.6 mm was used in the titration syringe. This was done to avoid the heat of melittin dilution because melittin forms tetramers at high concentrations (39Wilcox W. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci... 1992; 1: 641-653Google Scholar). The blank injections of titrant into corresponding buffer were used to account for the heat of mixing and dilutions. It was found that in all cases the heat effects upon blank injections were less than 1% of the heat effect of CaM-peptide interactions. The heat of the reaction, Q, was obtained by integrating the peak after each injection of peptide ligand using ORIGIN software provided by the manufacturer. The heat of the reaction at each injection is related to the calorimetric enthalpy of binding, ΔHcal, and the other thermodynamic parameters as follows (40Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem... 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar). Q=n·[CaM]t·ΔHcal·Va2·A−A2−4·[pep]tn·[CaM]tEquation 1 where A=1+[pep]tn·[CaM]t+[pep]tn·Ka·[CaM]t,Equation 2 n is the stoichiometry of the peptide/CaM complex,Ka is the association constant, [CaM]tis the amount of calmodulin in the ITC cell with the volumeVo, and [pep]t is the total concentration of a peptide. ASA values were computed using the modeled three-dimensional structures of CaM complex with the studied peptides as described (41Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem... 1995; 47: 307-425Google Scholar). The changes in the surface area were divided into four types (41Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem... 1995; 47: 307-425Google Scholar): 1)ASAbb, the surface area of the backbone atoms C, O, N; 2) ASAarm, the aromatic surface area that is defined as all carbon atoms for Phe, Tyr, Trp except CA, CB; 3)ASAalp, the surface area for aliphatic group that includes all carbon atoms except those that are defined as backbone or aromatic; and 4) ASApol, the surface area for the polar groups that include all side chain oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms. Two different models for the calculations of the changes in ASA upon peptide/Ca2+-CaM complex formation have been used. For Type I binding, the changes in the ASA upon complex formation, ΔASA, were calculated as follows. ΔASA=ASACaM−pepti−ASACaMi−ASApepiEquation 3 whereASA CaM−pepti is the water-accessible surface of CaM-peptide complex,ASA CaMi is the water-accessible surface area of free CaM, andASA pepi is the water-accessible surface area of an unstructured peptide; superscript “i” represents one of the four type of the surface areas: backbone, polar side chains, aliphatic, and aromatic. The CaM-peptide complex was modeled according to one of the several known x-ray and NMR structures, 1CDL, which represents an x-ray structure of the smMLCK/Ca2+-CaM complex (14Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science.. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Google Scholar). The rest of the peptides were threaded into this structure using sequence alignment of Yap et al. (42Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins.. 1999; 37: 499-507Google Scholar) performed in the environment of Swiss/Protein Data Bank viewer as described (43Gribenko A.V. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol... 1998; 283: 679-694Google Scholar). Several control calculations have been performed to ensure that the threading procedure is reasonably reliable in terms of ASA calculations. The most compelling evidence for the correctness of our threading is comparison of the surface area of smMLCK/Ca2+-CaM complex calculated using Protein Data Bank entry 1CDL with the area of the complex after smMLCK was threaded into the Protein Data Bank entry 1CDM instead of the original sequence corresponding to calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The difference is very small particularly in terms of predicted heat capacity change upon complex formation, ΔCp (see Table II). This is mostly due to the fact that the peptides become largely buried upon binding to CaM.Table IIExperimental and calculated values of the heat capacity changes upon peptide/Ca2+-CaM complex formationPeptideΔASAbbΔASApolΔASAalpΔASAarmΔCp,expΔCp,calcÅ2Å2Å2Å2kJ/(mol K) 2-aThe estimated experimental error in ΔCp, exp is at least 10%.kJ/(mol K) 2-bCalculated according to the Equation 8.

Open table in a new tab The surface area of the free CaM was calculated as follows. We decided not to use the reported structural coordinates of CaM based on the fact that even small perturbations in the conformation because of the refinement procedure, crystal symmetry, and resolution significantly affect the absolute values of ASA. This might lead to erroneous results because we are looking at small difference, ΔASA, between two large numbers, ASACaM−pept andASACaM. Thus, free CaM for the purpose of ASA calculations was modeled as a sum of surfaces. ASACaM=ASACaM1–76+ASACaM76–148Equation 4 where ASACaM1–76 andASACaM76–148 are the water-accessible surfaces of the N-terminal (amino acid residues 1–76) and the C-terminal (amino acid residues 76–148) domains of CaM.ASACaM1–76 andASACaM76–148 were calculated using the coordinates of the CaM-peptide complex by simply removing the coordinates of the peptide and using only the coordinates for the residues 1–76 or 76–148, respectively. The change in the surface area calculated using the structure of unligated CaM or as a sum of isolated domains did not have significant effect on the absolute values of the ΔASA change (data not shown). The Type II binding model describes binding of the peptide to only one of the N- or C-terminal lobes of CaM. For the purpose of surface area calculations for Type II binding, hypothetical complexes were modeled as follows. The coordinates of one of the domains in the threaded structure were removed, and surface area was calculated using coordinates for the remaining peptide and another domain plus a hinge region (amino acid residues 72–86). The surface area change upon complex formation was estimated as follows. ΔASATIIN=ASACaMN−pept−ASACaMN−ASApepEquation 5 ΔASATIIC=ASACaMC−pept−ASACaMC−ASApepEquation 6 where the subscripts TIIN and TIICreflect Type II binding of peptides to N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM, respectively; ASACaMN−pept and ASACaMC−pept are the surface areas of the peptide/N-terminal domain and peptide/C-terminal domain complexes; ASACaMN andASACaMC are the surface areas of N- or C-terminal domains of CaM in the absence of the other domain; andASApep is the surface area of the unbound peptide in the fully extended conformation (see above). As a test of correctness of this model, we also performed calculations based on the NMR structure of the complex of Ca2+-CaM with a target peptide from a Ca2+ pump using Protein Data Bank entry 1CFF(44Elshorst B. Hennig M. Forsterling H. Diener A. Maurer M. Schulte P. Schwalbe H. Griesinger C. Krebs J. Schmid H. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 12320-12332Google Scholar). The peptide in this structure binds to the C-terminal domain. The surface area change upon complex formation was calculated as follows. ΔASATII=ASA1CFF−ASACaM1CFF−ASApepEquation 7 where ASA1CFF is the surface area of the CaM-peptide complex and ASACaM1CFFis the surface area of the CaM only. The results of the calculations using Equations 6 and 7 are very similar (Table II). Fig. 2 A shows representative results of calorimetric titrations of Ca2+-CaM with two different peptides, CaMKI and PDE. The interaction of CaMKI with Ca2+-CaM is exothermic. In contrast, the reaction of PDE with Ca2+-CaM is endothermic. The sum of the areas of the peaks after each injection normalized per amount of CaM in the cell represents the enthalpy of binding of a given peptide to Ca2+-CaM, ΔHcal. The experimentally measured enthalpy, ΔHcal, consists of two parts. ΔHcal=ΔHb+Δn+·ΔHionEquation 8 where ΔHb is the enthalpy of bindingper se and Δn+·ΔHion is the enthalpy of linked protonation effects (LPE). The latter arises from the fact that the pKa value(s) of one or several groups on the ligand (peptide) or macromolecule (Ca2+-CaM) can change as a result of complex formation, as has been observed in a variety of other systems (45Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valey, CA1990Google Scholar, 46Ferrari M.E. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 12896-12910Google Scholar, 47Baker B.M. Murphy K.P.

Hence, the change in the protonation upon binding can be characterized as the difference in the number of protons bound before and after complex formation, Δn+. Equation 8 provides an experimental test for LPE by measuring the binding reaction in the presence of buffers with very different enthalpies of ionization, ΔHion; a plot of ΔHcal versusΔHion will allow the estimate of Δn+. Fig. 2 B compares the experimental enthalpies, ΔHcal, of the CaMKI-Ca2+-CaM complex formation in four different buffers with different enthalpies of ionizations (51Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins.. 1998; 33: 159-166Google Scholar): sodium cacodylate (ΔHion = −4 kJ/mol), PIPES (ΔHion = 12 kJ/mol), MOPS (ΔHion = 23 kJ/mol), and imidazole (ΔHion = 36 kJ/mol). The absence of the dependence of ΔHcal on the ΔHion of the buffers shown in Fig.2 B indicates that the interactions of Ca2+-CaM with CaMKI are devoid of LPE (Δn+ is only -0.03). This conclusion is in accord with the results obtained for other peptide/Ca2+-CaM complexes (19Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 266: 1050-1062Google Scholar, 52Milos M. Schaer J.J. Comte M. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1987; 262: 2746-2749Google Scholar). Because peptide binding to Ca2+-CaM is not accompanied by LPE, most of the experiments were performed in PIPES buffers, and the measured enthalpies were considered to be entirely the enthalpies of binding,i.e. ΔHcal = ΔHb. The enthalpies of binding of eight different peptides to Ca2+-CaM measured at different temperatures are presented in the TableI. It is remarkable that there is a great variation in the enthalpies of binding ranging from +90 kJ/mol to −66 kJ/mol.Table IThermodynamics of CaM-peptide interactionsPeptideTemperatureBufferNbΔHcalKa°CkJ/molm−1CaMKI5.3PIPES0.9018.8(8.0 ± 4.0) × 10710.0PIPES0.903.3(1.6 ± 1.4) × 10715.0PIPES1.00−15.1(2.8 ± 0.6) × 10720.0PIPES1.10−33.1(2.3 ± 0.3) × 10725.01-aKa = 5.0 × 108m−1 (29).PIPES0.93−50.2(3.4 ± 0.8) × 10725.0Imidazole1.03−49.4(7.0 ± 1.0) × 10725.0Imidazole1.01−52.3(2.4 ± 0.3) × 10725.0NaCacodylate0.80−51.0(6.0 ± 1.0) × 10725.0NaCacodylate0.75−49.0(4.0 ± 0.9) × 10725.0MOPS0.93−50.6(3.2 ± 0.7) × 107cNOS5.2PIPES0.9560.7∼2.4 × 10810.0PIPES0.9243.9∼1.8 × 10815.0PIPES0.9924.3∼1.7 × 10820.0PIPES0.986.7ND25.01-bKa = 5 × 108m−1 (55, 56).PIPES1.09−11.7∼1.3 × 108PDE5.2PIPES0.9051.9∼1.6 × 10811.0PIPES0.9642.7∼1.2 × 10820.0PIPES1.0024.7∼0.9 × 10824.01-cKa = 4.5 × 106m−1 (22).PIPES0.9015.9∼1.1 × 108MEL10.1PIPES1.0090.0(3.0 ± 1.0) × 10815.0PIPES1.0877.8(1.9 ± 0.5) × 10820.01-dKa = 3.3 × 108m−1 (85).PIPES1.0962.3(3.0 ± 1.0) × 108MLC5.0PIPES0.9731.4(2.3 ± 0.4) × 10615.1PIPES0.9616.7(3.8 ± 0.5) × 10625.1PIPESND2.3NDCaD-A5.0PIPES0.93−33.1(4.1 ± 0.4) × 10610.1PIPES0.90−41.8(3.5 ± 0.2) × 10615.0PIPES0.97−49.4(3.3 ± 0.3) × 10620.0PIPES0.92−57.7(2.2 ± 0.1) × 10625.01-eKa = 1.3 × 106m−1 (24).PIPES0.90−66.1(1.4 ± 0.1) × 106CaD-A*5.0PIPES1.03−24.3(0.8 ± 0.4) × 10610.0PIPES1.03−36.0(1.0 ± 0.5) × 10617.0PIPES0.97−39.3(1.7 ± 0.8) × 10625.0PIPES0.96−49.0(1.4 ± 0.7) × 106CaD-A*-CH325.0PIPES0.90−50.6(0.4 ± 0.2) × 1061-a Ka = 5.0 × 108m−1 (29Blumenthal D.K.

Open table in a new tab Under the conditions of the ITC experiment, the binding of most peptides to Ca2+-CaM is close to stoichiometric. This can be seen in Fig. 2 A, which shows that the heat effects during initial injections are comparable and are followed by a quick disappearance of heat effects in later injections, indicating that saturation of Ca2+-CaM with the peptide has been achieved. This means that the molar concentration ratio of peptide to Ca2+-CaM at which the heat of binding on the titration curve reaches 50% of total heat corresponds to the stoichiometry of the binding. For the studied peptides this stoichiometry is essentially one molecule of peptide per one molecule of Ca2+-CaM (TableI).

The chaperone-like function of αB-crystallin helps to avoid formation of large light-scattering aggregates and possibly helps to prevent cataract in the lens. Moreover, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia, or multiple sclerosis lead to an overexpression of this protein, which makes it an object of special medical interest (2Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr.

Upon addition of 1% deoxycholic acid, the α-crystallin oligomer dissociates into tetramers (7Kantorow M. Horwitz J. van Boekel M.A. de Jong W.W. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17215-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The latter can also be formed by deletion of amino acids 1–63 in αA-crystallin (8Merck K.B. Horwitz J. Kersten M. Overkamp P. Gaestel M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed spin-labeling demonstrated that the αA-crystallin dimers are formed by subunit interactions along a highly conserved β-strand in the region of residues 109–121 (9Berengian A.R. Parfenova M. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6305-6314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This stretch of residues forms a sheet of two antiparallel β-strands that extends across the dimer interface. The oligomers of bacterial sHSPs are monodisperse and more rigid. Their gel filtration profile shows a single narrow, symmetric peak, whereas α-crystallin, αB-crystallin, or HSP27 yield broader peaks (10Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. McHaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of MjHSP16.5, a sHSP isolated from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, has been determined (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The topology of the MjHSP16.5 monomer resembles an immunoglobulin fold with a central β-sandwich of two sheets, consisting of four β-strands each. Upon dimerization, one of the sheets is extended by an additional strand contributed by the neighboring subunit (Fig.1, left panel). This fifth strand labeled β6 (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), a small stretch of five residues from 93 to 97, is part of a long loop of 19 residues (84) protruding into the structural core of the monomer. This strand is therefore crucial for the stabilization of the MjHSP16.5 dimer. A dimeric model of the α-crystallin domain has recently been generated (12Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of MjHSP16.5. The quaternary structure of the homology model and thus the dimeric interface are virtually identical to those of MjHSP16.5 displayed in Fig. 1, left panel. The loop-strand-loop motif (residues 84–102 of subunit A) interacting with strand β2 (residues 45–49 of subunit B) in MjHSP16.5 has been modeled in human αB-crystallin as a large loop lacking secondary structure (residues 104–115 of subunit A) that is adjacent to strand β2 (residues 66–70 of subunit B). The homology model (12Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) does not show contacts between residues 114–118 in subunits A and B, and this contradicts the spin-labeling results (9Berengian A.R. Parfenova M. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6305-6314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The present study is aimed at the analysis of the properties and structure of the α-crystallin domain of the human αB-crystallin. A dimeric α-crystallin domain is expressed, purified, and characterized using different biochemical and physical methods. Its quaternary structure is studied by synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering. The latter method allows us to determine overall structures of native biological macromolecules under nearly physiological conditions (13Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). Comparisons between experimental x-ray solution scattering curves and those evaluated from crystallographic structures are widely used to verify structural similarity between macromolecules in crystals and in solution (14Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. Fetler L. Vachette P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Aleshin A.E. Malfois M. Liu X. Kim C.S. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8359-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, the use of crystallographic models of individual subunits permits the building of structural models of complex particles in solution by rigid body refinement against the scattering data (16Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Gallimore J.R. Pepys M.B. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Krueger J.K. Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J.

Below, solution scattering is used to demonstrate that the quaternary structure of the α-crystallin domain dimer differs from that of sHSP from Methanococcus jannaschii. A model of the former, constructed by rigid body refinement, displays a new dimerization interface, suggesting that the α-crystallin domain may be flexible in solution. The amino acid sequence alignment between human αB-crystallin and MjHSP16.5 was used as a basis (12Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The residue Ala-57 in αB-crystallin was aligned with Gln-36 in MjHSP16.5, the N-terminal residue of the first β-strand β1. The Arg-157 in αB-crystallin was aligned with Ile-144 in MjHSP16.5, located in the last β-strand, β10. The sequence Ala-57 through Arg-157 covered the core α-crystallin domain plus an additional nine residues from the N-terminal domain. The αB-crystallin deletion mutant gene was excised from plasmid αB57+pET16b at the restriction sitesNcoI and XhoI. The gene fragment was ligated into expression vector pETM-11 at the NcoI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid was named pαB57–157. Plasmid pαB57–157 was transformed into BL21(DE3), and 1-liter expression cultures were grown in Luria Broth medium supplemented with kanamycin to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The expression was induced atA600 = 0.8 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4–6 h of induction, cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of starting buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.4). 400 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml; Sigma) were added to the cell suspension, and the suspension was stirred in an ice-water bath for 20 min. After the addition of 1 μl of benzonase (250 units/μl; Merck), the suspension was incubated at 23 °C for 10 min with constant stirring. Insoluble cellular debris was removed by sedimentation at 36,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore). At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, 25 ml of cell extract were applied on a 1-ml Hi-Trap metal-chelating column (Pharmacia), charged with 100 mm NiCl2 solution, and equilibrated with starting buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of starting buffer. For 10 column volumes, a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm imidazole was applied. The His-tagged αB57–157 fusion protein eluted at 400 mm imidazole concentration. The positive fractions were pooled, and a His6-tagged TEV-protease was added in a 100:1 ratio (w/w). The cleavage reaction was dialyzed against starting buffer at 20 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was passed through a mini-column (Bio-Rad) filled with 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), which had been equilibrated with starting buffer. The flow-through was collected and analyzed for purity on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex) stained with Coomassie Blue or silver staining methods. Protein samples were concentrated using Centricon (Millipore) filter units with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa. Protein concentrations for all measurements were determined by the Bradford method, using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The effect of the α-crystallin domain on protein aggregation was measured as described previously (19Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) at 37 °C was measured as an apparent optical density at A360using a Kontron Uvikon 922 Spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder. In a total reaction volume of 400 μl, 5 μm yeast ADH (Sigma) was incubated with varying amounts of purified α-crystallin domain or 1 μm human αB-crystallin. The reaction buffer was a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 2 mmEDTA. The optical density in the cell was recorded every 2 min. For all molar ratios, three independent experiments were conducted. A Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) equipped with ultraviolet absorption optics was used for the sedimentation velocity and the sedimentation equilibrium studies at 4 °C and at 10 °C, respectively. Protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was loaded into 12-mm double-sector aluminum cells placed in an An60 Ti rotor. For the sedimentation velocity analysis, sample volumes of 350 μl were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm. Radial scans of absorbance at 290 nm were taken at 2-min intervals. Data were analyzed to provide the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients by means of the programs DCDT (20Stafford W.F. d. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and SVEDBERG (21Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The hydrodynamic modeling was done with ULTRASCAN (22Demeler B. Saber H. Hansen J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 397-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For the sedimentation equilibrium analysis, a sample volume of 180 μl at 3 mg/ml protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was centrifuged at 26,000 rpm. Each data point measured at 297 nm was an average of 50 measurements. The solution density (1.0029 g/ml) and the partial volume of the protein (0.7217 ml/g) were calculated with ULTRASCAN, using the known buffer composition and amino acid composition of the protein. The degree of hydration was estimated based on the amino acid composition by the method of Kuntz and Brassfield (23Kuntz Jr., I.D. Brassfield T.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected using standard procedures on the X33 camera (24Koch M.H.J.

Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Meth. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The solutions were measured at protein concentrations of 5, 10, and 25 mg/ml. The scattering curves were recorded at a wavelength λ = 0.15 nm for sample detector distance 1.4 m covering the momentum transfer range 0.40 < s < 5.1 nm−1(s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for the detector response, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for concentration using the program SAPOKO. 2D. I. Svergun and M. H. J. Koch, unpublished data.The curves were extrapolated to zero concentration and merged with the data obtained at high protein concentration using standard procedures (13Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). The maximum dimension Dmax of the protein was estimated from the experimental data using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (28Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The radius of gyrationRg was evaluated using the Guinier approximation,Iexp(s) =I(0)exp(-s2Rg2/3), which is valid for (sRg) < 1.3 (13Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I.

Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) Vp was calculated from the experimental data as described previously (13Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I.

The coordinates of the crystallographic model of the HSP16.5 fromM. jannaschii were taken from the Protein Data Bank, entry1shs (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H.

Malfois and D. I. Svergun, manuscript in preparation. a modified version of the program CRYSOL (32Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2688) Google Scholar). The program takes into account the scattering from the solvation shell at the surface of the protein model. The latter is covered by a 0.3-nm-thick hydration layer with an adjustable density ρb, which may differ from that of the bulk solvent. The scattering intensity isI(s)=|Aa(s)−ρsAs(s)+δρbAb(s)|2ΩEquation 1 where Aa(s) is the scattering amplitude from the particle in vacuo, As(s) andAb(s) are, respectively, the scattering amplitudes from the excluded volume and the hydration layer, both with unitary density, δρb = ρb− ρs; and 〈 〉 stands for the average over all particle orientations (Ω is the solid angle in reciprocal space,s = (s, Ω)). Given the atomic coordinates, the program fits the experimental data using two free parameters, the excluded volume of the particle and the contrast of the hydration layer δρb, to minimize the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated curvex2=1N−1∑j=1NIcalc(sj)−Iexp(sj)σ(sj)2Equation 2 where N is a number of the experimental points, andIexp(s) and ς(s) denote the experimental intensity and its S.D., respectively. The x-ray structure of MjHSP16.5, Protein Data Bank entry 1shs (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), was used as a template for molecular modeling. The monomer of the α-crystallin domain was modeled in close structural homology to the crystal structure of MjHSP16.5, using the residues 36–144 with the exception of the dimerization motif. All models were built and energy minimized using the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.-T. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr A. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment used in the molecular modeling is identical to that of Muchowski et al. (12Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), with one exception. The largest gap in the entire alignment was reduced from eight to seven residues to optimize the interaction at the putative dimer interface (Fig.2). The α-crystallin domain corresponds to the peptide 57–157 from αB-crystallin, which was isolated after a tryptic digest of αB-crystallin (34Muchowski P.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Clark J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30190-30195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was the smallest peptide identified after trypsinization, which comprises the α-crystallin domain. With the expression of pαB57–157 and after proteolytic cleavage of the His-tagged fusion protein, the α-crystallin domain had an additional three N-terminal, vector-derived amino acids (Gly, Ala, and Met). The untagged form of the α-crystallin domain eluted with a >98% purity in the flow-through of the Ni-NTA column (Fig.3). Proper folding of the protein was confirmed by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig.4). The spectrum showed negative ellipticity with a minimum at 215 nm, typical for a β-sheet structure and in agreement with secondary structure predictions made for the α-crystallin domain of αB-crystallin (35Siezen R.J. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36De Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol.

The spectrum is the average of eight scans.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functionality of the α-crystallin domain was also confirmed by the chaperone activity assay (Fig. 5). The ADH aggregation was effectively suppressed with a 5-fold molar excess of α-crystallin domain over ADH and was comparable to the protection by wild type αB-crystallin in a ratio of ADH (5 μm):αB-crystallin (1 μm). When comparing the aggregation values of the ADH control and ADH (5 μm):α-crystallin domain (5 μm) at the 32 min time point, the control showed 100% ADH aggregation, whereas the ADH in the presence of α-crystallin domain aggregated only to 45%. At a 10-fold molar excess of ADH over α-crystallin domain, no protection of ADH aggregation was observed. The decrease of absorption for ADH (5 μm) and ADH (50 μm):α-crystallin domain (5 μm) beyond the 34 min time point was caused by precipitation of large protein aggregates in the cuvette. With an average of 32 subunits/wild type αB-crystallin molecule, the protection from aggregation per dimer was 100% at a 3.2-fold molar excess of αB-crystallin over ADH. With the α-crystallin domain dimer, a 5-fold molar excess was effective in protecting the same amount of ADH. Although the chaperone activity of the wild type αB-crystallin dimer exceeded that of the α-crystallin domain dimer by about 1.5-fold, the effectiveness of the α-crystallin domain in preventing ADH aggregation remains high. The molecular mass of the α-crystallin domain estimated from the analytical ultracentrifugation (22 ± 2 kDa) indicated that the protein is dimeric in solution. The velocity sedimentation data confirmed that the solution was monodisperse. The sedimentation coefficient 1.82 ± 0.06 (s20,W) and the hydrodynamic modeling suggested that the dimer is rather elongated with an estimated axial ratio of 1:10. The synchrotron x-ray scattering curve from the α-crystallin domain is presented in Fig. 6a. The maximum dimension of the particle was 7.0 ± 0.2 nm, and the radius of gyration = 2.27 ± 0.03 nm. The Porod volume (i.e. the excluded volume estimate) of 42 ± 3 nm3 was compatible with the expected excluded volume of a hydrated dimer and incompatible with a monomeric protein. It can thus be concluded that the α-crystallin domain is dimeric in solution, in agreement with the above-mentioned results of the analytical ultracentrifugation. The dimeric structure has been found at all protein concentrations. The comparison between the scattering curve computed from the dimeric x-ray model of the sHSP (11Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, left panel) and the experimental scattering curve is presented in Fig. 6a, fit(1Veretout F. Delaye M. Tardieu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The two curves display noticeable systematic deviations (the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated data is χ = 1.89). To check whether the data can be fitted by minor modifications of the crystallographic structure, several tentative models were generated by rigid body movements (up to ± 0.2 nm) and rotations (up to ± 10 degrees) of the second monomer. All these models yielded poor fits with χ between 1.8 and 2.5. This suggests that the quaternary structure of the α-crystallin domain of the human αB-crystallin differs from that of HSP16.5 from M. jannaschii. The focus of the molecular modeling of the αB-crystallin mutant was the generation of an interface between two subunits, which is in agreement with (i) the sequence alignment, (ii) the spin-labeling study (9Berengian A.R. Parfenova M. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6305-6314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and (iii) the general molecular interactions involved in protein stabilization and fits the experimental scattering data. In keeping with the low resolution of solution scattering, the modeling of the dimer of αB-crystallin was performed in terms of rigid body movements and rotations of the monomeric subunit derived by homology modeling from the crystal structure of MjHSP16.5. The amino acid sequence of the α-crystallin domain of human αB-crystallin and MjHSP16.5 is more than 23% identical, and more than 50% of the residues are chemically similar. Furthermore, secondary structure prediction indicated a similar arrangement of secondary structure elements in both proteins (results not shown). In the crystal structure of MjHSP16.5, the strands β5 and β7 are connected by a loop-strand-loop motif ranging from residues 84–102. Within this motif, the short strand β6 (residues 93–97) from one subunit interacts with strand β2 (residues 45–49) from the neighboring subunit. The corresponding region in αB-crystallin was modeled as a strand-turn-strand ranging from residues 105 to 116 and designated as β6.1 and β6.2. The dimerization between the monomers takes place along strand β6.2, contributed by the two subunits A and B, which built a four-stranded, antiparallel, intersubunit composite β-sheet with the following strand order: Aβ6.1-Aβ6.2-Bβ6.2-Bβ6.1. The modeled strands β6.1 and β6.2 are separated from β5 and β7 by one residue only, Glu-105 and Glu-117, respectively. Both residues are in a nonextended main chain dihedral conformation, resulting in a kink between the sheet made up by β5 and β7 and the β6.1-β6.2 sheet. The angle between the core β-sandwich and the intersubunit composite sheet varies depending on the actual main chain dihedrals of Glu-105, Glu-117, and their flanking residues. Accordingly, the dimer may have a more closed, compact or a more open, elongated shape. Five different dimer models have been tested (Fig. 6b), ranging from a dimer with an open L-shape (top; (2Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar)) to more compact structures and, finally, a V-shaped dimer (bottom; (6Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). The fits to the experimental data computed by CRYDAM are presented in Fig.6a, curves (2–6). All these models yield better fits than that provided by the crystallographic model of the MjHSP16.5 dimer (curve (1)). The most compact, V-shaped model providing the best agreement with the experimental data is also displayed in Fig. 1 (right panel) for comparison with the crystallographic model of MjHSP16.5. Probably the most intriguing functional finding in our study of the dimeric α-crystallin domain from human αB-crystallin is that the chaperone activity does not require a multimeric αB-crystallin complex. The existence of two sites of interactions between sHSP monomers has been proposed previously (39Merck K.B. De Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that after deletion of the N-terminal domain of αB-crystallin no large oligomers are formed and that the interaction site in the C-terminal domain promotes the assembly of a stable dimer. Unlike HSP16.2 fromCaenorhabditis elegans, αB-crystallin maintains chaperone-like activity without its N-terminal domain and, moreover, does not require multimeric assembly to be active (40Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity at different levels of oligomerization has also been observed for murine HSP25, a member of the mammalian sHSP family (41Ehrnsperger M. Lilie H. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The final model of the α-crystallin domain dimer in Fig. 1(right panel) provides an excellent fit to the solution scattering data in a wide angular range. A nominal resolution of the data is 1.2 nm, and details of the tertiary structure can obviously not be validated experimentally at this level of resolution, which is why we restricted ourselves to rigid body modeling. Solution scattering is rather sensitive to rigid body movements of structural domains and has successfully been used to model the quaternary structure of proteins (15Aleshin A.E. Malfois M. Liu X.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The use of rigid body modeling is justified by a high sequence homology between monomeric αB-crystallin and MjHSP16.5. Because no reasonable fit to the scattering data could be obtained in the vicinity of the crystallographic model of MjHSP16.5 (Fig. 1,left panel), the arrangement of the monomers as shown in Fig. 1 (right panel) was the only possibility to construct a sound model compatible with the spin-labeling results (9Berengian A.R. Parfenova M. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6305-6314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and with the solution scattering data. The modeling in the form of a grid search permitted us to systematically explore plausible dimeric configurations. An automated rigid body refinement would have been a better option for larger proteins (42Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. König S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in which the influence of the bound solvent scattering is less pronounced. The present study is not the first example of proteins with similar tertiary structures but totally different quaternary structures. In particular, tertiary structures of monomeric α and β chemokines (e.g. interleukin-8 and human macrophage inflammatory protein-1β) are very similar, but the dimers are formed by different sets of residues (43Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One should also mention a number of thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes (transketolase, pyruvate oxidase, and pyruvate decarboxylase) consisting of identical or nearly identical monomers with molecular masses of about 60 kDa that form very different biologically active dimers and tetramers (42Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. König S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The proposed model of the α-crystallin domain dimer displays a potentially flexible dimer interface. This flexibility may be the reason why our protein crystallization attempts were not successful, despite extensive trials. 4I. K. Feil, J. Hendle, and H. van der Zandt, unpublished results.The flexibility might also be an essential property enabling variable sizes and compositions of the multimeric complex of αB-crystallin and yielding mixed sHSP species (i.e. αA-crystallin, αB-crystallin, and HSP27) in a single hetero-oligomeric complex (44Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that the potential flexibility of the protein is problematic for crystallographic analysis but not for solution scattering modeling (the experimental scattering pattern corresponds to an average position of the monomers). The dimer interface in the proposed model contains the residue Arg-116 that causes autosomal dominant congenital cataract in humans when mutated to Cys. Circular dichroism and 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphtalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid fluorescence spectra indicate that R116C αA-crystallin is structurally different from the wild type protein (45Shroff N.P. Cherian-Shaw M. Bera S. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Arg-116 is an identically conserved residue between αA- and αB-crystallin. According to the present model, this residue plays an essential role in dimerization, and detrimental effects on the quaternary structure and biological activity can be expected after mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2040207971,"Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is distinguished from BoNT/E by longer duration of paralysis and greater potency. The proteolytic activity of BoNT/A in cultures of dissociated spinal cord neurons persists beyond 80 days, whereas BoNT/E activity persists for less than 1 day (Keller, J. E., Neale, E. A. Oyler, G., and Adler, M. (1999) FEBS Lett. 456, 137–142). This single quality of toxin activity can account for the differences observed in the duration of muscle block. In the present work we sought to understand the basis for the apparent greater potency of BoNT/A. BoNT/E cleaves a 26-amino acid fragment from the C terminus of the synaptic protein SNAP-25 whereas BoNT/A removes only nine residues creating a 197-amino acid fragment (P197) that is 95% the length of SNAP-25. We show that inhibition of neurotransmitter release by BoNT/E is equivalent to the damage caused to SNAP-25. However, synaptic blockade by BoNT/A is greater than the extent of SNAP-25 proteolysis. These findings can be explained if P197 produces an inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. A mathematical model of the experimentally determined relationship between SNAP-25 damage and blockade of neurotransmission supports this interpretation. Furthermore, neurotransmitter release following complete cleavage of SNAP-25 can be achieved by P197, but with about 5-fold less sensitivity to external Ca2+. In this case, vesicular release is restored by increasing intracellular Ca2+. These data demonstrate that P197 competes with intact SNAP-25, but is unable to initiate normal synaptic vesicle fusion in physiological concentrations of Ca2+.

Intoxication with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)1 in vivoleads to flaccid paralysis by blockade of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction (1Burgen A.S.V. Dickens F. Zatman L.J. J.

Physiol. 1954; 123: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of the toxin responsible for causing paralysis resides within the 50-kDa light chain domain (4Bandyopadhyay S. Clark A.W. DasGupta B.R. Sathyamoorthy V. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). BoNT/A and -E both cleave SNAP-25 but at distinct sites (12Schiavo G. Santucci A. Dasgupta B.R. Mehta P.P. Jontes J. Benfenati F. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Interestingly, paralysis from BoNT/A lasts for many months whereas blockade caused by BoNT/E lasts for relatively brief periods (13Sellin L.C. Kauffman J.A. Dasgupta B.R. Med. Biol. 1983; 61: 120-125PubMed Google Scholar, 14Adler M. Macdonald D.A. Sellin L.C. Parker G.W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses were proposed to account for this difference: (a) BoNT/A remains catalytically active for a longer interval than BoNT/E or, alternatively (b) the catalytic activity of both toxins is very short-term but the major SNAP-25 fragment generated by BoNT/A (P197) persists in nerve terminals and interferes with neurotransmitter release (15Eleopra R. Tugnoli V. Rossetto O. De Grandis D. Montecucco C. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The first hypothesis has been substantiated by direct demonstration of BoNT/A persistence in primary mouse spinal cord cultures, electroporated chromaffin cells, and mammalian neuromuscular junction preparations in vivo (16Keller J.E. Neale E.A. Oyler G. Adler M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Bartels F. Bergel H. Bigalke H. Frevert J. Halpern J. Middlebrook J. J. Biol.

Evidence for the second hypothesis is indirect. Overexpressed P197 in an insulinoma Hit-T15 cell line inhibits insulin secretion (19Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H. Sheu L. Lukacs G.L. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1060-1070PubMed Google Scholar). BoNT/A action at the neuromuscular junction produces a strong immunogenic signal for P197 within nerve terminals, indicating that P197 resides for some time in the proper intracellular regions where it could exert an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission (20de Paiva A. Meunier F.A. Molgo J. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3200-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 21Raciborska D.A. Charlton M.P. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, there has been no quantitative analysis to determine whether the concentrations of P197 generated by toxin activity are able to inhibit neurotransmitter release. BoNT/A and -E are unique among the BoNTs in that, under certain experimental conditions, elevated Ca2+ can partially relieve a toxin-induced blockade (22Molgo J. Dasgupta B.R. Thesleff S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 137: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Cull-Candy S.G. Lundh H. Thesleff S. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The molecular relationship between SNAP-25 and Ca2+ is not well understood, however. The altered Ca2+ sensitivity observed in PC12 cells for either BoNT/A or -E (30Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) is consistent with earlier observations using neuromuscular or chromaffin cell preparations prior to the discovery of SNAP-25 as the toxin substrate (32Molgo J. Thesleff S. Brain Res. 1984; 297: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Sellin L.C. Thesleff S. Dasgupta B.R. Acta Physiol.

Furthermore, electrophysiological results indicate that the C terminus of SNAP-25, which is directly affected by BoNT/A and -E, contributes to the initiation of two distinct Ca2+-sensitive steps in the neurotransmitter release process (31Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 and P197 each bind to VAMP and syntaxin although the P197-containing complex is less stable to detergent solubilization than a complex containing SNAP-25 (35Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 36Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H.

Examining the possible inhibitory role of P197 within the framework of the SNARE hypothesis (38Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 39Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar) suggests that BoNT/A damage compromises the ability of the complex to facilitate vesicle fusion. Calcium induces a conformational transition of the trimeric SNARE complex from a cis(nonsecretory) to a trans orientation which triggers vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release (40Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 41Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given these two effects, SNAP-25 cleavage and reduced Ca2+ sensitivity, it is possible that BoNT/A action on SNAP-25 alters other interactions which affect neurotransmitter release. To this end, it was demonstrated that Ca2+ stimulates binding between SNAP-25 and P197 with synaptotagmin (30Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hence, there may be multiple roles for SNAP-25 and Ca2+ in the release process (34von Ruden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 41Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E.

Herzog K.H. Wang T. Morgan J.I. Lu B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Calcium ionophores have been used successfully to discriminate between the effects of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and direct effects of elevated intracellular Ca2+ on BoNT/A action (27Capogna M. McKinney R.A. O'Connor V. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7190-7202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Capogna M. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. J.

This approach has been extended to the present study to investigate the requirement for intracellular Ca2+ in overcoming the inhibitory action of BoNT/A in mouse spinal cord cultures. The findings demonstrate that a mathematical correlation exists between the generation of P197 by BoNT/A and inhibition of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release, indicating that the amount of P197 attained within neurons will block exocytosis. Monoclonal antibody to SNAP-25 (SMI-81) was obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc. (Lutherville, MD). Thapsigargin, ionomycin, monoclonal antibody to syntaxin, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. All electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. Preparations of BoNT/A and -E toxin complex were from Wako Chemicals Inc. (Richmond, VA) with reported activities of 2.0 × 107 LD50 and 1.0 × 107LD50 per mg of protein, respectively. BoNT/E (1 mg/ml) was activated (nicked) by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.3 mg/ml trypsin (type XI, bovine pancreas) in 30 mm HEPES, pH 6.75. Trypsin was subsequently inhibited by addition of 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (type I-S, soybean) and incubation for 15 min at 20 °C (16Keller J.E. Neale E.A. Oyler G. Adler M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Toxins were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C; each experiment utilized a new aliquot of toxin to ensure uniform activity. Molar concentrations stated in the text were based upon masses of 500 and 300 kDa for BoNT/A and -E, respectively. Timed pregnant C57BL/6NCR mice were obtained from the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD. Spinal cord cell cultures were prepared as described (46Williamson L.C. Fitzgerald S.C. Neale E.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 47Ransom B.R. Neale E. Henkart M. Bullock P.N. Nelson P.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1977; 40: 1132-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Briefly, spinal cords were removed from fetal mice at gestation day 13, dissociated with trypsin, and plated on VitrogenTM 100-coated dishes (Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA) at a density of 106 cells/dish. Cultures were maintained for 3 weeks at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% air, 10% CO2 before addition of toxins. Growth medium consisted of minimum essential medium (formula 82-0234AJ; Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and a mixture of complex factors (48Fitzgerald S.C. Sharar A. Devellis J. Vernadakis A. Javer B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 219-222Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with BoNT diluted with growth medium for times indicated in figure legends. BoNT-containing medium was removed by aspiration; cells were rinsed with toxin-free medium and prepared for Western blot analysis or neurotransmitter release. Protein was prepared by dissolving cells in 1% SDS with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA. The slurry was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, incubated in a 95 °C water bath for 5 min to inactivate proteases, and then stored at −20 °C. Immediately prior to use samples were thawed, mixed with equal volumes of Tris-Tricine sample buffer (Bio-Rad), heated at 95 °C for 4 min, and then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Equal quantities of protein were loaded onto 16.5% acrylamide gels prepared by the method of Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated using 0.1m Tris-Tricine, pH 8.3 (50Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar), and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a buffer containing 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, and 12% methanol. Membrane development was performed as previously described (16Keller J.E. Neale E.A. Oyler G. Adler M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Potassium-stimulated Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release was determined as previously described (51Williamson L.C. Halpern J.L. Montecucco C. Brown J.E. Neale E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7694-7699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cultures were labeled with [3H]glycine for 0.5 h at 35 °C and then washed with a series of low K+-containing buffers. Unless otherwise indicated, glycine release was stimulated by addition of 56 mm K+ and 2 mm Ca2+ to cultures; stimulation medium was collected after 5 min at 35 °C. Calcium-dependent release was determined by subtracting baseline radioactivity secreted from cultures in the absence of Ca2+, and expressed as a percentage of the total cellular radioactivity. Scanned images of Western blots were produced and edited utilizing NIH Image(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Where indicated, images were digitally analyzed using IPLab Gel software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). Nonlinear regression analysis of data was performed with Sigma Plot (SPSS Science, Inc., Chicago, IL). Error bars represent standard deviations of triplicate determinations unless otherwise indicated. BoNT/E treatment of spinal cord cell cultures results in cleavage of SNAP-25 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Under the conditions of these experiments, the IC50 for BoNT/E cleavage of SNAP-25 is ∼50 pm. Measurement of synaptic function indicates that K+-evoked glycine release is inhibited to the same extent as SNAP-25 cleavage (Fig. 1 B). In control cultures, the extent of glycine release is related to Ca2+concentrations in the external medium. Cultures depolarized in the presence of 0.15, 0.25, 2, and 10 mm Ca2+release 4.3, 15.7, 26.5, and 25.8% of the total cellular radiolabel. Maximal release is achieved with 2 mm Ca2+(Fig. 3). Varying external Ca2+ concentration over this range did not alter significantly the IC50 for the BoNT/E block of glycine release which varies from 49 to 55 pm for the conditions tested (Fig. 1 B).Figure 3Calcium titration and K+-evoked glycine release. Spinal cord cultures were incubated in growth medium containing either BoNT/A or -E at 1 nm for 24 h at 37 °C, after which Ca2+-dependent release of glycine was assayed. Cultures not treated with toxin (●) demonstrated a standard titration curve relative to Ca2+concentration with an EC50 value for Ca2+ of 0.21 ± 0.01 mm and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.2. Maximal glycine release for each experiment ranged from 18 to 27% of the total cellular radioactivity and was set to 100%. BoNT/A-treated cultures (○) demonstrated Ca2+ dependence with an EC50 value of 1.0 ± 0.1 mm and maximal release when Ca2+ exceeded 2 mm. The plateau value for this release was 23.2 ± 2.2% of the maximal release elicited from control cultures. BoNT/E-treated cultures (▪) demonstrated no Ca2+ dependent release when measured in the presence of 1–8 mm Ca2+. Results were compiled from five (control) and four (BoNT/A-treated) experiments. Each symbol represents the average of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The model in Fig. 1 C illustrates the effect of BoNT/E on the release process. In this model, SNAP-25 is shown to interact with elements (X) required for neurotransmitter release with an affinity represented by Kd. Potassium depolarization stimulates release in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Release is directly proportional to the amount of SNAP-25 present. As SNAP-25 is cleaved by increasing concentrations of BoNT/E, neurotransmitter release decreases to a similar extent. BoNT/E-cleaved SNAP-25 (P180) has been shown to interact with VAMP and syntaxinin vitro (36Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 37Pellegrini L.L. O'Connor V. Lottspeich F. Betz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that in this intact neuronal system, P180 does not interfere with K+-evoked release, possibly because P180 interacts withX very weakly relative to SNAP-25. Furthermore, increasing extracellular Ca2+ above physiological concentrations does not overcome the block (Fig. 3), similar to findings with neuromuscular preparations (14Adler M. Macdonald D.A. Sellin L.C. Parker G.W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unlike BoNT/E, dose-response data with BoNT/A produce nonoverlapping curves for SNAP-25 proteolysis and blockade of neurotransmitter release (Fig.2 B). SNAP-25 cleavage occurs with an approximate IC50 of 3 pm and glycine release is inhibited with IC50 values decreasing from 0.3 to 0.1 pm as Ca2+ concentrations decrease from 2 to 0.15 mm in the release medium (Fig. 2 B). Increasing Ca2+ to 8 or 10 mm yielded results identical to that obtained with 2 mm Ca2+ (data not shown). At Ca2+ concentrations lower than 2 mm, a greater degree of inhibition occurs relative to SNAP-25 cleavage (Fig. 2 B). At all Ca2+concentrations tested, the slopes for neurotransmitter release were the same. Comparing these slopes with the slope for SNAP-25 yields a ratio of ∼2:1. Fig. 2 C depicts possible interactions between SNAP-25 and P197 and their combined effects on the release process. In this model P197 binds to elements X much the same as SNAP-25. Because elevated Ca2+ has been shown previously to reverse BoNT/A inhibition in brain slices (27Capogna M. McKinney R.A. O'Connor V. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7190-7202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PC12 cells (29Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20227-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and neuromuscular preparations (52Molgo J. Siegel L.S. Tabti N. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. 1989; 411: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that neurotransmitter release through the P197-X pathway would require Ca2+ in excess of that achieved during normal neuronal stimulation. Elevated Ca2+ above normal levels is depicted with the term Ca2+′. This model allows us to predict the relationship between SNAP-25 cleavage and block of transmitter release. Assuming (a) that P197 interacts with elements X with the same or nearly the same affinity as SNAP-25, and (b) that at any given dose of BoNT/A, the molar sum of the remaining SNAP-25 and P197 will equal the amount of SNAP-25 in the absence of toxin, the profile in Fig. 2 D is generated. According to this model, the ratio of the slope for neurotransmitter release relative to SNAP-25 is exactly 2:1. The data for neurotransmitter release measured with 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B) overlap the predicted result. Because at lower Ca2+ concentrations, BoNT/A-exposed cultures show a greater block in transmitter release (Fig. 2), we examined the effects of extracellular Ca2+concentration on glycine release following exposure to a single, high dose of BoNT/A or -E. Both BoNTs at 1 nm cleave all detectable SNAP-25 after 24 h (Figs. 1 A and 2A). [3H]Glycine release from control cultures (no toxin exposure) is Ca2+ dependent with an EC50 value for Ca2+ of 0.21 mm and a Hill coefficient of about 2 (Fig. 3). Glycine release from BoNT/A-treated cultures is similarly Ca2+ dependent with an EC50 value of 1.0 ± 0.1 mm and a plateau value that is 23% of control release (Fig. 3). Maximum release for both control and BoNT/A-treated cultures is attained when Ca2+ exceeds 2 mm(Fig. 3) and the slope of release is unaffected by toxin with an estimated Hill coefficient of 2.2 ± 0.3 (53Trudeau L.E. Fang Y. Haydon P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7163-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 54Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Zucker R.S. J. Physiol. 1982; 323: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Glycine release from BoNT/E-treated cultures is not detected at any concentration of Ca2+ tested (Fig. 3). This indicates that the rise of intracellular Ca2+ resulting from Ca2+-channel activation can restore some function to BoNT/A- but not to BoNT/E-treated neurons, consistent with results from Figs. 1 and 2. To examine the effects of increased intracellular Ca2+ above levels attained from Ca2+-channel activation, glycine release was evoked by 56 mmK+ in the presence and absence of 2 mmCa2+ and 5 μm ionomycin, a Ca2+-specific ionophore. Ionomycin partially restores glycine release after exposure to BoNT/A (Fig.4). Treatment with BoNT/A reduces glycine release to ∼23% of control release. Addition of ionomycin in combination with Ca2+ reduces the effect of BoNT/A, raising glycine release to 60% of control values. To determine the source of Ca2+ that contributes to this reversal, glycine release was assayed with ionomycin either in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, or after having treated cultures with thapsigargin to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores (55Brayden D.J. Hanley M.R. Thastrup O. Cuthbert A.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 56Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of any release with zero external Ca2+ with ionomycin and the failure of thapsigargin to affect the ionomycin-dependent release provide evidence that internal Ca2+ stores do not contribute significantly to ionomycin's reversal of the BoNT/A-induced block. To expand upon this finding, cultures were treated with 1 nm BoNT/A or BoNT/E for 24 h and neurotransmitter release was measured in the presence of 10 μm ionomycin in 56 mm K+ with various external Ca2+ concentrations. Ionomycin produces a significant reversal of the BoNT/A block at all Ca2+ concentrations tested with complete recovery occurring near 2 mmCa2+. Unlike K+/Ca2+ stimulation alone, stimulation in the presence of ionomycin partially alleviates BoNT/E-induced block with maximum glycine release at 53% of control cultures (Fig. 5). Within these experimental conditions, BoNT/A- and/E-treated neurons are about 4- and 7-fold less sensitive to Ca2+, respectively, than untreated neurons. Ionomycin has two measurable effects on reversing BoNT/E action: neurons release more glycine and demonstrate higher sensitivity to Ca2+. In the case of BoNT/A, ionomycin stimulates release of glycine to control values. However, ionomycin does not alter the EC50 value for Ca2+ which is 0.8 ± 0.1 mm (Fig. 5) compared with 1.0 ± 0.1 mm obtained for the partial release achieved in the absence of ionomycin (Fig. 3). Ionomycin at the tested concentration does not affect cultures that were not treated with toxin; neither the Ca2+ sensitivity nor the extent of glycine release was altered (Fig. 5). In this study, we examined the relationship between blockade of neurotransmitter release and cleavage of SNAP-25 caused by BoNT/A and -E to aid in understanding how BoNT/A seems to derive greater potency than BoNT/E (14Adler M. Macdonald D.A. Sellin L.C. Parker G.W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Molgo J. Dasgupta B.R. Thesleff S. Acta Physiol.

Thesleff S. Brain Res. 1984; 297: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both BoNTs induce a concentration-dependent block in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and proteolysis of SNAP-25. However, it appears likely that in addition to disabling SNAP-25, BoNT/A action has a secondary inhibitory effect. The nonoverlapping pattern of SNAP-25 cleavage and block of K+-evoked transmitter release in this latter case points to the formation of an inhibitory complex containing a cleavage fragment produced by BoNT/A. Most simply, BoNT/A action on SNAP-25 produces a dual effect: a reduction in functional SNAP-25 and production of a fragment that antagonizes synaptic vesicle fusion. The identity of this fragment could be either the 197-amino acid fragment, P197, or the"

Co-expression of mutant and wild-type HERG resulted in currents with altered voltage dependence but without dominant current suppression. The data from co-expression of V822M and wild-type HERG best fit a model where one normal subunit within a tetramer allows nearly normal current expression. The presence of KCNE2, an accessory protein that associates with HERG, however, conferred a partially dominant current suppression by CNBD mutants. Thus KCNE2 plays a pivotal role in determining the phenotypic severity of some forms of LQT2, which suggests that the CNBD of HERG may be involved in its interaction with KCNE2.

The gene responsible for LQT2 is the humanether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG),1 which encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (Ikr) in cardiac myocytes (2Warmke J.W.

We reported that cAMP could regulate HERG by direct interaction or through PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the channel (12Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigate the direct effect of cAMP on HERG channel properties through mutagenesis designed to disrupt the ability of HERG to bind cAMP. Previous studies of the CNBD in cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase and bacterial cAMP-regulated catabolic gene activator protein (CAP) identified six invariant key amino acid residues for cyclic nucleotide binding (13Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three of these are glycine residues that are essential for maintenance of the β-barrel structure that is required to form a pocket for cyclic nucleotide binding. A glutamic acid residue forms a hydrogen bond with the ribose 2′-OH of cAMP and an arginine residue interacts with the phosphate of cAMP to form a salt bridge (14Woodford T.A. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13321-13328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of any of these six invariant amino acid residues in CAP or in type I cAMP-dependent kinase impairs or eliminates cAMP binding (15Steinberg R.A. Russell J.L. Murphy C.S. Yphantis D.A. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3547-3553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homologous amino acid residues are also present in the CNBD of HERG. Here we describe the functional consequences of mutations at these homologous residues (G806D, E807(K/Q), and R823(W/Q)) designed to alter the ability of the channel to bind cAMP. Because HERG assembles in a tetramer to form functional channels, we also investigated the effects of co-expression of CNBD mutants with wild-type HERG. We found that CNBD mutants lose specific binding affinity for cAMP. They do not express currents as homotetrameric channels. Moreover, the loss of function is not because of defective protein biosynthesis or trafficking. Mutant HERG proteins do not have a dominant-negative effect on wild-type current but do alter voltage-dependent gating. Co-expression with the accessory subunit KCNE2, converts the CNBD mutants into partially dominant-negative suppressors. Epitope tagging of HERG with c-Myc has been described (4McDonald T.V., Yu, Z.

The mutatedXhoI-FseI fragments were subcloned into a HERG-myc-pCI-neo plasmid. An inframe deletion mutation ΔNBD was constructed using a one-step PCR. The forward primer begins at 2662 of HERG cDNA (5′-TACTGTGACCTACACAAGATCCATC) and the reverse primer spanned an EcoRI site within the psp64 vector (5′-GCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGG). The resulting PCR product was digested with FseI and the ∼300-base pair fragment was purified and ligated into the parent construct HERG-psp64 digested withStuI and FseI sites. The resulting ΔNBD mutation lacks the coding sequence for amino acids 815–825. N-terminal GFP-tagged HERG plasmids were constructed by inserting WT-HERG or CNBD mutants into pEGFPC3 at BamHI-HindIII sites. Mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequence analyses. CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Gene transfer was performed using 1–5 μg of Qiagen Midiprep purified plasmid DNA. Cells were electroporated at 225 V, 72 ohms, and 1800 microfarads in cytomix media (22van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cells were studied after 36–72 h after transfection. A plasmid containing the cDNA for GFP was combined with HERG plasmids (in a ratio of 1:5 GFP/HERG) to allow identification of transfected cells as previously described (4McDonald T.V., Yu, Z. Ming Z.

In co-transfection experiments current amplitudes were normalized each day to a group of cells transfected with HERG alone to control for day-to-day variations in transfection efficiency.

Extracellular solution was NaCl 150 mm, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, osmolarity ∼300–330 mm. Pipette solution was 120 mm KCl, 4 mm Mg-ATP, 2 mmMgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Osmolarity was adjusted to maintain the pipette solution at 20–40 mm less than the extracellular solution. Currents were evoked by 2–4 s depolarizing steps to various levels from a holding potential of −70 mV followed by a repolarizing step to −40 mV and then to −120 mV briefly to measure outward and inward tail currents. Current densities were calculated by dividing maximal tail current peaks by cell capacitance measurements. Voltage activation data were plotted as peak tail current amplitudes against the test potential values and were fitted to a Boltzmann function, I = 1/(1 + exp[(V 12−V)/k]), whereI is the measured tail current, V is the applied membrane voltage, V 12 is the voltage at half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. CHO or HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for biochemical analyses. Membrane preparations were enriched for plasma membrane proteins and Western blots were carried out as previously described (4McDonald T.V., Yu, Z. Ming Z. Palma E. Meyers M.B. Goldstein S.A.N.

To control for transfection efficiency between groups of cells, cDNA for Myc-tagged connexin43 was included. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7% gel. Anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody ascites fluid was used for Western blots to detect Myc-tagged HERG proteins. Anti-HERG polyclonal antisera was generated against a GST fusion protein constructed from a PCR fragment encoding amino acids 979–1159 ligated into pGEX-KG. The GST·HERG fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and was partially purified on GSH-agarose. The protein was then identified by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE, and the appropriate gel band was excised, electroeluted, and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. The resulting antisera was assayed for ability to recognize heterologously expressed HERG·Myc protein on immunoblot and immunoprecipitation and was verified by comparison to anti-Myc staining. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was used as ascites fluid diluted into immunoblot blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline, 10% nonfat dry milk, and 0.1% Tween 20). CHO cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE (as above) with GFP·HERG plasmids. After 24–48 h, the transfected cells were resuspended and replated on glass coverslip chambers (Nunc) and allowed to attach for at least 24 h prior to imaging. GFP fluorescent images were collected using an Olympus I×70 microscope with 12 bit cooled Photometrics Sensys CCD camera. Image analysis was performed using NIH Image, ImagePro, and Photoshop 7.0 software. For [3H]cAMP binding, HERG·Myc was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cell lysates with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody A-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology., Inc.) and Ultralink immobilized protein G (Pierce). Precipitated proteins were washed with ice-cold NDET (150 mm NaCl, 0.4% deoxycholic acid, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40) and suspended in cAMP binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 120 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml Histone IIA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), pH 7.0). Determination of cyclic nucleotide binding was performed as previously described (12Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of the HERG nucleotide binding domain, we constructed eight CNBD mutations targeted to disrupt cAMP binding (Fig. 1 a). The selected mutant amino acid residues are homologous to invariant residues in other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins that have been identified as essential for normal conformation and cAMP binding ability. Among these mutations, V822M and R823W are naturally occurring LQT2 mutations (1Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Vincent G.M.

We measured the whole cell K+ current from CHO cells transiently transfected with each HERG mutant. Typical whole cell current tracings are seen in Fig. 1 b. Except for mutant R823Q, none of the mutations could produce voltage-gated K+current when expressed alone. We also did not detect any K+current when mutant expressing cells were exposed to 1 mmCPT-cAMP. Our results confirmed previous reports that LQT2 homotetramers involving the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (V822M and S818L) do not form functional channels (25Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L.

Taniguchi Y. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Nagai R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of the CNBD mutants, however, R823Q, did produce HERG current. Comparison of current-voltage and voltage-dependent activation showed that the current amplitude was greater for wild-type HERG than R823Q homotetramers at all voltages (Fig.2 a). The maximal tail current density measuring at −40 mV after a 2 s depolarizing test for wild-type HERG is 54.5 ± 5.8 pA/pF (n = 8); whereas R823Q is 11.3 ± 1.37 pA/pF (n = 33;p < 0.001). When the data were independently normalized to unity (Fig. 2 a, inset), the voltage to achieve half-activation (V 12) for R823Q was shifted to more negative potentials when compared with wild-type HERG, (V 12 WT = −12.33 ± 0.23 mV; V 12 R823Q = −20.09 ± 0.31 mV). There was no apparent change in the slope factor (kWT = 10.13 ± 0.21 mV;kR823Q = 9.21 ± 0.29 mV). We have previously shown that cAMP decreased whole cell HERG current amplitude with minimal alteration in voltage-dependent activation (12Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This current inhibition was primarily achieved via PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the channel protein. To assess the effect of cAMP on mutant R823Q, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog CPT-cAMP was applied to the extracellular solution at a concentration of 500 μm. HERG K+ current was recorded 3 min after CPT-cAMP addition. Fig. 2 b shows that cAMP caused a current reduction of ∼15% and a small negative shift in voltage-dependent activation (V 12 (baseline) = −20.44 ± 0.39 mV; V 12(cAMP) = −26.86 ± 0.16 mV, n = 18). Several LQT2 mutations are known to cause reduced Ikr by defective transport of mutant proteins to the plasma membrane or through enhanced protein degradation (24Kagan A., Yu, Z. Fishman G.I.

When misfolded mutant HERG subunits assemble with wild-type protein, a dominant effect can be exerted where both proteins are subjected to early and rapid degradation (24Kagan A., Yu, Z. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11241-11248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To assess whether the dysfunction of CNBD mutations was also caused by abnormal protein biosynthesis or trafficking, we examined the abundance and the membrane expression of c-Myc-tagged HERG and CNBD mutants. Anti-Myc immunoblot analysis showed that the CNBD mutants were expressed in abundance less than but comparable with wild-type HERG (Fig. 3 a). There was no evidence of retention of CNBD mutant protein in endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi compartments when fractions enriched for microsomal membrane proteins were isolated from plasma membrane and subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 3 b). Recent reports have shown that loss of function associated with misfolded and mistrafficked mutant HERG may be rescued by incubation at low temperatures (24Kagan A., Yu, Z. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11241-11248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol.

We examined the effect of decreasing culture temperature on the expression of CNBD mutations. Previous work demonstrated that HERG existed as two bands on SDS-PAGE analysis when expressed in HEK293 cells. A band migrating near 155 kDa represents the mature fully glycosylated channel protein, and a band near 135-kDa represents a core-glycosylated immature form of protein (29Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielsky J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 c, both wild-type HERG and the CNBD mutants were expressed as two bands on Western blot. In all groups, both bands migrated slightly slower when grown at 30 °C. No enhancement of mutant protein abundance occurred in cells that were grown at the lower temperature. Moreover, we were not able to detect any HERG current in CHO cells transfected with the V822M or ΔNBD mutants after incubation at 30 °C for 36–72 h. The R823W mutant, however, occasionally produced a very small amount of current when the incubation temperature was decreased to 27–30 °C for 24–48 h. Among 12 examined cells, 6 exhibited small HERG currents (Fig. 3 d). The average tail current density for wild-type and R823W at 30 °C was 117.6 ± 14.5 pA/pF and 8.25 ± 2.7 pA/pF, respectively (p< 0.01). Despite comparable protein abundance, low temperatures resulted in a current that was expressed in only half of the cells with an amplitude that was ∼7% of the wild-type current. This argues against misfolding and mistrafficking as a primary mechanism in the loss of function for R823W. To further examine whether the CNBD mutant proteins are expressed on the plasma membrane, we visualized the location of HERG protein in living cells using N-terminal GFP fusion proteins for both wild-type and mutant HERG. GFP-tagged wild-type HERG produces K+current similar to untagged wild-type HERG (data not shown). GFP-tagged β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) was used as a control for plasma membrane location (30Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). CNBD mutations exhibited a similar fluorescence pattern as wild-type HERG and β-AR (Fig.4). As frequently seen with transient forced expression, a signal was seen in endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi locations in all cells in addition to cell surface locations. These results confirm that defective biosynthetic processing and protein transport are not the major causes of the channel dysfunction in CNBD mutations. To assess the interactions between wild-type and CNBD mutant proteins, we co-expressed equal amounts of wild-type and mutant HERG in CHO cells and performed whole cell patch clamp recordings. Compared with wild-type HERG homotetramer, co-expression of wild-type with mutant HERG did not significantly alter current amplitudes (Table I and Fig. 5 a). Alterations inV 12 observed in currents from cells co-expressing wild-type HERG and CNBD mutants are evidence that support heterotetrameric channel assembly (Table I). When cAMP was applied during whole cell patch clamp measurements, the degree of current amplitude suppression seen in cells transfected with wild-type HERG alone was comparable with cells expressing both wild-type and CNBD mutants (Fig. 5 a). This is consistent with our finding that cAMP-dependent current suppression is because of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of HERG (12Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr.

Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported that both KCNE1 and KCNE2 altered the effects of cAMP regulation of the HERG channel (12Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of CNBD mutations on Ikr, we co-expressed wild-type HERG and CNBD mutants with KCNE2. KCNE2 failed to induce currents from the functionally defective CNBD mutants in the absence of co-expressed wild-type HERG. The presence of KCNE2, however, did confer a suppressive effect on CNBD mutants when co-expressed with wild-type HERG. The exception to this was the R823Q mutant that can sustain current as a homotetramer (Table I and Fig. 5 b). Compared with expression of wild type alone, current density for co-transfection with V822M, R823W, and ΔNBD were decreased 35.3%, 49.6, and 44.6%, respectively. Whereas this is a significant suppression, it does not represent a completely dominant-negative effect as seen with several other LQT2 mutants (24Kagan A., Yu, Z. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11241-11248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that co-expression KCNE2 with wild-type and mutant HERG would lower the expression of channel protein, we examined the abundance of total HERG protein by immunoblot. As seen in Fig.5 c, the total HERG protein abundance was comparable in the wild-type alone and mutant co-expression groups when KCNE2 was present. Assuming random assembly of an equal amount of wild-type and mutant subunits a binomial distribution would predict that a completely dominant mutation should reduce the current amplitude by >90% whereas the CNBD mutants range from ∼35–50% current reduction. The cAMP effects on wild-type and mutant heteromultimers are altered when KCNE2 is co-expressed (Table I and Fig. 5 b). In cells expressing WT-HERG-KCNE2, cAMP induced a leftward shift in voltage-dependent activation and did not significantly alter current amplitudes, which is consistent with our previous report (12Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Addition of cAMP, however, causes an augmentation of current density for WT-V822M-KCNE2 channel and a suppression of the others. TheV 12 for WT-CNBD mutant-KCNE2 were all shifted to more negative voltages by cAMP. Fig. 6 shows a more detailed analysis of the effects of the LQT2 mutant V822M on WT HERG current. CHO cells were transfected with constant amount (5 μg) of wild-type HERG cDNA with varying ratios of V822M. Expression of V822M alone produced no current (Fig. 1 b), whereas co-transfection of equal amounts of wild-type and V822M cDNA (50% wild type) yielded a"

Several studies supported an asymmetric distribution of GLUT1 protein between the luminal and abluminal membranes (1:4) with a significant proportion of intracellular transporters. In this study we investigated the activity and concentration of GLUT1 in isolated luminal and abluminal membrane fractions of bovine brain endothelial cells. Glucose transport activity and glucose transporter concentration, as determined by cytochalasin B binding, were 2-fold greater in the luminal than in the abluminal membranes. In contrast, Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 20 amino acids of GLUT1 indicated a 1:5 luminal:abluminal distribution. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against either the intracellular loop of GLUT1 or the purified erythrocyte protein exhibited luminal:abluminal ratios of 1:1. A similar ratio was observed when the luminal and abluminal fractions were exposed to the 2-N-4[3H](1-azi-2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl)benzoxyl-1,3-bis-(d-mannos-4-yloxyl)-2-propylamine ([3H]ATB-BMPA) photoaffinity label. These observations suggest that either an additional glucose transporter isoform is present in the luminal membrane of the bovine blood-brain barrier or the C-terminal epitope of GLUT1 is “masked” in the luminal membrane but not in the abluminal membranes.

These observations suggest that either an additional glucose transporter isoform is present in the luminal membrane of the bovine blood-brain barrier or the C-terminal epitope of GLUT1 is “masked” in the luminal membrane but not in the abluminal membranes. The mammalian brain depends on a continuous supply of glucose for normal function. The delivery of circulating glucose to the brain requires transport across the endothelial cells of the cerebral microvessels that constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB).1 Glucose transport across the BBB is mediated by the highly glycosylated, 55-kDa form of the facilitative glucose transporter protein, GLUT1 (1Pardridge W.M.

The capacity for facilitated glucose transport across both the luminal (blood-facing) and abluminal (brain-facing) membranes of the endothelial cell was confirmed by electron microscopy immunolocalization studies, which reported GLUT1 protein in both luminal and abluminal membranes as well as in intracellular vesicles (3Gerhart D.Z.

Most studies support an asymmetric distribution of GLUT1 among these three compartments: 11% luminal membrane, 44% abluminal membrane/vesicles, and 45% intracellular membrane/vesicles for rat (4Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. J. Neurosci. Methods.. 1991; 37: 103-110Google Scholar) with similar distributions reported for rabbit (5Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Pardridge W.M. J. Cereb.

Neurol... 1995; 54: 842-851Google Scholar). This apparent difference in GLUT1 concentrations between luminal and abluminal membranes could convey a polarity to BBB glucose transport favoring transport from the blood, across the endothelial cell, and into the brain. In addition, the existence of the intracellular pool and the potential for transporter recruitment and redistribution between membranes has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the acute modulations in brain glucose transport observed in vivo (7Pardridge W.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1993; 692: 126-137Google Scholar). The question of the rate-determining step in BBB glucose transport has been difficult to resolve because of the inability to study the transport properties of the luminal and abluminal membranes separately.

Physiol... 1997; 272: C1552-C1557Google Scholar) demonstrated that glucose transport activity was equal in the luminal and abluminal membranes rather than asymmetric as was suggested by the electron microscopy studies of GLUT1 (12Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 5779-5783Google Scholar). To help resolve these apparent discrepancies, we extended the studies of Lee et al. (11Lee W.J. Peterson D.R.

Our findings suggest both the presence of an additional glucose transporter and a conformational alteration in the GLUT1 proteins in the luminal membranes of the BBB.

Protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) were included at 1 μg/ml during the initial homogenization and then at 0.01 μg/ml in all subsequent buffers. Characterization of the fractions was achieved by measuring the activities of luminal and abluminal markers,i.e. γ-glutamyltranspeptidase and System A amino acid transport activity with N-(methylamino)isobutyric acid as substrate, respectively (8Sanchez del Pino M.M.

Briefly, aliquots of luminal and abluminal membranes (10–15 μg) were incubated in duplicate with varying concentrations of [3H]cytochalasin B (4–50 × 10−8m) in the presence of 2 mm cytochalasin E and with or without 500 mmd-glucose. Tracer [14C]urea was included to correct for trapping of radioactivity. The membranes were pelleted (Beckman Instruments LP 42.2 Ti, 42 K, 220,000 ×g, 30 min), and a sample was removed from the supernatant for the determination of free CB. The pellet was solubilized in 0.1m NaOH and neutralized, and the radioactivity associated with both pellets and supernatants was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The data were analyzed by subtraction of the binding curves obtained in the presence of d-glucose from those obtained in the absence of d-glucose (23Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W.

Membrane fractions were photolabeled essentially as described by Maher and Simpson (26Maher F. Simpson I.A. Biochem. J... 1994; 301: 379-384Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg each of the luminal (F1) and abluminal (F3) membranes were resuspended in isolation buffer (mannitol-HEPES) and incubated with 100 μCi of [3H]ATB-BMPA (final concentration 50 μm). The mixture was exposed to UV light (Rayonet photochemical reactor with 300 nm lamps) for 2 min. The membranes were washed to remove free [3H]ATB-BMPA, pelleted and solubilized in SDS/urea/dithiothreitol (3.5%:6 m:100 mm), and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel was sliced (including the lane of molecular markers), the slices were dried and solubilized in 30% H2O2,2% NH4OH, and the radioactivity incorporated into each slice was determined by liquid scintillation counting. A typical membrane fractionation is depicted in Fig.1 A. The proportion of luminalversus abluminal membrane was determined in each fraction by measurement of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase activity (luminal) and System A amino acid transport activity (abluminal) (8Sanchez del Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 14907-14912Google Scholar). Glucose transport activity determined in the individual fractions is depicted in Fig.1 B and indicates a transport capacity in the luminal fraction greater than twice that of the abluminal fractions in agreement with the previous studies of Lee et al. (11Lee W.J. Peterson D.R. Sukowski E.J. Hawkins R.A. Am. J. Physiol... 1997; 272: C1552-C1557Google Scholar) To analyze the GLUT1 content of these fractions, Western blot analysis was performed with three distinct rabbit antibodies: an antiserum that recognizes the C-terminal 20 amino acids of GLUT1 (C), an antiserum against 15 amino acids of the intracellular loop (L), and an antiserum raised against the purified human erythrocyte GLUT1 protein (H). The relative concentrations of GLUT1 in each of the fractions as determined from image analysis of these blots are presented below the respective blots in Fig. 1 C. It appeared, based on the results obtained with the C-terminal antibody, that there was a much lower concentration of GLUT1 in the luminal fraction. However, this relationship was quite different when analyzed with the two other antisera. Whereas the ratio of F1 (luminal) to F3 (abluminal) obtained with the C-terminal antibody was approximately 1:5, this becomes 1:0.9 and 1:1.3 when analyzed with H and L antisera, respectively. Although the absolute luminal-abluminal content/fraction varied, comparable ratios were obtained in all preparations (n = 5). Based on the distribution of luminal and abluminal markers detected in F1 (Fig. 1 A), it appeared that the C-terminal antibody only detected the GLUT1 protein in the abluminal membrane. H sera provided an intermediate response between the results obtained with C and loop. This may be explained by the studies of Lienhard et al. (27Gibbs A.F. Chapman D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J... 1988; 256: 421-427Google Scholar, 42Gibbs E.M. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1986; 261: 16597-16603Google Scholar) who demonstrated a significant C-terminal component to polyclonal antisera comparable with H. Using red cell membranes as an internal standard, the loop antisera provided the greatest estimate of total GLUT1 transporter in all fractions and suggested that the majority of the transporters in F1 and a significant proportion (50%) in F2-F5 express an epitope that is inaccessible to the C-terminal antibody. A simple explanation for this would be proteolysis during the fractionation; however, the identical observation in the unfractionated microvessel membrane samples refuted this possibility. Furthermore, proteolytic cleavage of GLUT1 in these samples should have resulted in a lower molecular weight protein detectable by both H and L sera, and this was not observed. These data suggest that the C terminus of luminal GLUT1 is somehow masked. To determine whether the disparities in transport activity between fractions F1 (luminal) and F3 (abluminal) depicted in Fig.1 A were due to differences in concentration and/or intrinsic activity of GLUT1, the membranes were analyzed for glucose transporter concentration by CB binding (Fig. 2). Netd-glucose-inhibitable CB binding was determined by subtraction of the binding curves obtained in the absence and presence of d-glucose along the radial axes of equal free CB concentration radiating from the origin (23Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn C.R. Harrison L.C. The Insulin Receptor.Alan R. Liss. 1988; 12B: 171-187Google Scholar, 24Rosenthal H.E. Anal. Biochem... 1967; 20: 525-532Google Scholar). In this experiment,R0 and Kd values were determined for luminal (F1) and abluminal (F3) fractions: F1, 630 pmol/mg, 509 × 10−9m; F3, 280 pmol/mg, 356 × 10−9m. The results depicted in Fig. 2 demonstrated a greater number of binding sites in the luminal fraction than in the abluminal fraction, which is in agreement with transport activity determinations (Fig.1 B) but distinct from the results obtained by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). Cytochalasin B is readily membrane-permeant and thus can bind to all transporters irrespective of orientation (inside-out versusright side-out). To determine whether the orientation was the same in the luminal and abluminal membranes, we used the impermeant photolabel [3H]ATB-BMPA developed by Clark and Holman (25Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Biochem. J... 1990; 269: 615-622Google Scholar). Luminal (F1) and abluminal membranes (F3), 100 μg each, were resuspended in isolation buffer (mannitol-HEPES) and incubated with [3H]ATB-BMPA as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data depicted in Fig. 3were constructed by plotting dpm/slice. The area under the peak at 55 kDa was calculated by summing the slices included in the peak and subtracting the base line. The results of this experiment indicated that the ratio of luminal:abluminal transporters detected with [3H]ATB-BMPA was 1:1.4, which is comparable with ratios obtained by Western blotting with the loop and H sera but is still less than observed with CB binding and activity measurements. These data clearly indicate differences in accessibility of the transporter(s) to ATB-BMPA and CB between the luminal and abluminal membranes. These results suggested that either more than 50% of the luminal transporters were in inverted vesicles or alternatively another glucose transporter capable of binding CB but not ATB-BMPA was present in the luminal membrane. Of the other facilitative glucose transporters, GLUTs 2 and 5 do not bind CB with the affinity observed in Fig. 2. GLUTs 3 and 4 do bind CB but also bind ATB-BMPA. The presence of GLUT4 was discounted by Western blotting (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the presence of GLUT3 as neither human nor rat GLUT3 antibodies were found to cross-react with bovine GLUT3 (data not shown). This study is the first demonstration that functional GLUT1 glucose transporter proteins may exist in different conformations in the luminal and abluminal membranes of the mammalian BBB. The GLUT1 transporters responsible for mediating transport from the blood across the luminal membrane into the endothelial cell appear to be modified such that the C terminus is no longer available to immunodetection by Western blot analysis. The original purpose of this study was to systematically define the polarity of glucose transport across the cerebral microvascular endothelial cells that constitute the blood-brain barrier. This polarity has been characterized for some transport systems,i.e. amino acids, as involving different transporters, for instance sodium-dependent transport across the abluminal membrane but not the luminal membrane (10O'Kane R.L. Martinez-Lopez I. DeJoseph M.R. Vina J.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 31891-31895Google Scholar, 28Lee W.J. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. Vina J.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19129-19133Google Scholar). It has generally been agreed that GLUT1 is the sole mediator of glucose transport across the mammalian BBB and that the polarity of glucose transport has been derived from the observed asymmetry in the distribution of transporter numbers in the two membranes (12Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 5779-5783Google Scholar). However, actual measurements of transport activities in isolated luminal and abluminal membrane vesicles suggested equivalent levels of transport (11Lee W.J. Peterson D.R. Sukowski E.J. Hawkins R.A. Am. J. Physiol... 1997; 272: C1552-C1557Google Scholar). Because the latter study did not include any specific measure of GLUT1 concentration in these vesicles, we undertook a comprehensive characterization of the glucose transport properties of these membrane vesicles by a variety of techniques. The results of the present study provide the first indication of a modification of the GLUT1 glucose transporter in the luminal membranes that is reflected in an inability to detect clearly functional transporters with an antibody directed against the C terminus of the protein. Transport activities in luminal (F1) and abluminal (F2-F5) membrane vesicles in this study were ∼2:1 (Fig. 1 B). A similar ratio was obtained when these fractions were analyzed for glucose transporter content by CB binding to F1 and F3 (Fig. 2) suggesting a comparable number of transporters in the fractions. However, when the membrane fractions were blotted with the commonly used anti-C-terminal antibody, the ratio of luminal:abluminal GLUT1 was roughly 1:5, which is similar to the asymmetric distribution derived from electron microscopic immunogold studies (12Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 5779-5783Google Scholar). Further analysis of these fractions with H sera, which were raised against the entire purified human erythrocyte GLUT1 protein, yielded far more equivalent concentrations for GLUT1 in the respective membranes. This was corroborated in an additional Western blot employing an antiserum directed against a peptide sequence within the intracellular loop of GLUT1. Thus, it is clear from the results of Figs. 1 and 2 that the glucose transporter protein in the luminal F1 fraction displays an epitope specificity quite different from the other fractions despite a greater capacity for transport and an apparent higher concentration of transporters as determined by cytochalasin B binding. There could be several potential explanations for these findings. One possibility is that the epitope was lost due to proteolysis during preparation; however, several factors suggest that this is not the case. These include the use of multiple protease inhibitors throughout the preparation and the failure to identify any lower molecular weight proteolytic fragments with the antisera raised against the whole protein (H) or the loop antibody (L). Furthermore, we observed the same apparent loss of epitope in both unfractionated cow and rat microvessels by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Alternatively, the existence of other GLUT isoforms could contribute to increased transport activity and CB binding in the luminal membranes. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown both human and rat microvessels to be devoid of GLUTs 2–5 (17Maher F. Vannucci S. Takeda J. Simpson I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1992; 182: 703-711Google Scholar, 29Maher F. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab... 1993; 13: 342-345Google Scholar, 30Vannucci S.J. Clark R.R. Koehler-Stec E. Li K. Smith C.B. Davies P. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Dev. Neurosci... 1998; 20: 369-379Google Scholar). There have been reports of GLUT3 in human, rodent, and canine BBB (31Gerhart D.Z. Broderius M.A. Borson N.D. Drewes L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 733-737Google Scholar, 32Mantych G.J. James D.E. Chung H.D. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology.. 1992; 131: 1270-1278Google Scholar). Subsequent studies refuted this observation for both rodent and human brain (29Maher F. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab... 1993; 13: 342-345Google Scholar, 34Mantych G.J. James D.E. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology.. 1993; 132: 35-40Google Scholar). Others have detected trace levels of GLUT4 and GLUT5 in rat microvessels (33McCall A.L. van Bueren A.M. Huang L. Stenbit A. Celnik E. Charron M.J. Brain Res... 1997; 744: 318-326Google Scholar, 34Mantych G.J. James D.E. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology.. 1993; 132: 35-40Google Scholar). It should be noted that GLUT2 and GLUT5 have very low affinities for CB and glucose and thus are unlikely candidates to resolve the discrepancies. Our studies failed to detect GLUT4 in bovine vessels with an antibody that will recognize bovine GLUT4. However, as discussed above, we cannot use lack of immunodetection to rule out the presence of GLUT3 as our antibodies do not cross-react with the bovine isoform. The recent discovery of a new family of glucose transporters (35Doege H. Schurmann A. Bahrenberg G. Brauers A. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 16275-16280Google Scholar, 36Doege H. Bocianski A. Joost H.G. Schurmann A. Biochem. J... 2000; 350: 771-776Google Scholar, 37Ibberson M. Uldry M. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 4607-4612Google Scholar) offers additional candidates to explain these findings. Little is known about the transport kinetics of these proteins, although both GLUTXs 1 and 2/GLUTs 8 and 9 appear to bind CB. 2B. Thorens, personal communication. The potential expression in the BBB has yet to be determined, although our preliminary studies have failed to detect GLUTX-1 or -2 mRNA in mouse BBB by in situ hybridization (data not shown). Finally, the question arises as to whether there are any GLUT1 transporters in the luminal membrane that are detectable with the C-terminal-directed antibody or is this modification uniformly applied to luminal GLUT1? The results of our studies suggest the latter. In any given fractionation there is a certain degree of contamination of F1 with abluminal membrane (Fig. 1 A) and the potential for further contamination with intracellular transporters, which may or may not fully interact with the C-terminal antibody. Thus, the results of this study confirm and extend our earlier report of a comparable level of glucose transport activity in luminal and abluminal fractions coupled with a modification of the luminal GLUT1 transporters that alters the C-terminal immunoreactivity. It next becomes important to view these data in the context of previous electron microscopy studies on BBB GLUT1 localization especially with regard to the nature of the antisera used in the respective studies. The first report on canine microvessels used a C-terminal antibody and reported an equal distribution of GLUT1 transporters between the luminal and abluminal membranes with a relatively low level (13%) of intracellular transporters (3Gerhart D.Z. LeVasseur R.J. Broderius M.A. Drewes L.R. J. Neurosci. Res... 1989; 22: 464-472Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in rat, rabbit, and human found an asymmetrical distribution between luminal:abluminal membranes (1:4) and a substantial (40%) intracellular pool of GLUT1 (12Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 5779-5783Google Scholar, 38Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Swartz B.E. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab... 1994; 14: 106-112Google Scholar, 39Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Landaw E.M. Brain Res... 1994; 663: 7-18Google Scholar). These studies also used a C-terminal-directed antibody, but in addition one study reported similar findings with an antibody raised against the purified human erythrocyte GLUT1 comparable with the H sera used in this study (12Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 5779-5783Google Scholar). When this human erythrocyte GLUT1 antiserum was later used to describe the microvascular distribution of GLUT1-resected tissue from the brain of a patient with hemangioblastoma and seizures, there was a significant detection of the luminal transporters relative to abluminal (26.4:20.5%) (6Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Black K.L. Cornford M.E. Vinters H.V. Pardridge W.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol... 1995; 54: 842-851Google Scholar). This observation was later confirmed in a subsequent, more extensive study (40Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Cornford M.E. Landaw E.M. Delgado-Escueta A.V. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab... 1998; 18: 26-42Google Scholar). The authors attributed the redistribution to a pathologic adaptation of BBB GLUT1. However, in light of the results of this study it could reflect equally the physiologic distribution detected with an antiserum to the whole protein. A likely explanation for the differences in antibody binding would be a modification of the C-terminal epitope. The C terminus was first shown to be a target for protein kinase C in human erythrocytes by Witterset al. (41Witters L.A. Vater C.A. Lienhard G.E. Nature.. 1985; 315: 777-778Google Scholar) and has since been shown to be phosphorylated upon activation of protein kinase C in a variety of cells (42Gibbs E.M. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1986; 261: 16597-16603Google Scholar, 43Nishimura H. Simpson I.A. Biochem. J... 1994; 302: 271-277Google Scholar). However, in none of the above studies was the interaction of the phosphorylated protein with a C-terminal-specific antibody assessed. The GLUT1 C terminus is replete with serine and threonine residues, and in addition to the protein kinase C site there are two consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Thus the potential for a covalent modification that alters epitope accessibility is certainly plausible. Therefore the next step in elucidating such a regulatory mechanism is to confirm such a phosphorylation, determine the appropriate kinase responsible, and investigate the role that the modification(s) play on the activity, localization, and recycling of the luminal GLUT1 protein. Clearly, the results of this study demonstrate that the mechanism(s) of glucose transport into the mammalian brain are far from resolved. Rather, these initial findings support asymmetries in distribution as well as in protein conformation between luminal and abluminal vessel membranes, thus opening a spectrum of questions on the regulation of glucose transport across the BBB.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking the osteogenic effects of BMPs and Runx2 and the expression of a bone matrix by osteoblastic cells are still largely unknown.BMPs were originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone formation (6Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar, 7Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7599-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This unique bone-inductive activity indicates that BMPs provide the primordial signals for osteodifferentiation, as supported by the BMP-induced expression of Runx2. As a sub-group of the TGF-β superfamily, BMPs signal through type I and type II serine/threonine receptors on the cell surface (8ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Curr. Opin.

These receptor-regulated Smads form a complex with the common partner Smad (Smad4) and translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors, including Xenopus FAST1 and its mammalian homologues and also the c-Jun·c-Fos complex, to regulate the transcription of target genes. A murine isoform of Runx2 was first identified as a binding protein of an osteoblast-specific “AACCACA” enhancer element (OSE2) of the osteocalcingene (14Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J.

Although the Runx·Smad complex likely regulates genes involved in the differentiation of bone, target genes for this complex have yet to be identified.To characterize genes involved in osteoblastic differentiation, we used differential display to identify genes expressed by proliferating fetal rat calvarial cells (FRCCs) that were up-regulated by BMP-7 (osteogenic protein-1; OP-1). From an initial screen we identified a novel gene, provisionally named AJ18 (19Jheon A. Ganss B. Cheifetz S. Sodek J. Goldberg M. Boskey A. Robinson C. Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL2000: 87-91Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of AJ18 as a zinc finger transcription factor that is transiently up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation and that appears to modulate osteogenic differentiation through effects on Runx2 activity.DISCUSSIONAlthough more than one hundred members of the KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein family have been described (32Bellefroid E.J.

Moreover, few target DNA sequences or target genes have been identified for KRAB/C2H2 proteins (34Mark C. Abrink M. Hellman L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated and characterized a novel zinc finger transcription factor, provisionally named AJ18, that is developmentally expressed in bone and that appears to regulate osteoblastic differentiation. AJ18 contains 11 C2H2 zinc finger motifs and an N-terminal Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB), which is believed to function as a repressor of transcription. We show that the zinc finger region of the molecule is involved in nuclear targeting and for selective binding of AJ18 to dsDNA containing a 5′-CCACA-3′ sequence, including the OSE2 for Runx2. Our studies further show that AJ18 can suppress the osteogenic effects of Runx2, a transcription factor that is crucial for bone development (5Rodan G.A. Harada S. Cell. 1997; 89: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and alkaline phosphatase activity in BMP-7-stimulated C3H10T1/2 cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first to identify a KRAB/C2H2 protein that is involved in regulating osteoblastic differentiation.The C2H2 or TFIIIA/Krüppel-type zinc finger proteins comprise a large family of genes that is divided into two classes according to the number of zinc finger motifs contained within the protein sequence (35Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In one class are zinc finger genes that code for proteins such as Egr-1, Sp1, andWT1, with fewer than five zinc finger motifs. The proteins in the group have generally been identified as transcriptional activators or repressors involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The proteins expressed by the second class of zinc finger genes have more than five zinc finger motifs and include AJ18. Although these genes are more abundant, apart from TFIIIA, which binds to both the 5S RNA gene and to 5 S RNA (36Theunissen O. Rudt F. Guddat U. Mentzel H. Pieler T. Cell. 1992; 71: 679-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and MZF1, which regulates the CD34 gene (37Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Davis B. Klemsz M. Xu D. Tenen D. Hromas R. Blood. 1995; 86: 3640-3647PubMed Google Scholar), the biological function of the proteins expressed by these genes is largely unknown.Approximately, one-third of all C2H2 zinc finger proteins contain a KRAB domain, which is not present in yeast proteins and appears to have evolved with multicellular organisms as a transcriptional repressor (38Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). KRAB domains can be separated into three subfamilies based on nucleic acid sequence alignment (34Mark C. Abrink M. Hellman L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar): subfamilies containing a KRAB A box alone, both A and B boxes, or an A box with a divergent B box. Based on amino acid (Fig. 3) and nucleic acid (data not shown) sequence alignments, AJ18 appears to be a member of the subfamily of genes possessing a classical KRAB A and divergent B box. Notably, the A domain alone is sufficient for repressor activity, whereas the B domain has a lesser contribution (38Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J.

A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain associates with TIF1β/KAP-1 (41Le Douarin B. You J. Nielsen A.L. Chambon P. Losson R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 42Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), which serves as a universal co-repressor for KRAB-containing transcription factors involved in silencing RNA pol II- and III-, but not pol I-, dependent transcription (44Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Thiesen H.J. Hagmann M. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, until recently neither target genes nor DNA target sequences have been identified for these transcription factors. Characterization of ZBRK1, has identified a novel 60-kDa zinc finger protein, with a KRAB domain and eight zinc fingers, that recognizes a GGGXXXCAGXXXTTT DNA sequence found in the growth regulatory gene GADD45. ZBRK interacts with BRCA1, which is required as a co-repressor in the regulation of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation (45Zheng L. Hongyi P. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Consistent with zinc finger proteins acting as transcription factors, we have shown, using an AJ18-GFP fusion protein and immunohistochemical analysis, that AJ18 is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6, 7) and that it binds a consensus DNA binding site that includes a 5′-CCACA-3′ sequence (Fig. 8 C). Moreover, analyses of the expression of a truncated form of AJ18 lacking the N-terminal KRAB domain revealed that the KRAB motif is not required for nuclear targeting or for DNA binding. We recognized that the DNA binding sequence for AJ18 is present within the consensus binding sequence for Runx2 (OSE2), which is present in the promoters of several genes, including osteopontin and osteocalcin that are involved in bone formation (31Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3605) Google Scholar). Our studies show that the OSE2 binds, under high stringency conditions of the target detection assay, to AJ18 in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 8 D). Notably, we were unable to establish conditions for electrophoretic mobility shift assays, suggesting that stabilization of the protein structure, afforded by the target detection assay, may be required for DNA binding. In this regard, ZNF74, a KRAB/C2H2protein whose primary sequence is similar to AJ18, has been shown to interact strongly with the nuclear matrix (46Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus in vivo, full-length AJ18 could strongly suppress transcriptional activity induced by Runx2 in a 6xOSE2-luciferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 10). This suppression could be mediated by the KRAB domain recruiting co-repressors such as TIF1β/KAP-1, or involve competition of the AJ18 and Runx2/Osf2 for OSE2 binding sequence. Because truncated AJ18, which lacks the KRAB domain, also suppressed Runx2-induced transcription of a 6xOSE2-luciferase reporter gene, the modulation of Runx2/Osf2 appears to involve competition between AJ18 and Runx2 for the OSE2 (Fig. 10). Because of the low transfection efficiency of the ROS17/2.8 cells used in transient transfection assays, we have not been able to determine whether AJ18 suppresses the endogenous expression of either osteocalcin or osteopontin. To answer this question, we are currently preparing stable transfectants of a rat bone marrow clonal cell line that undergoes osteogenic differentiation in vitro.That AJ18 may modulate Runx2-mediated osteogenic differentiation is indicated by the suppression of alkaline phosphatase expression in BMP-7-stimulated CH310T1/2 cells transfected with an AJ18 expression vector (Fig. 11). Although not an immediate target of Runx2, alkaline phosphatase is an early marker of osteogenic differentiation that is required for mineralization (47Lee M.H. Javed A. Kim H.J. Shin H.I. Gutierrez S. Choi J.Y. Rosen V. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Analysis of the temporal expression of AJ18 and Runx2 during bone formation in vivo and in vitro is also consistent with an interactive role of these transcription factors (Fig. 9), although the relative level of expression of the two proteins within the same cell is currently unknown. Both AJ18 and Runx2 are up-regulated early and are maximally expressed as osteoblastic differentiation occurs; the mRNA expression of both proteins being down-regulated as bone tissue formation is underway. However, the expression of AJ18 in other embryonic tissues, including kidney and brain, indicates a more general role for AJ18 in organogenesis.In summary, we have characterized a novel zinc finger transcription factor, expressed early in bone formation, which has the potential to modulate the osteo-inductive activities of Runx2. The characterization of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs1), their serine/threonine kinase membrane receptors, and downstream Smad effectors (reviewed in Refs. 1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Nature. 1998; 393: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) along with the identification ofRunx2/Cbfa-1/Osf2 (Runt domain factor 2/core binding factor α-1/osteoblast specific factor 2; reviewed in Ref. 4Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) as a master gene for osteogenesis (5Rodan G.A. Harada S. Cell. 1997; 89: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) has established a template for osteogenic differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the osteogenic effects of BMPs and Runx2 and the expression of a bone matrix by osteoblastic cells are still largely unknown. BMPs were originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone formation (6Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar, 7Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7599-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This unique bone-inductive activity indicates that BMPs provide the primordial signals for osteodifferentiation, as supported by the BMP-induced expression of Runx2. As a sub-group of the TGF-β superfamily, BMPs signal through type I and type II serine/threonine receptors on the cell surface (8ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, the type I receptor phosphorylates a family of Smad proteins. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 mediate BMP signaling (9Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M.O. Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). These receptor-regulated Smads form a complex with the common partner Smad (Smad4) and translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors, including Xenopus FAST1 and its mammalian homologues and also the c-Jun·c-Fos complex, to regulate the transcription of target genes. A murine isoform of Runx2 was first identified as a binding protein of an osteoblast-specific “AACCACA” enhancer element (OSE2) of the osteocalcingene (14Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Runx2-dependent gene expression increases in parallel with osteogenic differentiation (14Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G.

Moreover, Runx and Smads have been shown to functionally interact and stimulate transcription of the germline Ig Cα promoter for which binding of both factors to their specific binding sites is essential (18Hanai J.

Although the Runx·Smad complex likely regulates genes involved in the differentiation of bone, target genes for this complex have yet to be identified. To characterize genes involved in osteoblastic differentiation, we used differential display to identify genes expressed by proliferating fetal rat calvarial cells (FRCCs) that were up-regulated by BMP-7 (osteogenic protein-1; OP-1). From an initial screen we identified a novel gene, provisionally named AJ18 (19Jheon A. Ganss B. Cheifetz S. Sodek J. Goldberg M. Boskey A. Robinson C. Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL2000: 87-91Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of AJ18 as a zinc finger transcription factor that is transiently up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation and that appears to modulate osteogenic differentiation through effects on Runx2 activity. DISCUSSIONAlthough more than one hundred members of the KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein family have been described (32Bellefroid E.J. Lecocq P.J. Benhida A. Poncelet D.A. Belayew A. Martial J.A.

Moreover, few target DNA sequences or target genes have been identified for KRAB/C2H2 proteins (34Mark C. Abrink M. Hellman L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated and characterized a novel zinc finger transcription factor, provisionally named AJ18, that is developmentally expressed in bone and that appears to regulate osteoblastic differentiation. AJ18 contains 11 C2H2 zinc finger motifs and an N-terminal Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB), which is believed to function as a repressor of transcription. We show that the zinc finger region of the molecule is involved in nuclear targeting and for selective binding of AJ18 to dsDNA containing a 5′-CCACA-3′ sequence, including the OSE2 for Runx2. Our studies further show that AJ18 can suppress the osteogenic effects of Runx2, a transcription factor that is crucial for bone development (5Rodan G.A. Harada S. Cell. 1997; 89: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and alkaline phosphatase activity in BMP-7-stimulated C3H10T1/2 cells.

Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). KRAB domains can be separated into three subfamilies based on nucleic acid sequence alignment (34Mark C. Abrink M. Hellman L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar): subfamilies containing a KRAB A box alone, both A and B boxes, or an A box with a divergent B box. Based on amino acid (Fig. 3) and nucleic acid (data not shown) sequence alignments, AJ18 appears to be a member of the subfamily of genes possessing a classical KRAB A and divergent B box. Notably, the A domain alone is sufficient for repressor activity, whereas the B domain has a lesser contribution (38Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J.

Georgiev O. Thiesen H.J. Hagmann M. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, until recently neither target genes nor DNA target sequences have been identified for these transcription factors. Characterization of ZBRK1, has identified a novel 60-kDa zinc finger protein, with a KRAB domain and eight zinc fingers, that recognizes a GGGXXXCAGXXXTTT DNA sequence found in the growth regulatory gene GADD45. ZBRK interacts with BRCA1, which is required as a co-repressor in the regulation of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation (45Zheng L. Hongyi P. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Consistent with zinc finger proteins acting as transcription factors, we have shown, using an AJ18-GFP fusion protein and immunohistochemical analysis, that AJ18 is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6, 7) and that it binds a consensus DNA binding site that includes a 5′-CCACA-3′ sequence (Fig. 8 C). Moreover, analyses of the expression of a truncated form of AJ18 lacking the N-terminal KRAB domain revealed that the KRAB motif is not required for nuclear targeting or for DNA binding. We recognized that the DNA binding sequence for AJ18 is present within the consensus binding sequence for Runx2 (OSE2), which is present in the promoters of several genes, including osteopontin and osteocalcin that are involved in bone formation (31Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3605) Google Scholar). Our studies show that the OSE2 binds, under high stringency conditions of the target detection assay, to AJ18 in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 8 D). Notably, we were unable to establish conditions for electrophoretic mobility shift assays, suggesting that stabilization of the protein structure, afforded by the target detection assay, may be required for DNA binding. In this regard, ZNF74, a KRAB/C2H2protein whose primary sequence is similar to AJ18, has been shown to interact strongly with the nuclear matrix (46Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus in vivo, full-length AJ18 could strongly suppress transcriptional activity induced by Runx2 in a 6xOSE2-luciferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 10). This suppression could be mediated by the KRAB domain recruiting co-repressors such as TIF1β/KAP-1, or involve competition of the AJ18 and Runx2/Osf2 for OSE2 binding sequence. Because truncated AJ18, which lacks the KRAB domain, also suppressed Runx2-induced transcription of a 6xOSE2-luciferase reporter gene, the modulation of Runx2/Osf2 appears to involve competition between AJ18 and Runx2 for the OSE2 (Fig. 10). Because of the low transfection efficiency of the ROS17/2.8 cells used in transient transfection assays, we have not been able to determine whether AJ18 suppresses the endogenous expression of either osteocalcin or osteopontin. To answer this question, we are currently preparing stable transfectants of a rat bone marrow clonal cell line that undergoes osteogenic differentiation in vitro. That AJ18 may modulate Runx2-mediated osteogenic differentiation is indicated by the suppression of alkaline phosphatase expression in BMP-7-stimulated CH310T1/2 cells transfected with an AJ18 expression vector (Fig. 11). Although not an immediate target of Runx2, alkaline phosphatase is an early marker of osteogenic differentiation that is required for mineralization (47Lee M.H. Javed A. Kim H.J. Shin H.I. Gutierrez S. Choi J.Y. Rosen V. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Analysis of the temporal expression of AJ18 and Runx2 during bone formation in vivo and in vitro is also consistent with an interactive role of these transcription factors (Fig. 9), although the relative level of expression of the two proteins within the same cell is currently unknown. Both AJ18 and Runx2 are up-regulated early and are maximally expressed as osteoblastic differentiation occurs; the mRNA expression of both proteins being down-regulated as bone tissue formation is underway. However, the expression of AJ18 in other embryonic tissues, including kidney and brain, indicates a more general role for AJ18 in organogenesis. In summary, we have characterized a novel zinc finger transcription factor, expressed early in bone formation, which has the potential to modulate the osteo-inductive activities of Runx2. We are grateful to Dr. Kuber Sampath (Creative Biomolecules, Hopkington, MA) for providing the BMP-7 (OP-1) and to Dr. Gerard Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) for providing the mouse Runx2/Osf2 cDNA (pLA-Oa4) and the p6OSE2-luc reporter.

https://openalex.org/W1976153504,"Pantothenate, the precursor of coenzyme A, is an essential nutrient for the intraerythrocytic stage of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Pantothenate enters the malaria-infected erythrocyte via new permeation pathways induced by the parasite in the host cell membrane (Saliba, K. J., Horner, H. A., and Kirk, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10190–10195). We show here that pantothenate is taken up by the intracellular parasite via a novel H+-coupled transporter, quite different from the Na+-coupled transporters that mediate pantothenate uptake into mammalian cells. The plasmodial H+:pantothenate transporter has a low affinity for pantothenate (Km ∼23 mm) and a stoichiometry of 1 H+:1 pantothenate. It is inhibited by low concentrations of the bioflavonoid phloretin and the thiol-modifying agent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate. On entering the parasite, pantothenate is phosphorylated (and thereby trapped) by an unusually high affinity pantothenate kinase (Km ∼300 nm). The combination of H+-coupled transporter and kinase provides the parasite with an efficient, high affinity pantothenate uptake system, which is distinct from that of the host and is therefore an attractive target for antimalarial chemotherapy.

The mechanisms by which it does so remain poorly understood. One important nutrient for which the human parasite P. falciparum has an absolute extracellular requirement is the vitamin pantothenic acid (PA1, vitamin B5) (1Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), a precursor of the enzyme cofactor coenzyme A (CoA) (2Tahiliani A.G. Beinlich C.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 165-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PA is impermeant to normal, uninfected human erythrocytes but enters P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes via “new permeation pathways” induced by the intracellular parasite in the host cell membrane (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Once inside the parasitized cell, PA is taken up by the parasite where it is phosphorylated by pantothenate kinase (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the first step in its conversion to CoA. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which PA is taken up across the plasma membrane of the intracellular malaria parasite. The results demonstrate the presence in the parasite membrane of a low affinity H+:pantothenate symporter, which acts in combination with a high affinity kinase within the parasite to form a highly efficient uptake system. The characteristics of the H+-dependent pantothenate transporter are quite different from those of its Na+-dependent counterparts in mammalian cells, raising the possibility that it may be a suitable antimalarial drug target. P. falciparum parasites (FAF6, cloned from ITG2, (4Biggs B.A. Gooze L. Wycherley K. Wollish W. Southwell B. Leech J.H. Brown G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9171-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) were maintained in synchronous in vitro cultures as described previously (5Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar), with modifications (6Cranmer S.L. Magowan C. Liang J. Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 91: 363-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out on late-stage trophozoites (36–40 h post-invasion) isolated from their host cells using saponin (0.05% w/v) as described previously (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Saponin permeabilizes both the host cell membrane and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (8Ansorge I. Paprotka K. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), thereby allowing solutes present in the extracellular medium unimpeded access to the parasite plasma membrane. Measurements of the uptake of [14C]PA into parasites within saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes were carried out as described previously (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In experiments designed to allow investigation of the uptake of [14C]PA under conditions in which the phosphorylation of the radiolabeled compound within the cell was minimized, isolated parasites were depleted of ATP by suspending them in a glucose-free, HEPES-buffered saline (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) for 30–60 min at 37 °C (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ATP-depleted parasites were then harvested by centrifugation (2060 × g, 8 min) and resuspended in a weakly buffered solution (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) at 0.6–1.7 × 109cells/ml, before combining 1 volume of the ATP-depleted parasite suspension with 12 volumes of a heavily buffered solution (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 20 mm MES, 1 mm MgCl2), pH-adjusted to either 5.5 or 7.4 and containing [14C]PA (± inhibitors), to give a final PA concentration of 2 μm and a [14C]PA activity of 0.1 μCi/ml. At predetermined intervals 0.2-ml aliquots of the suspension were removed and centrifuged through an oil layer to terminate the flux as described elsewhere (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments the ion dependence of [14C]PA uptake into isolated parasites was compared with that of [14C]PA uptake into mammalian cells (the rat hepatoma cell line, HTC). The HTC cells were grown as adherent cultures under standard conditions and were released into suspension (to allow the use of identical methodology to that used with the isolated parasites) by trypsinization. Uptake of [14C]PA into HTC cells in suspension was carried out using the same solutions and under identical conditions to those used for the isolated parasites. The water volume of the cell pellets (both for isolated parasites and HTC cells) was estimated using a combination of [3H]water and [14C]sucrose as described elsewhere (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The water volumes of the isolated parasites and HTC cells used in this study were estimated as 20 ± 2 fl (mean ± S.E.; n = 13) and 67 ± 1 fl (mean ± range/2; n = 2), respectively. Phosphorylation of [14C]PA by cell lysates prepared from isolated parasites was monitored as described previously (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were either used immediately or frozen and stored at −70 °C for subsequent analysis. It was confirmed in control experiments that no loss of activity occurred during cryostorage. The cytosolic pH (pHi) of the isolated parasites was monitored using the intracellular fluorescent pH indicator BCECF, as described previously (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out at 37 °C (except where specified otherwise) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorometer, with gentle stirring of the cell suspension. The buffering capacity of the parasite cytosol (βi) was measured both at 37 °C and 5 °C by the additions of varying concentrations (10–40 mm) of either NH4+ or butyrate to isolated parasites suspended in either the presence or absence of glucose. The removal of glucose results in a decrease in pHi of about 0.2 pH units (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and served the purpose of increasing the pHi range over which βi could be estimated. The discrepancy between the change in pHi predicted to occur upon addition of different concentrations of either NH4+ or butyrate, and that actually observed, allows the calculation of βi (10Boyer M.J. Hedley D.W. Methods. Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For parasites at 37 °C, βi decreased approximately linearly with pHi, from ∼30 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit) at pHi 7.5, to ∼50 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit) at pHi 7.1. At pHi values below 7.1, βi increased more steeply with decreasing pHi, reaching a value of ∼150 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit) at a pHi of 6.9. Linear regression analysis of the pHi dependence of βi in the pHi range 7.5–7.1 yielded an estimated βi value of 42.2 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit) at the normal resting pHi of 7.3. This value was used in the evaluation of the H+ transport rates in all experiments carried out at 37 °C. For parasites at 5 °C, βi remained at ∼30 mmol of H+/(l·pH unit) over the pHi range 7.5–7.1, and increased only marginally to ∼50 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit) when the pHi was decreased further to 7.0. The βi value at the resting pHi at 5 °C (7.22 ± 0.02; mean ± S.E.; n = 4) was estimated to be 32.3 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit). Because the βi values at the resting pHi values at 37 °C and 5 °C were similar, an average βi value of 37.3 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit) was used for the estimation of H+ influx rates in the analysis of the experiment (giving rise to Fig. 6) in which H+ influx was measured as a function of temperature in the range 16–37 °C. Uptake of [14C]PA into isolated P. falciparumtrophozoites was independent of the presence of Na+ in the extracellular solution. The initial rate of accumulation of [14C]PA in parasites suspended in a HEPES-buffered saline solution, estimated from the initial slope of the uptake time course (Fig. 1 A), was 2.8 ± 0.4 μmol/(1012 parasites.h) (mean ± S.E.;n = 4). This was not significantly different from that in parasites suspended in Na+-free solution, containing choline in place of Na+ (2.7 ± 0.4 μmol/(1012 parasites.h); n = 4;p = 0.2, paired t test). This contrasts with the situation in mammalian cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, the uptake of [14C]PA into rat hepatoma (HTC) cells was wholly dependent upon the presence of Na+ in the extracellular medium, decreasing to a negligible level on replacement of Na+ with choline. Although independent of the presence of extracellular Na+, the rate of [14C]PA uptake did show a marked dependence on the extracellular pH (Fig. 1 C). For isolated parasites suspended in RPMI at pH 8.5 the initial rate of uptake was 0.5 ± 0.2 μmol/(1012 parasites.h). Decreasing the pH of the medium (pHo) from 8.5 to 7.4 caused the initial rate of uptake to increase significantly (p = 0.042) to 1.1 ± 0.2 μmol/(1012 parasites.h). Decreasing the pHofurther to 6.5 caused the initial rate of uptake to increase even further (p = 0.009), to 1.7 ± 0.2 μmol/(1012 parasites.h). Isolated trophozoites accumulated [14C]PA to levels many-fold higher than that in the extracellular medium (Fig. 1,A and C) and the data of Fig. 1 C are consistent with a role for H+ in the PA uptake process. As has been shown previously (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), however, PA entering the parasite is phosphorylated, the first step in its conversion to coenzyme A. The accumulation of radiolabel under the conditions of Fig. 1 therefore arises from a combination of the transport of the compound into the parasites and its subsequent “metabolic trapping” within the parasites (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of H+ ions in the transport of PA into the parasite, in the absence of interference from metabolism, uptake of [14C]PA was measured into parasites depleted of ATP (by preincubation in a glucose-free solution at pH 7.4; see “Experimental Procedures”) and therefore unable to carry out the phosphorylation of PA. The ATP-depleted parasites lose the ability to regulate their cytosolic pH (pHi), which, over a period of several minutes, therefore approaches the pH of the preincubation medium (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Following ATP depletion, the cells were resuspended (at t = 0) in media of either pH 5.5 or 7.4 (i.e. in either the presence or absence, respectively, of a substantial initial inward [H+] gradient). In the absence of a significant inward [H+] gradient (Fig. 2 A, open symbols) there was a gradual uptake of [14C]PA, with the intracellular radiolabel reaching a concentration of around 0.8 times that in the extracellular solution by 5 min. By contrast, in ATP-depleted parasites suspended in the presence of a substantial inward [H+] gradient (Fig. 2 A, closed symbols), there was a rapid uptake of radiolabel into the parasites. The ratio of the intracellular concentration of radiolabel to the extracellular concentration of radiolabel (the so-called “distribution ratio”) reached a maximum value of 6–7 at 1–2 min, before declining. Cell extracts corresponding to each of the time points shown by theclosed symbols in Fig. 2 A were analyzed for the presence of phosphorylated [14C]PA using Somogyi reagent (3Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Throughout the time course the majority (>80%) of the PA taken up by the parasites remained unphosphorylated. The accumulation of [14C]PA, within the ATP-depleted parasites, to concentrations much higher than that in the extracellular medium, as seen in parasites suspended in the presence (but not in the absence) of an inward [H+] gradient, may therefore be attributed primarily to active accumulation of (non-phosphorylated) [14C]PA. The inability of the ATP-depleted parasites to regulate their pHi meant that those suspended in the acidic medium underwent a progressive acidification (Fig. 2 B). This accounts for the observed decline in the PA distribution ratio following its reaching a maximum at 1–2 min (Fig. 2 A, closed symbols). Fig. 2 C shows the effect of a number of reagents on the uptake of [14C]PA by ATP-depleted parasites suspended in the presence of an inward [H+] gradient, whereas Fig.2 B illustrates the effect of the different reagents tested on the time-dependent dissipation of the [H+] gradient. In this set of experiments, the distribution ratio in the absence of inhibitors reached a value of ∼4.5 in the 1-min incubation period. The H+ ionophore carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (10 μm) caused a rapid dissipation of the imposed [H+] gradient (Fig. 2 C) and caused the distribution ratio attained in 1 min to decrease to just below 1, a similar value to that seen in cells suspended in the absence of a transmembrane [H+] gradient at pHo 7.4 (Fig. 2 C). Phloretin (200 μm), and the two sulfhydryl reagents pCMBS (10 μm) and N-ethylmaleimide (2 mm), were all found to reduce the uptake of [14C]PA by ≥ 70% (p ≤ 0.008; Fig.2 B). Unlike CCCP, however, these reagents did not increase the rate of dissipation of the imposed [H+] gradient (Fig. 2 B) and their inhibitory effect on [14C]PA uptake may therefore be attributed to an inhibition of the actual transport mechanism rather than a dissipation of the driving force for PA influx. The data of Fig. 2, demonstrating H+-dependent PA transport, are consistent with the hypothesis that pantothenate is transported across the parasite plasma membrane via a H+-coupled process. This was explored further by investigating the effect of pantothenate on the pHiof the isolated parasites. As shown in Fig.3 A, the initial resting pHi of the parasites at 37 °C was in the range 7.30–7.35. Addition of pantothenate (2–40 mm) to the suspending medium resulted in a transient, concentration-dependent acidification of the parasite cytosol, consistent with H+entering the parasite. The time courses for the initial acidification were fitted to a first order exponential equation (Fig. 3 B) and the initial slope (i.e. the initial rate of acidification of the cytosol) was calculated for each of the fitted curves. This was multiplied by the intracellular buffering capacity (42.2 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.pH unit)) to give an initial rate of H+ influx at each of the pantothenate concentrations tested. Fig. 3 C shows the initial H+ influx rate as a function of the extracellular pantothenate concentration. The data, showing a non-linear dependence of H+ influx rate on pantothenate concentration, were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, giving an estimatedKm of 22.6 ± 2.3 mm andVmax of 56.3 ± 2.2 mmol of H+/(l cell H2O.min) (mean ± S.E.;n = 4). The water volume of a single isolated P. falciparum trophozoite estimated in this study was 20 fl (“Experimental Procedures”); the estimatedVmax is therefore equivalent to a PA-induced H+ influx of 1.13 ± 0.04 mmol of H+/(1012 cells.min). Phloretin and pCMBS, shown in Fig.2 C to inhibit H+-dependent [14C]PA uptake, were both found to be effective inhibitors of the pantothenate-induced acidification. The addition of 200 μm phloretin to ATP-replete parasites caused a slight apparent alkalinization of the cytosol (by an undetermined mechanism) and an almost complete inhibition of the acidification caused by the addition of 40 mm PA (not shown). To eliminate the possibility that the inhibition of H+ influx was related to the apparent phloretin-induced alkalinization, the experiment was repeated in parasites depleted of ATP, which caused pHi to decrease from 7.3 to 7.1 (Fig.4 A and Ref. 7Saliba K.J.

As shown in Fig. 4 A, 200 μm phloretin inhibited the pantothenate-induced acidification in ATP-depleted parasites almost completely. Fig. 4 B shows the concentration dependence of the inhibition by phloretin of the pantothenate-induced acidification; the IC50 (i.e. the concentration of phloretin at which inhibition was half-maximal) was 16.4 ± 2.6 μm (mean ± S.E.; n = 3; Fig.4 B). The sulfhydryl reagent, pCMBS, was an even more potent inhibitor of the pantothenate-induced acidification, exerting an unusual “all-or-none” effect. In initial experiments it was found that pCMBS concentrations as low as 0.3 μmcaused complete inhibition of the pantothenate-induced acidification (Fig. 4 C). However, it was also found that inhibition of the pantothenate-induced acidification by pCMBS was dependent upon the concentration of cells present in the suspension; 0.391 μm pCMBS abolished pantothenate-induced acidification in parasites suspended at a concentration of 4.3 × 106 cells/ml while having no effect on pantothenate-induced acidification in parasites suspended at 8.6 × 106cells/ml (not shown). Fig. 4 D, showing the concentration dependence of the effect of pCMBS on pantothenate-induced acidification in a single representative experiment, illustrates the all-or-none effect. Under the conditions of the experiment, 0.781 μm pCMBS caused a complete inhibition of pantothenate-induced H+ influx whereas 0.391 μm pCMBS was without significant effect. The data in Figs. 2 and 3, together, constitute good evidence for PA entering the parasite via a H+:pantothenate symport process. The stoichiometry of the process was investigated by comparing the maximum decrease in pHi(ΔpHimax) observed following the addition of increasing concentrations of pantothenate (2.5–40 mm) with that observed following the addition of the same concentrations of the more lipophilic monocarboxylate, butyrate. Butyrate crosses membranes rapidly in the undissociated form;i.e. with an effective stoichiometry of transport of 1 H+:1 butyrate (11Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 861-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For the purpose of these experiments the isolated parasites were depleted of ATP to minimize H+pump-mediated pH recovery within the time taken for the pantothenate- and butyrate-induced acidification. The addition of butyrate to the isolated parasites caused an extremely rapid acidification (Fig. 5 A); ΔpHimax was attained within 4 s and was followed by a slow, progressive alkalinization, reflecting the leakage of H+ out of the cell, down the outward [H+] gradient. The pantothenate-induced acidification was substantially slower than the butyrate-induced acidification, taking ∼150 s for ΔpHimax to be reached in the ATP-depleted parasites (Fig. 5 A). Fig. 5 Bcompares the ΔpHimaxfollowing the addition of increasing concentrations of pantothenate or butyrate. In the case of pantothenate, the influx was sufficiently slow for there to have been significant leakage of H+ out of the parasite, down the [H+] gradient, during the ∼150 s required for ΔpHimax to be attained. To make a quantitative comparison of the relative magnitude of the H+ uptake induced by the influx of butyrate and pantothenate, it was therefore necessary to correct the ΔpHimax measured following addition of pantothenate, for the significant H+ leakage that occurred during the period of pantothenate influx (as described in the legend to Fig. 5). The corrected pantothenate-induced ΔpHimax values (Fig.5 B, open circles) were very similar to the butyrate-induced ΔpHimaxvalues (Fig. 5 B, closed circles), consistent with pantothenate and H+ entering the parasite with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The transport process is therefore electroneutral. The pantothenate-induced H+ influx was highly sensitive to temperature. Upon reduction of the temperature from 37 °C to 5–10 °C, pantothenate-induced H+ influx was abolished (Fig. 6 A). An Arrhenius plot was linear over the temperature range 16–37 °C (Fig. 6 B) and yielded an estimated activation energy for pantothenate-induced H+ influx of 89 ± 6 kJ/mol (mean ± S.E.;n = 3). The kinetics of the phosphorylation of PA, within the parasite, was investigated in parasite lysates. The rate of phosphorylation was measured over the PA concentration range 0.1–0.75 μm, and the Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to the data (Fig. 7), yielding aKm of 0.28 ± 0.03 μm and aVmax of 10.8 ± 0.7 μmol/(1012 parasites.h). Pantothenic acid, one of the relatively few nutrients for which the intracellular malaria parasite P. falciparum has an absolute extracellular requirement (1Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), enters infected erythrocytes primarily via the new permeation pathways induced by the parasite in the host cell membrane (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). From the host cell cytosol, PA is presumed to enter the parasitophorous vacuole in which the parasite is enclosed, via the large-diameter pores characterized previously in the vacuole membrane (12Desai S.A. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). From the parasitophorous vacuole, PA is taken up across the parasite plasma membrane. The results of this study shed light on the mechanism by which this is achieved. In this study we have used parasites functionally isolated from their host cells by brief exposure of the parasitized cells to saponin. Saponin permeabilizes the erythrocyte membrane to both low and high molecular weight solutes (including host cell proteins), as well as making the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (already highly permeable to low molecular weight solutes (12Desai S.A. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)) permeable to proteins (8Ansorge I. Paprotka K. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By contrast the parasite plasma membrane remains intact, able to support transmembrane ion gradients (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There is a possibility that the solution within the parasitophorous vacuole compartment acts as an unstirred layer, influencing the rate of passage of solutes into the isolated parasites as well as the concentration of solutes in the immediate vicinity of the parasite plasma membrane. However, the finding in this study that butyrate equilibrates between the intra- and extracellular solutions within 3–4 s, and the earlier observation that NH3 does so even faster (in < 2 s (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)) would indicate that our measurements of pantothenate transport (which is more than an order of magnitude slower than that of either butyrate or NH3) are not subject to significant unstirred layer effects (13Stein W.D. Transport and Diffusion Across Cell Membranes. Academic Press, London1986: 1-52Crossref Google Scholar). PA is transported across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells via a well-characterized family of Na+:pantothenate symporters ((14–17) and see Fig. 1 B). By contrast, the uptake of PA into the intracellular malaria parasite is independent of Na+, but is, instead, dependent on H+. The demonstration, in Fig. 2 A, that an inward [H+] gradient can drive the active accumulation of [14C]PA (to a distribution ratio ≫ 1) and the demonstration in Fig. 3 that an inward [PA] gradient can drive the net influx of H+, together, constitute good evidence for the operation of a H+:pantothenate symport process, operating with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (Fig. 5). These data do not distinguish between simple diffusion of the undissociated acid, and a transporter-mediated process. However the findings that pantothenate-driven H+influx is saturable (Km = 22.6 ± 2.3 mm; Fig. 3) and that both H+-driven PA influx (Fig. 2 A) and pantothenate-driven H+ influx (Fig. 3 A) are inhibited by phloretin and by sulfhydryl reagents are consistent with the involvement of a transporter. So too is the finding that the transport process has a relatively high activation energy (Ea = 89 ± 6 kJ/mol; Fig. 6), which is in the range of those reported previously for transporters in other systems and higher than that usually associated with the process of simple diffusion (18Ellory J.C. Hall A.C. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1987; 41: 53-66PubMed Google Scholar). The H+-coupling of pantothenate transport may allow the parasite to take advantage of the H+ gradient normally present across the parasite plasma membrane in accumulating PA from the extracellular medium. The normal pHi of the parasite is 7.3–7.4 (Refs. 7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Bosia A. Ghigo D.

Yamada H. Mitamura T. Horii T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34353-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). There is therefore a significant inward [H+] gradient, favoring the net accumulation of PA, although the intracellular concentration of PA will be determined not only by the stoichiometry of the transporter but by the relative rates of transport and metabolism of the vitamin under in vivoconditions. The H+:pantothenate symporter of the intracellular malaria parasite differs from the Na+:pantothenate symporters of the host not only in its cation requirements, but in its substrate affinity. Although the relatively high Km for the process could not be measured with a high degree of accuracy (without exposing the parasites to excessively high concentrations of the pantothenate salt) it is evident that the transport of PA into the parasite occurs via a low affinity process. The estimatedKm of ∼23 mm contrasts with those of PA transporters elsewhere. The H+-coupled pantothenate transporter of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has aKm of 3.5 μm (22Stolz J. Sauer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18747-18752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the prokaryotes Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli have Na+-coupled pantothenate transporters withKm values of 0.8 μm (23Germinario R.J. Waller J.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and 0.4 μm (24Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The Na+-coupled multivitamin transporters of mammalian cells have aKm for pantothenate of 1.5–4.9 μm(14Wang H. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Xia H. Yang-Feng T.L. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Prasad P.D.

Schweitzer C. Pearson J. Song W.O. Windham C.T. Wyse B.W. Hansen R.G. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1989; 50: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the comparatively low affinity of the parasite's PA transporter, the parasite's pantothenate kinase has a significantly higher affinity for pantothenate than its mammalian counterparts. The kinase phosphorylates and thereby traps the PA within the parasite cytosol, doing so with a Km (∼0.28 μm) that is some 40-fold lower than that of the highest affinity mammalian pantothenate kinase described to date (from rat liver; Km ∼12 μm (26Khomich T.I. Moiseenok A.G. Voskoboev A.I. Biokhimiia. 1990; 55: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar)), as well as being significantly lower than that of the high affinity transporters of the cells of the host. Thus, although the transporter in the parasite plasma membrane is a low affinity system, the combination of the transporter and the kinase serves as a high affinity uptake system that should enable the parasite to compete very effectively with the cells of the host for this key nutrient. The H+:pantothenate symporter described here is, to our knowledge, the first example described of a H+-coupled nutrient transporter in P. falciparum. The only previous description of a H+:pantothenate symporter in a eukaryote cell is in the yeast S. cerevisiae (22Stolz J. Sauer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18747-18752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the view that the physiology of the malaria parasite resembles that of lower eukaryotes, such as plants and yeast (7Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), more closely than it does that of mammalian cells. The PA transporters of mammalian cells are Na+-dependent systems with characteristics quite different from those of the H+:pantothenate symporter described here. The finding here that the pantothenate kinase of the parasite has a substrate affinity substantially higher than that of any of the mammalian pantothenate kinases described to date may be indicative of there also being significant differences between the mammalian and parasite forms of this enzyme. Such differences, together with the previously demonstrated importance of PA for parasite growth (1Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), focus attention on the possibility that the mechanisms involved in the uptake of PA by the intracellular malaria parasite are suitable targets for new and much-needed antimalarial drugs. We are grateful to Pauline Junankar for the provision of HTC cells, to Jemma Elliott for the estimation of the buffering capacity of the isolated parasites, and to the staff of the Canberra branch of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service for the provision of blood for use in parasite culture."

Our data suggest that the association with HSP90 may regulate intracellular protein stability and solubility of MOK. Experiments with a series of deletion mutants of MOK indicated that the region encompassing the protein kinase catalytic subdomains I–IV is required for HSP90 binding. Closely related protein kinases (male germ cell-associated kinase and male germ cell-associated kinase-related kinase) were also found to associate with HSP90, whereas conventional mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase) were not associated with HSP90. In addition, we found that other molecular chaperones including Cdc37, HSC70, HSP70, and HSP60 but not GRP94, FKBP52, or Hop were detected specifically in the MOK-HSP90 immunocomplexes.

In mammalian systems, three major types of MAP kinases, namely ERK, p38, and JNK/SAPK, have been identified and characterized extensively. Recently, striking progress in molecular cloning techniques and in bioinformatics has greatly facilitated homology-based discoveries of novel protein kinases that are more or less closely related to conventional MAP kinases (9Miyata Y. Nishida E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Among them, protein kinase catalytic domains of ERK5 (10Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) are highly homologous to those of conventional MAP kinases, and activation mechanisms and downstream targets of ERK5 have been described (for review, see Ref.13Kato Y. Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Lee J.D. Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 233-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently identified and cloned a novel member of the MAP kinase superfamily, MOK, by a computer search of the expressed sequence tags database followed by screening of human and mouse cDNA (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MOK is most similar to previously identified protein kinases, male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK) (15Matsushime H. Jinno A. Takagi N. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and MAK-related kinase (MRK) (16Abe S. Yagi T. Ishiyama S. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Ikawa Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2187-2195PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase catalytic domains of MOK, MAK, and MRK are highly homologous to that of conventional MAP kinases, especially at their activation loops where all of them encode the MAP kinase characteristic TXY motifs (9Miyata Y. Nishida E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). MRK is abundantly expressed in ovary, whereas MAK and MOK are abundant in testis; hence they are postulated to play roles in regulating the meiotic cell division in reproductive tissues. Previously we observed that MAP kinase-stimulating treatment of cells including serum addition, anisomycin treatment, and osmotic shock did not significantly activate MOK (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that specific upstream signal-transducing molecules are involved in the activation processes of MOK. Treatment of cells with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activated MOK, and the activity of MOK was dependent on its phosphorylation status (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but the precise physiological functions and cellular regulatory factors of MOK remain unknown. Catalytic subunits of certain protein kinases are associated with cellular proteins. cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit is complexed with a regulatory subunit (for a review, see Ref.17Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CK2 (casein kinase II) is composed of catalytic α and α′ subunits and a regulatory β subunit (18Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 19Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Cell cycle-regulated Cdk protein kinases are accompanied by their specific activating subunits, cyclins (20Nigg E.A.

The specific associations of noncatalytic proteins are important for catalytic subunits in their regulation such as inhibitory control, signal-dependent activation, substrate recognition, or cellular localization. More generally, a number of protein kinases are known to be associated with cellular molecular chaperones. Among many molecular chaperones, HSP90 and Cdc37 are often observed to be complexed with signal-regulated protein kinases such as pp60v-src (27Brugge J.S. Erikson E. Erikson R.L.

HSP90 is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in all organisms and tissues and associates with various kinds of important cellular proteins including transcription factors and protein kinases, thus assisting correct folding and functions of target proteins (36Yahara I.

To elucidate the physiological function and regulation of MOK, we have biochemically searched for cellular binding proteins of MOK in this report and identified several cellular MOK-associating proteins. The results have revealed that the associated proteins consist of a specific set of molecular chaperones including HSP90 and Cdc37. Functional importance of the association of molecular chaperones on the stability of MOK has been presented and discussed. Plasmids encoding HA-tagged MOK (wild type and kinase-dead) were described previously (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Anti-Cdc37 (C-19), anti-HSP/HSC70 (clone W27 that recognizes both HSP70 and HSC70), anti-HSP70 (goat polyclonal, specific for HSP70), anti-HSC70 (goat polyclonal, specific for HSC70), and anti-ERK2 (clone D-2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-mammalian Hop/STI1 (clone 28) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech (against rabbit and mouse primary antibodies) and from Santa Cruz (against goat primary antibodies). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-MAK polyclonal antibody was described previously (15Matsushime H. Jinno A. Takagi N. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and stock solution was prepared at 10 mm in Me2SO. MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem, and stock solution was made at 10 mm in Me2SO. Tran35S-label (mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals. A series of deletion mutants of MOK was produced by in vitro mutagenesis of plasmids as described below. C-terminal deletion mutants were made by introducing stop codons at the indicated sites to make truncated proteins. For example, MOK(N107) encodes amino acids 1–107 of MOK. N-terminal deletion mutants were made by introducing a newMfeI restriction enzyme site by in vitromutagenesis at the indicated positions. The wild type mouse MOK coding region possesses a unique MfeI site near its N-terminal end (amino acid 7); thus MfeI treatment and self-ligation of plasmids after introducing an additional MfeI site resulted in the N-terminal deletion mutants. For example, MOK(D8–195) encodes a protein with amino acids 1–7 fused to the sequence from amino acid 196 to the end of MOK, lacking amino acids 8–195. Site-directed in vitro mutagenesis was performed using mutagenic primers and DpnI digestion essentially as described (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sense sequences of mutagenic primers used were 5′-GAGAAAAAGATTATGCTCTAGATGTATCAGCTG-3′ for MOK(N107), 5′-CACCGACGGGTTCTAGACATACAAGATGGACC-3′ for MOK(N178), 5′-CAGCACCCCTATTTCTAGATGCAGAGGGCAGC-3′ for MOK(N285), 5′-CAGAAAATCTGGTTCAATTGCACTAATATG-3′ for MOK(D8–078), 5′-CTGCGTGTTCTACGCAATTGCCAGCCTGCAGC-3′ for MOK(D8–195), and 5′-GTCCCAAGTTCTCAATTGTGCCAGAATCATC-3′ for MOK(D8–309). COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Mammalian expression plasmids encoding various MOK constructs were transfected into COS7 cells by electroporation as described previously (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared, and the tagged protein was immunoprecipitated as described (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of FLAG-tagged proteins, beads that had been covalently conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody were used. For large scale affinity purification of FLAG-MOK and its associated proteins, anti-FLAG affinity beads were packed into a column (inner diameter = 0.5 cm), and cell extract was applied to the column three times followed by extensive washing with cell lysis buffer before elution. COS7 cells were transfected with HA-MOK plasmid as above. 48 h later, the culture medium was replaced with Met- and Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated with or without geldanamycin (5 μm) for 2 h. Then cells were labeled with [35S]Met/[35S]Cys in fresh Met- and Cys-free medium with or without geldanamycin for 2 h. Next, radioactive medium was removed, and cells were further incubated for chase in complete medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for various times indicated before lysis. When indicated, geldanamycin (5 μm) was also included during the chase period. The amount of radiolabeled MOK was determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography of dried gels. MOK-transfected COS7 cells were treated with MG132 (25 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 3 h then with geldanamycin (5 μm) or control Me2SO for 2 or 4 h. MG132 was also included in the medium during the incubation with geldanamycin. Cells were collected as described above and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatants were recovered as soluble fractions, and the precipitates were solubilized by adding diluted (5:7) SDS sample buffer and then boiling for 5 min to obtain insoluble fractions. MOK-associated proteins were isolated by using anti-FLAG affinity beads as described above. The associated proteins were eluted by treating the beads twice with a high salt buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Eluted proteins were diluted 10× in a buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and applied on a MonoQ ion exchange column. The column was washed extensively with 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and bound proteins were eluted and purified by a liner salt gradient (100 mm to 1.5 m NaCl) in 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Finally protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were cut out from the gel. The gel pieces were equilibrated in a buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and homogenized in diluted (5:7) SDS sample buffer, and then the gel suspensions were applied to a second SDS-PAGE for analysis. Human HSP90α cDNA was originally from Dr. K. Yokoyama (51Yamazaki M. Akaogi K. Miwa T. Imai T. Soeda E. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The coding region was inserted into the EcoRI site of pMAL-cRI (New England Biolabs) by blunt ligation. The resulting expression plasmid encodes human HSP90α with maltose-binding protein in the N termini. The plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli host strain TB1. After reaching an A 600 level of 0.4, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the culture was further shaken for 2 h at 37 °C.E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation 3300 ×g for 15 min at 2 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen at −80 °C, and then resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmEGTA, pH 7.0) supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin. Then the cells were ruptured by repeated freeze-thawing followed by sonication. NaCl concentration was adjusted to 500 mm, and the solution was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C to recover the supernatant. Purification of maltose-binding protein-HSP90 fusion protein by an amylose column and cleavage with Factor Xa protease were performed essentially as described in the manual of the manufacturer. Recombinant HSP90 was further purified by MonoQ column chromatography using a linear gradient (20–2000 mm NaCl in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4) and then desalted with PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium azide, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4. HSP90 from mammalian sources was purified as described previously (33Miyata Y. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7042-7047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat Cdc37 BglII fragment described above was inserted into aBamHI site of pGEX6P2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase-Cdc37 was introduced into E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). After reaching an A 600 level of 0.6, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for induction, and the culture was further shaken for 4 h at 23 °C.E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 15 min at 2 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen at −80 °C, and resuspended in B-PER solution (Pierce) supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.7 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin. The extract was clarified by centrifuging at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 2 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was mixed with the extract and rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and then with cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.0). Suspension of beads in the cleavage buffer was incubated with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with gentle agitation for 16 h at 4 °C. Cleaved recombinant Cdc37 was recovered by centrifugation and then dialyzed extensively in a buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4). MOK was expressed in COS7 cells and then immunoprecipitated as described (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were mixed with 1 μg of substrate proteins and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with gentle mixing in phosphorylation buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP as described (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed using 2D-Silver Stain II kit (Daiichi Pure Chemicals). Western blotting was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detection was performed using the chemiluminescent system as described (14Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged MOK protein kinase, and cell lysates were prepared. MOK protein was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with anti-HA tag antibody, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining to visualize possible cellular MOK-associated proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 A, at least one cellular protein with a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, marked with an asterisk, was specifically co-immunoprecipitated along with MOK (lane 4). Although a lot of nonspecifically attached proteins can be seen because of the high sensitivity of silver staining, specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation of this protein with MOK was confirmed as follows. First, the 90-kDa band could not be observed when lysates of control cells without HA-MOK transfection were used (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 3). In addition, the association of the 90-kDa protein was not observed when nonimmune antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2). In fact, we confirmed immunoprecipitation of MOK only in lane 4 (Fig.1 B); thus MOK-associated proteins should also appear only inlane 4 as was the case for the 90-kDa protein. The molecular mass of expressed HA-MOK is ∼47 kDa (Fig. 1 B); thus the 90-kDa protein cannot be a degradation product of expressed MOK. Taken together, at least one (but not necessarily only one) cellular protein with a molecular mass of 90 kDa associates with MOK. Several protein kinases including pp60v-src , Raf1, Cdk4, and CK2 had been reported to be associated with a 90-kDa cellular protein, and this protein had been identified as a major cytosolic molecular chaperone/heat shock protein, HSP90. Because the molecular mass of the MOK-associated protein observed in Fig. 1 A is similar to that of HSP90, we examined the possibility of an association between MOK and HSP90 directly by Western blotting. The same set of immunoprecipitates as in Fig. 1 was probed with antibody specific for HSP90. As clearly shown in Fig.2 A, HSP90 was detected in the immunocomplexes only in lane 4, which shows the anti-HA immunoprecipitate from HA-MOK-expressing cell lysates. HSP90 was not detected in control immunoprecipitates (lanes 1–3), confirming specificity of the association between HSP90 and MOK. The association of HSP90 with HA-MOK was not a result of binding of HSP90 to the HA tag moiety of the fusion protein because we also observed the specific co-immunoprecipitation between FLAG-MOK and HSP90 (Fig. 2 B). Although these results may not rule out the possibility of other 90-kDa MOK-associated proteins, they clearly indicate that MOK is associated with HSP90 in mammalian cells and that HSP90 can be isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with MOK. Geldanamycin, a low molecular mass compound that is a derivative of ansamycin-type benzoquinoid (52Uehara Y. Hori M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), has been shown to inhibit the molecular chaperone function of HSP90 (53Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). After observing the physical association of HSP90 with MOK as above, we examined the effect of geldanamycin treatment of cells on MOK. COS7 cells had been transfected with HA-MOK and treated with 5 μm geldanamycin for the indicated time periods up to 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and changes of the intracellular amount of MOK after geldanamycin treatment were examined by Western blotting with antibod"

While screening for Cdc42 targets that influence these activities, we identified the protein-tyrosine kinase ACK2 (for activated Cdc42-associated kinase 2) as a new binding partner for clathrin. ACK2 binds clathrin via a domain that is conserved among a number of other clathrin-binding proteins including the arrestins and AP-2. Overexpression of ACK2 in NIH3T3 cells results in an inhibition of transferrin receptor endocytosis because of a competition between ACK2 and AP-2 for clathrin. Activated Cdc42 weakens the interaction between ACK2 and clathrin and thus reverses the ACK2-mediated inhibition of endocytosis. Overexpression of ACK2 increases the amount of clathrin present in fractions enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles. Taken together, our data suggest that ACK2 may represent a novel clathrin-assembly protein and participate in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis.

The ACKs (ACK1 and ACK2)1 are nonreceptor-tyrosine kinases that share some similarity with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) and serve as highly specific target/effectors for the Ras-related GTP-binding protein Cdc42 (8Manser E.

They bind Cdc42 via a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain that is also present in other Cdc42/Rac effectors, including the PAKs (for p21-activated kinases), WASPs (Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome proteins), and MLKs (mixed lineage kinases) (10Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). ACKs have multiple known functional motifs such as SH3 and proline-rich domains. Aside from Cdc42, there are no known binding partners for ACKs. Although our previous studies indicate that ACK2 may play a role in cell adhesion signaling (11Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J-L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the exact function is not known yet. To better define the cellular role for ACK2, we have searched for novel binding partners. In this study, we show that ACK2 directly interacts with clathrin heavy chain via a conserved clathrin-binding motif shared in all endocytic adaptor proteins and that Cdc42 can regulate the ACK2-clathrin interaction. These findings now provide a potentially interesting link between Cdc42 and one of its specific target/effectors with clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis. Anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-clathrin light chain antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Tom Kirchhausen of Harvard Medical School. Anti-AP2 αC subunit antibody was purchased from UBI. Cy3-conjugated transferrin was purchased from Molecular Probes. The GFP vector pGFPC1 was obtained from CLONTECH. The ACK2 tetracycline-inducible (Tet-off) expression cell line was established as previously described (12Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.-L. J.

PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, whereas C2C12, COS-7, and SK-N-DZ cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The experimental procedures for cDNA transfection, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and GST fusion protein precipitation were the same as described previously (9Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

All of the ACK2 mutants were made by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ACK2-2W2A, the SH3 domain mutant, was prepared by mutating Trp-424 and Trp-425 to Ala-424 and Ala-425; ACK2-2H2A, the Cdc42-binding defective mutant, was generated by mutating His-464 and His-467 to Ala-464 and Ala-467; ACK2-ΔN, the amino-terminal truncation mutant, was prepared by deleting the first 76 amino acid residues; ACK2-ΔC, a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant, was prepared by deleting the last 241 amino acid residues. The cells were cultured to 80% confluency on coverslips in a 24-well plate. After the medium was removed, the cells were incubated with warm (37 °C) internalization medium (DMEM plus 1% bovine serum albumin) for 5–10 min. To initiate endocytosis, the cells were incubated with 200 μl of transferrin conjugated with Cy3 in internalization medium (1:100–200) at 37 °C for 15–30 min. Endocytosis was stopped by adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at 25 °C for 10 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (3×). The internalized Cy3-transferrin was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Membrane fractionations were performed basically as adapted from Grimes et al. (13Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C.

The cells were harvested by scratching with a cell spade in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and then homogenized manually with a 2-ml glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell bodies, nuclei, and cytoskeletal fractions. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 10 min to pellet large vesicles. The clathrin-coated vesicles were pelleted from the 8,000 × g supernatant by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 30 min. To search for binding partners for ACK2, we prepared two GST constructs that each contained one of the two proline-rich domains (PRDs) from ACK2 (amino acids 490–589 and 580–711, Fig.1 A); these were designated GST·ACK2PRD1 and GST·ACK2PRD2, respectively. Following the incubation of glutathione-agarose resins containing GST·ACK2PRD1 and GST·ACK2PRD2 with lysates from the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-DZ, an 180 kDa protein was co-precipitated with the GST·ACK2 constructs (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). An apparently identical 180 kDa protein was precipitated following the incubation of these GST·ACK2 fusion proteins with lysates from either skeletal muscle C2C12 cells or from NIH3T3 cells transformed by oncogenic Ras (data not shown). Microsequence analysis indicated that the 180 kDa ACK2-binding protein was the clathrin heavy chain (Fig.1 C; Ref. 14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71404) Google Scholar). This was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of the ACK2PRD1- and or ACK2PRD2-associated proteins with an anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody (Transduction Laboratory) (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6). Myc-tagged ACK2 was also co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous clathrin heavy chain from COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 D, lane 3). There are 10 amino acid residues that are shared by ACK2PRD1 and ACK2PRD2 (Fig. 1 A), and it therefore seemed likely that the clathrin-binding domain was contained within this overlapping region. To confirm this, two additional GST·ACK2 fusion proteins were prepared. The first, designated GST·ACK2PRD2-2, represented an amino-terminal deleted version of ACK2PRD2 that lacked 8 of the overlapping amino acids (i.e. residues that were also present in ACK2PRD1), whereas the second, designated ACK2CBD, essentially contained the region of overlap shared by ACK2PRD1 and ACK2PRD2 but lacked either proline-rich domain (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, clathrin binds to ACK2CBD as well as to ACK2PRD2, but is incapable of binding ACK2PRD2-2, thus indicating that the region shared between ACK2PRD1 and ACK2PRD2 does in fact contain the clathrin-binding site. Alignment of this region (amino acid residues 580–589 in ACK2) with the clathrin-binding domains from endocytic adaptor proteins (15Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) defines a conserved clathrin-binding motif, LIDF (Fig.2 C). Given that ACK2 is a specific target for Cdc42, an obvious question concerned whether the interaction between ACK2 and clathrin is influenced by activated Cdc42. To address this question, we transiently expressed a Myc-tagged Cdc42-binding defective mutant, ACK2-2H2A (in which two histidine residues from the CRIB motif of ACK2 were mutated to alanine), in COS-7 cells. ACK2-2H2A is completely incapable of binding activated Cdc42 (data not shown). However, the binding affinity of this ACK2 mutant for clathrin was increased dramatically, as indicated from co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 2 and 6, upper left panel; the lower left panel compares the relative levels of expression of the different Myc-tagged ACK2 constructs). In addition, when we used GST·Cdc42Q61L, a GTPase-defective mutant, to precipitate ACK2, clathrin was not complexed with ACK2 (Fig.2 D, upper right panel, compare lanes 2and 3; ΔNT designates an ACK2 construct that lacks an amino-terminal positively charged cluster but still binds Cdc42; see below). These data indicate that Cdc42 negatively regulates the interaction of ACK2 with clathrin. We examined whether the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and proline-rich domains of ACK2 influenced its binding to clathrin. We mutated the two conserved tryptophan residues in the SH3 domain that are critical for binding proline-rich domains (Ref. 17Musacchio A. Noble M. Pauptit R. Wierenga R. Saraste M. Nature. 1992; 359: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar; designated ACK2-2W2A) and tested the ability of this mutant to bind clathrin. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the amount of clathrin that co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged ACK2-2W2A was markedly decreased compared with the case for wild-type ACK2 (upper left panel,lanes 2 and 5), indicating that perturbations of the SH3 domain of ACK2 significantly reduced its binding affinity for clathrin. Apparently, the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich domain of ACK2, upon undergoing an intramolecular interaction with the SH3 domain (11Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J-L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), exposes a surface that constitutes the clathrin-binding site. When Cdc42 binds to the CRIB domain between the SH3 and proline-rich domains, this intramolecular interaction would then be reversed, such that the proper binding surface is no longer accessible to clathrin. As expected, the removal of the carboxyl-terminal 241 residues (ACK2-ΔCT) that contains the clathrin-binding site prevents clathrin from co-immunoprecipitating with Myc-tagged ACK2 (Fig. 2 D,upper left panel, lane 3). However, it is interesting that the removal of the amino-terminal end of ACK2, which contains a positively charged cluster of amino acids (yielding the construct designated as ACK2-ΔNT) strongly increases the amount of clathrin that co-precipitates with Myc-tagged ACK2 (Fig. 2 D,upper left panel, lane 4). This may reflect an increased accessibility of the ACK2 mutant for clathrin, because we have found that the amino-terminal truncation of ACK2 alters its cellular location and increases the amount of the protein in the soluble fraction (data not shown). Clathrin plays a pivotal role in receptor-mediated and synaptic vesicle endocytosis as well as in trans-Golgi vesicle transport (18Marsh M. McMahon H.T.

To examine the effects of ACK2 on clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis, we used GFP·ACK2 fusion proteins to identify cells expressing ACK2, and Cy3-conjugated transferrin to monitor receptor endocytosis by the accompanying increases in Cy3 fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the overexpression of GFP alone did not affect the endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (panels a and b; the arrows denote cells expressing GFP). However, the overexpression of GFP·ACK2 in NIH3T3 cells blocked receptor endocytosis (panels c andd; the arrows point to cells expressing GFP·ACK2). We obtained identical results in PC12 cells when overexpressing ACK2 (data not shown). The inhibition of transferrin receptor endocytosis was prevented when overexpressing a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of ACK2 that lacked the clathrin-binding site (panels e and f; thearrows point to the ACK2-expressing cells), thus indicating that the ability of ACK2 to bind clathrin is necessary for the inhibition of endocytosis. The Cdc42-binding defective mutant, GFP·ACK2-2H2A, was also capable of mediating an inhibition of transferrin receptor endocytosis (Fig.3 A, panels g and h; thearrows point to cells expressing the GFP·ACK2 double mutant). This was consistent with our finding that the binding of Cdc42 is not necessary for the interaction of clathrin with ACK2. In fact, it would be expected that the expression of activated Cdc42, by interfering with the binding of ACK2 to clathrin, should reverse the ACK2-mediated inhibition of receptor endocytosis. This in fact turned out to be the case (Fig. 3 B). When the GTPase-defective mutant, Cdc42Q61L, was co-expressed with GFP·ACK2, the endocytosis of transferrin receptors was essentially restored to that observed with control cells. Adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) is a universal adaptor for plasma membrane receptor endocytosis and is necessary for the cellular uptake of transferrin receptors (25Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Begue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The β subunit of AP-2 contains a clathrin-binding site similar to that found on ACK2 (Fig.2 C). Thus, one plausible mechanism for the inhibition of receptor endocytosis by ACK2 is that it competes with the AP-2 β subunit for binding to clathrin. To examine this possibility, we immunoprecipitated clathrin and AP-2 separately from the lysates of cells transfected with an inducible (tetracycline-off) expression plasmid for ACK2 and then immunoblotted with either anti-AP-2 or anti-clathrin antibody to analyze the association of AP-2 and clathrin (Fig. 3 C). Expression of Myc-tagged ACK2 was induced by removing tetracycline from the culture medium (lane 1,middle panel), whereas control (uninduced) cells did not show a detectable expression of ACK2 (lane 2, middle panel). Significantly less AP-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with clathrin (using an antibody against the clathrin light chain) in cells where the expression of ACK2 was induced, compared with cells showing no detectable expression of Myc-tagged ACK2 (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 3 and 4 in the lower panel). Likewise, when using an anti-AP-2 antibody, there was a significantly greater amount of clathrin co-immunoprecipitated with AP-2 in cells that did not express Myc-tagged ACK2, compared with cells that inducibly expressed ACK2 (compare lanes 5 and6 in the upper panel). However, under the conditions where the induction of ACK2 caused a marked reduction in the amount of AP-2 associated with clathrin, a significant amount of ACK2 was co-immunoprecipitated with clathrin (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 3 and 4 in the middle panel). These results demonstrate that the overexpression of ACK2 can effectively block the interaction of AP-2 with clathrin. This appears to be translated into a change in the cellular localization of AP-2 and its association with endocytotic vesicles. In control cells, the staining of AP-2 shows the typical punctate appearance expected for AP-2-containing vesicles (Fig. 3 D, panel b; cell that lacks the arrow), whereas in cells overexpressing ACK2 (Fig. 3 D, panel b, the arrow points to the cell), there is a marked change in AP-2 staining such that there appears to be less punctate vesicular structures and instead, AP-2 appears to be aggregated, particularly along the cell surface. Based on the observation that overexpression of ACK2 inhibited transferrin receptor endocytosis, and competed with AP-2 for binding clathrin, we expected that the immunostaining of clathrin-coated vesicles would be significantly decreased in ACK2-expressing cells. However, as shown in Figs.4 A–C, this is not the case. First, it appears that the overall staining of clathrin-associated structures is actually increased upon overexpression of ACK2 (Fig.4 A, panels b and d, and g andh). Note that it is possible to still detect overlap between ACK2 and clathrin staining (Fig. 4 B), as well as a high degree of overlap between clathrin and phosphotyrosine staining in cells expressing ACK2 (Fig. 4 A, panels a andd, and c and f); the latter is likely because of autophosphorylated ACK2 associated with clathrin based on anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis (data not shown). Second, whereas roughly equivalent amounts of clathrin were found in the 1,000 × g and 8,000 × g supernatants and pellets, both in the absence and presence of ACK2 (Fig.4 C, lanes 1–6, upper panel), the amount of clathrin present in the 300,000 × g pellet, which is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles, was consistently increased (by at least 2-fold) in cells overexpressing ACK2 relative to control cells (compare lanes 7 and 9). Identical results were obtained when PC12 cells were used (data not shown). Fig.4 C also shows that ACK2 was predominantly present in the 300,000 × g pellet. Taken together, the immunofluorescence data and the results obtained from cell fractionation experiments lead us to suspect that ACK2 may promote, rather than inhibit, clathrin assembly, as has been suggested for the adaptor proteins AP-2 and AP-3 (27Murphy J.E. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10850-10855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Rac and Rho inhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis (28Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); however, our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that a Cdc42 target/effector (ACK2) is a clathrin-binding protein and raise interesting possibilities for Cdc42 in the regulation of clathrin assembly and/or clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis. Although ACK2 is a nonreceptor-tyrosine kinase, we have not yet found any requirement for its tyrosine kinase activity in the regulation of receptor endocytosis. This either means that the tyrosine kinase activity of ACK2 serves another function and/or has only modulatory effects on an endocytic process. Our finding that ACK2 can negatively regulate transferrin receptor endocytosis is likely a direct outcome of its ability to bind clathrin, competitively versus AP-2 in cells, rather than a reflection of its true physiological function. It is especially attractive to consider a role for ACK2 as an adaptor of clathrin-coated vesicles in brain or neuronal cells, as it is highly expressed in these cell types (9Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whereas early work implicated Cdc42 in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell shape changes, more recent studies have provided strong indications for the involvement of Cdc42 in the stimulatory regulation of membrane trafficking, exocytosis, and endocytosis (4Hong-Geller E.

Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Homologues of about 18 of the 21 prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit proteins can be identified by similarity searches in the yeast complete genomic sequence. However, the number of ribosomal proteins is larger in the small subunit of yeast mitochondria, estimated to be 33 or 36 (2, 3). Thus far, yeast mitochondrial ribosomal proteins have been identified either by the study of mutant strains with mitochondrial dysfunction (pet mutants; for review see Ref. 4Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by direct biochemical approaches involving isolation of mitochondria, purification of mitochondrial ribosomes, and protein separation followed by microsequencing (5Kitakawa M. Graack H.R. Grohmann L. Goldschmidt-Reisin S. Herfurth E. Wittmann-Liebold B. Nishimura T. Isono K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ribosome purification has thus far been technically difficult, because the ribosomal proteins represent only 2–3% of the mitochondrial proteins (2Faye G. Sor F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 155: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To date, these approaches have identified only a subset of the total number of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. In yeast, the eukaryote in which most of the studies were performed, only 14 proteins of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit have been characterized experimentally (1Graack H.R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Costanzo M.C. Mol. Cell.

We were originally interested in the study of the yeastYKL155C gene because it was found in a two-hybrid exhaustive screen to interact with the Prp11 splicing factor (7Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To test whether this protein was associated with splicing factors under physiological conditions, we used the recently described tandem affinity purification technique (8Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) that allows the isolation of protein complexes by two successive affinity purification steps under mild conditions. Instead of containing splicing factors, the purified complex associated with Ykl155c was found to consist of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit. We took advantage of this rapid and efficient affinity purification strategy to identify and characterize twelve novel proteins of the small ribosomal mitochondrial subunit. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Gene deletions were made by replacing the entire open reading frame by a TRP1 or KanMX6 cassette (9Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J.

The strains containing green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 fusion proteins or TAP-tagged fusion proteins were constructed by genomic insertion of the tag together with the TRP1 marker downstream of the affected genes to obtain C-terminally tagged fusion proteins. The Tag/TRP1 markers were generated by polymerase chain reaction either from pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-TRP1 for the GFP fusion (9Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A.

Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis was done in the Tris-Tricine system (11Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). A gradient of 5–20% acrylamide was used in all cases. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue G-250 staining (12Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W.

The generated peptides were cleaned on a reversed-phase support using Millipore Zip-Tip C18 or Poros R2 (Perseptive Biosystems). The mixture of peptides was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE-STR system (Perseptive Biosystems) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix.

A minimum of four peptides was considered necessary for an accurate protein identification. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed on a triple quadrupole API 365 mass spectrometer (Sciex) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Protana). Protein identification was done using the PeptideScan 3.02 software part of the BioToolBox 2.3 package (PE-Sciex) for Macintosh. Protein data bases were searched for matching entries using the peptide sequence tag methodology (14Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Identification of a given protein was considered to be accurate if two or more fragmented peptides gave the same polypeptide match or one fragmented peptide and a peptide mass map identified the same protein. Fluorescence microscopy was done using a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4880 cooled digital camera and a 100-watt UV excitation lamp. MitoTracker Red CMXRos from Molecular Probes was used as a specific mitochondrial marker following the manufacturer's instructions. Image manipulation was done with Photoshop version 5 (Adobe). For sequence homology search, we used the PSI-BLAST 2.1 program (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) from the NCBI web site with an expected E-value of 10 for the first BLAST search. The PSI-BLAST iterations were initiated after manual selection of similar sequences based on the presence of potential sequence motifs. The same homologues were also detected using the precalculated Blastp alignments accessible as the Blink feature of the GenPept entries. A similarity between sequences coming from two different organisms was considered significant if searches starting with either sequence found the other as one of the best matches. The search for yeast homologues of prokaryotic ribosomal proteins was facilitated by the available clusters of orthologous groups (16Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were made using the CLUSTALX program (17Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) and prepared for publication using GeneDoc version 2.6. A yeast strain deleted forYKL155C was viable but unable to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source (respiration-deficient; data not shown). We constructed the TAP-tagged chromosomal fusion of YKL155Caccording to Rigaut et al. (8Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). This construction ensured a natural level of tagged protein expression, and the strain was respiration-competent, indicating that the modified protein was functional. The TAP affinity purification of the Ykl155c-associated complex was performed under standard conditions as described (8Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The proteins that remained associated with the Ykl155c-TAP-tagged protein after the two successive affinity purification steps were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). After Coomassie Blue staining, about 30 different bands were visible, with various intensities (Fig.1 A, lane 1). This variability of band intensities could result from different factors such as uneven protein recovery after trichloroacetic acid precipitation, dye binding dependent on protein sequence and length, bands that contain more than one protein, components of the complex that are not equimolar, or partial degradation. The bands were excised from the gel, and the proteins were identified by MALDI peptide fingerprinting and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.2 for an example). A number of the identified proteins were known components of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, namely Nam9, Mrp4, Mrps28, Mrp2, Var1, Pet123, Mrp51, and Mrp1 (Fig. 1 and TableII). These findings, together with the respiratory phenotype that follows the deletion of theYKL155C gene, strongly suggested that Ykl155c was associated with the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.Table IISummary of small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit proteinsProteins identified during this studySystematic name 2-aSystematic names are in bold and underlined when the corresponding proteins were not previously experimentally identified as components of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome.Gene nameProkaryotic familyFirst direct biochemical identificationApparent molecular mass 2-bIn each category, proteins were sorted according to their apparent molecular mass determined in this study or predicted molecular mass calculated from the complete sequence.CommentsPotential yeast homologues of known prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit proteinsYNL137cNAM9S4p(28Biswas T.K.

Open table in a new tab We wanted to confirm that the complex isolated by affinity purification with the Ykl155c-tagged protein indeed corresponded to the small subunit of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome. Therefore, we examined the protein profile of the affinity-purified complex obtained using the TAP-tagged version of the small subunit mitochondrial ribosomal protein Mrp1 (Mrp1-TAP). When compared, the band patterns of the two purified complexes were identical, with the exception of the tagged proteins, which migrated about 5 kDa higher than their unmodified version as a result of the remaining calmodulin binding domain tag fragment (Fig.1). The presence of Ykl155c in the complex purified with Mrp1 was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The intensity of the Ykl155c band appears to be significantly lower in the Mrp1-TAP purification. It is possible that part of the tagged form of Ykl155c is not associated with the ribonucleoprotein complex, and therefore additional free protein was purified when using Ykl155c-TAP. To search for RNA components in the purified complex, the RNAs extracted from the purified fractions were heat-denatured, spotted on a filter, and hybridized with either a 21 S (Fig. 1 B) or a 15 S (Fig. 1 C) yeast rRNA-specific probe. As expected, the 15 S probe for the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA hybridized specifically to the RNA associated with the Ykl155c and Mrp1 complexes, whereas the 21 S-specific probe did not. Finally, we analyzed the cosedimentation of Ykl155c with Mrp1 and the 15 S rRNA by ultracentrifugation on a 15–30% sucrose gradient under dissociating conditions (0.5 m salt). Whole yeast soluble crude extracts from the Ykl155c-TAP- and Mrp1-TAP-tagged strains were mixed and loaded on top of the gradient. After ultracentrifugation, the fractions were analyzed for their protein content by denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblot specific for the protein A component of the tag. In addition, the RNAs of an aliquot from each fraction were spotted on a filter and probed with the 21 S- or 15 S-specific probe. Cosedimentation of Ykl155c with Mrp1 and the 15 S mitochondrial rRNA is shown in Fig. 3. In addition to the proteins previously described as components of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, we found 12 proteins that had not been previously biochemically characterized. Only 6 of these 12 proteins had clear known ribosomal prokaryotic homologues (TableII). The nomenclature of the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins is as variable as the methods employed for their characterization, but MRP(for mitochondrial ribosomal protein) is the most frequently used. However, this name does not allow one to discriminate between small and large subunit proteins and thus may be misleading. For example, Mrp2 is not the homologue of the prokaryotic S2 ribosomal proteins but belongs to the S14p family. Accordingly, we preferred to designate the newly identified genes RSMxx genes, where RSM stands for ribosomal small subunit ofmitochondria, and xx is the number of the corresponding prokaryotic protein family (see Table II). The genes that encode proteins that are not significantly similar to prokaryotic proteins were named with the same prefix RSM followed by a number that begins with 22, because there are 21 prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit protein families. Thus, the proposed name of the YKL155c gene is RSM22 (Table II). A large amount of functional data was generated in the course of genetic screenings and functional genomic studies in yeast. Hence, for a number of the identified proteins, some cellular or functional data were already available in public data bases. In addition, for some of the less well characterized proteins, we analyzed the cellular localization of the GFP C-terminally tagged proteins and the respiratory competency of strains disrupted for the corresponding genes. These data are summarized in Table II and described below. Ribosomal protein families S7p and S10p are represented in yeast mitochondria by the corresponding homologues Yjr113c and Ydr041w. Mammalian homologues of S7 (19Koc E.C. Blackburn K. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and S10 (20Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Koc H. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32585-32591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were also recently described as components of the bovine small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. As expected, the fluorescently labeled yeast proteins localized to mitochondria (Fig.4). The C-terminal quarter of the Yer050c sequence is similar to prokaryotic S18 ribosomal proteins (16Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). In the case of the haploid strain LMA139 (YER050C-GFP; Table I), no strong mitochondrial signal is visible either in the case of the specific mitochondrial marker or in the case of the GFP (Fig. 4), and the strain is respiration-deficient. Mitochondria are visible in a heterozygous diploid strain (obtained by crossing LMA139 and wild-type BMA64 Matα), which can also grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source, but no GFP signal could be detected (data not shown). Hence, the GFP tag interferes with the function of the protein. Although this precludes the determination of its cellular localization, it shows that the protein is essential for mitochondrial function, because the haploid strain LMA139 is respiration-deficient. A similar case was observed after the GFP tagging of Ynr037c, a homologue of the S19 prokaryotic ribosomal proteins. However, in a heterozygous diploid strain, we were able to detect a weak GFP signal that matches the mitochondrial marker (Fig. 4, bottom). Given that six newly identified ribosomal proteins have no obvious similarity with previously known ribosomal proteins, it was important to determine the cellular localization and the involvement of these proteins in mitochondrial function. The result of the cellular localization of the GFP C-terminally tagged proteins is shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table II. With the exception of Yjr101w, which was not analyzed, all these proteins were unambiguously localized to the mitochondria. Ykl155c, Ygl129c, Ydr175c, and Yjr101w were previously reported in the literature or public data bases to be essential for mitochondrial function (see Table II for references). We confirmed the direct involvement of Ykl155c in mitochondrial function by showing that the defective growth on glycerol resulting from the deletion of its gene could be complemented by a plasmid expressing a wild-type version of the protein (data not shown). For Yil093c, no previously reported functional data were available. We deleted the gene, which proved to be essential for growth on a medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source (data not shown). All these data confirmed that the newly identified proteins were localized to mitochondria and/or were essential for mitochondrial function. The number of protein components of the yeast small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit was estimated by mitochondrial purification, preparative ultracentrifugation, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to lie between 33 (2) and 36 (3). We used an affinity purification method with tagged versions of yeast Ykl155c and Mrp1 that allowed us to identify, by mass spectrometry, 20 different proteins of this ribosomal particle. Some of the previously described components of the small subunit were not found (Table II). Our affinity-purified complex is unlikely to correspond to a specific particle, distinct in vivo from the bona fidesmall mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, because of the identical patterns of proteins obtained with either Ykl155c or Mrp1 (a previously described mitochondrial ribosomal protein). Thus, the discrepancies observed between the presented method and previously described techniques might result from the loss of specific proteins during the purification procedure or from our inability to identify some of the components. Conversely, at least Ykl155c, with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa, is conspicuously absent from the two-dimensional gels previously published for the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit in which no proteins with an apparent mass above 60 kDa were revealed. The two approaches may thus be regarded as complementary. An international consortium for the study of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins has been created recently (Mammalian Mitochondrial Ribosomal Consortium). A number of mammalian homologues of the prokaryotic ribosomal proteins have been identified by using the bovine ribosome as a source for the isolation and purification of the mitochondrial ribosomes (19Koc E.C.

We were able to identify in yeast, along with other mitochondrial homologues of prokaryotic ribosomal proteins, the corresponding proteins for the S7 (Yjr113c/Rsm7) and S10 family (Ydr041w/Rsm10) and also the previously identified S15 homologue, Mrps28 (23Dang H. Ellis S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6895-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The analysis of the bovine and yeast mitochondrial ribosome shows that an important number of proteins have no similarity with known ribosomal proteins from prokaryotes. For this group of yeast proteins, significant similarities can be detected with sequences of the relatively distant fungi Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In some cases, similar proteins from other fungi may also be found, and one example is a hypothetical protein from Neurospora crassa(NCBI GenPept data base gi 7899415) that is similar to the yeast Ydr175c/Rsm24 protein. Yjr101w/Rsm26 is similar to the yeast mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit protein Mrp1. Interestingly, both proteins also share similarities with proteins of the superoxide dismutase family. No prokaryotic homologues of Ykl155c/Rsm22 may be detected, but we found significant similarities of its sequence with hypothetical proteins of yet unknown function in several higher eukaryotes, including humans (Fig. 5). It is tempting to speculate that these proteins are true homologues of the yeast Ykl155c/Rsm22 ribosomal protein and are components of the corresponding mitochondrial ribosomes. Ygl129c/Rsm23 was found by similarity search to be a member of the DAP-3 family of apoptosis mediator proteins (24Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Just like Ygl129c/Rsm23, the mouse mDAP-3 protein is localized into the mitochondrial matrix. Ygl129c/Rsm23 is the yeast sequence most similar to the DAP-3 proteins, but this similarity is weak (17% identity with the mouse mDAP-3). Nevertheless, a BLAST search using the S. pombe Ygl129c homologue sequence (SPBC29A3.15c) also finds the human hDAP-3 sequence. Moreover, mDAP-3 is able to partially complement a mitochondrial DNA loss phenotype observed in yeast strains deleted for YGL129C (24Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If Ygl129c/Rsm23 is the true homologue of hDAP-3, these observations would suggest an interesting link between modulation of apoptosis and the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery. In conclusion, an efficient affinity purification technique allowed us to characterize novel ribosomal components and to bring to 26 the total number of proteins identified as components of the yeast mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit. These findings and the discovery of the yeast Ykl155c/Rsm22 and Ygl129c/Rsm23 as essential components of the mitochondrial ribosome and members of conserved eukaryotic protein families contribute to extending the classification of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins to three different classes. A first group, which probably exists in every eukaryotic organism, consists of proteins similar to prokaryotic ribosomal components. Another group contain proteins with no prokaryotic homologues but only conserved in related species. Finally, a third group that includes the Ykl155c and Ygl129c protein families comprises mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are conserved across diverse eukaryotic species. We thank B.

https://openalex.org/W2132933678,"The initial steps in N-linked glycosylation involve the synthesis of a lipid-linked core oligosaccharide followed by the transfer of the core glycan to nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we describe alg11, a new yeast glycosylation mutant that is defective in the last step of the synthesis of the Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol core oligosaccharide on the cytosolic face of the ER. A deletion of the ALG11 gene leads to poor growth and temperature-sensitive lethality. In an alg11 lesion, both Man(3)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol and Man(4)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol are translocated into the ER lumen as substrates for the Man-P-dolichol-dependent sugar transferases in this compartment. This leads to a unique family of oligosaccharide structures lacking one or both of the lower arm alpha1,2-linked Man residues. The former are elongated to mannan, whereas the latter are poor substrates for outerchain initiation by Ochlp (Nakayama, K.-I., Nakanishi-Shindo, Y., Tanaka, A., Haga-Toda, Y., and Jigami, Y. (1997) FEBS Lett. 412, 547-550) and accumulate largely as truncated biosynthetic end products. The ALG11 gene is predicted to encode a 63.1-kDa membrane protein that by indirect immunofluorescence resides in the ER. The Alg11 protein is highly conserved, with homologs in fission yeast, worms, flies, and plants. In addition to these Alg11-related proteins, Alg11p is also similar to Alg2p, a protein that regulates the addition of the third mannose to the core oligosaccharide. All of these Alg11-related proteins share a 23-amino acid sequence that is found in over 60 proteins from bacteria to man whose function is in sugar metabolism, implicating this sequence as a potential sugar nucleotide binding motif."

We now demonstrate that HHARI interacts and co-localizes with UbcH7 in mammalian cells, particularly in the perinuclear region. We have further defined a minimal interaction region of HHARI comprising residues 186–254, identified individual amino acid residues essential for the interaction, and determined that the distance between the RING1 finger and IBR (in betweenRING fingers) domains is critical to maintaining binding. We have also established that the RING1 finger of HHARI cannot be substituted for by the highly homologous RING finger domains of either of the ubiquitin-protein ligase components c-CBL or Parkin, despite their similarity in structure and their independent capabilities to bind UbcH7. Furthermore, mutation of the RING1 finger domain of HHARI from a RING-HC to a RING-H2 type abolishes interaction with UbcH7. These studies demonstrate that very subtle changes to the domains that regulate recognition between highly conserved components of the ubiquitin pathway can dramatically affect their ability to interact.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6948) Google Scholar). The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins involves an energy-dependent, multistep pathway. Ubiquitin, activated in the presence of ATP by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme, is transferred to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)1 by trans-thiol esterification. It is then transferred to ε-amino groups of lysine residues in target proteins, generally with the aid of an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) and sometimes involving an additional protein, the multiubiquitin chain assembly factor (3Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The conjugated ubiquitin molecule can itself serve as an ubiquitylation substrate, and repeated ubiquitylation leads to the formation of poly(ubiquitin) chains. Deubiquitylating enzymes may remove ubiquitin molecules before a sufficiently large branch structure has been synthesized to activate 26 S proteasome-mediated protein destruction. The specificity of protein targeting by the ubiquitylation pathway lies in the unique interaction between a particular combination of an E2, an E3, and a target protein (4Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A.

By contrast, the identification of E3 families has been more difficult because of their more complex, multicomponent nature. We employed a yeast two-hybrid approach to isolate potential E3 components that interact with the human E2, UbcH7. This identified two proteins that we termed HHARI (human homologue ofDrosophila ariadne) and H7-AP1 (UbcH7-associated protein 1) (7Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F.

As observed with many components of the ubiquitin pathway, both UbcH7 and HHARI are structurally and functionally highly conserved throughout evolution (8Robinson P.A. Leek J.P. Thompson J. Carr I.M.

Indeed, an interaction between orthologues of UbcH7 and HHARI has subsequently been demonstrated in both mouse (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) andDrosophila (14Aguilera M. Oliveros M. Martinez-Padron M. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1231-1244PubMed Google Scholar). HHARI and H7-AP1 are characterized by the presence of RING (really interesting newgene) finger domains, which apparently regulate their interaction with UbcH7. The RING finger domain is a Cys/His-rich, zinc-chelating domain that promotes both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and is defined as Cys1-X 2-Cys2-X 9–39-Cys3-X 1–3-His4-X 2–3-(Cys/His5)-X 2-Cys6-X 4–48-Cys7-X 2-Cys8, where X can be any amino acid (15Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Proteins containing RING finger motifs are further subgrouped depending on whether a Cys or His residue is found at Cys/His5 within the motif, so that they are defined as either RING-HC (Cys5) or a RING-H2 (His5) type. Proteins containing RING finger domains represent a large group with diverse cellular functions. These include roles in apoptosis, cell cycle control, and prevention of oncogenesis. More recently, however, an increasing number of proteins containing RING finger domains have been implicated in the ubiquitylation pathway (see reviews in Refs. 16Borden K.L. J. Mol.

It has become evident that HHARI is a member of a family of RING-HC finger UbcH7-binding proteins that also includes c-CBL and Parkin, a protein mutated in autosomal dominant juvenile onset Parkinson's disease (Ref. 29Kitada T.

HHARI and Parkin both contain two RING-HC type domains separated by an additional Cys/His-rich region, which has been termed either the IBR (in between RING fingers) (30Morett E. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 229-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or DRIL (double RING fingerlinked) (31van der Reijden B.A. Erpelinck-Verschueren C.A.J.

This R-IBR-R domain structure regulates these two proteins interactions with UbcH7 (7Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol.

Disease-associated mutations within the R-IBR-R domain of Parkin prevent its interaction with UbcH7 and destroy E3 activity (22Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S.-I. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Kahle et al. (32Kahle P.J. Lemer U. Haass C. Trends. Biochem.

The proto-oncogene c-CBL is an adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitylation of tyrosine kinase receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (19Joazeiro C.A.P.

The oncogenic 70Z-CBL isoform, which has a 17-amino acid deletion immediately upstream of the RING domain, fails to interact with UbcH7 (21Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartiewicz M. Horne W.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and, as a consequence, fails to mediate ubiquitylation and degradation of tyrosine kinase receptors (19Joazeiro C.A.P.

Other than the RING-HC finger domain c-CBL shares no other obvious homologies in the domain or primary structure with HHARI and Parkin (see Fig. 6 A for a schematic representation of their protein domain structures). The biological function of HHARI and its orthologues remains unclear. By analogy with other proteins containing RING domains that interact with UbcH7, it may possess an E3 activity. In Drosophila, null mutants of Ariadne resulted in embryonic lethality at the pupal stage, with occasional adult survivors displaying severe disruption of the central nervous system (14Aguilera M. Oliveros M. Martinez-Padron M. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1231-1244PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is analogous to mutants of the E2 encoded bybendless (35Oh C.E. McMahon R. Benzer S. Tanouye M.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3166-3179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indications of the function of HHARI will be obtained with the identification of proteins that interact with itin vivo and by mapping its interaction domains. In this study, we demonstrate that HHARI binds and co-localizes with UbcH7 in mammalian cells. We also identify the minimal interaction region of HHARI (residues 186–254) and highlight key amino acid residues within this domain that regulate the interaction. The distance between the first RING finger and IBR domains is critical for UbcH7 binding. Moreover, we demonstrate that the RING finger motifs of c-CBL and Parkin cannot substitute for that of HHARI to mediate binding of the latter to UbcH7. HHARI coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a primer to the vector T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and a reverse primer corresponding to the 3′-end of HHARI using a full-length HHARIcDNA clone isolated from the Origene fetal brain library (7Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30963-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This latter primer was designed to incorporate an EcoRI restriction endonuclease site at its 5′-end. The amplification product was digested with EcoRI, gel-purified, and cloned into pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His (Invitrogen). The stop codon ofHHARI was then altered from TGA to TGG using site-directed mutagenesis to allow in-frame expression of the Myc-His tag. UbcH7-GFP and UbcH8-GFP constructs were generated by amplification of the inserts in previously described pET3a constructs (7Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol.

Amplification products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated into the pcDNA3-derived GFP expression vector pJMA2eGFP (36Askham J.M. Moncur P. Markham A.F. Morrison E.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All mutant HHARI constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Deletion mutants were generated by introducing restriction sites into mutant oligonucleotide primers (either PmlI or HpaI; oligonucleotide sequences available on request). One round of site-directed mutagenesis was performed with one set of primers, and isolated clones were grown, purified, and subjected to a second round of mutagenesis to generate the second restriction site. Clones were then digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease(s), gel-purified, and religated to create the deleted construct (details of individual constructs available upon request). HHARI-RINGcCBL and HHARI-RING1Parkin constructs were made using HHARI-ΔRING1 as a template (Figs. 3 A and 6 B). This latter construct retains only the first cysteine residue of the RING1 finger domain. Polymerase chain reaction fragments for HHARI-RINGcCBL encoding amino acid residues 383–420 of c-CBL or for HHARI-RING1Parkin encoding residues 240–294 of Parkin were generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). These fragments were then inserted into gel-purified, linear polymerase chain reaction product, which was identical to that used to generate HHARI-ΔRING1. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (clone 9E10) was obtained from Sigma. Living ColorsTManti-peptide antibody raised in rabbit for detection of GFP constructs was obtained from CLONTECH (herein abbreviated as anti-GFP). The rabbit polyclonal anti-UbcH7 C-terminal peptide antibody was described previously (7Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol.

Antibody stock solutions were diluted 1:100 for anti-Myc and anti-GFP and diluted 1:5000 for anti-UbcH7 for Western blotting procedures. Secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Dako. Anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and anti-mouse tetra-methyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Vector Laboratories. Human kidney 293t cells and monkey COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in 6% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with Glutamax supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-7 cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in a 6-well culture plate. Following attachment, the cells were transfected as described above with 2 μg of the appropriate construct(s). At 36 h post-transfection, coverslips were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by fixing with ice-cold methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, all procedures were performed at 20 °C. Post-fixation, coverslips were washed three times in PBS for 5 min prior to incubation with primary antibody solutions diluted 1:200 in 1% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS for 2 h. Coverslips were then subjected to four 5-min washes with PBS before incubation with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody solution at 1:100 dilution and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stain at 1:200 dilution in 1% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h. Following five 5-min washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) on glass slides. Confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP confocal imaging system. Transfections were performed in 75-cm2flasks using 6.6 μg of each construct DNA and 25 μl of LipofectAMINE. 48 h post-transfection cells were washed twice in PBS prior to the addition of 0.75 ml of prechilled lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1 × CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubation for 5 min at 20 °C. Cell suspensions were homogenized using QIAshredder columns (Qiagen) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from supernatants using anti-Myc antibody (diluted 1:100) and 50 μl (50%) of protein A-agarose suspension according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred on to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in 3% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1 h at 20 °C prior to incubation with primary antibody in 1% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS for 16 h at 20 °C. Bound primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in 0.1% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). When required, antibodies were stripped from Western blots using 0.2 m sodium hydroxide prior to reblocking with 3% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS and reprobing with additional antibody, as above. Co-transfection experiments with UbcH7-GFP and HHARI-Myc constructs were performed to demonstrate interaction in vivo. Both constructs produced readily detectable levels of immunoreactive proteins (Fig. 1). Expression of UbcH7 and/or UbcH7-GFP was demonstrated in cell lysates with either affinity purified UbcH7 antibodies or anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–12). Indeed, the presence of endogenous UbcH7 observed in all lanes indicated approximately equal loading of lysate. Immunoprecipitation of HHARI-Myc in cells transfected with HHARI-Myc or with HHARI-Myc and UbcH7-GFP led to the co-precipitation of endogenous UbcH7 or both endogenous UbcH7 and UbcH7-GFP, respectively (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 5and 6). Immunoprecipitates of UbcH7-GFP were only observed when this was co-transfected with HHARI-Myc (Fig. 1 A, compare upper and lower panels for lanes 4 and 6). No interaction was observed between HHARI-Myc and UbcH8 in co-transfected 293t cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). This lack of interaction was not due to low levels of UbcH8 expression (Fig.1 B, lane 4). In this same experiment, HHARI-Myc clearly immunoprecipitated UbcH7 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) when expressed at approximately the same levels as UbcH8 (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). We performed immunofluorescence studies on COS-7 cells to investigate the cellular localization patterns of UbcH7 and HHARI. Diffuse staining of UbcH7 was observed within the nucleus and the cytoplasm of transfected COS-7 cells, with extensive perinuclear staining (Fig.2 A). This staining pattern was identical to that observed for the endogenous protein (data not shown). HHARI was also detected within the cytoplasm with diffuse staining of the nucleus (Fig. 2 B). However, in cells overexpressing HHARI the degree of nuclear staining was variable. Levels similar to that of the endogenous protein were observed in some cells (Fig.2 B), whereas others displayed more intense nuclear staining (Fig. 2 C). Some perinuclear staining of HHARI was also observed, although it was not as obvious as for UbcH7. Co-transfection of UbcH7 and HHARI demonstrated areas of co-localization within cells, primarily in the perinuclear region, although diffuse co-localization was observed elsewhere (Fig. 2 D, panel iv). Co-staining with DAPI demonstrated that neither protein localized to the nucleoli (Fig. 2, A–C, panels iii, andD, panel iv). Previous data from in vitro experiments had indicated that the minimum region of HHARI required for binding to UbcH7 was between amino acid residues 167 and 293. This region encompasses the first RING finger (RING1) and the N-terminal part of the IBR domain. To confirm the interaction in mammalian cells, each characterized domain was deleted from the full-length HHARI-Myc construct as detailed in Fig.3 A, and the resulting deletion constructs were co-transfected with UbcH7-GFP. Deletion of either the acidic, the poly(Gly)-rich, or the second RING finger domain did not diminish the interaction with UbcH7 (Fig. 3 B,upper panel, lanes 2, 3, and6, respectively).Indeed, we consistently observed increased interaction between HHARI-ΔPoly(Gly) and UbcH7, in repeat experiments. We attribute this to increased levels of HHARI-ΔPoly(Gly) after transfection, although we cannot rule out a positive effect on the affinity of binding between UbcH7 and HHARI as a result of deletion of the poly(Gly) sequence. By contrast, removal of the first RING finger or the IBR domain prevented interaction with UbcH7 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lanes 4and 5, respectively). The absence of signal in the lanes transfected with HHARI-ΔRING1 and HHARI-ΔIBR was not due to the absence of mutant protein because reprobing the Western blot with the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) and the presence of UbcH7-GFP in all of the cell lysates (Fig. 3 B,lanes 7–12) confirmed expression of these constructs. Deletion of the RING1 (HHARI-ΔRING1, deleted residues 188–237) or the IBR (HHARI-ΔIBR, deleted residues 238–324) domain prevented the interaction between UbcH7 and HHARI (Fig. 3). Furthermore, our previous in vitro data indicated that a minimal binding region, spanning amino acid residues 167–293, which included the RING1 finger domain and part of the IBR domain, was required for interaction. A construct consisting of HHARI residues 142–242 alone (RING1 with additional N- and C-terminal sequences) did not bind UbcH7 (7Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F.

Robinson P.A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that a smaller region of the sequence contained within the HHARI-ΔIBR construct must be required for efficient binding of UbcH7. A comparison of the primary structures of HHARI, H7-AP1, Parkin, and other R-IBR-R-containing proteins, identified a common 20-amino acid spacer region (amino acid residues 237–256 in HHARI) between the RING1 finger and IBR domains (Fig.4 A). These spacer regions demonstrate no obvious sequence homology. The HHARI-ΔIBR construct described above lacks both the IBR motif and this spacer region. A series of Myc-tagged constructs were designed to test the hypothesis that the presence and size of the spacer region may be important (Fig.4 B). HHARI-Δ238–254 was designed to delete the spacer region; HHARI-Δ238–273 was designed to delete the spacer region and part of the IBR but to leave the DRIL domain (residues 276–317) intact; HHARI-ΔIBR(min) was designed to delete amino acid residues 254–324 of the IBR domain but leave the spacer region intact; HHARI-Δ238–254HA was designed to delete residues 238–254, and a 9-amino acid HA tag was inserted to generate a 12-amino acid spacer; and HHARI-237HA238 was designed to increase the size of the spacer region to 29 amino acid residues by insertion of a 9-amino acid HA tag between residues 237 and 238. Expression of HHARI-ΔIBR(min) showed that it maintained its ability to bind to UbcH7 (Fig. 4 C, upper panel,lane 6). In contrast, neither HHARI-Δ238–254 nor HHARI-Δ238–273 was able to immunoprecipitate with UbcH7 (Fig.4 C, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Furthermore, replacement of the 20-amino acid spacer with a 12-amino acid spacer or insertion of an additional sequence at the N terminus of the spacer to create a 29-amino acid spacer abolished the UbcH7/HHARI interaction (Fig. 4 C,"

Transthyretin (TTR)1 is a serum tetrameric protein of four identical subunits of 14 kDa synthesized early in development and primarily in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain (1Soprano D.R. Herbert J. Soprano K.J. Schon E.A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma TTR derives predominantly from the liver and acts as a transport protein for thyroxine (T4) and retinol (vitamin A) (2Raz A. Shiratori T. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1903-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in the latter case this is accomplished by the formation of a 1:1 molar complex with retinol-binding protein (RBP) (3Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Academic Press, New York1984: 41-88Crossref Google Scholar). TTR binds virtually all of serum RBP and about 15% of serum T4.Though it is known that liver, kidney, muscle, and skin are the major sites of TTR degradation in the rat (4Makover A. Moriwaki H. Ramakrishnan R. Saraiva M.J.M. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8598-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its cellular uptake is poorly understood. Divino and Schussler (5Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol.

Receptor-mediated uptake of TTR was also shown in astrocytes and ependymomas (7Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 1265-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Kuchler-Bopp S. Dietrich J.B. Zaepfel M. Delaunoy J.P. Brain Res. 2000; 870: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggesting a role for delivery of TTR ligands to the central nervous system. All these reports support a receptor-mediated process for TTR internalization in several tissues, but information is lacking on the biochemical nature of the TTR-receptor interaction.Several point mutations in TTR have been related to the occurrence of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the extracellular deposition of TTR fibrils in various tissues (9Saraiva M.J.M. Almeida M.R. Alves I.L. Bonifácio M.J. Damas A.M. Palha J.A. Goldsteins G. Lundgren E. The nature and origin of amyloid fibrils. Ciba Foundation, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chishester, England1996: 47-51Google Scholar). FAP patients generally present low levels of plasma TTR, which might be related to a different catabolism of the mutant protein; however, because no studies are available on the internalization of different TTR mutants, investigation of cellular uptake of both amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic protein can give clues on structural determinants of TTR important for interaction.We reported that 1–2% of plasma TTR circulates bound to HDL and that the association of TTR to the HDL vesicle occurs through binding to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (10Sousa M.M. Berglund L. Saraiva M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we showed that in the kidney, megalin, a member of the lipoprotein receptor family (LDLr) is responsible for TTR uptake (11Sousa M.M. Norden A.G.W. Jacobsen C. Willnow T.E. Christensen E.I. Thakker R.V. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Saraiva M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38176-38181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that TTR and lipoproteins share related uptake pathways. The murine scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), has been identified as the receptor that enables cells to capture cholesterol from HDL particles in the bloodstream (12Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). SR-BI recognizes the apolipoproteins on the surface of the HDL particle and mediates thereby selective HDL lipid uptake (13Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the association of TTR with HDL, it would be possible that SR-BI could act as a TTR-receptor. Alternatively, receptors of the LDLr family, other than megalin, and preferentially expressed in the liver (the major site of TTR degradation), such as LDLr and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) could mediate TTR internalization. It is interesting to note that all these receptors bind to a chaperone-like molecule, the receptor-associated protein (RAP) (14Medh J.D. Bowen S.L. Fry G.L. Ruben S. Andracki M. Inoue I. Lalouel J.M.

A. 1997; 94: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Here we report the various results obtained for TTR uptake using different cell lines and systems and elucidate a possible common pathway between lipoproteins and TTR uptake.DISCUSSIONOur experiments provide direct evidence for the existence of a specific receptor for TTR on hepatocytes and fibroblasts. Because the liver is the major site of catabolism of the protein, the existence of high affinity and saturable binding sites on hepatomas was expected. TTR had already been found to bind to HepG2 (a human hepatoma cell line) by a receptor-mediated process (5Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this cell line, TTR is synthesized and secreted into the cell medium (22Blaner W.S. Bonifacio M.J. Feldman H.D. Piantedosi R. Saraiva M.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and could interfere with a proper assessment of the binding capacity and affinity because the amount of iodinated TTR used is on the nanogram range as are the levels of TTR secreted by HepG2 (∼150 ng TTR/106cells) (22Blaner W.S. Bonifacio M.J. Feldman H.D. Piantedosi R. Saraiva M.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For this reason, all our assays were performed under serum-free conditions and with cells that do not produce TTR. Interestingly, our results in hepatomas that do not produce TTR and in primary cultures of hepatocytes from ttr knockout mice showed a single class of high affinity binding sites with aKd of ∼4 nm at 37 °C, which is effectively in the same range as the one previously reported (∼10 nm). This Kd indicates that the receptor is saturated with the normal plasma TTR concentration of 5 μm and that TTR can be taken up efficiently from much lower concentrations existing in the extracellular fluid.To assess the influence of lipoproteins on TTR internalization, some uptake experiments were performed using lipoprotein-deficient serum from ttr knockout mice and as expected, no significant inhibition of uptake was observed nor differences in binding constants were obtained. We therefore concluded that the measured TTR uptake does not represent TTR-lipoprotein complex internalization, although both HDL and LDL are able to inhibit TTR uptake. It is also noteworthy that only a small fraction of TTR (1–2% of the total plasma TTR pool) circulates bound to HDLs and that there are even some individuals that are devoid of TTR bound to lipoproteins (10Sousa M.M. Berglund L. Saraiva M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that this small fraction of TTR bound to lipoproteins significantly accounts for the physiological turnover of the protein. At this point we cannot however exclude that the TTR·HDL complex might be internalized by an alternative pathway, namely involving one of the members of the LDLr. However, in this event, the physiological relevance would have to be explained because of the small amount of TTR bound to lipoproteins.In this study we show that RAP, a multifunctional ligand binding all members of the LDLr family antagonizing their ligand binding activity, inhibits TTR uptake. The inhibition was observed in different cell lines and in primary hepatocytes. This finding was reinforced by the fact that the ∼90-kDa TTR-receptor complex observed by cross-linking on hepatoma cells was also RAP-sensitive. We had already demonstrated (11Sousa M.M. Norden A.G.W. Jacobsen C. Willnow T.E. Christensen E.I. Thakker R.V. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Saraiva M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38176-38181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that in the kidney, TTR uptake occurring through megalin, is a RAP-sensitive process. However we observed that in the case of cells from liver origin, none of the candidate members of the LDLr family were involved in TTR uptake. We conclude that TTR uptake is occurring via another yet unidentified RAP-sensitive receptor. It has been suggested (23van Vlijmen B.J. Rohlmann A. Page S.T. Bensadoun A. Bos I.S. van Berkel T.J. Havekes L.M. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35219-35226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the only RAP-sensitive receptors present in the liver are the LDLr and the LRP. This was based on the evidence that in LDLr and LRP double knockout mice, no RAP binding could be detected in the liver using both membrane binding studies and ligand-blotting experiments. However it is possible that RAP-sensitive receptors were not identified because of low receptor binding affinities. For instance, isolated membranes may present partially destroyed and/or functionally defective receptors. The involvement of other RAP-sensitive receptors such as megalin and cubilin, which are expressed on the apical surfaces of many specialized absorptive epithelia (24Lundgren S. Carling T. Hjalm G. Juhlin C. Rastad J. Pihlgren U. Rask L. Akerstrom G. Hellman P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Kozyraki R. Fyfe J. Kristiansen M. Gerdes C.

Med. 1999; 5: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), was highly unlikely because these receptors are not physiologically expressed in the liver. We did however perform Western blot analysis for megalin and cubilin on cellular extracts of both hepatoma cell lines used and found that these cell lines do not express megalin nor cubilin (data not shown). It is also noteworthy that the high molecular weight of megalin and cubilin is not compatible with the ∼90-kDa band we obtained by cross-linking for the receptor here reported. The ∼90-kDa TTR-receptor complex identified, corresponds to a lower molecular weight receptor than the ∼100-kDa TTR receptor previously described (6Vieira A.V. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Kuchler-Bopp S. Dietrich J.B. Zaepfel M. Delaunoy J.P. Brain Res. 2000; 870: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because TTR is a homotetramer (determined by cross-linking assays), it is difficult to predict which form of the protein will preferentially bind the receptor. Although the kinetics of the interaction of TTR with its receptor are identical to the ones described for other cell types (5Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Vieira A.V. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 2000; 870: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude at this point that the TTR receptor here described is different from the receptors reported in oocytes and ependymomas.We observed that complexation of TTR to T4 led to a 20% increased cell surface binding, which agrees with previous studies (5Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which T4 increases TTR uptake is probably due to slight conformational changes that this ligand induces in TTR (26Reid D.G. McLacklan L.K. Voyle M. Leeson P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2013-2023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because only a small proportion of TTR molecules carry T4, a supraphysiological concentration of the hormone would be required to demonstrate stimulation of TTR uptake. Moreover, TTR does not appear to play a role in the delivery of T4 to the tissues; thus, studies performed on ttr knockout mice revealed that TTR is not essential for T4 to reach tissues, namely the liver (27Palha J.A. Hays M.T. Morreale de Escobar G. Episkopou V. Gottesman M.E. Saraiva M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E485-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the 20% increased uptake of the TTR·T4 complex, we would predict that the addition of lipoproteins that induce a high inhibition of TTR uptake would still be able to reduce the uptake of the TTR·T4 complex. However, methodologically as T4 also binds lipoproteins, competition experiments using the TTR·T4 complex, and lipoproteins would be difficult to interpret.On the other hand, RBP·TTR led to a 70% decreased uptake, which shows that TTR is preferentially taken up in its non-RBP complexed form. This can be explained by several hypotheses: steric hindrance by RBP of TTR binding to its receptor or even the possibility that the interaction sites of TTR with RBP and with its receptor are overlapping. RBP had the same inhibitory effect on the TTR·T4 complex, which was predictable given the high inhibitory effect of RBP on TTR uptake when compared with the increase produced by T4. Conflicting results have been published with regard to the effect of TTR on RBP binding to its receptor; Sivaprasadarao et al. (28Sivaprasadarao A. Boudjelal M. Findlay J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported TTR inhibition of RBP uptake whereas Bavik et al. (29Bavik C.O. Ericksson U. Allen R.A. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1485PubMed Google Scholar) showed that TTR has no effect on RBP internalization. Our results on TTR uptake are in agreement with the first observation. Under physiological conditions where TTR and RBP circulate as a complex, prior to TTR and/or RBP uptake, it is probable that the two proteins dissociate because they are internalized by distinct pathways.As already mentioned, several point mutations in TTR are related to the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils. TTR plasma levels are decreased in FAP V30M patients (30Saraiva M.J.M. Costa P.P. Goodman D.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 102: 590-603PubMed Google Scholar), despite an equal expression of the variant and normal TTR in the liver (31Mita S. Maeda S. Shimada K. Araki S. J. Biochem. 1986; 100: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggested that TTR metabolism could be related to the amyloid formation process. Moreover, higher TTR levels were found in carriers of the nonpathogenic TTR T119M mutation. Comparative in vivo clearance studies of TTR V30M and TTR T119M have been performed (32Alves I. Hays M.T. Saraiva M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and showed a slower clearance for TTR T119M and a faster one for TTR V30M. When the TTR V30M/T119M was studied, it showed a similar behavior as normal TTR. This led to the hypothesis that, at least in part, a different clearance could account for the differences in circulating plasma levels observed for each of the mutations. In our uptake studies however, no direct correlation was observed between TTR amyloidogenicity and TTR uptake. This can be explained by the fact that an in vivo system comprises complex and different pools not represented in a cellular system such as the ones used in our assays. TTR mutants were used to evaluate binding to megalin (11Sousa M.M. Norden A.G.W. Jacobsen C. Willnow T.E. Christensen E.I. Thakker R.V. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Saraiva M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38176-38181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the mutant with a faster uptake in the kidney (V30M) corresponds in this study to a mutant with a low cell association. This not only shows that the receptors involved in TTR uptake in the kidney and liver are different, but also suggests that the turnover of the protein in the body is probably the overall result of processes mediated by different organ-specific receptors.The membrane protein bound to TTR is now under study to further isolate the TTR receptor. The final identification of a TTR receptor should be useful in further studies of transport function and metabolic effects of TTR and possibly with respect to the pathological deposition of TTR variants. The reason why both LDL and HDL particles are able to inhibit TTR uptake, despite the lack of interaction of TTR with any of the described LDL or HDL receptors present in the liver, remains to be further elucidated. Recently, RAP has been shown to interact with a growing number of proteins, including several that are unrelated to the LDL receptor family as well as new members of this rapidly expanding family (33Sarti M. Farquhar M.G. Orlando R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Transthyretin (TTR)1 is a serum tetrameric protein of four identical subunits of 14 kDa synthesized early in development and primarily in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain (1Soprano D.R. Herbert J. Soprano K.J. Schon E.A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma TTR derives predominantly from the liver and acts as a transport protein for thyroxine (T4) and retinol (vitamin A) (2Raz A. Shiratori T. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1903-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in the latter case this is accomplished by the formation of a 1:1 molar complex with retinol-binding protein (RBP) (3Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Academic Press, New York1984: 41-88Crossref Google Scholar). TTR binds virtually all of serum RBP and about 15% of serum T4. Though it is known that liver, kidney, muscle, and skin are the major sites of TTR degradation in the rat (4Makover A. Moriwaki H. Ramakrishnan R. Saraiva M.J.M. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8598-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its cellular uptake is poorly understood. Divino and Schussler (5Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported a specific and saturable TTR uptake, consistent with the existence of a receptor-mediated process in hepatomas, providing the probable mechanism for the in vivo translocation of plasma TTR into the rat liver previously observed by Makover et al. (4Makover A. Moriwaki H. Ramakrishnan R. Saraiva M.J.M. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8598-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vieira et al. (6Vieira A.V. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have investigated the transport of serum TTR into chicken oocytes and showed the existence of a ∼115-kDa oocytic TTR receptor, which might be responsible for regulating the uptake of T4 and retinol into the growing embryo. Receptor-mediated uptake of TTR was also shown in astrocytes and ependymomas (7Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 1265-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Kuchler-Bopp S. Dietrich J.B. Zaepfel M. Delaunoy J.P. Brain Res. 2000; 870: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggesting a role for delivery of TTR ligands to the central nervous system. All these reports support a receptor-mediated process for TTR internalization in several tissues, but information is lacking on the biochemical nature of the TTR-receptor interaction. Several point mutations in TTR have been related to the occurrence of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the extracellular deposition of TTR fibrils in various tissues (9Saraiva M.J.M. Almeida M.R. Alves I.L. Bonifácio M.J. Damas A.M. Palha J.A. Goldsteins G. Lundgren E. The nature and origin of amyloid fibrils. Ciba Foundation, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chishester, England1996: 47-51Google Scholar). FAP patients generally present low levels of plasma TTR, which might be related to a different catabolism of the mutant protein; however, because no studies are available on the internalization of different TTR mutants, investigation of cellular uptake of both amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic protein can give clues on structural determinants of TTR important for interaction. We reported that 1–2% of plasma TTR circulates bound to HDL and that the association of TTR to the HDL vesicle occurs through binding to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (10Sousa M.M. Berglund L. Saraiva M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we showed that in the kidney, megalin, a member of the lipoprotein receptor family (LDLr) is responsible for TTR uptake (11Sousa M.M. Norden A.G.W. Jacobsen C. Willnow T.E. Christensen E.I. Thakker R.V. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Saraiva M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38176-38181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that TTR and lipoproteins share related uptake pathways. The murine scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), has been identified as the receptor that enables cells to capture cholesterol from HDL particles in the bloodstream (12Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). SR-BI recognizes the apolipoproteins on the surface of the HDL particle and mediates thereby selective HDL lipid uptake (13Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the association of TTR with HDL, it would be possible that SR-BI could act as a TTR-receptor. Alternatively, receptors of the LDLr family, other than megalin, and preferentially expressed in the liver (the major site of TTR degradation), such as LDLr and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) could mediate TTR internalization. It is interesting to note that all these receptors bind to a chaperone-like molecule, the receptor-associated protein (RAP) (14Medh J.D. Bowen S.L. Fry G.L. Ruben S. Andracki M. Inoue I. Lalouel J.M.

Ullrich R. Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we report the various results obtained for TTR uptake using different cell lines and systems and elucidate a possible common pathway between lipoproteins and TTR uptake. DISCUSSIONOur experiments provide direct evidence for the existence of a specific receptor for TTR on hepatocytes and fibroblasts. Because the liver is the major site of catabolism of the protein, the existence of high affinity and saturable binding sites on hepatomas was expected. TTR had already been found to bind to HepG2 (a human hepatoma cell line) by a receptor-mediated process (5Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this cell line, TTR is synthesized and secreted into the cell medium (22Blaner W.S. Bonifacio M.J. Feldman H.D. Piantedosi R. Saraiva M.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and could interfere with a proper assessment of the binding capacity and affinity because the amount of iodinated TTR used is on the nanogram range as are the levels of TTR secreted by HepG2 (∼150 ng TTR/106cells) (22Blaner W.S. Bonifacio M.J. Feldman H.D. Piantedosi R. Saraiva M.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For this reason, all our assays were performed under serum-free conditions and with cells that do not produce TTR. Interestingly, our results in hepatomas that do not produce TTR and in primary cultures of hepatocytes from ttr knockout mice showed a single class of high affinity binding sites with aKd of ∼4 nm at 37 °C, which is effectively in the same range as the one previously report"
https://openalex.org/W2064923918,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a MADS box transcription factor that regulates muscle-specific and growth factor-inducible genes by binding the consensus sequence CC(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG, known as a CArG box. Because SRF expression is not restricted solely to muscle, its expression alone cannot account for the muscle specificity of some of its target genes. To understand further the role of SRF in muscle-specific transcription, we created transgenic mice harboring <i>lacZ</i> transgenes linked to tandem copies of different CArG boxes with flanking sequences. CArG boxes from the <i>SM22</i> and skeletal <i>α-actin</i> promoters directed highly restricted expression in developing smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle cells during early embryogenesis. In contrast, the CArG box and flanking sequences from the c-<i>fos</i> promoter directed expression throughout the embryo, with no preference for muscle cells. Systematic swapping of the core and flanking sequences of the <i>SM22</i> and c-<i>fos</i> CArG boxes revealed that cell type specificity was dictated in large part by sequences immediately flanking the CArG box core. Sequences that directed widespread embryonic expression bound SRF more strongly than those that directed muscle-restricted expression. We conclude that sequence variations among CArG boxes influence cell type specificity of expression and account, at least in part, for the ability of SRF to distinguish between growth factor-inducible and muscle-specific genes <i>in vivo</i>."

These include the generation of disulfide bonds in the proteins of seminal plasma or spermatozoa, the preservation of spermatozoan membrane integrity, antimicrobial activity (through the release of H2O2), and the protection of spermatozoa against the harmful effects of thiol after ejaculation (14Ostrowski M.C.

It has been shown recently that flavin-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase from chicken egg white contains one redox-active cystine bridge, and accepts a total of 4 electrons per active site (15Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

These sequences were similar to those of four mammalian cDNAs. The first of these, encoding human bone-derived growth factor-1 (BPGF-1; GenBank™ accession no.

The second, GEC-3 (GenBank™ accession no.U82982), was the product of a gene whose expression is hormone-dependent in the uterine tissue of the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus). The third, encoding the cell growth inhibiting factor (CGIF; GenBank™ accession no. E12644) was cloned from human lung fibroblast. The last is the product of quiescin Q6 (GenBank™ accession no. U972760) (18Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a gene that is specifically expressed, together with collagen α chains, decorin, and complement C1r, as cultured human lung fibroblasts begin to leave the proliferative cycle and enter quiescence (19Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). The quiescin Q6 gene has evolved by the fusion of two ancient genes, those for thioredoxin and ERV1 (18Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protothioredoxin gene first evolved into thioredoxin and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) genes; then the quiescin Q6 form diverged from the PDI form (18Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).We have now cloned and sequenced rat seminal vesicle FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase cDNA. We believe that this enzyme, together with quiescin Q6 and quiescin Q6-related genes, constitutes a new family of FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase-related proteins. They contain protein-disulfide isomerase/thioredoxin and ERV1 domains, which may assist in the folding of a number of newly synthesized or secreted proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDTT, 5–5′ dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), glutathione and papain were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France). The papain (EC 3.4.22.2) was repurified on a Mono-S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove the glycyl-endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.25) which usually contaminates the commercial enzyme (20Buttle D.J.

Z-Phe-Arg-NH-Mec (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in 10% dimethylformamide. E-64 was obtained from the Peptide Research Institute (Osaka, Japan). H2O2 was supplied by Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Catalase was prepared from frozen rat liver.Purification and Sequencing of Sulfhydryl Oxidase from Rat Seminal Vesicle FluidSeminal vesicle fluid from Wistar rats was collected directly (21Esnard A. Esnard F. Faucher D. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was diluted in four volumes of 0.01m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and homogenized in an Ultraturrax. The fraction of the centrifuged homogenate precipitated by 40–70% (NH4)2SO4 was redissolved and dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl and then chromatographed on carboxymethylated papain-Sepharose to eliminate rat cystatin C, a known inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteinase inhibitors (22Esnard A. Esnard F. Gauthier F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1988; 369: 219-222PubMed Google Scholar). Rat cystatin C was detected immunochemically in the proteins eluted with phosphate buffer pH 12.0. Most of the papain inhibitory activity was in the flow-through of the column. The unbound material was equilibrated with 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4 in 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and loaded on to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.1 × 7.0 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a gradient of (NH4)2SO4 decreasing from 1.5 to 0.0 m. The column was then washed with 30% ethylene glycol and the inhibitory activity eluted with a gradient of urea (0.0–6.0 m) in 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The inhibiting fractions were dialyzed against 0.01m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (2.1 × 7 cm) (Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted by a potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, gradient from 0.01 to 0.20m. The purity of the fractions was checked by reverse-phase chromatography using an Aquapore BU300 (C4) cartridge (2.1 × 30 mm; Applied Biosystems) and an acetonitrile gradient (0–60%) in 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular mass of the eluted peak was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Brücker reflex mass spectrometer. The amino acid sequence was determined on an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed liquid sequencer using the chemicals and programs recommended by the manufacturer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified using an on-line Applied Biosystems model 120A analyzer. Rat sulfhydryl oxidase cleavage was carried out on the reduced and pyridylethylated enzyme (23Hawke D. Yuan P. Applied Biosystems Bulletin 28. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA1987Google Scholar) after purifying by reverse-phase chromatography on an Aquapore BU300 (C4) cartridge using an acetonitrile gradient (0–60%) in 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid. CNBr cleavage was performed as previously described (24Esnard F. Esnard A. Faucher D. Capony J.P. Derancourt J. Brillard M. Gauthier F. Biol. Chem.

The resulting material was either analyzed directly by reverse-phase chromatography on Aquapore BU300 or submitted to endoproteinase Lys-C, used according to the manufacturer's directions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by reverse-phase chromatography.Deglycosylation of Rat Sulfhydryl OxidaseRat sulfhydryl oxidase was deglycosylated using endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Sigma) at concentrations of 0.08–2.5 units/ml. Fractions were incubated overnight in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS in the presence of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Papain Inhibiting ActivityPurified papain was titrated against E-64 (25Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Papain (0.01 μm range) and sulfhydryl oxidase (nanomolar range) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Brij, and 2 mm DTT in the presence or not of catalase (about 50 nm). The residual enzyme activity was measured with Z-Phe-Arg-NH-Mec (5 μm final) on a Dynatech Microfluor reader or a F-2000 Hitachi spectrofluorimeter.Sulfhydryl Oxidase AssaysDithiotreitol (2 mm) was oxidized in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Aliquots (7 μl) of the incubation mixture were removed and added to 650 μl of 0.54 mm DTNB in the same buffer, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured (26Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21077) Google Scholar).Total RNA Extraction, Poly(A)+ RNA Purification, and Northern BlotTotal RNA was extracted from Wistar rat tissues using the TriReagent method (Euromedex, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg) or poly(A)+ RNA from rat seminal vesicles (1 μg) was separated on 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °C with the QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene). A 300-bp probe was generated from the 3′-untranslated region of rat SOx cDNA by PCR using the forward primer (5′-AACATCGTCAGAGAC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-AGCTGGGTAGGCCAGAGAA-3′). One hundred nanograms of this probe was [α-32P]dCTP random primer-labeled and added to prehybridization buffer. Hybridization was performed overnight at the same temperature. Membranes were washed at 68 °C for 20 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice for 30 min at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS. They were then exposed to Kodak AR x-ray film at −70 °C using intensifying screens for 4 h to 7 days. RNA markers (Promega) were used to determine the size of SOx transcript.Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) AnalysisThe first cDNA strand was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA prepared from various rat tissues using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT)17 primer following the manufacturer's instructions. At the end of reverse transcription, the reaction mixture (20 μl) was diluted to 1000 μl with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and 1 μl of this solution was used to amplify a 400-bp SOx fragment or a 800-bp GAPDH fragment (internal standard). The sequences of the 5′ and 3′ primers for SOx were 5′-ACTTGAGCGAGGTGGACAGTCAAG-3′ and 5′-AGCACAGGCACTCGGGAA-3′; for GAPDH they were 5′-AGTTCAACGGCACAGTCAAGGCTGAGAAT-3′ and 5′-GAGGGGCCTCCACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGC-3′. Amplification was performed in a Progene thermocycler (Techne) using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 62 °C for 2 min, and 68 °C for 40 min for second strand synthesis, the thermocycling parameters were 30 cycles of amplification at 96 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 90 s. Ten microliters (1/5 of PCR products) were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. Expression of SOx mRNA was quantified by densitometry and corrected using GAPDH as internal standard.cDNA Cloning of Rat SOx, Sequencing, and Plasmid ConstructionThe 5′ end of the rat SOx cDNA was generated as follows. One microgram of poly(A)+ mRNA from rat seminal vesicles was first reverse transcribed using a reverse primer 5′-GCGAAGAACTCCACCGCCCAG-3′. This primer was synthesized on a conserved 5′ region of human quiescin Q6, human BPGF-1, and guinea pig GEC-3 cDNAs. After addition of a poly(C) tail to the first cDNA strand with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (28Frohman M.A. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S40-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cDNA amplification was performed with the same reverse primer and an oligo(dG) primer, using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The thermocycling parameters were: one cycle at each of 95 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 68 °C for 40 min; and 20 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The 300-bp amplified product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into a pGEM®T vector (Promega). DNA constructions were transformed into XL2-Blue Epicurian Coli ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). The two cDNA strands were sequenced with a Thermosequenase™ II dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Based on the sequence of this 5′ end fragment, a specific 5′ primer, 5′-ACTTGAGCGAGGTGGACAGTCAAG-3′, was synthesized to generate the full-length rat sulfhydryl oxidase cDNA. The reverse transcription reaction was performed from 1 μg of rat seminal vesicle poly(A)+ RNA with an oligo(dT)17 primer for 1 h at 42 °C. Amplification was performed as described in Ref. 28Frohman M.A. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S40-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar with 1/1000 of the reverse transcription product, in the presence of an oligo(dT) primer and the specific 5′-primer. Cycling parameters were one cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 58 °C for 2 min and 68 °C for 40 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 4 min; and one final cycle with an elongation step at 68 °C for 15 min. The 2.5-kilobase pair product corresponding to the full-length rat SOx cDNA was then cloned in pCR3.1 T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCR3.1-rSOx plasmid; it was sequenced with forward and reverse rSOx-specific primers. The pcDNA/3.1/LacZ/V5-His-TOPO (pcDNA-3-LacZ) came from the Eukaryotic TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen).Cell Culture and TransfectionsThe Hamster ovary epithelial cell strain CHO was maintained in 10% fetal calf serum (Eurobio, France) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Eurobio) supplemented with 100 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Eurobio) and 2 mml-glutamine (Eurobio). Transfection was performed using the electroporation method. Briefly, subconfluent CHO cells were trypsinized and washed twice in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (2.4 106cells in 400 μl of culture medium) with 10 μg of pcDNA-3-LacZ or pCR3.1-rSOx plasmid were then subject to electroporation at 150 V for 25 ms in a ECM399 electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA). They were then plated in 75-cm2 flasks. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were passaged and the medium was supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. After 2 weeks in this selective medium, resistant colonies were selected, passaged for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, and analyzed for expression and enzymatic activity of SOx recombinant protein or for activity of β-galactosidase on lacZ-transfected cells.Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and Activity of Recombinant EnzymeOne hundred microliters of stably transfected CHO 10× concentrated supernatant were incubated in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 5 μl of pre-immune or immune rat seminal vesicle SOx serum. After gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight, 50 μl of 50% (v/v) Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for an additional 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose was then washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and heated for 3 min at 100 °C (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was analyzed by Western blot with immune rat seminal vesicle sulfhydryl oxidase serum after electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were revealed by chemiluminescence with the detection system RPN 2106 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A concentrated supernatant (10×) of CHO transfected cells was used to measure recombinant sulfhydryl oxidase activity, as described previously. Activity of 75 ng of native protein measured in 10× concentrated DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum was used as a control.RESULTSPurification and Sequencing of Rat FAD-dependent Seminal Vesicle Fluid Sulfhydryl OxidaseWhile purifying the specific inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteinases from seminal vesicle fluid, using papain as target enzyme, we found a hitherto unreported inhibitory activity that was not bound to carboxymethylated papain Sepharose (data not shown). This was unusual behavior for any known specific inhibitor of the cystatin superfamily (30Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The unbound papain inhibitory activity was fractionated by hydrophobic chromatography. The activity was not eluted by either a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate or by 30% ethylene glycol, but it was eluted by an increasing gradient of urea without detectable loss of activity. The inhibitory activity was further fractionated on hydroxyapatite gel using a phosphate buffer gradient. The activity eluted with the yellow retained fractions. One peak was at 39 min by reverse-phase chromatography on Aquapore BU-300 but there was no inhibitory activity in the eluted peak. It corresponds to a protein with a Mr of 64,000 by SDS-PAGE and of 64,624 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). These molecular properties were similar to those of the previously described rat sulfhydryl oxidase (EC 1.8.3.2), an androgen-independent protein in seminal vesicle fluid that catalyzes the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups to disulfides with the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (11Ostrowski M.C. Kistler W.S. Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,14Ostrowski M.C. Kistler W.S. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Since papain activity must be analyzed under reducing conditions, usually in 2 millimolar DTT, the free thiol content of the reaction mixtures in the presence of inhibitory fractions was measured using DTNB. DTT progressively disappeared from the medium as a function of time until it had all been consumed. The parallel production of H2O2 was demonstrated by the appearance of luminescence in the presence of luminol and peroxidase (data not shown), and this luminescence was totally abolished by incubation with rat liver catalase. The indirect inhibition of papain by sulfhydryl oxidase was partially reversible, because only a fraction of the inactivated papain could be reactivated when placed under reducing conditions (2 mm DTT) (Fig.2). This inactivation is explained by the direct effect of H2O2 on protease, because papain remains active when sulfhydryl oxidase acts in the presence of catalase (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of rat sulfhydryl oxidase on papain activity. a, activity of papain incubated with sulfhydryl oxidase. Papain (0.01 μm) was incubated with sulfhydryl oxidase in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Brij 35, and 2 mm DTT at 37 °C. Activity of the papain (0.25 nm final) was analyzed at different times with 5 μm Z-Phe-Arg-NH-Mec. Fluorescence is expressed as arbitrary units (AU). b, activity of papain incubated with sulfhydryl oxidase in presence of catalase.c, concentration of H2O2 produced by the action of sulfhydryl oxidase on DTT. H2O2concentration was deduced from the free sulfhydryl concentration determined using DTNB. The H2O2 produced was calculated on the basis of 1/2 H2O2 per R-SH consumed by sulfhydryl oxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Direct sequencing of the unreduced or of the pyridylethylated rat sulfhydryl oxidase gave a sequence of 25 amino acids (ARLSVLYS(F/S)ADPLTLLDADTVRGAV). The pyridylethylated protein was therefore submitted to CNBr cleavage and reverse-phase chromatography (Aquapore BU 300). One narrow peak, eluting at 30.4 min, gave the sequence XXVGSPNAAVLXLXI. Finally, endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage was performed directly on the CNBr cleavage product. A reverse-phase chromatography peak at 33.5 min gave the sequence RLIDALESHRDTWPPACPXL. These amino-terminal and internal sequences of the rat sulfhydryl oxidase did not correspond to any protein sequence in data banks and were therefore the first elements of sequence of FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase. However, they were similar to the amino acid sequences derived from two human cDNAs, BPGF-1 and quiescin Q6 (hQ6) and to the amino acid sequence derived from the guinea pig (C. porcellus) GEC-3 gene product. Bone-derived growth factor-1 was cloned from an osteosarcoma cell line. Quiescin Q6 is a gene that is expressed in confluent cultures of human lung fibroblasts (19Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the GEC-3 gene is hormone-dependent in the uterine tissue of guinea pig. We therefore decided to clone the rat sulfhydryl oxidase cDNAMolecular Cloning of Rat Seminal Vesicle FAD-dependent Sulfhydryl OxidaseA two-step cloning strategy was developed to obtain the complete cDNA of sulfhydryl oxidase from seminal vesicles using a primer based on the homology between the amino-terminal sequence of the rat enzyme and the deduced open reading frame of human quiescin Q6, guinea pig GEC3, and human BPGF-1 cDNA (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). The rat 2472-bp sulfhydryl oxidase cDNA contains a polyadenylation signal after the stop codon (Fig. 3) showing that it codes for a full-length sulfhydryl oxidase. This cDNA has an open reading frame of 1710 bp coding for 570 amino acids. The deduced protein contains a 32-amino acid putative signal peptide, which leads to a mature protein with a calculated Mr of 60,035, a value distinct from that of the native enzyme, which is 64,624 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). Compared with the deduced protein sequence, the higher mass of the native form is probably due to the carbohydrate content of the mature protein, which is glycosylated, as seen in Fig.1. However, only one of these two putative N-glycosylation sites seems to be used in vivo, as observed by the modification of SOx electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE after incubation with increasing concentrations of endoglycosidase F (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of rat sulfhydryl oxidase contains all the amino acid sequences of the three peptide fragments obtained from the native seminal vesicle enzyme (Fig. 3). Moreover, the NH2 amino acid sequence of native protein, which started by the ARLSV sequence, confirms the presence of a 32-amino acid cleavable signal peptide, which is released in the mature secreted sulfhydryl oxidase protein.Figure 3Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of rat sulfhydryl oxidase. The rat sulfhydryl oxidase open reading frame contains 1710 bp between ATG (bp 50–52) and TGA (1760–1762) coding for a 570-amino acid protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of rSOx contains a signal peptide (amino acids 1–32, according to rat sulfhydry"

Histones are relatively small proteins with a very high proportion of positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine); the positive charge helps the histones bind tightly to DNA regardless of its nucleotide sequence (1Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raft M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Robertson M. Adams R. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 342Google Scholar). The five types of histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) fall into two main groups: core histones and linker histones. Core histones are wrapped by DNA as octamers, consisting of two H2A-H2B dimers and a tetramer of H3-H4 (2D'Anna J.A. Isenberg I.

H3 at serine 28 is phosphorylated during early mitosis and with mitotic chromosome condensation in various mammalian cell lines (34Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K.

However, the kinase that is responsible for H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of MAP1 kinases in phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 in vitro and in vivo after UVB irradiation. Minimal Eagle's medium (MEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from BioWhittaker, Inc.l-Glutamine was from Life Technologies, Inc. Gentamicin was from Quality Biological. Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad. PD 98059 and SB 202190 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Sigma. Pure histone H3 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibody-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and antibodies for phosphorylated ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs were from New England Biolabs. Antibody for H3 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Antibody for phosphorylated H3 at serine 28 was produced and identified as described previously (34Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Active ERK1, ERK2, p38 kinase, JNK1, and JNK2 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Phosphorylation of histone H3 by activated ERK1, ERK2, p38 kinase, JNK1, or JNK2 was carried out as described previously (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol.

In brief, pure histone H3 or chromatin of JB6 Cl 41 cells was incubated with ERK1, ERK2, p38 kinase, JNK1 or JNK2, and 200 μm ATP in 50 μl kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2) for 45 min at 30 °C. The samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated H3 at serine 28 was detected by Western blotting with a specific antibody (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T.

Equivalent numbers of cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and cultured in 5% FBS MEM until they reached 85% confluence and then were starved in 0.1% FBS MEM for 48 h. Cells then were incubated for 2 h in fresh 0.1% FBS MEM, after which time they were exposed to UVB and then cultured for additional time periods. Because the normal UVB lamp also generates a small amount of UVC light, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber with a Kodak Kodacel K6808® filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. After UVB irradiation the media were removed. The cultured cells were harvested and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Acid-solution protein extraction was carried out as described by the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. In brief (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), acid-soluble proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), and then H2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m (0.4 n) and the protein solutions were left on ice for 60 min. Supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm/10 min and precipitated on ice for 45 min with a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid. These tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm/10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed once with acidic acetone and then once with acetone. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), and the acid-soluble proteins were stored at −20 °C. Acid-soluble proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE after boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Resolved acid-soluble proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal antibody against H3 or the monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated H3 at serine 28. The second antibody against rabbit or rat IgG-conjugated alkaline phosphatase, respectively, was incubated with the respective membrane for 4 h at 4 °C. Membrane-bound proteins were detected with chemiluminescence (Enzyme-catalyzed fluorescence of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using the Storm 840 Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Similar to phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 plays a key role during early mitosis and coincides with the initiation of mitotic chromosome condensation (34Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To determine the role of MAP kinases in mediating H3 phosphorylation at serine 28, we incubated pure histone H3 protein with each of the active MAP kinases (ERK1, ERK2, p38 kinase, JNK1, or JNK2) and 200 μm ATP (32Zhong S.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated H3 at serine 28 was detected by a specific monoclonal antibody as before (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The results show that pure histone H3 at serine 28 was phosphorylated strongly by ERK1 (Fig. 1 A), ERK2 (Fig. 1 B), or p38 kinase (Fig. 1 C) and to a comparatively lesser degree by JNK1 (Fig. 1 D) or JNK2 (Fig.1 E) in vitro. Similar results were found also by using chromatin as substrate for these MAP kinases (data not shown). Our previous study showed that UVB could induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in JB6 Cl 41 cells (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the signal transduction pathways responsible for H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 in vivo, we exposed mouse epidermal JB6 cells to UVB irradiation and then extracted acid-soluble proteins for detection of H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 by Western blot with a specific antibody (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The results show that UVB strongly induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 (Fig.2, A and B). The dose-response study showed that H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 increased with UVB exposure from 1 to 6 kJ/m2 (Fig.2 A). H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 was greater at 30 or 60 min than at 15 or 120 min after UVB irradiation (Fig. 2 B). We found previously that phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 was higher at 15 or 30 min than at 60 min (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the level of phosphorylated H3 at serine 28 was higher at 60 min compared with phosphorylation at serine 10 at 60 min (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) after UVB irradiation. This difference in the phosphorylation time courses between H3 at serine 28 and serine 10 suggests that phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 and serine 10 may be mediated by different pathways. These results indicate that UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 is dose- and time-dependent. MAP kinases including ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs are mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. We showed previously that UVB strongly induced phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs in JB6 Cl 41 cells (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine the possible role of MAP kinases in mediating UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 in vivo, we first examined the influence of specific chemical inhibitors on UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 in JB6 Cl 41 cells. PD 98059 is a specific inhibitor of the activation of MEK1 in vivo and in vitro (37Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and 50 μm PD 98059 totally blocks activation of ERKs (22Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) but not JNKs or p38 kinases (40Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A.H. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Our results showed that 25 μm PD 98059 markedly inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 (Fig.3 A). This result implies that ERKs may be involved in the UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28. SB 202190 is a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase (26Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 40Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A.H. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and pretreatment of cells with 0.5–4 μm SB 202190 almost totally blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 (Fig.3 B). A high concentration of SB 202190 (40 μm) can inhibit activation of ERKs, but 10 μm SB 202190 has almost no effect on the phosphorylation of ERKs (39Oh-hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K.-I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 263: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used low concentrations of SB 202190 (0.5–4 μm), which selectively blocks activation of p38 kinase, to inhibit p38-mediated H3 phosphorylation at serine 28. The above data indicate that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 may be mediated by ERKs and p38 kinase in vivo. Previous studies showed that overexpression of DNM ERK2, DNM p38 kinase, or DNM JNK1 markedly inhibited activation of endogenous ERKs (35Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol.

To identify the role of MAP kinases in UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 in vivo, we used cells expressing these mutant kinases. Compared with JB6 Cl 41 cells (Fig.4 A), cells expressing DNM ERK2 totally blocked UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 at 60 min after UVB irradiation, and DNM p38 or DNM JNK1 also markedly suppressed UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 by ∼70–80% (Fig. 4,B and C). In contrast, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 at 60 min increased ∼2-fold in UVB-treated JB6 Cl 41 cells (Fig. 4, A–C). The inhibition of UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 in DNM-ERK2, DNM-p38, and DNM-JNK1 cells also was dependent on UVB dose (Fig.5, A–C). However, inhibition of phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 by DNM ERK2 cells (Fig. 5 A) was stronger than that by DNM p38 (Fig.5 B) or DNM JNK1 cells (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Dose response of UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 in JB6 Cl 41, DNM ERK2, DNM p38, and DNM JNK JB6 Cl 41 cells. Cells of JB6 Cl 41 and JB6 Cl 41 DNM ERK2 (A), JB6 Cl 41 DNM p38 (B), and JB6 Cl 41 DNM JNK1 (C) were exposed to UVB at doses of 1, 2, 4, or 6 kJ/m2 and incubated an additional 30 min. Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 and total H3 protein were detected as indicated in Fig. 1. The arrows denote the position of phospho-H3 at serine 28 and total H3 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also used Jnk1(Jnk1 −/−) and Jnk2(Jnk2 −/−) knockout cells and Jnkwild-type (Jnk +/+) cells to examine the role of JNKs in UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28. The results showed that UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 was blocked inJnk1 −/− cells (Fig.6, A and C) but not in Jnk2 −/− cells (Fig. 6, B andD) compared with Jnk1 +/+ cells (Fig.6, A–D). These experiments further confirmed that ERK1, ERK2, p38 kinase, and JNK1 mediate UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28. In contrast, UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 was not affected inJnk1 −/− and Jnk2 −/−cells (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our present study indicates that UVB irradiation activates MAP kinases (ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs) resulting in phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28. We found that active ERK1, ERK2, and p38 kinase strongly phosphorylated H3 at serine 28, whereas JNK1 and JNK2 phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 was relatively weaker in vitro. Further, our data showed that PD 98059 and SB 202190 and the expression of DNM ERK2, p38 kinase, or JNK1 inhibited UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 28. UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 was blocked also in Jnk1 −/− but not inJnk2 −/− cells. These data clearly indicate that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 is mediated mainly through ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNK1 pathways. The covalent modification of the amino-terminal tails of histone H3 has emerged as an important mechanism in regulation of transcriptional activation and chromatin condensation. The best understood histone modification is acetylation of lysine residues of H3/H4, which is mediated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (19Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T.

However, mechanisms regarding phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and serine 28 have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years.

However, the pathway that mediates phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 is unknown.

Inhibition of phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 by expression of DNM ERKs (Fig. 4 A) is more marked than inhibition by either DNM p38 kinase (Fig. 4 B) or DNM JNK1 (Fig. 4 C). This implies that ERKs may play a more important role in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 28 than p38 kinase or JNKs. JNK1 and JNK2 also phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 28 in vitro, but compared with JNK2, JNK1 phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 was weaker (Fig. 1, D andE). Moreover, expression of DNM JNK1 inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (Figs. 4 C and 5C), and phosphorylation of histone H3 was blocked inJnk1 −/− cells (Fig. 6, A andC) but not in Jnk2 −/− cells (Fig.6, B and D) compared withJnk +/+ cells (Fig. 6,A–D). These results indicate that JNK1 indeed is involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28in vivo but not in phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (32). The difference between phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 and serine 10 by JNKs suggests that H3 phosphorylation at distinct sites in the N terminus may be important in different physiological functions after UVB irradiation. Our results also show that the highest peak of UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 is at 60 min (Fig.2 B), whereas UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is highest at 30 min after UVB irradiation (32Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because serine 10 of histone H3 is closer than serine 28 to the NH2-terminal tail of histone H3, serine 10 of histone H3 may be phosphorylated faster than serine 28 after UVB irradiation. This difference in phosphorylation time implies that outside serine residues of histone H3 are phosphorylated preferentially after UVB irradiation. This difference in phosphorylation time of H3 at serine 10 and serine 28 also suggested that MAP kinase may indirectly regulate phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 through activation of as yet unidentified protein kinases. We are currently investigating the role of MSK1, a downstream kinase of MAP kinases, in the UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 (26). Although serine 28 and serine 10 of histone H3 have identical surrounding sequences (that is, both are RKS; Ref. 10Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 6: 41-45Crossref Scopus (6679) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of each of these serine residues of histone H3 are different. These phosphorylation responses to different signals are likely to have distinct effects on H3 function during chromatin remodeling and gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2089602785,"EmrE, a multidrug transporter fromEscherichia coli removes toxic compounds from the cell in exchange with protons. Glu-14 is the only charged residue in the putative membrane domains and is fully conserved in more than 50 homologues of the protein. This residue was shown to be an essential part of the binding site, common to protons and substrate. EmrE bearing a single carboxylic residue, Glu-14, shows uptake and binding properties similar to those of the wild type. This suggests that a small protein bearing only 110 amino acids with a single carboxyl in position 14 is the most basic structure that shows ion-coupled transport activity. The role of Glu-14 in substrate binding was examined by using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a hydrophobic carbodiimide that is known to react with carboxyls. Tetraphenylphosphonium binding to both wild type and the single carboxyl mutant is inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in a dose-dependent manner. Ethidium and other substrates of EmrE prevent this inhibition with an order of potency in accord with their apparent affinities. This suggests that dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding is sterically prevented by the substrate, supporting the contention that Glu-14, the reactive residue, is part of the substrate-binding site.

Multidrug transporters recognize a broad range of substrates with a relatively high affinity and actively remove them from the cytoplasm (1Higgins C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol... 1992; 8: 67-113Google Scholar, 2Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms.Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. 1996; 2Google Scholar). In many cases, the substrates are toxic to the cells, and their removal confers resistance. For example, multidrug transporters are responsible for resistance of cancer cells and bacteria to antineoplastic agents and antibiotics, respectively (1Higgins C. Annu. Rev.

The SMR are the smallest multidrug transporters known (5Paulsen I. Skurray R. Tam R. Saier M. Turner R. Weiner J. Goldberg E. Grinius L. Mol. Microbiol... 1996; 19: 1167-1175Google Scholar, 6Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev... 1996; 60: 575-608Google Scholar). They are about 100 amino acids long, widespread in the eubacterial kingdom. EmrE, a member of this family, is a 12-kDa transporter fromEscherichia coli (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). This transporter is unique in terms of its size and properties and can be easily expressed and purified. Therefore, the protein can serve as a model system to study ion-coupled transporters (8Schuldiner S. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. J. Exp. Biol... 1997; 200: 335-341Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of EmrE predicts four α-helical transmembrane segments. Results from transmission Fourier transform infrared measurements and high resolution NMR studies agree remarkably well with this prediction (9Arkin I. Russ W. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Google Scholar, 10Schwaiger M. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. Coles M. Groger A. Schwarz A. Schuldiner S. Kessler H. Eur. J. Biochem... 1998; 254: 610-619Google Scholar). EmrE was shown to be a homo-oligomer by mixing of wild type and inactive mutants, both in vivo and in vitro, in which negative dominance has been observed (11Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 31044-31048Google Scholar). The projection structure of two-dimension crystals of EmrE revealed a nonsymmetric dimeric structure as the basic oligomeric unit (12Tate C. Kunji E. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2001; 20: 77-81Google Scholar). The protein is tightly packed, without any continuous aqueous domain (9Arkin I. Russ W. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Google Scholar, 13Steiner Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 19480-19486Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of a hydrophobic pathway in the membrane region through which the substrates are translocated. EmrE contains eight charged residues, seven of them in the hydrophilic loops, and only one, Glu-14, is embedded in the putative membrane domain (Fig. 1). Substitution of this highly conserved residue totally abolishes resistance to EmrE substrates and dramatically affects transport activity (5Paulsen I. Skurray R. Tam R. Saier M. Turner R. Weiner J. Goldberg E. Grinius L. Mol. Microbiol... 1996; 19: 1167-1175Google Scholar, 14Grinius L. Goldberg E. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 29998-30004Google Scholar, 15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S.

The results support the contention that this residue is an essential part of the binding domain shared by substrates and protons. The occupancy of this site is mutually exclusive and provides the basis of the simplest coupling for two fluxes (17Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Google Scholar). Carboxylic residues embedded in the membrane were shown to be important for activity in various ion-coupled transporters (17Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Google Scholar, 18Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett... 2000; 476: 93-97Google Scholar). In some cases, these carboxyls are involved in substrate recognition and binding, and in others, they are part of the coupled ion binding site. EmrE is unique in that a single carboxyl is involved in recognition of both substrate and the coupling ion. In this work we provide strong support for the role of Glu-14; a mutant bearing a single carboxylic residue (Glu-14) is shown to be active. E. coli TA15 cells (19Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1987; 84: 2615-2619Google Scholar) with pT7-7 plasmid (20Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar) containing wild type EmrE-Myc/His and pGP1-2 plasmid are used throughout all the experiments (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar). The E25C/D84C mutant, in which Glu-25 and Asp-84 were replaced by Cys, was also constructed into the pT7-7 plasmid with the c-Myc and His tags by using polymerase chain reaction and standard methods of molecular cloning. E. coli TA15 cells with pT7-7 EmrE-His were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 0.01% MgSO4, 2.5 μg/ml thiamine, 0.5% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin, to anA600 nm of about 0.8. The temperature was then increased to 42 °C to induce the T7 polymerase; 15 min later the culture was shifted back to 30 °C for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in TSCD buffer (250 mmsucrose, 150 mm choline chloride, 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm MgSO4). At this stage the cell pellets can be kept at −70 °C until further processing. For preparation of membrane vesicles, the cells were thawed and resuspended in TSCD buffer containing DNaseI. The cells were broken up by two passages through a French Press at 20,000 p.s.i. Undisrupted cells were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then pelleted by centrifugation at 311,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in TSCD buffer and stored at −70 °C. EmrE-His protein was purified using ion chelate chromatography essentially as described in Muth and Schuldiner (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar), except that size exclusion chromatography was omitted as the last purification step. Membranes were solubilized in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,1.5% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DM,1 Anatrace, Inc. Maumee, OH), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After a 20-min incubation at 25 °C the extract was centrifuged at 435,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with the Ni-NTA beads (Qiagene, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) in the presence of 20 mm imidazole for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.08% DM, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30 mm imidazole. For reconstitution the beads bound to EmrE-His (EmrE beads) were washed first in the same buffer, with 0.08% DM and then in buffer containing 1%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). EmrE-His was eluted from the beads with the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and DM for purification or n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside for reconstitution. Reconstitution was performed essentially as previously described for NhaA (21Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 11289-11294Google Scholar). Purified EmrE-His was mixed with a solution containing 25 mg/ml E. coli phospholipids (Avanti Inc. Alabaster, AL), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. After sonication the mixture was diluted into NH4 buffer containing 190 mm NH4Cl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For proteoliposome formation the diluted mixture was incubated for 20 min in 25 °C and then centrifuged at 257,000 × g for 1 h. Proteoliposomes were resuspended in NH4 buffer, frozen, and kept at −70 °C. Before the assay, the proteoliposome suspension was thawed and sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for a few seconds until clear. Uptake of [14C]methyl viologen into proteoliposomes was assayed essentially as described in Yerushalmiet al. (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). 3 μl of the ammonium chloride-containing proteoliposomes (about 600 ng of EmrE) were diluted into 200 μl of an ammonium-free solution. The latter contained 37.2 μm[14C]methyl viologen (64–74 nCi/assay), 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Tricine, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. At given times the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution. The samples were filtered through Millipore filters (0.22 μm) and washed with an additional 2 ml of solution. The radioactivity on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation. In each experiment the values obtained in a control reaction, with 15 μm nigericin, were subtracted from all experimental points. This background was no more than 10% of most experimental values. The kinetics of uptake was measured in duplicate at 25 °C. Tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) binding was assayed essentially as described in Muth and Schuldiner (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar). EmrE-His membranes were solubilized with 0.8% DM in NH4 buffer (190 mm NH4Cl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7) at 25 °C for 15 min. Ni-NTA beads were washed twice in distilled H2O and once in NH4buffer with 0.08% DM (NH4-DM buffer). The beads (10 μl per assay) were bound to EmrE-His protein from solubilized membranes or to purified protein by incubation at 4 °C for 45 min. The unbound material was discarded, and the EmrE-His bound to beads (EmrE beads) was washed with NH4-DM buffer. After two washes with NH4-DM buffer, 200 μl of buffer containing 12.5 nm [3H]TPP+ (5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. In each experiment the values obtained in a control reaction, with 25 μm unlabeled TPP+, were subtracted. The binding reaction was stopped by separating the beads from the supernatant by pulse centrifugation and then removing the supernatant. The bead fraction was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 450 μl of NH4-DM buffer containing 150 mm imidazole to release the EmrE-His and [3H]TPP+ from the beads. After spinning down the beads, the [3H]TPP+-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. All binding reactions were performed in triplicate. In experiments that tested the effect of EmrE substrates on [3H]TPP+ binding, the substrates were added with the [3H]TPP+ to the EmrE beads. For examining the effect of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) on [3H]TPP+ binding, EmrE beads (10 μl) were incubated at 4 °C in a 100-μl suspension of NH4-DM buffer containing different concentrations of DCCD. In some of the experiments EmrE substrates (ethidium bromide, acriflavine, methyl viologen, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), or benzalkonium) were added to the buffer as well as DCCD. [3H]TPP+ binding was assayed on the EmrE beads after the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.4 ml of NH4-DM buffer and immediate spinning down. When the effect of pH on TPP+ binding was tested, the solutions contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Tricine, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.08% DM. The different solutions were buffered with 30 mm MES (pH range 6.5–7.5) and Tris-Cl (pH range 7.5–9.5) and titrated with either KOH or HCl. In these experiments the binding buffer contained 6 nm[3H]TPP+ (30 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For measurement of the Kd calculations of E25C/D84C EmrE,1 μg of purified protein was used. TPP+ binding was measured in a range of concentrations (3–300 nm) essentially as described in Muth and Schuldiner (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar).Kd and Bmax were calculated from the Scatchard plot. In previous studies Glu-14 was shown to be central for activity. This residue is involved in binding both substrate and proton but separately in time (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar, 16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). To further characterize the importance of Glu-14 for EmrE activity, a single carboxyl mutant (E25C/D84C) was constructed. This mutant confers resistance to EmrE substrates, although it is less resistant compared with the wild type, especially in the presence of methyl viologen. (16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). Because of the uniqueness of such a protein with a single carboxyl, we tagged it with a His6 tag, purified it, and characterized its activity. After purification on a Ni-NTA column the protein was reconstituted with E. coli lipids by detergent dilution. The proteoliposomes loaded with NH4Cl were diluted into an ammonium-free buffer to generate a pH gradient (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). The E25C/D84C mutant shows significant uptake activity (50% of the wild type activity, Fig. 2 A), and transport is inhibited by the ionophore nigericin that prevents generation of a pH gradient (not shown). The pH dependence of the uptake reaction is practically identical to that of the wild type (not shown). This demonstrates again that Glu-14 is indeed central for transport activity whereas the other carboxylic residues are less important. The single carboxyl mutant binds the high affinity substrate TPP+ with properties comparable with those of the wild type protein (Kd = 28 nm,Bmax = 0.18 mol/mol). The affinity of the mutant protein is 3 times lower than that of the wild type (Kd = 10 nm (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar)) suggesting that the two hydrophilic carboxyls have only a minor effect on substrate binding. The total number of binding sites determined from the experiment is 0.15–0.2 mol/mol. This value is slightly lower than that of the wild type (0.25–0.3 mol/mol (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar)). The difference can result from the fact that the mutant protein was only partially purified, as compared with the wild type EmrE that was purified to homogeneity. The pH dependence of binding activity of this mutant is practically identical to that of the wild type as well (Fig. 2 B). TPP+ binding increases dramatically between pH 6.7 and 7.8 and is maximal above pH 8.3 (50% at pH 7.3). This similarity supports our previous suggestion that Glu-14, and not the other charged residues, is responsible for the pH dependence. In addition, the findings indicate the presence of a residue with an apparent pK of 7.3–7.5 in the binding site of the wild type as well as the mutant. EmrE substrates inhibit TPP+ binding of the E25C/D84C mutant at the same concentration range as for the wild type (Fig.2 C (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar)). Benzalkonium, ethidium, and acriflavine inhibit binding with a relatively high affinity; 10 μmbenzalkonium or 100 μm ethidium and acriflavine fully inhibit TPP+ binding. As previously shown for the detergent-solubilized wild type EmrE, the affinity for MPP+is lower, and even at 10 mm it does not inhibit binding totally, whereas methyl viologen does not inhibit at all, at the concentrations tested. Single carboxyl EmrE shows uptake and binding properties similar to those of the wild type. This similarity between the E25C/D84C mutant and the wild type protein supports the contention that Glu-14 is the only carboxyl essential for transport activity and for proton and substrate binding. Characterization of the single carboxyl mutant emphasizes the importance of this residue. The role of Glu-14 in substrate recognition and binding was further examined by chemical modification by carbodiimides. In previous studies we showed that DCCD, a carbodiimide that is known to react with carboxyls in hydrophobic environments, inhibits uptake by wild type EmrE in a dose-dependent manner (16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that substitution of each of the two other carboxylic residues, Glu-25 and Asp-84, does not modify the profile of inhibition. Glu-14 is the only carboxylic residue common to the wild type and the two other mutants; therefore it was suggested that this residue is the site of action of DCCD. In this work the DCCD effect on binding of the high affinity substrate, TPP+, was tested directly. The binding to wild type EmrE is inhibited in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). The reaction with the detergent-solubilized protein can be controlled and manipulated very easily. To slow down the reaction it was carried out at 4 °C. Under these conditions 50% of inhibition can be seen after 25 min of incubation in 4 °C, whereas 2 h are needed for full inhibition (Fig. 3 A). Addition of 150 μm ethidium, one of the EmrE substrates, during the incubation with DCCD prevents this inactivation almost completely. Lower ethidium bromide concentration has only a partial protective effect. Other substrates of EmrE prevent inhibition by DCCD as well (Fig. 3 B). Very low concentrations of benzalkonium (1 μm) prevent most of the DCCD effect on binding, whereas ethidium and acriflavine protect against DCCD inhibition at higher concentrations. MPP+shows only 50% protection, even at high concentration (20 mm), whereas methyl viologen does not prevent DCCD inhibition even at concentrations as high as 100 mm. The effect of various substrates on DCCD prevention of binding is in the same range and order of potency as the inhibition of TPP+binding. We suggest that substrate protection against the DCCD reaction is most likely due to steric hindrance, and therefore, its target residue is in or near the binding site. As was shown here the activity of the single carboxyl mutant E25C/D84C is comparable with that of the wild type EmrE. In addition, the only site of action for DCCD in this mutant is the single carboxylic residue, Glu-14. Therefore, this mutant can be used for further examining the role of Glu-14 in substrate recognition. DCCD inhibits also TPP+ binding to E25C/D84C EmrE in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). As previously shown for the single replacement D84C (16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar), this mutant is also more susceptible to DCCD than the wild type. After less than 5 min of incubation with 500 μm DCCD, 50% of the binding is inhibited, whereas 25 min are needed for the same inhibition of the wild type. Substitution of the carboxylic residues in the hydrophilic loops (Glu-25 and Asp-84) seems to increase DCCD accessibility to the protein and therefore increases the sensitivity. Ethidium bromide (150 μm) prevents most of the inhibition by DCCD. Other substrates of EmrE protect against the DCCD effect in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 D). As described above for the wild type, the substrates with the higher affinity are benzalkonium, ethidium bromide, and acriflavine that react in the micromolar range; MPP+ affinity is lower (milimolar range), and methyl viologen does not show any protection at all. Most of the substrates more efficiently prevent the inhibition of binding by DCCD in the wild type compared with the single carboxyl mutant. For example 100 μm acriflavine prevents the DCCD effect totally in the wild type, whereas in the mutant it prevents only 60% of the DCCD effect. This is in line with the observed higher rate of inhibition by DCCD in the mutant that decreases the efficiency of the protection. The protection against the DCCD effect by substrate in the single carboxyl mutant strengthens again the suggestion that Glu-14 is an essential part of the substrate-binding site. Binding of substrate to this residue decreases the accessibility of DCCD to this site and therefore prevents its action. The substrate specificity and the concentration range for inhibition of TPP+ binding and for protection against the DCCD effect is similar for the single carboxyl mutant. This confirms the above contention that the inhibition of the DCCD reaction with Glu-14 by substrates is most likely due to a steric effect. EmrE has eight charged residues, three of which are carboxyls (Glu-14, Glu-25, and Asp-84, Fig. 1). Glu-14 is strictly conserved in more than 50 homologues of EmrE and is the only charged residue essential for transport (16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). Replacement with an Asp has a profound effect on the behavior of the protein, because in the mutated protein the Asp residue has a much lower pK than the corresponding Glu (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar). Our results support the notion that Glu-14 is an essential part of the binding domain shared by substrates and protons but mutually exclusive in time (17Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Google Scholar). DCCD, a carbodiimide that was shown to react specifically with Glu-14, was previously shown to inhibit uptake of methyl viologen by proteoliposomes (16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). In this work we tested the effect of DCCD directly on binding of the high affinity substrate, TPP+, to the detergent-solubilized transporter. The detergent-solubilized protein maintains its ability to recognize most substrates at high affinity; the pK of Glu-14 is not modified, and the sensitivity to DCCD is conserved. The inhibition of transport by DCCD is observed at lower concentrations, but this may reflect the partition of this hydrophobic compound in the membrane, reaching an effective concentration much higher than in the bulk. The binding assay allows for a very simple termination of the reaction by dilution and washing as opposed to the proteoliposomes system where the DCCD partitions into the lipid phase and is not removed. DCCD inhibits binding of TPP+ to EmrE in a time-dependent manner, and this is prevented by the presence of EmrE substrates (benzalkonium, ethidium, acriflavine, and partially by MPP+). The different substrates inhibit TPP+ binding and the DCCD effect in the same range of concentrations, indicating that the binding affinity of each substrate is comparable with its potency to prevent the DCCD effect on binding. Our explanation for this effect is that binding of substrate limits the accessibility of DCCD to its site of action, Glu-14, suggesting that this residue is part of the substrate binding site. In the single carboxyl mutant (E25C/D84C) the substrate effect on inhibition by DCCD is comparable with what was shown for the wild type. In this mutant, the carboxylic residue Glu-14 is the only site of action for DCCD. Therefore, preventing this reaction between DCCD and Glu-14 by substrates strongly strengthens the role of Glu-14 in the substrate-binding site. Carboxylic residues embedded in the transmembrane region were shown to be part of the substrate- or coupling ion-binding site in a range of larger transporters that are more complex than EmrE (reviewed in Refs.17Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Google Scholar and 18Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett... 2000; 476: 93-97Google Scholar)). In many ion-coupled transporters this carboxyl is found in the first transmembrane segment. This is the case for MdfA, anotherE. coli multidrug transporter (22Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 822-832Google Scholar), the Tet transporter Tet(B) (23Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Ono N. Someya Y. Nakatani M. Sawai T. J. Biol.

In the vesicular and plasma membrane monoamine transporters, an Asp in transmembrane segment 1 is important for substrate recognition (25Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 25798-25804Google Scholar, 26Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci... 1999; 19: 4705-4717Google Scholar, 27Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D. Uhl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 7782-7785Google Scholar). EmrE and other transporters in the SMR family are the smallest ion-coupled transporters known (5Paulsen I. Skurray R. Tam R. Saier M. Turner R. Weiner J. Goldberg E. Grinius L. Mol. Microbiol... 1996; 19: 1167-1175Google Scholar, 6Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev... 1996; 60: 575-608Google Scholar). This means that a simple structure of 110 amino acids, organized as an oligomer, is capable of transporting a wide variety of substrates. In this work, we show that even a simpler structure, which includes only one carboxylic residue, is active. E. coli cells expressing the single carboxyl mutant, E25C/D84C, show significant resistance to EmrE substrates (16Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). The purified protein reconstituted in proteoliposomes catalyzes ΔpH-driven transport of [14C]methyl viologen with properties similar to those of the wild type protein. In addition, the affinity of binding as well as the number of binding sites is comparable with that of the wild type protein. Both wild type and mutant show similar pH dependence of TPP+ binding. We have previously shown that this pH dependence reflects the fact that binding and release of the substrate occur only upon the corresponding release and binding of protons (15Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar). It is quite surprising that in such a small protein, with only eight charged residues, removal of two negative charges has relatively little effect on activity, implying that the overall structure must be maintained. In addition, the negative charges in the loop seem to play a minor role in “guiding” the positively charged substrates, because the affinity of TPP+ is not dramatically altered in the single carboxyl mutant. The results imply also very little, if any, effect of these two residues on insertion into the membrane and on protein stability. The single carboxyl mutant has four net positive charges. We therefore speculate that to prevent electrostatic repulsion with the cationic substrates most of the positive charges in the protein may be neutralized by ion pairing to species such as phospholipids for example. The simplicity and size of EmrE allow for a detailed dissection of the role of Glu-14. The construction of an active transporter that has a single carboxyl residue at position 14 provides even stronger support for the previous conclusions. This mutant also gives us the opportunity to try to find the most basic structure that shows transport activity. We thank Y. Mordoch for performing the binding experiments. n-dodecyl-β-maltoside tetraphenylphosphonium 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide EmrE fused to Myc/His epitope nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid"
https://openalex.org/W2153279664,"Retinoic acids exert profound effects on many biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis. We previously reported that all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) protected mesangial cells from H2O2-triggered apoptosis by suppressing the activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway. It was via inhibition of c-fos and c-jun expression and suppression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. In this report, we investigated the involvement of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) in the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA in H2O2-exposed cells. We found that pretreatment with RAR pan-antagonist (AGN193109) or RXR pan-antagonist (HX531) attenuated the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA. Similarly, transient transfection with a dominant-negative mutant of RAR or a dominant-negative RXR diminished the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA. Both RAR and RXR antagonists reversed the suppressive effect of t-RA on AP-1 activity. However, the roles of RAR and RXR in the suppression of AP-1 components by t-RA were found to be different. RAR antagonist reversed the suppressive effect of t-RA on both c-fos and c-jun, whereas RXR antagonist reversed the effect of t-RA on c-fos but not c-jun. Furthermore, suppression of JNK activation by t-RA was observed even in the presence of RAR and RXR antagonists. Consistently, suppression of JNK by t-RA was not affected by overexpression of either the dominant-negative RAR or the dominant-negative RXR. These data elucidated that the antiapoptotic effect of t-RA is mediated by both nuclear receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1548529343,"Human hepatitis B virus is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatitis B virus x protein (HBx) has been shown to inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor protein and impair DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis mechanisms. Herein we report that HBx represses two components of the transcription-repair factor TFIIH, XPB (p89), and XPD (p80), both in p53-proficient and p53-deficient liver cells. This inhibition is observed while HBx maintains its transactivation function. Expression of HBx in liver cells results in down-regulation of endogenous XPB and XPD mRNAs and proteins; this inhibition is not observed with other TFIIH subunits, XPA or PCNA. In liver tissue from HBx transgenics, XPB and XPD proteins are down-regulated in comparison to matched normal liver tissue. HBx has been shown to interact with Sp1 transcription factor and affects its DNA binding activity. Sp1 is essential for the basal promoter activity of XPB in liver cells and Drosophila SL2 cells. In the Sp1-deficient SL2 cells, HBx-induced XPB and XPD inhibition is Sp1-dependent. In summary, our results provide evidence that HBx represses the expression of key TFIIH proteins at least in part through Sp1 elements; this repression may impair TFIIH function in DNA repair mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1994296232,"Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been suggested to be the main point of control of gene expression in kinetoplastid parasites. We have previously shown thatTrypanosoma cruzi SMUG mucin mRNA steady-state level is developmentally regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms, being stable in the epimastigote insect vector stage, but unstable in the trypomastigote infective stage of the parasite. Its turnover is controlled by an AU-rich element (ARE) localized in the 3′-untranslated region, since a reporter gene lacking this sequence was stable in the trypomastigote stage (Di Noia, J. M., D'Orso, I., Sanchez, D. O., and Frasch, A. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 10218–10227). Here, we show by gel mobility shift assay that the 44-nt ARE sequence interacts with a set of stage-specific AU-rich element RNA-binding proteins (ARE-BPs). The epimastigote stage AU-rich element RNA-binding protein, named E-ARE-BP, and the trypomastigote stage ARE-BPs, named T-ARE-BPs, are efficiently competed by poly(U). UV cross-linking analysis showed that E-ARE-BP has an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa and is different from the 45–50-kDa ARE-BPs present in other stages of the parasite. Transfection experiments allowed the identification of a novelcis-element that might be responsible for a positive effect on mRNA stability. It is a G-rich element, named GRE, composed by two contiguous CGGGG pentamers. The factors that recognize GRE were different from the ones that bind to ARE, in both molecular masses and subcellular localization. Thus, ARE and GRE are functionally differentcis-elements, which might regulate mucin expression throughout the parasite life cycle.

Wirtz L.E. Navarro M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transcriptional start sites have been extremely difficult to detect; only two putative promoter regions were described as transcriptionally void regions upstream from the actin and Hsp70 genes (5Ben Amar M.F. Jefferies D. Pays A. Bakalara N. Kendall G. Pays E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5857-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The maturation of polycistronic RNA precursors to render individual mRNA molecules is achieved by cleavage in the intergenic region by a coupled processing of 5′ endtrans-splicing and 3′ end polyadenylation (7Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both processes seem to depend on the recognition of polypyrimidine tracts present in the intergenic regions (8Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which acts as a bifunctional element affecting RNA processing both upstream and downstream from itself (7Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).In vivo treatment of parasites with protein synthesis inhibitors induces an accumulation (9Wilson M.E. Paetz K.E. Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a decrease in the mRNA levels of some transcripts (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and this effect is not due to an increase or a reduction in transcriptional levels, respectively. Therefore, these results point to the presence of labile factors, affected by protein synthesis inhibitors, that might be negative or positive regulators of mRNA maturation. However, the mechanisms of interference in pre-mRNA processing, unbalanced nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, or unusual mRNA stability control processes remain to be identified. It is known that both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs)1 are responsible for stabilization/destabilization mechanisms, up- or down-regulating mRNA levels in a developmentally regulated manner (10Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In transient and stable parasite transfection experiments, the 3′-UTRs of some mRNAs were found to influence the expression of a reporter gene in a stage-specific manner (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S.

The way in which the 3′-UTR differentially influence the mRNA steady-state levels is still unknown. Furthermore, few cis-elements responsible for these post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been defined (12Furger A. Schurch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Hotz H.R. Hartmann C. Huober K. Hug M. Clayton C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12051-12060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Several cis-elements and trans-acting factors controlling mRNA stability have been characterized in higher eukaryotes (15Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 16Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar). A well known example is the case of AU-rich elements or AREs, cis-sequences localized in the 3′-UTR of short-lived mRNAs, such as proto-oncogenes and cytokines (17Chen C.A. Shyu A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). These elements are recognized by different positive or negative RNA-binding proteins, like HuR and AUF-1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, respectively (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 19Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), causing rapid changes in mRNA stability. Another example is the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with human α-globin mRNA (21Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cytidine-rich (C-rich) segment within the 3′-UTR of α-globin is critical for mRNA stability through the interaction with differenttrans-acting factors that mediate this effect (22Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that neither αCP1 nor αCP2 complex-forming proteins can bind the C-rich element unless they are complexed with the remaining non-poly(C)-binding proteins, such us AUF1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (23Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a protein implicated in ARE-mediated mRNA decay is also an integral component of the mRNA stabilizing α-complex.Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite agent of Chagas disease, is covered by a dense mucin coat (24Pereira-Chioccola V.L. Acosta-Serrano A. Correia de Almeida I. Ferguson M.A. Souto-Padron T. Rodrigues M.M. Travassos L.R. Schenkman S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1299-1307PubMed Google Scholar), at least in two of its developmental stages. Mucins are highly O-glycosylated proteins having relevant roles in cell protection and in cell-cell interactions, especially in immune cell migration in vertebrate cells (25Van Klinken B.J.W. Dekker J. Buller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-G627PubMed Google Scholar). Mucins from T. cruzi were classified into two different protein families that differ between parasite stages. The form of the parasite present in the insect vector, epimastigote, expresses a small mucin family named TcSMUG (35–50 kDa) whose core proteins are encoded in about 70 different genes (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), while the forms of the parasite present in the mammalian host, bloodstream trypomastigotes, have larger mucins encoded by 500 different genes (26Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Developmentally regulated expression of these mucins in the different parasite stages is relevant because they might accomplish different functions related with parasite survival (27Frasch A.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that a 44-nt ARE sequence within the 3′-UTR of SMUG mucin family was a destabilizing cis-element acting in a stage specific manner (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results suggest that different trans-acting factors might bind mucin transcriptsin vivo, and selectively regulate its mRNA stability throughout parasite development. We have now identified a novel G-rich element, named GRE, which might be responsible for a stage-specific stabilization of SMUG mRNA family in the epimastigote form of the parasite. Transfection experiments show that GRE and ARE sequences have opposite functions in terms of mRNA stabilization in the different stages of the parasite and are specifically recognized bytrans-acting factors, some of them being developmentally regulated during the trypanosome life cycle.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have obtained evidence for the existence of novelcis-elements localized in the 3′-UTR of SMUG mucins fromT. cruzi that control both mRNA stability and translation efficiency. In addition to the AU-rich element involved in the selective mRNA destabilization of mucin transcripts in the metacyclic trypomastigote stage of the parasite (Ref. 1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and this work), new negative and positive cis-elements have now been identified. First, a small GRE, composed of the first 27-nt downstream stop codon and containing two contiguous CGGGG pentamers, functions as a positive element only in the epimastigote stage of the parasite. Second, deletion of another element in the construction SMUG-LΔ1, named here E1 and localized between nucleotides 28 and 62 of the 3′-UTR, increases the half-life of a cat reporter mRNA (Fig. 1), suggesting that this sequence acts as a negative element. Finally, deletion of the 450-base pair retrotransposon SIRE also produces the same effect as the element E1, but, given the large size of SIRE sequence, further work is required to confirm this effect. It was shown previously that SIRE is responsible for the down-regulation of gene expression of the TCP2β ribosomal protein by altering itstrans-splicing efficiency (45Vazquez M.P. Levin M.J. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1998; 93: 161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different functions might be assigned to sequences within this retrotransposon. Indeed, it was reported that U-rich regions and also the length of the 3′-UTR positively regulate mRNA polyadenylation and the translation efficiency of a reporter gene (11Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although GRE sequence is sufficient to up-regulate SMUG mRNA abundance, E1 has a dual effect on mRNA stability and translation, regulating both processes in a negative manner. It is not unprecedented for a single element to have two functions, since AU-rich sequences within the 3′-UTR of TNF-α affect both mRNA abundance and translation efficiency (46Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 47Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 48Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two functionally different cis-elements, ARE and GRE, were identified. The ARE was involved in mRNA destabilization in the infective stage of the parasite, but not in the replicative epimastigote stage, because mRNAs from SMUG-L and SMUG-LΔAU constructs have similar half-lives in the latter stage (Fig. 3). These results further support the idea that the RNA-binding protein(s) that recognize the ARE in the epimastigote stage of the parasite, might provide resistance to endo- or exonucleolytic cleavage rather than providing actively mRNA protection. Conversely, GRE sequences have a different effect on mRNA stability throughout parasite development. It up-regulates SMUG mRNA abundance in the epimastigote stage, since deletion of the GRE motif makes the mRNA more labile (Fig. 3, B and C). The presence of the ARE sequence within the 3′-UTR of mucin SMUG mRNA also have been shown to modulate translation efficiency in a positive manner (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, GRE had no considerable effect on translational levels, suggesting that both elements might coordinately cooperate in thein vivo regulation of SMUG mRNA abundance in the epimastigote stage of the parasite, but not in translation. Coordinated interaction between different negative and positivecis-elements was observed in the 3′-UTR of procyclic mRNAs of African trypanosomes, affecting both mRNA abundance and translation efficiency (12Furger A. Schurch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Cellular factors interacting with RNA motifs that regulate mRNA stability have not been identified yet in trypanosomes. Evidence showing that GRE and ARE RNA sequences interact with different cellulartrans-acting factors has now been obtained (Figs. 4 and 6, and summarized in the model of Fig. 9). Three GRE-forming ribonucleoprotein complexes were detected. Two of them, named G-complex 1 and G-complex 2, were specifically and efficiently competed by poly(G) homoribopolymer (Fig. 4 C). G-complex 1 is formed by a single protein band whose apparent molecular mass is 80 kDa, and G-complex 2 is composed of several factors whose molecular masses were about 35, 39, and 66 kDa. This suggests that the 80-kDa protein of G-complex 1 directly recognized GRE sequence. In the case of G-complex 2, the three proteins might also be involved in protein-protein interactions. The presence of large complexes might regulate mRNA expression in a coordinated way, depending on the proteins that compose it or the protein-protein interactions that are produced during the different stages of the parasite. Since the presence of the ARE within SMUG-L 3′-UTR led to a rapid mRNA decay, it is possible that a coordinated interaction between GRE-binding proteins with ARE-BPs and/or other protein factors not identified yet might determine the final mucin SMUG mRNA stability (Fig. 9).A model for the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism acting on mucin SMUG mRNA and mediated by ARE and GRE RNA-binding proteins is shown in Fig. 9. E-ARE-BP, only expressed in the epimastigote stage, might be a positive trans-acting factor interacting with the ARE and protecting SMUG mRNA from degradation. E-ARE-BP binding could also prevent the association of the destabilizing factor(s) to those mRNAs, possibly through competition for binding to similarcis-elements. Indeed, E-ARE-BP might be one of the proteins involved in the modulation of the translation activity mediated by the ARE motif (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), probably through the interaction with other cellular factors of the translational apparatus. On the other hand, GRE RNA-binding proteins are always present during the life cycle ofT. cruzi (Fig. 9). The possibility that an ARE-GRE-complex exists in vivo, and that this whole complex or some complex-forming proteins interact with a poly(A)binding protein or other cellular factor(s) to prevent the attack of a deadenylase activity, remains to be investigated. It is well known that, in mammalian cells, a large complex is formed by several proteins having different affinities for poly(C) homoribopolymer, such as the assembly of the α-globin mRNA stability complex in the pyrimidine-rich region of the globin 3′-UTR (22Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).The results obtained by subcellular fractionation suggest that E-ARE-BP is localized in the cytoplasm or only recognized the RNA in this cellular compartment, where mRNA decay or translational processes take place. Future experiments on Western blot analysis would permit us to determine if E-ARE-BP is also present in the nucleus and, thus, is recruited by some complex-forming proteins. Conversely, the ARE-BPs, at least in the trypomastigote stage, are present in similar amounts in both nucleus and cytoplasm and might be shuttling RNA-binding proteins (Fig. 8). G-complexes forming proteins, at least G-complex 2, might be formed by RNA-binding factors that showed a shuttling behavior between nucleus and cytoplasm. Consequently, it is possible that those GRE RNA-binding proteins might protect the messenger during transport between both compartments. Several proteins in higher eukaryotes were shown to present a shuttling behavior between nucleus and cytoplasm (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 20Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 49Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In trypanosomes a classical nuclear localization signal was identified and shown to be functional in the La and histone H2B proteins (50Marchetti M.A. Tschudi C. Kwon H. Wolin S.L. Ullu E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A regulated nuclear-cytoplasm export pathway mediated by CRM1 also might be present in kinetoplastid parasites, since leptomycin B affects the axenic growth of the epimastigote form of the parasite. 2I. D'Orso and A. C. C. Frasch, unpublished data. Leptomycin B inhibits the formation of the complex formed by nuclear export signal-containing proteins, RanGTP, and the receptor CRM1 (51Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar).Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as the ones mediated by ARE or GRE sequences, may be required for a quick response to change mucin core molecules expression pattern, triggering parasite adaptation to sudden changes on the environment. In this regard, expression of the correct surface mucin coat may be of central importance for parasite survival. Identification of an in vivo role for these ARE and GRE RNA-binding proteins in the mRNA stability of T. cruzi transcripts may allow proposal of a model of RNA metabolism and maturation in parasites that are deficient in the regulation by RNA polymerase II transcription. Kinetoplastid parasites control gene expression at the level of mRNA maturation by post-transcriptional mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 2Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and 3Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). α-Amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase II from trypanosomes transcribes large polycistronic units containing a number of coding sequences (4Cross G.A. Wirtz L.E. Navarro M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transcriptional start sites have been extremely difficult to detect; only two putative promoter regions were described as transcriptionally void regions upstream from the actin and Hsp70 genes (5Ben Amar M.F. Jefferies D. Pays A. Bakalara N. Kendall G. Pays E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5857-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The maturation of polycistronic RNA precursors to render individual mRNA molecules is achieved by cleavage in the intergenic region by a coupled processing of 5′ endtrans-splicing and 3′ end polyadenylation (7Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both processes seem to depend on the recognition of polypyrimidine tracts present in the intergenic regions (8Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which acts as a bifunctional element affecting RNA processing both upstream and downstream from itself (7Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In vivo treatment of parasites with protein synthesis inhibitors induces an accumulation (9Wilson M.E. Paetz K.E. Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a decrease in the mRNA levels of some transcripts (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and this effect is not due to an increase or a reduction in transcriptional levels, respectively. Therefore, these results point to the presence of labile factors, affected by protein synthesis inhibitors, that might be negative or positive regulators of mRNA maturation. However, the mechanisms of interference in pre-mRNA processing, unbalanced nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, or unusual mRNA stability control processes remain to be identified. It is known that both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs)1 are responsible for stabilization/destabilization mechanisms, up- or down-regulating mRNA levels in a developmentally regulated manner (10Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In transient and stable parasite transfection experiments, the 3′-UTRs of some mRNAs were found to influence the expression of a reporter gene in a stage-specific manner (1Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S.

The way in which the 3′-UTR differentially influence the mRNA steady-state levels is still unknown. Furthermore, few cis-elements responsible for these post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been defined (12Furger A. Schurch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Hotz H.R. Hartmann C. Huober K. Hug M. Clayton C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12051-12060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several cis-elements and trans-acting factors controlling mRNA stability have been characterized in higher eukaryotes (15Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 16Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar). A well known example is the case of AU-rich elements or AREs, cis-sequences localized in the 3′-UTR of short-lived mRNAs, such as proto-oncogenes and cytokines (17Chen C.A. Shyu A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). These elements are recognized by different positive or negative RNA-binding proteins, like HuR and AUF-1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, respectively (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 19Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), causing rapid changes in mRNA stability. Another example is the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with human α-globin mRNA (21Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cytidine-rich (C-rich) segment within the 3′-UTR of α-globin is critical for mRNA stability through the interaction with differenttrans-acting factors that mediate this effect (22Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that neither αCP1 nor αCP2 complex-forming proteins can bind the C-rich element unless they are complexed with the remaining non-poly(C)-binding proteins, such us AUF1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (23Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a protein implicated in ARE-mediated mRNA decay is also an integral component of the mRNA stabilizing α-complex. Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite agent of Chagas disease, is covered by a dense mucin coat (24Pereira-Chioccola V.L. Acosta-Serrano A. Correia de Almeida I. Ferguson M.A. Souto-Padron T. Rodrigues M.M. Travassos L.R. Schenkman S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1299-1307PubMed Google Scholar), at least in two of its developmental stages. Mucins are highly O-glycosylated proteins having relevant roles in cell protection and in cell-cell interactions, especially in immune cell migration in vertebrate cells (25Van Klinken B.J.W. Dekker J. Buller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-G627PubMed Google Scholar). Mucins from T. cruzi were class"

We previously showed that the second matrix loop containing a basic cluster of amino acids is important for peroxisomal targeting, and similar basic targeting motifs have been found in other peroxisomal membrane proteins. However, this basic cluster by itself targets to peroxisomes very poorly. We have developed a sensitive quantitative localization assay based on the targeting of Pmp47-GFP fusion proteins to identify the important elements of the basic cluster and to search for other targeting information on Pmp47. Our data suggest that side-chain structure and position as well as charge are important for targeting by the basic cluster. Analysis of other regions of Pmp47 indicates that all TMDs except TMD2 can be eliminated or substituted without significant loss of targeting. TMD2 plus an adjacent cytoplasmic-oriented sequence is crucial for targeting. Cytoplasmic-oriented sequences from two other peroxisomal membrane proteins, ScPex15p andScPmp22, could partially substitute for the analogous sequence in Pmp47. Targeting with high fidelity to oleate-induced peroxisomes required the following elements: the cytoplasmic-oriented sequence and TMD2, a short matrix loop containing a basic cluster, and a membrane-anchoring TMD.

Proteins are targeted to the peroxisomal matrix from the cytosol by virtue of peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs)1 (1Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Most matrix proteins contain a PTS1 sequence at their extreme carboxyl terminus consisting of three amino acids identical or related to the tripeptide SKL. A few matrix proteins contain a PTS2 sequence close to the amino terminus, which is often cleaved upon entering the peroxisomal assembly pathway. Receptors for PTS1 and PTS2 have been identified, as have docking proteins for the PTS receptors on the peroxisomal surface (2Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,3Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Receptor and cargo may translocate through the membrane before receptors are recycled to the cytosol (4van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Zhang J.W. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins lack these PTS sequences and must be targeted by alternative sequences. We have used Pmp47 from the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii as a model protein to understand targeting to the peroxisome membrane. Pmp47 shares homology with members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family (6Jank B. Habermann B. Schweyen R.J. Link T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 427-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These proteins span the membrane six times, and sequence similarity within them suggests that the family was derived from an ancient gene triplication. Pmp47 is important in the metabolism of medium-chain fatty acids and may transport ATP (7Nakagawa T. Imanaka T. Morita M. Ishiguro K. Yurimoto H. Yamashita A. Kato N. Sakai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3455-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and it is also critical for the import of dihydroxyacetone synthase, an abundant matrix protein (8Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pmp47 contains two loops of amino acids on the matrix side and three on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. We previously identified a targeting motif contained within the second matrix loop that we termed the mPTS (9Dyer J. McNew J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We showed that the most important attribute of the targeting loop is a basic cluster of amino acids of the sequence KIKKR. Matrix-oriented basic clusters have since been shown to be an important targeting element in several other peroxisomal membrane proteins (10Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M.

The Pmp47 second matrix loop fused to a carrier protein targets to peroxisomes very weakly (9Dyer J. McNew J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), as determined by organelle fractionation. Similarly, a basic cluster from the cotton seed ascorbate peroxidase (APX), fused to a synthetic membrane span and carrier protein, targets to punctate and reticular structures, although peroxisomal localization was not demonstrated (13Mullen R.T. Trelease R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16337-16344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, a cytosol-oriented region of 22 amino acids in rat Pmp22 can target a different fragment of the protein, which by itself is not sufficient for targeting, to the peroxisomal membrane (14Pause B. Saffrich R. Hunziker A. Ansorge W. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because some peroxisomal membrane proteins integrate into peroxisomal precursor organelles before arriving at peroxisomes (15Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2789-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a more complex targeting signal may be required to accommodate such a pathway. We now describe experiments to indicate that Pmp47 requires discrete regions for effective targeting. To gain evidence for the relative contribution of each region we have established a sensitive and quantitative in vivo fluorescence localization assay inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Results from the assay suggest that charge is not the sole factor governing targeting by the basic cluster; side-chain structure and residue position may also be important. We show that targeting at low efficiency occurs even when the basic cluster is eliminated, indicating other targeting elements must exist within Pmp47. We have identified the other important signal as consisting of a cytosol-oriented charged domain within cytoplasmic loop 1 and the adjacent transmembrane domain, TMD2. TMD2 by itself is poorly hydrophobic. Efficient targeting with high fidelity is only achieved by combining these discrete motifs (including the matrix basic cluster) with a strong transmembrane anchoring domain. Thus, effective targeting of Pmp47 requires discrete regions of the protein on both sides, and within, the membrane. Escherichia coli strain TG-1 (F′ traD36 laclq Δ [lacZ]M15 proA+B+/supE Δ [hsdM-mcrB]5 [rk−mk−McrB−]thi Δ(lac-proAB)) was used for plasmid amplification. Yeast S. cerevisiae strain MMYO11α was used in all the expression experiments (16McCammon M.T. Dowds C.A. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMYO11α was transformed by the lithium acetate method (17Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were maintained on synthetic complete plates (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI)) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases. For glucose liquid culture, MMYO11α was grown in synthetic dextrose medium (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases. To induce peroxisome proliferation in MMYO11α, cells were cultured in SGd medium (3% glycerol, 0.1% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases) to an A600 of 1 to 2. They were then “boosted” by adding 0.1 volume of 10% yeast extract, 20% peptone and cultured for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, re-inoculated to a final A600 of 1 into oleate medium (a semisynthetic medium (18van Dijken J.P. Otto R. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1976; 111: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) oleic acid, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 40 and appropriate amino acids and bases), and cultured for 16–20 h. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Isolation of DNA fragments and plasmids was carried out using the QIAEXII gel extraction kit and QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed with a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller from MJ Research, Inc. (Watertown, MA) using Pfu DNA polymerase. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were performed (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibodies used in this study include anti-3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (anti-thiolase) polyclonal antibodies (kind gift of Jonathan Rothblatt), and Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Plasmid constructs used in this study include pEMBLy3012, containing the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter and terminator (kind gift of Michael White, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), pRS315 and pRS316 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and vectors pGFP-C1 and pDsRed (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The 1.8-kb PGK promoter-terminator was excised from pEMBLy3012 by HindIII and subcloned into the unique HindIII site of yeast centromeric plasmid pRS315. The resulting construct was named pRS315-PGK. A DNA fragment containing amino acids 1–267 of Pmp47 was isolated from Candida boidinii genomic DNA by PCR using upper primer W5U (5′-GAA GAT CTA TGT CTA CAA GAG AGT ACG AC-3′), which introduced a BglII site at the amino terminus (restriction sites introduced in this oligonucleotide and those described subsequently are underlined), and lower primer W5L (5′-AGG TAA AGA TTG AAC GCT ATC-3′). A unique endogenousXbaI site is present at amino acid 267. The GFP coding region was amplified from pGFP-C1 by PCR using upper primer W4U (5′-GCT CTA GAA TGG GTA AAG GAG AAG AAC TT-3′), which introduced an in-frame XbaI site to its amino terminus, and lower primer W4L (5′-GAA GAT CTT TAC TTG TAT AGT TCA TCC ATG CC-3′), which introduced a stop codon followed by aBglII site to its carboxyl terminus. The Pmp47-(1–267) fragment and the GFP coding region were both digested withBglII and XbaI, and were then cloned into the unique BglII site between the PGK promoter and terminator of the pRS315-PGK to yield pPmp47-(1–267)-GFP. To facilitate the construction of mutant constructs from pPmp47-(1–267)-GFP, the BglII site between GFP and PGK terminator was disrupted by PCR mutagenesis to produce the construct D004. D004 has a unique BglII site preceding the start codon of the fusion protein and a uniqueNcoI site within the GFP coding region (at amino acid 55 of GFP). The DNA fragment encoding Pmp47-(1–267)-GFP (1–55) was used as a cassette for constructing the mutant Pmp47-GFP fusion proteins. The mutated forms of this cassette were cloned back into D004, replacing the original sequence. To construct the amino-terminal truncation mutants, the coding regions for the amino-terminally truncated Pmp47-(x-267)-GFP (1–55) fragments were isolated from D004 by PCR using specific upper primers with a BglII site and start codon included at the 5′-end and a common lower primer W20L (5′-ACA CCA TAA GAG AAA GTA GTG A-3′) that is located 3′ of the endogenous NcoI site. The carboxyl-terminal truncations, replacements, and internal deletions were constructed using PCR SOEing (Splicing by Overlap Extension) (21Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Wondisford F.E. Taylor S.I. Gene. 1989; 76: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,22Vallette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Upper primers starting at specific amino-terminal regions of Pmp47 with an upstream BglII site and a start codon were used as outer upper primers, and W20L was used as the common outer lower primer. A pair of inner SOEing primers, each of which contains the mutated sequences in its 5′-overlapping region, was used for each replacement construct. Briefly, the outer upper primer and the lower inner primer were used to isolate the amino-terminal flanking region of the replacement. The inner upper primer and the outer lower primer W20L were used to generate the carboxyl-terminal flanking region. Then the two fragments, which contained the mutated sequences in their overlapping region, were denatured, annealed to each other, and finally fused together by overlap extension. The carboxyl-terminal truncations and internal deletions were generated in a similar fashion, where the overlapping regions served solely as fusion junctions without introducing any replacement amino acids. Block I and III deletion constructs were made from pPmp47-(1–243)-GGG-GFP (see Table I). The TMD4 substitution constructs were made from pPmp47-(1–267)-GFP, the TMD3 substitution construct was made from pPmp47-(70–267)-GFP, and the TMD2 exchange constructs were made from pPmp47-(53–267)-GFP (see Table III).Table IDissecting the second matrix-oriented loopGFP fusion proteinLocalization scorePeroxisomal localization1-aNA, not analyzed; complete, every GFP fluorescent spot colocalizes with peroxisomal marker; partial, some GFP fluorescent spots do not colocalize with peroxisomal marker.C-terminal deletions1–267100 ± 4Complete1–243 (ΔTMD5)90 ± 6Complete1–232 (ΔTMD5 and blocks II and III)No fluorescenceBlock replacementBlock I → GGGGAGGG90 ± 5NABlock II → AAAAA18 ± 2PartialBlock III → GAAGGG108 ± 4NABlock deletions1–243-GGG17 ± 4CompleteΔblock I in 1–243-GGG25 ± 6CompleteΔblock III in 1–243-GGG56 ± 4CompleteIsoleucine positionsKIKKR-(1–267)100 ± 4CompleteIKKKR95 ± 6NAKKIKR102 ± 1NARKKIK96 ± 2NABasicity titrationsKIKKR-(1–267)100 ± 4CompleteKIKKQ87 ± 4CompleteKIKQQ70 ± 7CompleteKIQQQ22 ± 2CompleteQIQQQ33 ± 6CompleteAAKKR60 ± 4CompleteAAAKR68 ± 10CompleteAAKKA26 ± 3Complete/partial1-bMost cells displayed complete colocalization.AAAKA8 ± 3CompleteAAAAR27 ± 3CompleteAAAAA (block II → AAAAA)18 ± 2Partial1-a NA, not analyzed; complete, every GFP fluorescent spot colocalizes with peroxisomal marker; partial, some GFP fluorescent spots do not colocalize with peroxisomal marker.1-b Most cells displayed complete colocalization.

Open table in a new tab The Pmp47-derived sequences of all fusion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. First, the PGK promoter-terminator from pEMBLy3012 was subcloned into the unique HindIII site of the yeast centromeric plasmid pRS316 to yield pRS316-PGK. The coding region of the red fluorescence protein DsRed was amplified from the plasmid pDsRed by two rounds of PCR. The upper primer W71U (5′-AAT GAA GAT CTA TGA GGT CTT CCA AGA ATG TTA-3′), which incorporated an upstream BglII site, and the lower primer W71L-1 (5′-TTT AGC ACC TCC TCC AAG GAA CAG ATG GTG GCG TC-3′) were used for the first round, and W71U and W71L-2 (5′-AAT GAA GAT CT T TAC AAT TTA GCA CCT CCT CCA AGG-3′) were used for the second round. The two lower primers incorporated three glycines, the peroxisomal targeting signal type I (PTS1), alanine-lysine-leucine, and the stop codon (all shown in boldface). AnotherBglII site was also added downstream of the stop codon. The amplified fragment was then cloned into the unique BglII site of the pRS316-PGK to yield pDsRed-AKL, which encodes a red fluorescence protein that targets well to peroxisomes. Immunofluorescence of S. cerevisiae was performed as described previously (23Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 586-597Google Scholar). Fluorescence in both living and fixed cells was visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and an MRC 600 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The GFP was excited at 488 nm, and the DsRed and the Texas Red fluorophore were excited at 568 nm. The images shown in the figures are single representative Z-sections through cells that were fixed, converted to spheroplasts, and permeabilized (23Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 586-597Google Scholar) to eliminate vacuolar autofluorescence. Quantification of Peroxisomal Localization—Yeast transformants were cultured in SGd (synthetic medium containing 3% glycerol and 0.1% dextrose) and induced with oleic acid as described above. Living cells were harvested, spread in a monolayer on microscope slides, and observed by confocal microscopy. Five randomly chosen fields of at least 40 cells per field were examined for each culture. For each field a 19-section Z-series, 0.3 μm between optical slices, was recorded. The Z-series recordings were animated by IMAGE (version 1.60, National Institutes of Health). The percentage of the cells showing punctate fluorescence was determined and normalized against the positive and negative controls (Pmp47-(1–267)-GFP and untransformed MMY011α, respectively) in each experiment. The raw percentages of cells showing punctate fluorescence in the controls were typically 70% and 3%, respectively. The normalized value was termed the localization score, such that scores of 100 and 0 correspond to the positive and negative controls. A mean and standard error were determined from the localization scores of the five Z-series for each fusion protein. For the cluster modifications KIKQQ, KIQQQ, QIQQQ, AAKKA, AAAKA, and AAAAA, the data represent the average and standard error of ten Z-series from two independent experiments. Fig.1 A illustrates the Pmp47-GFP fusion protein used as the basis of deletion and mutation analysis in this study. The Pmp47 section consists of the first 267 of a total of 423 amino acids of the full-length protein. This region comprises the amino-terminal matrix fragment, the first two cytosolic and two matrix-oriented loops, and the first five of the six transmembrane domains (TMDs). The sequence of matrix loop 2, containing the KIKKR basic cluster previously shown to be important for targeting, is also shown. Amino acids 1–267 have been shown previously to be sufficient for efficient targeting to peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae (9Dyer J. McNew J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,24McCammon M.T. McNew J.A. Willy P.J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Correct targeting of Pmp47-(1–267)-GFP to peroxisomes was evident either with 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, a PTS2 protein used in previous studies (24McCammon M.T. McNew J.A. Willy P.J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or DsRed-AKL, a PTS1-tagged red fluorescence protein (Fig. 1 B), as observed by confocal microscopy of cells grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomal proliferation. Peroxisomes of most cells were clustered by Pmp47-(1–267)-GFP, as apparent in the figure. The clustering was dependent on an intact Pmp47 amino terminus (data not shown) and is of unknown physiological relevance. In preliminary experiments with several Pmp47-GFP fusion proteins we observed negligible mistargeting to organelles other than peroxisomes in living cells. If any fluorescence was seen, it was punctate and peroxisomal (i.e. colocalized with peroxisomal markers), suggesting that mistargeted Pmp47 fusion proteins were unstable in general; the few exceptions will be noted below. We also observed a correlation between the intensity of the fluorescence pattern and the percentage of cells displaying punctate fluorescence. Fusion proteins with relatively intense punctate fluorescence displayed this pattern in about 70% of cells. Weakly fluorescent punctate patterns were seen in 10–20% of cells (the remainder displayed no visible GFP fluorescence). We therefore developed a “localization score” as an indicator of peroxisomal targeting and retention of Pmp47-GFP fusion proteins. The localization score is based on the percentage of the cells displaying a peroxisome-like punctate pattern normalized to positive and negative controls (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We separately verified the identity of the green fluorescent organelles of key constructs by assaying colocalization with a peroxisomal marker. The localization score discriminates between fusion proteins that are efficiently sorted to and retained in peroxisomes and those that are deficient in stability or targeting. An initial set of GFP fusion proteins were expressed to confirm the importance of the basic cluster contained within matrix loop 2 and to understand the important elements of the cluster (Table I). Both the localization scores and results of colocalization assays with thiolase or DsRed-AKL are shown. Removal of TMD5 had little effect on localization, indicating that it contained no essential targeting information. Further removal of blocks II (the basic cluster) and III of the second matrix loop completely obliterated localization, suggesting that this region contains important targeting information. This conclusion was supported first by replacement of each block of the loop with glycines or alanines. Only replacement of block II resulted in a low localization score. The colocalization assay revealed that, although correct targeting to peroxisomes occurred in some of the few cells that showed punctate fluorescence in the block II substitution, many of the green fluorescent organelles were not peroxisomes (Fig.2), yielding partial colocalization. Finally, the importance of spacing of block II to the membrane was assessed with block deletions. Removal of block I resulted in localization score of 25. This may be an underestimation of the ability of the basic cluster to function close to a membrane span, because the matched control, Pmp47-(1–243-GGG)-GFP, had a localization score of only 17. The low score may reflect destabilization of the fusion protein by the triglycine spacer. Regardless, the basic cluster is functional to some extent when placed directly behind TMD4 or close to GFP (score of 56). Despite the low localization scores, these fusion proteins completely colocalize with peroxisomal markers (Table I). We then designed GFP fusion proteins to understand the critical characteristics of the KIKKR cluster. First we altered the placement of the isoleucine residue within the cluster (in the context of Pmp47-(1–267)-GFP) and found no significant decrease in localization efficiency (Table I). We then performed two titrations of basicity. In the first we substituted glutamines for basic residues beginning on the carboxyl side of the cluster. It can be seen that removal of two of the four basic residues (KIKQQ) still resulted in a localization score of 70 (Table I). However, the score dropped precipitously with one (KIQQQ) or no basic charge (QIQQQ) in the cluster, similar to the behavior of Pex3p (10Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We were surprised that the QIQQQ-containing fusion protein still localized with a score of 33. The QIQQQ substitution completely colocalized with DsRed-AKL (Fig. 2). Similar data were obtained with the second basic titration in which alanines replaced basic residues from the amino terminus of the cluster. AAAKR targeted with a score of 68, whereas the score dropped to 27 for AAAAR. Within the substituted clusters containing one or two basic charges, significant differences were seen: AAAKR localized much better than AAKKA (scores of 68 and 26, respectively), and AAAAR localized better than AAAKA (27 and 8). These data suggest that not all basic residues within the cluster are equivalent. Furthermore, the difference in targeting between the two neutral substitutions QIQQQ and AAAAA both in localization score (scores of 33 and 18, respectively) and colocalization with DsRed-AKL (complete versus partial colocalization) suggests that side-chain structure is important in basic cluster targeting. More definitive conclusions must await anin vitro targeting assay where stability can be controlled and correct folding more easily measured. We suspected that important targeting information was contained in the first half of Pmp47, because targeting was difficult to demonstrate without it (24McCammon M.T. McNew J.A. Willy P.J. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To localize the putative targeting information a series of amino-terminal deletions of Pmp47-(1–267)-GFP were constructed (TableII). TMD1 was dispensable as well as most of the first cytosolic loop, because Pmp47-(70–267)-GFP targeted well. Excellent colocalization of a fusion protein beginning at amino acid 75, 20 residues from TMD2, can be seen in Fig.3. A fusion protein that lacked the first 78 amino acids did not display any peroxisomal fluorescence. However, peroxisomal localization reappeared in a fusion protein that lacked the first 86 amino acids, although the localization score dropped to 30 and mistargeting to other organelles was observed (Fig. 3), suggesting that the distal region of the first cytoplasmic loop may be important for peroxisomal localization. Targeting to peroxisomes in oleate-grown cells was never observed in fusion proteins with amino termini beyond TMD2. Unlike most of the Pmp47-GFP proteins discussed earlier, a few of these fusion proteins stably mislocalized to nonperoxisomal structures of the oleate-grown cells, either punctate or reticular (Table II). Our results suggest that targeting information is contained within TMD2 or amino acids directly adjacent to it.Table IITargeting of amino-terminal truncation mutants to oleate-induced peroxisomesAmino terminus of Pmp47-(x-267)-GFPLocalization score or fluorescence intensityLocalization1100 ± 6PeroxisomesLoop 139120 ± 5Peroxisomes53114 ± 5Peroxisomes70106 ± 4Peroxisomes7574 ± 4Peroxisomes79None8730 ± 3Peroxisomes + non-peroxisomal punctate structuresLoop 2114None125StrongNon-peroxisomal punctate structures141MediumNon-peroxisomal punctate structures148NoneLoop 3168None176None187None190None196StrongReticular structures199StrongReticular structures203NoneLoop 4226None Open table in a new tab To further test whether TMD2 or the other remaining membran"
https://openalex.org/W1512286480,"Smad proteins are major components in the intracellular signaling pathway of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and phosphorylation is an important mechanism in regulation of their functions. Smad7 was identified as a potent inhibitor of TGF-β-dependent signaling. We have identified serine 249 in Smad7 as a major phosphorylation site, the phosphorylation of which was not affected by TGF-β1. Abrogation of the phosphorylation by substitution of Ser-249 with alanine or aspartic acid residues did not affect the ability of Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β1 and BMP7 signaling. No differences were found in the stability or in the intracellular distribution of Smad7 mutants compared with the wild-type molecule. However, Smad7 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 induced transcription from a reporter with mutated TATA minimal promoter in a Ser-249-dependent manner. Moreover, a reporter with the SV40 minimal promoter was inhibited by GAL4-Smad7, and this effect was also dependent on Ser-249 phosphorylation. The amplitude of effects on transcriptional regulation was dependent on cell type. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Smad7, unlike phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads, does not regulate TGF-β signaling but rather affects TGF-β-independent effects of Smad7 on transcriptional regulation.

Discovery of Smad proteins provided insights into the intracellular signaling by TGF-β1 family members. Three groups of Smads have been described. Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are direct targets of activated receptors and provide the signaling specificity. Common mediator (Co-Smad) Smad4 forms complexes with R-Smads and is involved in signal propagation. Finally, Smad7 and Smad6 were identified as inhibitors (I-Smads) of signaling by members of the TGF-β family (1Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar, 3Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been suggested to inhibit TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of R-Smads by type I receptors (1Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv.

Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Smad7 was found to occur abundantly in the nuclei of certain cells and to be exported from the nucleus upon TGF-β stimulation or a change in cell substrate (5Itoh S. Landstrom M.

This suggests that Smad7 may also have a function in the nucleus, which may be independent of the inhibition of ligand-induced signaling at the receptor level.Since expression of Smad7 is up-regulated after TGF-β stimulation, it has been suggested that Smad7 is involved in negative feedback of TGF-β signaling. Induction of Smad7 has also been described as the pivotal mechanism whereby tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon γ inhibit TGF-β signaling (7Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been found to be up-regulated in human tumors, but no mutation in human cancers has yet been described (9Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Maruyama H. Friess H. Truong P. Buchler M.W. Falb D. Korc M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation has been found to be a potent regulatory mechanism of Smad functions (10Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S.

Sequential phosphorylation of R-Smads at two C-terminal serine residues by activated receptors is the triggering event in ligand-dependent intracellular signaling (13Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K.

Phosphorylation in the linker region, presumably by mitogen-activated protein kinase, may affect nuclear translocation of R-Smads (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of R-Smads by other kinases has also been shown to influence intracellular signaling (14Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T.

Phosphorylation of mammalian Smad4 has not been reported, but Xenopus Smad4β has been identified as a phosphoprotein (16Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among inhibitory Smads, Smad6 is a phosphoprotein (17Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of Smad7 has not been characterized.We show here that Smad7 is phosphorylated, and we identify Ser-249 as a major phosphorylation site. Mutation of Ser-249 did not affect the inhibitory effect of Smad7 on TGF-β or BMP7 signaling and did not interfere with nuclear localization of Smad7. However, the TGF-β-independent transcriptional activity of Smad7 was affected by mutation of Ser-249, suggesting that phosphorylation of Smad7 at Ser-249 is important for its ligand-independent ability to regulate transcription.DISCUSSIONHere we report the identification of Ser-249 as a major phosphorylation site in Smad7. Unlike the case for R-Smads, the phosphorylation of Smad7 was found not to be dependent on TGF-β treatment of cells. We show that phosphorylation at Ser-249 does not affect the stability or subcellular localization of Smad7, nor does it affect the ability of Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, however, the presence of the phosphorylatable Ser-249 in Smad7 was found to be important for a novel function ascribed to Smad7,i.e. its ability to regulate transcription.Ser-249 is one of the two major phosphorylation sites in Smad7 (Fig.2); the second major site is currently under investigation. Ser-249 is located in the C-terminal part of the region corresponding to the linker in other Smads. Interestingly, a Smad activation domain (SAD) has been identified in the corresponding part of Smad4; SAD interacts with MSG-1, a transcriptional coactivator of Smad4, and has an important role for the transcriptional activity of Smad4 (22de Caestecker M.P.

A. 1998; 95: 9785-9790Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have not observed any homology between SAD and the corresponding region of Smad7; however, given the importance of SAD in Smad4 transcriptional regulation, it is interesting that phosphorylation in the corresponding region of Smad7 affects its transcriptional activity.The nuclear localization (Fig. 5) is consistent with the possibility that Smad7 is involved in regulation of gene expression. R-Smads and Smad4 are known as potent transcriptional regulators, and they are translocated to the nucleus upon ligand addition. Their function is dependent on interactions with coactivators and corepressors and on the ability of Smads to bind DNA directly (1Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv.

Recently, Baiet al. (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported that inhibitory Smad6 also can act as a transcriptional regulator through interaction with the homeobox (Hox)c-8 protein, extending the suggestion of transcriptional regulator function to inhibitory Smads. In line with previous observations (26Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we could detect only a weak effect of GAL4-FLAG-Smad7 on the activity of GAL4-binding sequence-containing reporters in Mv1Lu cells of epithelial origin (data not shown). However, in cells of mesenchymal origin, GAL4-FLAG-Smad7 significantly induced the GAL4-TGTA-luc reporter. Interestingly, a GAL4-binding sequence-containing reporter with an SV40 or TK minimal promoter was inhibited by the wild-type GAL4-FLAG-Smad7 fusion. Similar opposite effects on gene expression were also described for Smad3; Smad3 was found to potently induce CAGA(12)-luc (18Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar) but inhibited stimulation of the goosecoid reporter (27Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In similarity to Smad3, the stimulatory or inhibitory effects of Smad7 on the regulation of transcription may depend on the interaction between Smad7 and other proteins. Our data suggest that such interactions may be regulated by Smad7 phosphorylation, as the phosphorylation-deficient S249A mutant of Smad7 shows impaired effects when compared with the wild-type protein (Fig.6). The S249D mutant of Smad7, partially mimicking the presence of a phosphoryl group by introducing a negative charge, behaved similar to wild-type Smad7.Our findings suggest that Smad7 is not only involved in control of signaling pathways of TGF-β family members, but may also have direct effects in the nucleus, possibly regulated by other regulatory pathway(s). To explore this possibility, it will be important to identify the kinase phosphorylating Smad7, components interacting with Smad7 in the nucleus, as well as target genes for Smad7 as a transcription factor. These studies are in progress. Discovery of Smad proteins provided insights into the intracellular signaling by TGF-β1 family members. Three groups of Smads have been described. Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are direct targets of activated receptors and provide the signaling specificity. Common mediator (Co-Smad) Smad4 forms complexes with R-Smads and is involved in signal propagation. Finally, Smad7 and Smad6 were identified as inhibitors (I-Smads) of signaling by members of the TGF-β family (1Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar, 3Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been suggested to inhibit TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of R-Smads by type I receptors (1Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv.

Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Smad7 was found to occur abundantly in the nuclei of certain cells and to be exported from the nucleus upon TGF-β stimulation or a change in cell substrate (5Itoh S. Landstrom M.

This suggests that Smad7 may also have a function in the nucleus, which may be independent of the inhibition of ligand-induced signaling at the receptor level. Since expression of Smad7 is up-regulated after TGF-β stimulation, it has been suggested that Smad7 is involved in negative feedback of TGF-β signaling. Induction of Smad7 has also been described as the pivotal mechanism whereby tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon γ inhibit TGF-β signaling (7Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been found to be up-regulated in human tumors, but no mutation in human cancers has yet been described (9Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Maruyama H. Friess H. Truong P. Buchler M.W. Falb D. Korc M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has been found to be a potent regulatory mechanism of Smad functions (10Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S.

Sequential phosphorylation of R-Smads at two C-terminal serine residues by activated receptors is the triggering event in ligand-dependent intracellular signaling (13Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K.

Phosphorylation in the linker region, presumably by mitogen-activated protein kinase, may affect nuclear translocation of R-Smads (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of R-Smads by other kinases has also been shown to influence intracellular signaling (14Brown J.D.

Phosphorylation of mammalian Smad4 has not been reported, but Xenopus Smad4β has been identified as a phosphoprotein (16Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among inhibitory Smads, Smad6 is a phosphoprotein (17Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of Smad7 has not been characterized. We show here that Smad7 is phosphorylated, and we identify Ser-249 as a major phosphorylation site. Mutation of Ser-249 did not affect the inhibitory effect of Smad7 on TGF-β or BMP7 signaling and did not interfere with nuclear localization of Smad7. However, the TGF-β-independent transcriptional activity of Smad7 was affected by mutation of Ser-249, suggesting that phosphorylation of Smad7 at Ser-249 is important for its ligand-independent ability to regulate transcription. DISCUSSIONHere we report the identification of Ser-249 as a major phosphorylation site in Smad7. Unlike the case for R-Smads, the phosphorylation of Smad7 was found not to be dependent on TGF-β treatment of cells. We show that phosphorylation at Ser-249 does not affect the stability or subcellular localization of Smad7, nor does it affect the ability of Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, however, the presence of the phosphorylatable Ser-249 in Smad7 was found to be important for a novel function ascribed to Smad7,i.e. its ability to regulate transcription.Ser-249 is one of the two major phosphorylation sites in Smad7 (Fig.2); the second major site is currently under investigation. Ser-249 is located in the C-terminal part of the region corresponding to the linker in other Smads. Interestingly, a Smad activation domain (SAD) has been identified in the corresponding part of Smad4; SAD interacts with MSG-1, a transcriptional coactivator of Smad4, and has an important role for the transcriptional activity of Smad4 (22de Caestecker M.P.

We have not observed any homology between SAD and the corresponding region of Smad7; however, given the importance of SAD in Smad4 transcriptional regulation, it is interesting that phosphorylation in the corresponding region of Smad7 affects its transcriptional activity.The nuclear localization (Fig. 5) is consistent with the possibility that Smad7 is involved in regulation of gene expression. R-Smads and Smad4 are known as potent transcriptional regulators, and they are translocated to the nucleus upon ligand addition. Their function is dependent on interactions with coactivators and corepressors and on the ability of Smads to bind DNA directly (1Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv.

In line with previous observations (26Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in cells of mesenchymal origin, GAL4-FLAG-Smad7 significantly induced the GAL4-TGTA-luc reporter. Interestingly, a GAL4-binding sequence-containing reporter with an SV40 or TK minimal promoter was inhibited by the wild-type GAL4-FLAG-Smad7 fusion. Similar opposite effects on gene expression were also described for Smad3; Smad3 was found to potently induce CAGA(12)-luc (18Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

In similarity to Smad3, the stimulatory or inhibitory effects of Smad7 on the regulation of transcription may depend on the interaction between Smad7 and other proteins. Our data suggest that such interactions may be regulated by Smad7 phosphorylation, as the phosphorylation-deficient S249A mutant of Smad7 shows impaired effects when compared with the wild-type protein (Fig.6).

Other tryptophan residues were mutated to phenylalanine. The Trp-501 residue showed a large enhancement in fluorescence in the presence of ATP and a small quench in the presence of ADP as a result of perturbing both the ground and excited state processes. Fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield measurements indicated that at least three microstates of Trp-501 were present in all nucleotide states examined, and these could not be assigned to a particular gross conformation of the motor domain. Enhancement in emission intensity was associated with a reduction of the contribution from a statically quenched component and an increase in a component with a 5-ns lifetime, with little change in the contribution from a 1-ns lifetime component. Anisotropy measurements indicated that the Trp-501 side chain was relatively immobile in all nucleotide states, and the fluorescence was effectively depolarized by rotation of the whole motor domain with a correlation time on 50–70 ns. Overall these data suggest that the backbone of the relay loop remains structured throughout the myosin ATPase cycle but that the Trp-501 side chain experiences a different weighting in local environments provided by surrounding residues as the adjacent converter domain rolls around the relay loop.

These studies were preceded by and have been supplemented with chemical approaches to isolate the spectroscopy-sensitive residues (13Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14949-14954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Park S. Ajtai K. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3368-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Park S.

There is now unanimous agreement that the conserved tryptophan residue located on the relay loop of the lower 50 kDa domain (skeletal myosin Trp-510, smooth myosin Trp-512, andDictyostelium Trp-501) is uniquely associated with the fluorescence enhancement observed during ATP hydrolysis. The hydrolysis step itself appears coupled to the open → closed transition, identified crystallographically (16Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). It appears that the open → closed transition is actually responsible for the structural changes in the vicinity of the spectroscopy-sensitive tryptophan residue, but the hydrolysis reaction serves to pull the equilibrium toward the predominant steady-state intermediate in the Dictyostelium discoideum motor domain, M*·ADP·Pi or the equivalent M**·ADP·Pi intermediate in vertebrate skeletal myosins (12Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The origin of the smaller fluorescence enhancement seen on nucleotide binding to skeletal and smooth myosin is less clear and is species-specific. In smooth muscle myosin the enhancement induced by ADP binding appears to emanate from Trp-512 (10Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the equivalent residue in D. discoideum, Trp-501, responds with a fluorescence quench (12Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The fluorescence enhancement associated with ADP binding to skeletal myosin may have its origins in the nonconserved Trp-131 residue (15Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this work we address further properties of the relay loop tryptophan of D. discoideum myosin motor domain, Trp-501. The kinetic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by all myosins II appears similar. Although the absolute values of the rate constants of equivalent steps may differ among species, their ratios are such that a similar distribution of nucleotide states is obtained during the steady state. In the case of the D. discoideum motor domain the mechanism may be summarized as in Reaction 1M+ATP↔(M·ATP)→M†·ATP↔(M*·ATP)↔M*·ADP·Pi↔(M†·ADP·Pi)↔M†·ADP+Pi↔(M·ADP)↔M+ADPREACTION1where † represents a quenched state, and * is an enhanced state of Trp-501 (12Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). States in parentheses are present at near negligible concentrations under most conditions, but their existence is implied by kinetic arguments. Under the usual conditions of assay, the M*·ADP·Pi state predominates during the steady-state hydrolysis of ATP (which is equivalent to the M**·ADP·Pi state of vertebrate myosins in which other tryptophan residues may contribute to the overall fluorescence enhancement (17Bagshaw C.R.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). By adding the Pi analog AlF4− to the D. discoideum M†·ADP complex, a stable M*·ADP·AlF4complex can be made which has an enhanced fluorescent state and provides a useful analog of the M*·ADP·Pi state for spectroscopic studies (12Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Care is required, however, in relating a particular analog state to particular ATPase intermediate because in many cases these complexes exist as a mixture of conformations. Fluorescence quenching studies with acrylamide and iodide indicate that on binding nucleotide, Trp-501 (or equivalent) becomes slightly less accessible to solvent and is protected further after hydrolysis to give the long lived M*·ADP·Pi species (10Yengo C.M.

The crystal structures are generally in accord with the spectroscopic results in that, when resolved, Trp-501 (or equivalent) points toward the converter domain, but it is not internalized completely and has limited exposure to solvent (5Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of theDictyostelium crystal structures, the main chain bearing Trp-501 is usually unresolved in nucleotide states corresponding to the open state (M·ADP, M·ATPγS),1 but an exception is the dinitrophenyl aminoethyl diphosphate BeFx complex (pdb 1D1A (19Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Pate E. Yount R.G. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 398-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). One possible explanation of the origin of the fluorescence enhancement associated with the open → closed transition is that the relay loop goes from a disordered to ordered state and internalizes the Trp-501 side chain during the ATPase cycle, so protecting it from solvent (H2O) quenching. We have therefore carried out time-resolved fluorescence measurements on a mutant containing a single tryptophan residue at Trp-501 to test this idea. Overall we find that the Trp-501 residue is static on the nanosecond time scale in all states (nucleotide and nucleotide-free) of theDictyostelium motor domain. The anisotropy value is similar for all complexes and decays slowly with a time consistent with rotational motion of the whole motor domain (50–100 ns). However, the fluorescence intensity lifetime profiles and quantum yields suggest that in any one nucleotide state, the Trp-501 residue senses at least two or three different local environments on a time scale >5 ns to <20 μs. The fluorescence enhancement arises from a shift in the relative populations of these states that comprise both static and dynamically quenched components. Although accessibility to solvent water may contribute to quenching, interactions with nearby charged and polar groups are likely to be dominant factors. These results are compatible with the proposal that the relay loop remains structured throughout the ATPase cycle and maintains its contact with the converter domain (20Shih W.M. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19491-19494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but that the environment of the tryptophan residue is affected by local rearrangements of the side chain and surrounding residues. The cloning and preparation of a D. discoideum myosin II M761 motor domain containing a single tryptophan residue at position 501 was carried out as described previously (10Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and is based on the expression vector developed by Manstein et al. (21Manstein D.J. Schuster H.-P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this construct, denoted W501+, the nonresponsive tryptophan residues at positions 36, 432, and 584 were mutagenized to phenylalanine. A tryptophan-less construct, termed W−, was also made as a control in which all tryptophan residues were changed to phenylalanine. Nucleotides, NATA and human serum albumin (which contains a single buried tryptophan) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, U. K.) Steady-state fluorescence spectra and anisotropy were measured with an SLM 48000 spectro-fluorometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) using a 5 mm path length cell (101.034-QS, Hellma, Westcliff-on-Sea, U. K.). For spectral measurements, tryptophan was excited with a Hg-Xe lamp at 297 nm with 1-nm slits to minimize photobleaching and to reduce inner filter effects arising from high nucleotide concentrations. Quantum yields were determined using the comparative method taking the value for tryptophan of 0.13 (22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norvell, MA1999Crossref Google Scholar). Emission spectra were corrected using the calibration protocol supplied by SLM Instruments. Absorption spectra were measured using a Pye Unicam SP8–100 spectrophotometer. Steady-state anisotropies were measured using the T format method with Glan-Thomson calcite prism polarizers. Tryptophan was excited at 295 nm with 2-nm slits, and the vertical (parallel) emission was detected through a monochromator set at 335 nm with 16-nm slits. The horizontal (perpendicular) emission was detected through WG320 and UG11 filters (Comar Instruments, Cambridge, U. K.). The anisotropy values (A) were calculated from the intensity values of the vertical and horizontal measurements with correction for the detectorG value (A = (I v−G·I h)/(I v+2·G·I h). The G factor was calculated from the ratio of intensities (I v/I h) when the excitation light was horizontally polarized. The gain on the photomultipliers was adjusted so that the G factor was close to 1. However, we noted that the SLM automated polarization routine (48000 DOS version 2.1) gave erroneous values for the anisotropy because the background signal was not subtracted from intensities used to define the G value. Although this error may be negligible for strongly fluorescing samples, it was a significant factor in our measurements. For this reason we computed the anisotropy values independently from the measured intensity values. We also checked the anisotropy using the L format, so avoiding the use of the emission monochromator that makes a significant contribution to theG factor correction. Transient fluorescence and absorption measurements were made usingApplied Photophysics SX18MV stopped-flow apparatus with a xenon light source at 295 nm (2–4-nm slit width). Fluorescence emission was selected with WG320 and UG11 filters. All reactions were studied in a buffer comprising 40 mm NaCl, 20 mm TES, 1 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.5 at 20 °C and the reagent concentrations stated refer to the reaction chamber. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out using the time-correlated single-photon counting method at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Central Laser Facility. Samples (5–25 μm) were excited at 296 nm, achieved with a frequency-doubled, cavity-dumped, mode-locked synchronously pumped dye laser (Spectra-Physics model 3500) operating at 4 MHz with a pulse width of 10 ps. The fluorescence emission was collected via a WG335/UG11 filter combination (WG320 was used for tyrosine emission) using a MCP-PMT photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R3809U) with response time of 85 ps. The WG335 filter was used in preference to the WG320 filter in these studies to minimize the potential scattering artifact and tyrosine contribution to the signal. Time-resolved anisotropy was measured through a film polarizer (Halbo Optics, DPUV-25) in the emission channel, and the vertical and horizontally polarized light was collected sequentially. The total emission intensity for lifetime measurements was calculated by summingI v + 2·I h. A wedge depolarizer was placed in front of the photomultiplier tube, and theG factor of the detector was confirmed as unity by excitation with horizontally polarized light. The data were collected in 1024 channels (width 40 ps) using the Becker and Hickl GmbH (Berlin) single time-correlated single photon counting pc card module (SPC-700). The standard functions of the single photon counting setup, such as time-to-amplitude converter and constant fraction discriminator, were computer-controlled with software supplied with the SPC-700 module. The addition of ATP to the D. discoideum W501+ motor domain causes a large (30–90%) enhancement in tryptophan emission intensity (12Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The percentage enhancement observed is critically dependent on the wavelength and band width of the excitation source and emission detector. Samples were excited at 295–297 nm to minimize the contribution from tyrosine fluorescence and inner filter effects on the addition of high adenine nucleotide concentrations. To obtain sufficient signal with xenon light sources, 2–4-nm slit widths were required, and particular care was required in analysis because of the extreme sensitivity to these extraneous contributions when operating at the edge of the excitation spectrum. The properties of the emission detector are also crucial because the enhancement in fluorescence is accompanied by about a 9-nm blue shift. For time-resolved measurements cut-off filters were used in the emission channel to maximize photon throughput, but this approach underestimates the percentage change in fluorescence compared with that determined from the integrated intensity of the complete corrected emission spectrum. On the other hand, spectral purity is more important for determining quantum yields, so these measurements were made on instruments with monochromators. From the integrated emission intensities ATP gave an 85% enhancement in fluorescence, whereas ADP gave an 18% quench, in line with previous measurements on the W501+ construct (12Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Early spectrophotometric studies on skeletal muscle myosin showed that there was a significant change in the absorption spectra induced by nucleotides (1Morita F. Yagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 22: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We reinvestigated this aspect with D. discoideum W501+ and found that at 297 nm there was a 13% increase in the absorption coefficient on ATP addition, but there was no detectable change with ADP at this wavelength. Thus, although there is a significant effect of ATP on the ground state properties of Trp-501, the fluorescence emission process is much more sensitive to the presence of nucleotide. This result is clearly demonstrated in a stopped-flow experiment using the same optics for the absorption and excitation process (Fig.1). At wavelengths less than 290 nm the absorption change on ATP addition was inverted in sign. However, under these conditions the signal has a contribution from tyrosine residues, which outnumber the tryptophan residues by 29:1. Quantum yields were calculated from the spectrally resolved emission data using free tryptophan as a standard (TableI). The addition of AlF4− to the W501+ construct in the presence of ADP generated a species whose fluorescence properties were very similar to the steady-state complex generated by the addition of ATP. The latter were measured over a period from 20 to 100 s when the fluorescence levels were almost constant. After the ATP was turned over (>200 s, depending on the [ATP]:[W501+] ratio), the fluorescence and absorption signals were similar to those generated by ADP addition alone. Addition of 50 μm sodium vanadate to the W501+ construct in the presence of ADP also caused a fluorescence enhancement, but the signal was reduced by 8% relative to that with the addition of AlF4− because of inner filter effects. We did not explore the vanadate complex further because the statically quenched component is difficult to evaluate in the presence of a high background absorbance.Table ITrp-501 spectroscopic propertiesStateRelative fluorescence emission 1-aFrom integration of the corrected fluorescence emission spectra with excitation at 297 nm with a xenon-mercury lamp.

Open table in a new tab Previous studies of the tryptophan fluorescence lifetime of myosin were carried out using a native protein fragment that contained 5 tryptophan residues and revealed 3 classes of tryptophans with lifetimes of 0.72, 4.5, and 8.8 ns (23Torgerson P.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3002-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, for most proteins it has been shown that a single tryptophan residue displays more than a single lifetime component and that site-directed mutagenesis is required for an unambiguous assignment of individual residues. In the case of the D. discoideum W501+ myosin motor domain we found that the lifetime decay was well fitted by two components with τ values of the order of 1 and 5 ns. Interestingly on addition of nucleotides, these lifetimes did not change significantly; rather, the fractional amplitudes changed (Fig. 2 and Table I). This agrees with the earlier studies (23Torgerson P.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3002-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) which showed that the major effect of ATP was to increase the fractional contribution of the 4.5-ns component. The change in mean lifetime is in the direction expected for the observed emission intensity i.e. ATP and ADP·AlF4 cause a relative increase in the 5-ns component and an increase in the overall emission intensity, whereas ADP causes smaller changes in the opposite direction. Thus the nucleotide-induced changes in emission intensity contain a dynamically quenched component. However, quantitative comparison shows that the change in lifetime is only a partial explanation of the change in emission intensity. From the area under the normalized decay curves (Table I), ATP induces a 1.18 increase in mean lifetime relative to the nucleotide-free state, whereas ADP induces a reduction by 0.92. On the other hand, the measured emission intensity from the total counts (i.e. area under the un-normalized decay curves) was increased by 1.38 by ATP and reduced by 0.8 in the presence of ADP. The relative total photon counts are less than the maximum changes from the integrated fluorescence emission spectra (Table I) because light was collected from the red end of the spectrum (WG335 nm cut-off filter; see above). However, these values provide further evidence that the nucleotide-induced changes in Trp-501 fluorescence emission have both static and dynamic components. Thus, in a significant proportion (≥ 60%; see below) of the population Trp-501 forms a ground state complex with a quenching center that changes the absorption characteristics and causes the excited state to return to the ground state by a nonradiative mechanism. To estimate the contribution of the statically quenched component in the various nucleotide states, the quantum yields were compared with that of free tryptophan (0.13). If it assumed that free tryptophan in aqueous solution is quenched exclusively by a dynamic mechanism, then the intrinsic (natural) lifetime of tryptophan is about 16 ns. On this basis the fractional contributions of the static, 1-, and 5-ns components can be evaluated for each nucleotide state of the Trp-501 motor domain (Table II). This analysis reveals that the enhancement in Trp-501 fluorescence on addition of ATP is caused through a decrease in the statically quenched component and an increase in the 5-ns lifetime component with little change in the 1-ns lifetime component. The subsequent net quench observed after turnover to ADP arises from an opposite shift in the fractions of statically quenched and 5-ns components, again with little change in the 1-ns component.Table IIProportion of static and dynamically quenched species based on lifetime data and quantum yields relative to free tryptophanNucleotide stateStatic component1-ns component5-ns componentApo0.710.120.17ATP0.600.100.30ADP0.760.110.13ADP · AlF40.600.100.30The ratio of 1- and 5-ns components is defined by the observed intensity decay curves.

These enzymes appear to be ubiquitous, having been identified in viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic systems. Helicases hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates, usually ATP, to obtain the energy needed to unwind dsDNA. They translocate on DNA often in a very processive manner, unwinding thousands of base pairs in a single binding event. Their processive nature implies that helicases have multiple DNA binding sites; indeed, a characteristic feature of many helicases is their propensity to form oligomeric structures, often dimers or hexamers.Knowledge of the oligomeric form of a helicase is of fundamental concern in development of a mechanism for unwinding activity, and many approaches have been applied to determine oligomeric structure. The lack of evidence for oligomerization from biophysical experiments has led to the suggestion that some helicases function as monomers. PcrA helicase of Bacillus stearothermophilus is proposed to function as a monomer that contains two binding sites for DNA (6Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B.

The focus of this study is the bacteriophage T4 helicase, Dda, a 5′-to-3′ helicase classified in superfamily 1. Evidence suggests that Dda is involved in T4 replication initiation (12Gauss P. Park K. Spencer T.E. Hacker K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T4 Dda− mutants show a delayed DNA synthesis phenotype, consistent with this hypothesis. Dda also enhances the rate of branch migration owing to a specific interaction with the T4 recombinase (UvsX) and is therefore likely to play a role in recombination (13Kodadek T. Alberts B.M.

Unwinding of only a few hundred base pairs can be prevented by addition of ssDNA, even when Dda is incubated with the substrate prior to addition of the competitor DNA (19Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T.

The oligomeric nature of Dda was investigated in order to determine whether its relatively low processivity might be related to the oligomeric structure, and to lay the foundation for future mechanistic studies.DISCUSSIONThe search for a functional oligomeric structure of Dda has proven elusive. Experimental approaches such as chemical cross-linking and gel filtration did not strongly support nor eliminate formation of oligomeric species (Figs. 1 and 2). Biochemical assays in which the ATPase activity of Dda was measured at varying enzyme concentration did not provide any evidence for oligomerization (Fig. 3). Hence, methods that have provided support for oligomerization of other helicases gave negative results with Dda. Transient, protein-protein interactions that might be required for unwinding activity were not eliminated by these experiments.To further investigate this, an ATPase-deficient mutant enzyme was prepared that was unable to unwind DNA. If oligomerization were required for function, then the mutant enzyme would be expected to lower the activity of the wild type due to formation of hetero-oligomers. The effects of an ATPase-deficient mutant Dda protein (K38A Dda) on the activities of WT Dda were examined. The presence of K38A Dda protein, which is inactive as a helicase, but is still capable of binding DNA (Fig. 4), fails to decrease the ATPase activity of WT Dda (Fig. 5). The rate of unwinding under single cycle conditions was not reduced by the addition of the mutant enzyme, indicating that hetero-oligomers do not likely participate in the unwinding reaction. The amplitude for unwinding by WT Dda helicase was reduced upon addition of K38A Dda (Fig. 6). The data fall between that expected for a monomeric or dimeric helicase when analyzed as though a simple competition for substrate binding existed between wild type Dda and mutant or hetero-oligomeric Dda (Fig. 7 B). It is possible that more than one Dda monomer can bind to the substrate without invoking protein-protein interactions, which may lead to a greater than expected reduction in amplitude under conditions of excess enzyme and in the presence of the inactive K38A Dda.The effect of mixing K38A Dda and WT Dda was further investigated by conducting unwinding experiments in the presence of excess substrate. Under these conditions, the competition for DNA binding between the two proteins is effectively eliminated, because the protein will be distributed among the substrate molecules. If Dda is acting as a monomer, the addition of mutant protein should have no effect on WT Dda unwinding activity under these conditions because the mutant protein will bind to DNA, but will not prevent WT Dda binding and subsequent unwinding activity. However, if protein-protein interactions are required for unwinding, then such interactions should occur, despite the presence of excess DNA substrate. The results indicate that the presence of mutant Dda does not reduce the rate of unwinding (Fig.8 C), suggesting that Dda may not require oligomerization in order to function. Even when WT Dda alone or in the presence of K38A Dda is incubated with ATP prior to initiating the reaction with substrate, there is no reduction in the unwinding rate (Fig.8 C). Thus, Dda appears to be capable of functioning as a monomer. This may explain the fact that Dda is known to act in a distributive manner, cycling on and off of DNA during unwinding of long substrates (19Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps this distributive mode of action is the result of a monomeric structure that does not allow Dda to encircle ssDNA in a manner similar to that of many hexameric helicases (4Egelman E. Curr. Biol. 1996; 4: 759-762Google Scholar, 18Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Egelman E.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).In order to unwind a region of dsDNA, and translocate to a new site along the nucleic acid, helicases need two DNA binding sites so that the enzyme does not dissociate during unwinding. Therefore, Dda is expected to contain more than one site that is capable of binding to DNA. An inchworm mechanism has been suggested for unwinding and translocation by monomeric helicases. Evidence for multiple DNA binding sites on a monomeric helicase has been provided in the case of the PcrA helicase. The crystal structure of PcrA in the presence of a partial duplex DNA substrate indicates a binding site for ssDNA and an adjacent binding site for dsDNA (7Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Dda is classified as a super family 1 helicase, like PcrA, based on sequence comparison (11Gorbalenya A. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), although Dda is a 5′-to-3′ helicase (17Raney K.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas PcrA translocates 3′-to-5′ (30Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Another possible arrangement for “two” binding sites has been proposed for the NS3h helicase. The co-crystal structure of this enzyme in the presence of ssDNA indicates that 7 nucleotides are complexed within a groove between two adjacent domains and a third domain (31Kim J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Griffith J.P. Dwyer D.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The two domains on one side of the groove were proposed to interact with the ssDNA such that one domain could move relative to the other as a function of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Hence, the ssDNA bound in one domain could be released during translocation while interactions in the second domain are maintained to hold onto the DNA. Whether one of the models suggested for PcrA or NS3h applies to Dda remains to be determined.Helicases in superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 have been difficult to characterize in terms of oligomeric structure, and much discussion has surrounded this issue. This is due to the fact that many biophysical approaches for studying oligomerization provide negative results when applied to these enzymes. Evidence has been presented that suggests that PcrA (7Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), UvrD (8Mechanic L.E. Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12488-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and NS3h (32Preugschat F. Danger D.P. Carter III, L.H. Davis R.G. Porter D.J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5174-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) can function as monomers. Another helicase, PriA, was shown to exist as a monomer in solution, even when bound to ssDNA, although the functional form of the enzyme has not been determined (33Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Others have provided evidence that suggests that oligomeric forms of UvrD (34Ali J.A. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 815-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and NS3h (27Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) are required for optimal unwinding activity.Previously, the ability of Dda to displace streptavidin from the 3′ end of biotin-labeled oligonucleotides was found to exhibit a dependence on the length of the oligonucleotide. The streptavidin displacement reaction was found to proceed faster from longer oligonucleotides than from shorter ones (18Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results described here suggest that a monomeric form of Dda can function to unwind DNA. However, individual Dda monomers may align along the nucleic acid lattice to enhance overall activity in the streptavidin displacement assays, despite the lack of strong protein-protein interactions. When dsDNA1 is replicated, repaired, or recombined, the necessary ssDNA intermediates are provided by the activity of helicases (1Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 3West S.C.

Bioessays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These enzymes appear to be ubiquitous, having been identified in viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic systems. Helicases hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates, usually ATP, to obtain the energy needed to unwind dsDNA. They translocate on DNA often in a very processive manner, unwinding thousands of base pairs in a single binding event. Their processive nature implies that helicases have multiple DNA binding sites; indeed, a characteristic feature of many helicases is their propensity to form oligomeric structures, often dimers or hexamers. Knowledge of the oligomeric form of a helicase is of fundamental concern in development of a mechanism for unwinding activity, and many approaches have been applied to determine oligomeric structure. The lack of evidence for oligomerization from biophysical experiments has led to the suggestion that some helicases function as monomers. PcrA helicase of Bacillus stearothermophilus is proposed to function as a monomer that contains two binding sites for DNA (6Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Evidence has been provided that suggests Escherichia coli UvrD helicase (helicase II) can be active as a monomerin vivo and in vitro (8Mechanic L.E. Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12488-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The E. coliRep helicase has been proposed to function as a dimer (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), whereas other helicases such as T7 gene 4 helicase and T4 gp41 helicase appear to function as hexamers (9Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Helicases have been classified according to sequence homology (11Gorbalenya A. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), and those enzymes in superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 have proven difficult to characterize in terms of oligomerization. The focus of this study is the bacteriophage T4 helicase, Dda, a 5′-to-3′ helicase classified in superfamily 1. Evidence suggests that Dda is involved in T4 replication initiation (12Gauss P. Park K. Spencer T.E. Hacker K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T4 Dda− mutants show a delayed DNA synthesis phenotype, consistent with this hypothesis. Dda also enhances the rate of branch migration owing to a specific interaction with the T4 recombinase (UvsX) and is therefore likely to play a role in recombination (13Kodadek T. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Dda binds tightly to the T4 single-stranded DNA-binding protein, gp32, although the significance of this interaction has not been determined (15Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Jongeneel C.V. Bedinger P. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dda translocates on ssDNA with a strong directional bias in the 5′-to-3′ direction (17Raney K.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is capable of removing protein blocks placed in the path of the enzyme, including streptavidin bound to biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (18Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Dda is not highly processive (19Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Raney K.D. Sowers L.D. Millar D.P. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Unwinding of only a few hundred base pairs can be prevented by addition of ssDNA, even when Dda is incubated with the substrate prior to addition of the competitor DNA (19Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the replicative helicase from bacteriophage T4, gp41, can unwind thousands of base pairs in a single binding event (21Dong F. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14456-14461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like T7 gene 4 helicase, gp41 is a hexameric helicase that encircles ssDNA, resulting in very high processivity (18Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Egelman E.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The oligomeric nature of Dda was investigated in order to determine whether its relatively low processivity might be related to the oligomeric structure, and to lay the foundation for future mechanistic studies. DISCUSSIONThe search for a functional oligomeric structure of Dda has proven elusive. Experimental approaches such as chemical cross-linking and gel filtration did not strongly support nor eliminate formation of oligomeric species (Figs. 1 and 2). Biochemical assays in which the ATPase activity of Dda was measured at varying enzyme concentration did not provide any evidence for oligomerization (Fig. 3). Hence, methods that have provided support for oligomerization of other helicases gave negative results with Dda.

If oligomerization were required for function, then the mutant enzyme would be expected to lower the activity of the wild type due to formation of hetero-oligomers. The effects of an ATPase-deficient mutant Dda protein (K38A Dda) on the activities of WT Dda were examined. The presence of K38A Dda protein, which is inactive as a helicase, but is still capable of binding DNA (Fig. 4), fails to decrease the ATPase activity of WT Dda (Fig. 5). The rate of unwinding under single cycle conditions was not reduced by the addition of the mutant enzyme, indicating that hetero-oligomers do not likely participate in the unwinding reaction. The amplitude for unwinding by WT Dda helicase was reduced upon addition of K38A Dda (Fig. 6).

Chem. 1995; 270: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas PcrA translocates 3′-to-5′ (30Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Another possible arrangement for “two” binding sites has been proposed for the NS3h helicase. The co-crystal structure of this enzyme in the presence of ssDNA indicates that 7 nucleotides are complexed within a groove between two adjacent domains and a third domain (31Kim J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Griffith J.P. Dwyer D.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The two domains on one side of the groove were proposed to interact with the ssDNA such that one domain could move relative to the other as a function of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Hence, the ssDNA bound in one domain could be released during translocation while interactions in the second domain are maintained to hold onto the DNA. Whether one of the models suggested for PcrA or NS3h applies to Dda remains to be determined. Helicases in superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 have been difficult to characterize in terms of oligomeric structure, and much discussion has surrounded this issue. This is due to the fact that many biophysical approaches for studying oligomerization provide negative results when applied to these enzymes. Evidence has been presented that suggests that PcrA (7Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), UvrD (8Mechanic L.E. Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5174-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) can function as monomers. Another helicase, PriA, was shown to exist as a monomer in solution, even when bound to ssDNA, although the functional form of the enzyme has not been determined (33Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Others have provided evidence that suggests that oligomeric forms of UvrD (34Ali J.A. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 815-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and NS3h (27Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) are required for optimal unwinding activity. Previously, the ability of Dda to displace streptavidin from the 3′ end of biotin-labeled oligonucleotides was found to exhibit a dependence on the length of the oligonucleotide. The streptavidin displacement reaction was found to proceed faster from longer oligonucleotides than from shorter ones (18Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results described here suggest that a monomeric form of Dda can function to unwind DNA. However, individual Dda monomers may align along the nucleic acid lattice to enhance overall activity in the streptavidin displacement assays, despite the lack of strong protein-protein interactions.

RNA blot analyses suggested that the expression of these proteins was developmentally regulated. Western blot analysis of ribosomal proteins isolated from various organs, kernel tissues during seed development, and root tips deprived of oxygen (anoxia) revealed significant heterogeneity in the levels of these proteins. P1 and P3 were detected in ribosomes of all samples at similar levels relative to ribosomal protein S6, whereas P2a and P2b levels showed considerable developmental regulation. Both forms of P2 were present in ribosomes of some organs, whereas only one form was detected in other organs. Considerable tissue-specific variation was observed in levels of monomeric and multimeric forms of P2a. P2b was not detected in root tips, accumulated late in seed embryo and endosperm development, and was detected in soluble ribosomes but not in membrane-associated ribosomes that copurified with zein protein bodies of the kernel endosperm.

P0 (∼35 kDa), homologous to prokaryotic L10, interacts with 28 S rRNA to form the base of the stalk, and P1 and P2 (∼12 kDa), homologous to prokayotic L7/L12, are tethered as dimers to the stalk (2Santos C.

P1 and P2 are structurally similar; each protein has three domains that include an α-helical N-terminal region and a central, flexible acidic hinge region followed by a highly conserved C terminus (E/KSD/EDMGFG/SLD). The C-terminal region of P0 is structurally similar to 12-kDa P-proteins because it possesses the three domains of P1 and P2 (for review, see Ref. 6Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. 55. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 157-193Google Scholar). The 12-kDa P-proteins are the only r-proteins found in multiple copies within the ribosome. They do not assemble onto preribosomes in the nucleolus but cycle between ribosomes and a cytosolic pool in numerous species including, Artemia salina, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), humans, and rats (7van Agthoven A.

This suggests that the level of P-proteins in yeast ribosomes is affected by the metabolic state of the cell and possibly reflects the translational activity of the ribosome. The presence of these proteins in ribosomes has been shown to stimulate the eEF2-dependent GTPase activity of ribosomes (13Sánchez-Madrid F. Reyes R. Conde P. Ballesta J.P. Eur. J.

Hence, modulation of the 12-kDa P-protein component of ribosomes may impart eukaryotes with a means of ribosome-regulated translational control. Higher eukaryotes possess one type of P1 and P2, whereas lower eukaryotes possess multiple forms of P1 and P2 (20Remacha M. Saenz-Robles M.T. Vilella M.D. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9094-9101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae ribosomes, for example, possess two forms of P1 (P1α and P1β) and P2 (P2α and P2β) (21Remacha M. Jimenezdiaz A. Bermejo B. Rodriguezgabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4754-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant yeast strains in which one to four of the 12-kDa P-protein genes were disrupted remained viable but had decreased rates of cell growth (20Remacha M. Saenz-Robles M.T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribosomes isolated from strains in which two or three genes were disrupted showed reduced eEF2-dependent GTPase activity and levels of protein synthesis in vitro (23Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strain in which all four genes were disrupted was more severely impaired, unable to produce spores, and cold-sensitive. Remarkably, the profiles of proteins synthesized from the same poly(A) mRNA sample with ribosomes from this strain and a wild-type strain were distinct, suggesting that the presence of P1 and P2 influences the efficiency of translation of individual mRNAs. P1 and P2 and their phosphorylated forms appear to be functionally distinct. In yeast, the presence of P1 was required for the assembly of P2 into the ribosome (23Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B.

Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8929-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the ability to dephosphorylate one or more of these proteins was necessary for an adaptive response to osmotic stress (25Zambrano R. Briones E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14439-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Studies with recombinant P1 and P2 from rat suggested that phosphorylation of P2 more effectively stimulates eEF2 activity in vitro than phosphorylation of P1 (17Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further analyses indicated that P1 has a higher binding affinity for eEF2 but that phosphorylation of both proteins stabilizes the interaction of eEF2 with the ribosome (16Bargis-Surgey P. Lavergne J.-P. Gonzalo P. Vard C. Filhol-Cochet O. Reboud J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the presence and phosphorylation of the 12-kDa P-proteins is involved in ribosome-mediated translational regulation. We reported that maize (Zea mays L.) possesses one form of P1, two forms of P2 (P2a and P2b), and a third, plant-specific P1/P2-type protein designated P3 (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Szick K. Springer M. Bailey-Serres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we examined whether maize ribosomes vary with respect to the composition and phosphorylation of these proteins. Antisera that specifically recognize the four 12-kDa P-proteins (P1, P2a, P2b, P3) were used to examine levels of these proteins in ribosomes isolated from a number of plant organs, including kernel tissues during seed maturation. Levels were also examined in ribosomes of root tips following flooding (anoxia), an environmental stress condition known to promote selective mRNA translation (28Fennoy S.L. Bailey-Serres J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 287-295Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We observed considerable developmentally and environmentally regulated heterogeneity in the levels and phosphorylation of these proteins. Maize (Z. mays L.) (inbred B73, gift of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Johnston, IA) plants were grown in the field, and leaves of ear husks, ears, and silks were harvested at silk emergence. Ears were hand pollinated and harvested at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 days postpollination (DPP) and after complete desiccation to isolate embryos (including the scutellum and embryonic axis), aleurone (tissue included the aleurone layer and attached pericarp), and endosperm (refers to tissue within the pericarp and aleurone, excluding the embryo). For seedling tissue, kernels were surface sterilized with 0.25% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, imbibed for 8 h, and germinated in the dark for 4–5 days at room temperature. Previously described methods were used for oxygen deprivation (anoxia) of intact seedlings by submergence in an aqueous solution that was continuously sparged with 99.995% argon (28Fennoy S.L. Bailey-Serres J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 287-295Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The apical 1 cm of the primary root and the entire coleoptile were harvested. All samples were frozen directly in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was extracted following a CsCl gradient method (29Cone K.C. Burr F.A. Burr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9631-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and RNA blots (20 μg of RNA/sample) were prepared (30Manjunath S. Williams A.J. Bailey-Serres J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hybridization was with [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNAs (GenBank U62752, maize P1; T18290, maize P2a; U62753, maize P2b; U62751, maize P3; tomato 18 S rRNA (gift of Dr. D.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.49Google Scholar), washed twice in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS (w/v), once in 0.2 × SSC, and 0.1% SDS (w/v) for 20 min each at 65 °C, and exposed to autoradiographic film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Prior to reuse, membranes were washed in 0.05 × SSC, 0.01 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1% SDS (w/v) for 20 min at 100 °C. 1–10 g of tissue was ground to a fine powder under liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle and hydrated in 2–20 ml of extraction buffer A (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, 0.025 m EGTA, 0.036m MgCl2, 0.001 mNa2MoO4, 0.001 mdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol) containing a detergent mix (1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1% Brij 35 (w/v), 1% Tween 40 (v/v), 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (tert-octylphenoxy poly(oxyethylene) ethanol) (v/v)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 7,740 × g, and the resulting supernatant (S-8 extract) was filtered (Miracloth; Calbiochem). Ribosomes were isolated by centrifugation of the S-8 extract through a 1.3 m sucrose cushion (0.4m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, 0.005 mEGTA, 0.036 m MgCl2, 0.001 mNa2MoO4, 0.001 m dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 4 °C for 18–20 h at 135,000 × g. Ribosome pellets were resuspended in 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 0.005 m MgCl2, 0.001 mNa2MoO4, and 0.001 mdithiothreitol. To analyze zeins, S-8 extracts were prepared from endosperm tissue in the same manner, except that cycloheximide and chloramphenicol were omitted from the extraction buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a protein determination reagent (United States Biochemical Corp.). Acidic ribosomal proteins were purified from coleoptile ribosomes as previously described by Bailey-Serres et al. (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in the absence of sodium molybdate. Ribosomes were isolated following the protocol outlined by Mösinger and Schopfer (32Mösinger E. Schopfer P. Planta. 1983; 158: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 1–10 g of tissue was ground to a fine powder under liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle and hydrated in 2–20 ml of extraction buffer B (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.06m KCl, 0.05 m MgCl2, 0.005m dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide). The homogenate was filtered through Miracloth and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 37,000 × g. Detergents (as described above) were added to the supernatant, which contained soluble ribosomes. The pellet, which contained membrane-bound ribosomes, was resuspended in extraction buffer containing detergents. Ribosomes were isolated from each fraction by centrifugation through a 1.3 m sucrose cushion in extraction buffer B at 4 °C for 18–20 h at 135,000 ×g and resuspended in extraction buffer B minus cycloheximide. Ribosomes (2.5 μg) and S-8 extract protein (75 μg) were diluted with SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 0.005 m Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.125% bromphenol blue (w/v). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Ribosomal proteins were fractionated in resolving gels (15% acrylamide (w/v), 0.5% (w/v)N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide, 0.375 mTris, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS (w/v), 0.5% ammonium persulfate (w/v), and 0.5% TEMED). To examine zein levels, the S-8 extract was fractionated in 12% acrylamide (w/v), 0.5% (w/v)N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoresed in SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS (w/v) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm; NitroBind; Micron Separations Inc.) in 0.025 m Tris, 0.250 mglycine, 20% methanol (v/v), and 0.01% SDS (w/v). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBST (PBS (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.49Google Scholar), 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) that contained 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) and incubated with rabbit antiserum against maize S6 (1:5,000 dilution) (kindly provided by A. Williams), rabbit antisera against maize 12-kDa P-protein peptides (P1 (1:250 dilution), P2a (1:250 dilution), P2b (1:250 dilution), P3 (1:1,000 dilution)), or rabbit antiserum against maize γ-zein (1:10,000 dilution) (kindly provided by A. Esen, North Carolina State University) in PBST, 1% nonfat dry milk (w/v) for 1 h. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min in PBST and incubated for 1.5 h in PBST, 1% nonfat dry milk (w/v) with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:15,000 dilution; Bio-Rad) or 35S-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (2 × 105 cpm/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibody-antigen interaction was detected by chemilumenscence using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes that were incubated with35S-labeled anti-rabbit IgG were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) and were quantified using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Peptides specific to maize P-proteins (44ALFAKLLEKRNVED57 for P1, 40ELLLSQLSGKD50 for P2a,39LEFLLTELKDKDI51 for P2b, and9RNNGGEWTAKQHSGEI24 for P3) were synthesized, conjugated with a carrier protein (keyhole limpet hemocyanin for P2a, P2b, and P3; tetanus toxoid for P1) and injected into rabbits. Antisera against P2a and P3 were purified by affinity chromatography using the specific peptide bound to a Sepharose column (Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc., Brighton, MA). We examined the abundance of P1, P2a, P2b, and P3 mRNA transcripts in total RNA from several organs of maize and in kernel tissues during seed maturation and found that the accumulation of individual P-protein transcripts is developmentally regulated (Fig.1). Among the organs and tissues examined, transcript accumulation for all four 12-kDa P-proteins was highest in coleoptiles and immature ears, relative to 18 S rRNA levels, as expected for organs undergoing rapid cell division and differentiation (33Bailey-Serres J. Bailey-Serres J. Gallie D. A Look Beyond Transcription: Mechanisms Determining mRNA Stability and Translation in Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD1998: 125-144Google Scholar). P1, P2a, and P3 mRNA accumulation patterns were very similar. These transcripts were detected at very low levels in leaf, silk, and pollen, where, by contrast, P2b transcripts accumulated to moderately high levels. In all of the kernel tissues examined, P1, P2a, and P3 mRNAs were abundant, with the highest levels at 15 DPP, whereas P2b mRNA was present at low levels. This variation in mRNA accumulation led us to examine the possibility of developmental differences in P-protein composition of ribosomes. Peptides specific to each of the four types of 12-kDa P-proteins of maize were synthesized and used to prepare antisera in rabbits. To evaluate the specificity of the antisera, ribosomes were isolated from coleoptiles, washed with high salt (0.8 m NH4Cl and 50% ethanol) under conditions that release the 12-kDa P-proteins (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and immunoblot analyses were performed. Preimmune sera showed no detectable cross-reaction to r-proteins (data not shown). P1, P2a, P2b, and P3 antisera detected polypeptides of distinct molecular mass from coleoptile ribosomes, confirming that the antisera were specific (Fig.2 A, lane 1 in eachpanel). Maize P1 is encoded by a single-copy gene, has a predicted molecular mass of 11.0 kDa and three putative phosphorylation sites (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K.

P1 antisera recognized polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of ∼14.5 and 50 kDa in coleoptile ribosomes (Fig. 2 A,P1 panel, lane 1). A low level of P1 remained in the salt-washed ribosomes (lane 2). Following release from ribosomes with 0.8 m NH4Cl, P1 was detected primarily as 15 and 14.5 kDa (lane 3). The 50-kDa protein detected with the P1 antiserum was not released from ribosomes (lane 3). This protein was identified as r-protein L4 by matrix-assisted laser absorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (data not shown), indicating that the detection of the 50-kDa protein is most likely caused by nonspecific binding of the P1 antiserum. Maize P2a is encoded by a gene family of approximately four members, has a predicted molecular mass of 11.5 kDa, and five or six putative phosphorylation sites (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Szick K. Springer M. Bailey-Serres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The P2a antiserum detected a group of ∼12-kDa polypeptides in coleoptile ribosomes (Fig. 2 A,P2a panel, lane 1). The detection of multiple 12-kDa forms of P2a is most likely caused by the expression of more than one rpp2a gene. The P2a antiserum also detected groups of ∼26-, ∼42–48-, and ∼60-kDa polypeptides that were not detected with the other antisera. Following elution from ribosomes with high salt these polypeptides had slightly altered electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2 A, lane 3, white,gray, and stippled arrows, respectively). However, not all of the 26-kDa form was released from the salt-washed ribosomes (lane 2). We were unable to promote or inhibit formation of the P2a complexes in ribosomes or eluate samples by manipulation of SDS, urea, sulfhydryl-reducing agents, or heat, indicating that they involve strong hydrophobic interactions (data not shown). These results suggest that P2a is present in dimeric (24–26 kDa) and additional multimeric complexes (42–48 kDa, 60 kDa) in coleoptile ribosomes. Maize P2b is encoded by a single gene, has a predicted molecular mass of 11.8 kDa, and three putative phosphorylation sites (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,27Szick K. Springer M. Bailey-Serres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). P2b was detected as a 14-kDa polypeptide in coleoptile ribosomes (Fig. 2 A, P2b panel, lane 1) and was efficiently released from ribosomes by 0.8 mNH4Cl (lane 2). Similar to P1, P2b was detected after elution as 14- and 14.5-kDa forms (lane 3). Maize P3 is encoded by one to two genes, has a predicted molecular mass of 12.2 kDa, and three putative phosphorylation sites (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Szick K. Springer M. Bailey-Serres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The P3 antiserum detected a 15-kDa polypeptide in coleoptile ribosomes (Fig.2 A, P3 panel, lane 1). When P3 was released with 0.8 m NH4Cl two forms of 15.5 and 15 kDa were detected (lane 3). Much of the P3 protein remained in the salt-washed ribosomes (lane 2), indicating that the noncovalent interactions between P3 and the ribosome are stronger than that observed for P1, P2a, and P2b. Electrophoretic variants of the different P-proteins and P2a complexes were observed between different tissues (Fig.3, discussed below) and following release from coleoptile ribosomes with 0.8 m NH4Cl (Fig. 2 A). More slowly migrating forms of all of the P-proteins were observed following extraction from ribosomes with high salt. We determined that the in vivo phosphorylation status of these proteins was maintained if ribosomes were isolated in the presence of the nonspecific phosphatase and kinase inhibitor sodium molybdate. The effect of the presence or absence of sodium molybdate in the extraction and resuspension buffers is shown for root tip ribosomes in Fig. 2 B. To confirm loading of similar quantities of r-proteins in each sample, immunoblots were coincubated with an antiserum prepared against r-protein S6 (30 kDa). In all cases, the presence of sodium molybdate increased the level of the more slowly migrating forms of the different P-proteins (Fig. 2 B). A panel for P2b is not shown because this form was not detected in root tip ribosomes (see Fig. 3). These results indicate that root extracts contain a phosphatase activity that is inhibited by sodium molybdate and that P1, P2a, and P3 of root ribosomes are predominantly phosphorylated. By contrast, the P-proteins of coleoptile ribosomes had faster electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3, compare root tipand coleoptile lanes), indicating that these proteins are either dephosphorylated in coleoptile ribosomes or a phosphatase was not inhibited during the extraction. The ability of a ribosome-associated kinase to phosphorylate coleoptile P-proteins was evidenced by the change in electrophoretic mobility following resuspension in a buffer lacking sodium molybdate (Fig. 2 A,panel P3) or release from ribosomes with high salt (panels P1, P2a, and P2b). These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of these proteins may be regulated by ribosome-associated kinases. Our previous investigations indicated that the phosphorylation status of the 12-kDa P-proteins is altered in response to anoxia (26Bailey-Serres J. Vangala S. Szick K. Lee C.H.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1293-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The immunoblot shown in Fig. 2 C demonstrates that when intact seedlings were deprived of oxygen for up to 24 h, an increase was observed in the amount of the faster migrating, dephosphorylated forms of P1, P2a, and P3. This result demonstrates unambiguously that 12-kDa P-proteins are dephosphorylated under anoxia. Levels of the 12-kDa P-proteins in ribosomes from several organs (root tip, coleoptile, leaf, silk, and ear) and kernel tissues (embryo, aleurone, and endosperm) were surveyed relative to levels of r-protein S6. Ribosomes were isolated in the presence of sodium molybdate to control protein phosphorylation status during extraction. The immunoblots shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate considerable developmental differences in quantity and electrophoretic mobility of the 12-kDa P-proteins relative to the level of S6 (shown in P2 panel) in ribosomes. P1 was detected in ribosomes of all of the samples but in different amounts and in several electrophoretic variants (Fig. 3, panel P1). P1 was less abundant in leaf, silk, and ear ribosomes, compared with root, coleoptile, and kernel tissues. Variations in P1 included the presence of a single form (15 kDa) in leaf, silk, ear, embryo, and endosperm, two forms in root tip (15 and 14.5 kDa) and coleoptile (14.5 and 12 kDa), and three forms (15, 13, and 12 kDa) in aleurone ribosomes. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, the 15- and 14.5-kDa forms differ in phosphorylation status. The 13- and 12-kDa forms detected in coleoptiles and aleurone were present at varying levels between preparations and are most likely degradation products. The P2a antiserum detected polypeptides that varied considerably in abundance and electrophoretic mobility between the different organ and tissue samples (Fig. 3, panel P2a). The 12.5-kDa forms of P2a were abundant in root tip, embryo, and endosperm ribosomes, whereas a 12-kDa form was detected in coleoptile ribosomes. Consistent with mRNA accumulation data, lower levels of P2a were detected in leaf, silk, ear, and aleurone ribosomes. Levels of dimeric (24–26 kDa) and multimeric P2a (48 and 60 kDa) were proportional to levels of the 12- and 12.5-kDa P2a in all samples except ribosomes of embryo and endosperm. P2a was only detected as a monomer in these kernel samples. As seen for P1, the apparent molecular mass of P2a in root ribosomes was higher than that of coleoptiles. The apparent molecular mass of P2a in leaf, silk, and ear ribosomes was even higher than that of root tips. The observed variations in electrophoretic mobilty could reflect differential expression of the rpp2a genes and/or distinctions in protein phosphorylatio"

This approach was developed in this study and was used to estimate the compactness of HCA II during heat denaturation and interaction with GroEL. It was shown that thermally induced unfolding of HCA II proceeded only to the molten globule state. Reaching this state was sufficient to allow HCA II to bind to GroEL, and the volume of the molten globule intermediate increased ∼2.2-fold compared with that of the native state. GroEL-bound HCA II expands to a volume three to four times that of the native state (to ∼117,000 Å3), which correlates well with a stretched and loosened-up HCA II molecule in an enlarged GroEL cavity. Recently, we found that HCA II binding causes such an inflation of the GroEL molecule, and this probably represents the mechanism by which GroEL actively stretches its protein substrates apart (Hammarström, P., Persson, M., Owenius, R., Lindgren, M., and Carlsson, U.

GroEL is a tetradecamer composed of identical subunits that are organized in two stacked rings. Present knowledge suggests that non-native conformations of a variety of protein substrates interact with GroEL by binding to the apical domain surrounding the opening of the central cavity in the double toroid structure of the chaperonin. It has been shown that GroEL does not simply bind passively to the protein substrate, but instead actively unfolds the protein and thereby gives it a new opportunity to fold correctly (14Viitanen P.V.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the binding sites in the apical domain of GroEL alter conformation depending on the substrate, and this plasticity could be important for promiscuous recognition and binding of substrates (13Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that binding of the protein substrate induces conformational changes in GroEL that open up the structure of the chaperonin (19Hammarström P. Persson M. Owenius R. Lindgren M. Carlsson U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22832-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such an opening mechanism may bring about stretching of the protein substrate, which would account for the unfoldase activity of GroEL. We have previously demonstrated that GroEL can effectively prevent HCA II1from aggregation during refolding in the absence of GroES (7Persson M Aronsson G. Bergenhem N. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Surin B.P. Spangfort M.-D. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A prerequisite of the initial interaction with the chaperonin is that HCA II is unfolded to about the same degree as the molten globule state (18Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also found that GroEL protects an aggregation-prone molten globule intermediate formed at elevated temperatures from aggregation (20Persson M. Carlsson U. Bergenhem N.C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same structural β-sheet region of HCA II that has been demonstrated to be involved in specific aggregation (21Hammarström P. Persson M. Freskgård P.-O. Mårtensson L.-G. Andersson D. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32897-32903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) has also been shown to be loosened up by the action of GroEL, which probably facilitates rearrangements of misfolded structure during folding. In our previous studies of the interaction between GroEL and HCA II, we found that spin labels in the β-sheet core became more mobile in the presence of the chaperonin, indicating an unfolding of this stable hydrophobic core. Nevertheless, these findings did not reveal the extent to which the structure of HCA II is disrupted; hence, we addressed this question by conducting comparative compactness measurements of HCA II during GndHCl-induced unfolding and upon binding to GroEL. HCA II has a molecular mass of 29.3 kDa and dimensions of 39 × 42 × 55 Å according to the x-ray structure (22Eriksson A.E. Jones A.T. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 23Håkansson K. Carlsson M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), The unfolding of the protein is a three-state process that includes formation of a stable equilibrium molten globule intermediate (24Carlsson U. Jonsson B.-H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The central part of the molecule consists of a dominating β-sheet core (see Fig. 1), which is very stable, and has a compact structure in the unfolded state when the molten globule intermediate is ruptured (25Mårtensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. Freskgård P.-O. Kihlgren A. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,26Svensson M. Jonasson P. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Lindgren M. Mårtensson L.-G. Gentile M. Borén K. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this report, we monitored the compactness of HCA II during unfolding and upon interaction with GroEL by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Trp residues and site-directed introduced AEDANS fluorophores in HCA II (Fig.1). Such an approach can be used for specific surveying of conformational changes in HCA II in the presence of GroEL because the chaperonin is devoid of Trp (27Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoloulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The most straightforward way to register the compactness of a protein molecule by FRET is to have a single fluorescent donor and a single acceptor of the fluorescence energy. However, it is often difficult to obtain protein samples that contain a single donor and a different single-acceptor probe. Alternatively, multiple donors (Trp residues) and a single acceptor can be used. HCA II comprises seven Trp residues that are evenly distributed in the three-dimensional structure (22Eriksson A.E. Jones A.T. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). We have produced a number of single-cysteine mutants of HCA II that can be specifically labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS, which can function as an acceptor of Trp fluorescence. It is possible to monitor the quenching of Trp fluorescence in the presence of AEDANS and to compare the results with the quenched fluorescence intensity of the unlabeled protein. However, differences in stability between unlabeled and labeled proteins can blur the interpretation of FRET in the various stages of the unfolding process of the protein. Therefore, we used a strategy that can discriminate between the fluorescence intensity displayed by the AEDANS probe upon excitation by Trp FRET and upon direct excitation; this was accomplished by exciting the same sample of the labeled protein at 295 and 350 nm, respectively. The Trp residues can be excited specifically at 295 nm and fluoresce with a peak at 335–355 nm, depending on the degree of exposure. The AEDANS fluorophore absorbs light with a peak at 337 nm and displays a large spectral overlap with the Trp emission (see Fig. 2 A), which makes the Trp-AEDANS pair highly suitable for FRET studies. However, the Trp fluorescence of HCA II is very complex because all of the Trp residues fluoresce through an intricate network of energy transfer and local quenchers (28Bergenhem N.C.H. Schlyer B.D. Steela D.G. Gafni A. Carlsson U. Jonsson B.-H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 29Mårtensson L.-G. Jonasson P. Freskgård P.-O. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Jonsson B.-H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This network will be broken by the introduction of an extrinsic acceptor such as AEDANS, which complicates the interpretation since the efficiency of FRET is dependent on the quantum yield of the donor fluorophores. Consequently, use of this FRET approach in folding studies entails some approximations. Notwithstanding, the Trp- AEDANS FRET is distance-dependent. The ratio between the fluorescence intensity of the AEDANS moiety excited at 295 and 350 nm can be used as a measure of the distance between the Trp residues and AEDANS. Thus, it is possible to estimate the change in relative compactness of the protein molecule during interaction with GroEL by comparing the obtained values with a reference unfolding curve showing the change in fluorescence intensity ratio as a function of GdnHCl concentration. As in any FRET measurement, the ratio will depend on the distance by 1/d 6. Hence, there will be no linear dependence between the change in the fluorescence intensity ratio and the compactness of the protein. Nevertheless, quantitative estimation of the expansion of the protein is possible because the average distance between the Trp residues and the attached AEDANS can be calculated from the x-ray structure. The change in this average distance can then be approximately calculated from the dependence of the efficiency of FRET on the interprobe distance. The major advantage with the “FRET scaling” approach developed in this work is that a parameter of compactness can be determined. This is particularly useful when the protein interacts with another protein (lacking Trp residues) or a surface. The Trp-AEDANS FRET measurements reported in this study demonstrate that the diameter of HCA II is ∼30% larger than that of the native protein when it binds to GroEL. During the interaction with GroEL, HCA II shows significant structural expansion, and its diameter becomes ∼50% larger than that of the native conformation. 1,5-IAEDANS was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. The chemicals used were of the highest available grade. GdnHCl concentrations were determined by index of refraction (30Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The HCA II single-cysteine mutants were made as previously described (25Mårtensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. Freskgård P.-O. Kihlgren A. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using the cysteine-free C206S pseudo wild-type protein as a template. GroEL was purified as previously described (20Persson M. Carlsson U. Bergenhem N.C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Labeling and affinity chromatographic purification were performed as previously described by Svensson et al. (26Svensson M. Jonasson P. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Lindgren M. Mårtensson L.-G. Gentile M. Borén K. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All mutants except W16C and H64C were labeled in the unfolded state and were thereafter refolded and purified. The degree of labeling was 90–100%, judging by absorption measurements of HCA II at 280 nm and AEDANS at 337 nm. GdnHCl unfolding fluorescence measurements were performed in 1 μm solutions of labeled HCA II incubated overnight in varying concentrations of GdnHCl buffered with 0.1 m Tris H2SO4, pH 7.5. Thermal unfolding and the GroEL measurements were performed as previously described (18Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, for the GroEL measurements, protein concentrations of 1 μm were used for both HCA II and GroEL. In short, the protein was allowed to equilibrate in the incubation buffer for 1 h at 20 °C prior to measurements at that temperature. Thereafter, the protein was incubated at 50 °C to induce unfolding and either aggregation or formation of a complex with GroEL. Measurements were performed after incubation for 5 min and again after 1 h. Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer, exciting at 295 nm and monitoring emission at 310–580 nm. Excitation was also done at 350 nm, recording the AEDANS emission in the range 380–600 nm. Slits for both emission and excitation light were set at 5 nm. The FRET intensity ratio (I 295/I 350) was calculated by dividing the AEDANS emission intensity following excitation at 295 nm by the AEDANS emission intensity following excitation at 350 nm. The GdnHCl unfolding curves based on Trp fluorescence, AEDANS fluorescence, and Trp-AEDANS FRET were fitted to a three-state model as previously described (25Mårtensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. Freskgård P.-O. Kihlgren A. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TheT m values were calculated as reported by Perssonet al. (18Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The equation for calculation of the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (E) was as follows: E =R 06/(R 06+ d 6), where R 0 is the 22-Å Förster radius of the Trp-AEDANS pair (31Fairclough R.H. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 347-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), andd is the distance between Trp and AEDANS. The global unfolding of HCA II was registered by the wavelength shift of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence (TableI). This is a reliable method of monitoring global conformational changes because HCA II has seven Trp residues well distributed in the native conformation (22Eriksson A.E. Jones A.T. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Changes in compactness of the HCA II molecule during unfolding and interaction with GroEL were estimated from Trp-AEDANS FRET measurements, and local conformational changes were probed by fluorescence intensity shifts of AEDANS labels attached to specific sites in the protein structure. It must be noted that in the following discussion, the following distinctions are made between global and local conformational changes: global conformational changes are defined by changes in the intrinsic Trp fluorescence shift, and local conformational changes are defined by changes in the fluorescence shift of the AEDANS probe. Changes in compactness of the protein are based on Trp-AEDANS FRET, and this compactness measure is of both global and local character, and it varies from which site it is monitored.Table IStability of AEDANS-labeled mutants of HCA IIMutantC m (NI) 1-aStability measurements are presented as midpoint concentrations of GdnHCl for native-to-intermediate (NI) and intermediate-to-unfolded (IU) transitions.C m (IU) 1-aStability measurements are presented as midpoint concentrations of GdnHCl for native-to-intermediate (NI) and intermediate-to-unfolded (IU) transitions.T m 1-bT m was measured in the presence of 0.2 m GdnHCl.mm°CW16C0.411.934H64C0.921.844N67C0.761.946L79C0.291.732L118C0.151.419A142C0.421.635I146C0.191.123Global stability was measured by intrinsic Trp fluorescence shift.1-a Stability measurements are presented as midpoint concentrations of GdnHCl for native-to-intermediate (NI) and intermediate-to-unfolded (IU) transitions.1-b T m was measured in the presence of 0.2 m GdnHCl.

Unfolding of HCA II and variants thereof displays three-state global unfolding behavior (native → intermediate → unfolded) (25Mårtensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. Freskgård P.-O. Kihlgren A. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, the unfolded state of the enzyme has been shown to have a substantial amount of residual structure (26Svensson M. Jonasson P. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Lindgren M. Mårtensson L.-G.

Monitoring the global unfolding of HCA II by Trp fluorescence revealed a continuous red shift with increasing GdnHCl concentration. All the variants considered in our study exhibited this behavior, and the calculated GdnHCl concentration midpoints of denaturation for the native-to-intermediate and intermediate-to unfolded transitions are summarized in Table I. Compactness of HCA II was measured as the FRET from Trp residues to 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled single-cysteine mutants. This was accomplished by exciting the same sample of labeled protein at 295 and 350 nm, which excites the Trp residues and AEDANS, respectively. The FRET intensity ratio (I 295/I 350) is high for a compact folded protein in which the Trp donors and the AEDANS acceptors are situated close to each other, and it is low for an unfolded protein in which the Trp residues and AEDANS label are separated (Fig.2 B). Insertion of the AEDANS label at different positions in the protein will yield varying results, depending on the distance to the Trp residues. If an AEDANS acceptor fluorophore is inserted at various positions, the local conformational changes during unfolding will give a picture of the unfolding process throughout the protein structure. HCA II has seven Trp residues (positions 5, 16, 97, 123, 192, 209, and 245) that are evenly distributed in the molecule. We inserted the AEDANS label in nine different positions in the protein: W16C, H64C, N67C, L79C, L118C, A142C, I146C, N244C, and W245C (Fig. 1). All of the mutants were constructed using the cysteine-free C206S variant of cloned HCA II to be able to insert a unique cysteine at any position in the sequence. This approach to determine compactness during various stages of unfolding must be regarded to be approximate, and the distances calculated must be considered to be estimations of the real distances since the quantum yields and wavelength maxima can vary for the various Trp residues in HCA II in the native state and during unfolding. We have, however, previously shown that these parameters are rather uniform for the individual Trp residues in the molten globule and in the unfolded state, whereas they differ in the native state (29Mårtensson L.-G. Jonasson P. Freskgård P.-O. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Jonsson B.-H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, the estimated expansion of the HCA II molecule upon GroEL action should be fairly reliable since the GroEL-induced transition is started from the molten globule state, and we also monitored the FRET signal from several positions throughout the structure. The FRET unfolding curves of the variants are shown in Fig.3 A, and these unfolding curves will serve as reference curves when estimations of the compactness of HCA II at different stages of unfolding are made. The local change in polarity, detected by the AEDANS spectral shift, was also monitored for each mutant upon unfolding in GdnHCl (Fig.4, A and B). The fluorescence shift of AEDANS in a folded protein can show substantial variation due to large differences in the microenvironment. Site-directed fluorescence labeling with environmentally sensitive fluorophores has been used for structural mapping (34Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AEDANS at buried sites (e.g. L79C) and at sites in the hydrophobic core (L118C and I146C) displayed fluorescence shifts in the range 449–468 nm. AEDANS at partially buried sites, such as N67C and A142C, fluoresced between 471 and 483 nm. Labeling sites on the surface of HCA II, as was done with H64C and W16C, resulted in a fluorescence peak at 490–492 nm. During unfolding, the labels become exposed to the solvent, resulting in a red shift in the spectra. In the unfolded protein, the AEDANS fluorescence peaked around 505 nm for all the labeled positions. The equilibrium GdnHCl unfolding of HCA II appears to be a stepwise process. Unfolding of the native state of HCA II leads to a stable molten globule intermediate. The molten globule intermediate has previously been shown to be very prone to aggregate in a site-specific manner (21Hammarström P. Persson M. Freskgård P.-O. Mårtensson L.-G. Andersson D. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32897-32903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the aggregation interface was mapped to β-strands 4–7. For AEDANS-labeled positions in β-strands 5 and 6 (positions 118, 142, and 146), the Trp-AEDANS FRET intensity ratio increased upon aggregate formation. This could be explained by intermolecular FRET because Trp97, Trp123, Trp192, and Trp209 are all located in this region, evidently in proximity to these AEDANS labels. This indicates that positions 118, 142, and 146 are involved in the aggregation interaction surface. Interestingly, the FRET measurements in the present survey confirmed the previous findings. Notably, this indicates that the aggregation interface is compact because of the FRET sensitivity to the distance between the donors and acceptors. From these data, we were able to construct a contact map of the aggregation interface (Fig. 5 A) that is very similar to the aggregation interface map published in a previous study (21Hammarström P. Persson M. Freskgård P.-O. Mårtensson L.-G. Andersson D. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32897-32903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 A, the labeled sites that displayed increased efficiency of FRET after the first unfolding transition are shown in red, and those that exhibited decreased efficiency of FRET are illustrated in yellow. Two additional labeled sites are also included in that map (AEDANS-N244C and AEDANS-W245C), both of which are indicated in yellow(Fig. 5 A) because they exhibited decreased efficiency of FRET during the unfolding process (data not shown). As a comparison, the locations of the Trp residues in HCA II are included in Fig.5 B. The secondary structure maps reveal that thered positions in Fig. 5 A (AEDANS-labeled positions with increased efficiency of FRET in the aggregate) overlap the green positions in Fig. 5 B (location of Trp residues in the central region of the protein). Consequently, the central β-strands appear to cluster together intermolecularly, forming an aggregation nucleation site. Unfolding of peripheral secondary structure, as judged from the FRET transitions and AEDANS shifts monitored from positions 16, 64, 67, and 79, appears to coincide with the second global unfolding transition (Fig. 3, A and B; Fig. 4, A andB; and Table I). In the case of the core positions 118, 142, and 146, slightly higher midpoint concentrations of GdnHCl were found for the FRET transitions (1.5, 1.9, and 1.4 m, respectively) than for the global unfolding (Table I), indicating that this is the most stable part of the protein. These measurements can provide even more structural information at extreme GdnHCl concentrations (see below). Unfolding of the “unfolded state” is a non-cooperative process that entails disruption of local hydrophobic clusters. Continuous solvation of the unfolded state in GdnHCl has been discussed by Dill and Shortle (35Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), who concluded that hydrophobic clusters in proteins become increasingly soluble in increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. The FRET measurements performed on the various AEDANS-labeled mutants in this study revealed interesting features of the unfolded state. We employed two additional mutants in the C-terminal sequence to investigate the GdnHCl-unfolded protein and GdnHCl concentrations in the r"

Both operons are transcribed from two divergent promoters, P(X) and P(M), and are negatively regulated by the MalR transcriptional repressor. Purified MalR protein binds to two DNA regions that encompasses both promoters, thus occupying its two operators, O(M) and O(X). However, the levels of occupation and repression were different, being higher when MalR was bound to O(M) than when it was anchored to O(X). Competition experiments between MalR and the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase on promoters P(M) and P(X) showed that the affinity of either protein for the promoter/operator DNA sequences was important to determine the frequency of transcription initiation. In addition to the control exerted by MalR, expression from promoter P(M) was affected by upstream sequences located within or close to P(X) promoter."

Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. et al.Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5810) Google Scholar). These few residues are distributed among six extracytoplasmic loops that join successive pairs of membrane-spanning sequences (TMs). Most of these putative loops are extremely short; all except the first (EL1) and the fourth (EL4) are five residues or less in length (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. et al.Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5810) Google Scholar). EL1 and EL4 are only 15 and 31 residues in length, respectively, with two N-linked oligosaccharide chains attached to the latter. This relative lack of exposure to the cell exterior is not unexpected because the CFTR ion channel is not regulated from this side of the membrane but from the cytoplasmic side where most of the mass of the protein resides. In addition to the large nucleotide binding domains and R-domain even the cytoplasmic loops joining the TMs with lengths of ∼60 residues are much longer than the ELs. Hence little attention has been paid to these short external sequences in studies of the structure-function relationships of CFTR. However, one relatively common missense mutation in EL1, R117H, was shown earlier to reduce chloride conductance (2Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Subsequently several other disease-associated single residue substitutions in the ELs have been reported (CF Genetic Analysis Consortium). To determine what influence they may have on the biosynthetic processing and function of the molecule that might lead to the disease phenotype, we have reconstructed these mutants in an expression plasmid and established them in stable cell lines. In contrast to 18 of 30 disease-associated missense mutations that were found to prevent maturation (3Seibert F.S. Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M.

Instead, they had strong effects on the stability of the CFTR Cl− channel. The BHK cells expressing wild-type CFTR have been described in our earlier publications (6Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A.

CF-associated point mutations were reconstructed in the Bluescript cloning vector containing the CFTR cDNA using the Quick Exchange kit from Stratagene with the oligonucleotide primers listed in Table I. To allow efficient stable transfection, the mutated fragments were transferred to pNUT-CFTR, utilizingXmaI and DraIII for mutations in EL1 and EL2 or the two endogenous DraIII restriction sites of CFTR for mutations in EL4 and EL5.

For the following chase, the [35S]methionine-containing medium was replaced by complete medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 1 mmmethionine. Cells were grown to confluency in 10-cm plates. Plates were placed on ice for 30 min and then washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Surface proteins were labeled by incubation for 30 min in 1 ml of PBS, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). Plates were washed four times with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and four times with PBS. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described below for immunoprecipitation. After centrifugation the supernatant was transferred to fresh centrifuge tubes containing 50 μl of prewashed streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) and incubated overnight with gentle mixing. Beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and eluted with 50 μl of 2× sample buffer. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% acrylamide) and transfer to nitrocellulose, Western blots were probed with M3A7 (19Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaMoO4, and 0.09% Nonidet P-40 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (E64 (3.5 μg/ml), benzamidine (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and Pefabloc (50 μg/ml)). After centrifugation at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was incubated overnight with the monoclonal antibody M3A7 followed by a 4-h incubation with Protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). After four washings with radioimmune precipitation buffer, attached complexes were dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer. Total cell lysates, streptavidin precipitates, or immunoprecipitates were separated on 6% acrylamide gels. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and probed with M3A7 as primary antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). After electrophoresis of radiolabeled immunoprecipitates, gels were analyzed by fluorography and electronic autoradiography using a Packard Instrument Co. Instant Imager. Cells were grown to confluency in 6-well culture dishes. After two washes with efflux buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 11 mmglucose, 2 mm Ca2NO3, 2 mm Mg2NO3, 2 mmKNO3, 135 mm NaNO3), cells were loaded for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5 ml of efflux buffer containing 1 μCi of 36Cl−. Loaded cells were washed three times with 1 ml of efflux buffer at 1-min intervals. 0.5-ml samples were collected into 24-well Topcount plates and replaced with the same volume of efflux buffer at 1-min intervals. Starting at time 0, the efflux buffer contained 10 μmforskolin, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 100 μm dibutyryl cAMP to stimulate CFTR activity. To each sample 1 ml of Microscint scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co.) was added. Samples were analyzed in a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated from BHK cells expressing the different CFTR variants and phosphorylated with protein kinase A as described previously (9Aleksandrov A.A. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CFTR single channels were incorporated into the lipid bilayer by fusion of the microsomes with a preformed planar bilayer. Single channel records were collected in a buffer containing 300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2 on both sides of the bilayer. 2 mm Na2ATP was present also on the cis side. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments). Fig.1 A sketches the positions of the EL substitutions. Although most are in EL1, three other loops are represented also. One mutation reported in a patient in EL6, G1127E, was not expressed. Fig. 1 B indicates that although there is considerable variability in the level of protein expression among representative clones of each of the CFTR variants, they are all expressed and mature. In fact, the ratios of the intensities of the larger mature bands to the smaller immature bands are relatively similar to that of the wild type. Confirmation that the mature molecules that have acquired complex oligosaccharide chains are transported to the cell surface is provided by their labeling with a membrane-impermeant amino-reactive biotinylation reagent from the exterior (Fig. 1 C). The immature core-glycosylated forms are not labeled because they remain intracellular. The relative intensities of the surface labeled bands (Fig. 1 C) are generally proportional to those of the Western blots (Fig. 1 B). However, in the case of E116K the surface signal is disproportionally weaker relative to the immunoblot indicating that it could be somewhat impeded in transport to the cell surface. The detection of the mature form of each of these variants in Western blots and at the cell surface showed that biosynthesis and intracellular transport occurred. To better evaluate how efficiently this occurred, pulse-chase experiments were performed (Fig.2). As widely demonstrated previously (10Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) conversion of the wild-type core-glycosylated precursor to the mature complex-glycosylated product reached a maximum of ∼40% after ∼2 h of chase. After that, the mature protein decays with at12 between 15 and 20 h. The efficiency of conversion for most of the EL variants seems further reduced so that the maximum proportion of [35S]methionine incorporated into the precursor during the pulse, which is detected in the mature form, is as low as 0.2. Exceptions are S108F, which matures as efficiently as the wild type, and T908N, which matures even more efficiently. Although the processing of the nascent forms of most of these mutants occurs less well than the wild type, the turnover of the mature form is little changed and hence a reasonable steady-state level is achieved reflecting largely the amount that does mature. To gain some initial information on how these mutations influence the chloride channel activity of CFTR, cells were loaded with tracer36Cl−, and its efflux followed after stimulation to increase cAMP levels. The rates of efflux at times after stimulation are plotted in Fig. 3. Although appearing to be generally reduced compared with the wild type, there were substantial rates of efflux from cells expressing all of these variants. Thus it was feasible to undertake studies of the single channel properties of each as described below. As far as the comparison of the rates of 36Cl efflux goes, it has to be kept in mind that the amount of CFTR protein in each clonal cell line is somewhat variable. However, some significant changes are apparent. For example, E217G in EL2 reduces the efflux rate greatly. On the other hand, P1013L in EL5 exhibits rates as high as wild type. Fig.4 contains representative recordings of single channels in planar lipid bilayers with which membrane vesicles isolated from cells expressing each of the variants and the wild type were fused. Amplitude histograms accompany each tracing. Most of the salient features of the wild-type CFTR channel are illustrated in the first tracing shown. At this temperature of 21 °C with 300 mm Cl− on both sides of the bilayer, the principal mode of the wild-type channel exhibits two well defined conductance levels of 10.1 and 11.5 pS similar to those described by Gunderson and Kopito (11Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The behavior of the most N-terminal mutant in EL1, S108F, indicates that substitution of the small hydroxyl amino acid with the larger aromatic phenylalanine results in a channel with no stable open state. Channel openings are detected but these are extremely brief. No peak value for current through the open channel can be discerned in the all-points histogram. Simply put, this mutant channel attempts frequent opening, but the open state cannot be maintained suggesting that this residue or the region of EL1 it occupies is crucial to the stability of the open-state structure. If a parameter I equal to the mean current through a single channel at −75 mV is used to represent the total charge transported by the channel per unit of time, one can employ a ratio of that value for the mutant to that of the wild type to obtain a relative measure of the charge transport ability of the mutant compared with the wild type. The value of the parameterI is derived from the area under the channel openings divided by the time interval. As indicated in TableII, theIS108F/IWT is ∼11%.Table IIRelative charge transport capacity of mutantsMutantsS108FY109CD110HP111LP111AE116KR117HR117CR117LR117PE217GT908NP1013LImutant/Iwt100%1115271731051280275111048170 Open table in a new tab The substitution of the aromatic tyrosine in the adjacent position by the small thiol residue (Y109C) also results in a very unstable open state, but the tracing is different from that of S108F. There is a burstlike behavior but within the burst there are rapid closings. This channel is capable of gating but there is large fluctuation in the open-state structure. The mean current carried at −75 mV is ∼15% of the wild type (Table II). Replacing the aspartate residue in the next position by histidine (D110H) resulted in a much more normal looking channel with a major mean conductance of about 8.5 pS. Although a minor peak for the channel open state is detectable on the all-points histogram, the duration of the openings is much less than those of the wild type. Hence like the mutants at the previous two residues, instability of the open state is the most pronounced feature of this channel. Two different mutations found in patients at the next position were analyzed at the single channel level. P111L appears very much like wild type with a mean conductance of 10.3 pS. The Powas 0.45 with a main mean open time of 500 ms and closed time of 600 ms. There is no indication that this variant has any difficulty in maintaining its open-state structure at this temperature (21 °C). However, a marked difference in its behavior is revealed at higher temperature (35 °C; Fig. 5) at which its Po is reduced to about half that of the wild type. Substitution of the proline with the smaller aliphatic alanine residue (P111A) produced a channel with much more rapid kinetics and a reduced conductance of 9.2 pS even at 21 °C (Fig. 4). The mutation five residues further in the C-terminal direction resulted in a charge reversal (E116K). This mutant displays properties quite similar to S108F; channel openings occur but cannot be maintained. No defined peak is apparent for openings in the all-points histogram. The R117H mutant was reported previously to exhibit a small reduction in both current amplitude and open time (2Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Our observations confirm a conductance decrease of 1.5 pS in both of the two conductances observed in the wild type. Otherwise the kinetic behavior at this temperature was not very different from wild type. In fact we found this substitution at Arg-117 to have far less effect than the other three disease-associated replacements at this position. Both R117C and R117L had very unstable open states like S108F and E116K with the cysteine substitution able to maintain openings slightly longer than the leucine substitution. R117P also displayed only transient openings. Thus the more frequent R117H mutation seems to compromise open-channel structure less than the other three substitutions at this position. This may be because of the structural similarity of the arginine and histidine residues not shared by the other three substituting residues. Overall the set of EL1 mutations examined points to an involvement of this loop in the formation of a stable pore structure. Strikingly, the single missense mutation (E217G) in the short EL2 also results in channels with only transient rather than stable openings, perhaps implying that this loop is involved also in stabilizing open pore structure. The T908N mutation in EL4, the second of the two larger extracytoplasmic loops of CFTR, has a somewhat similar effect on the single channel behavior as those in EL1 that cause a very unstable open state. Cells expressing this variant in the large glycosylated loop at the beginning of the second half of the molecule display channels with a noisy open state and a mean conductance of ∼9.2 pS. This behavior is distinct from the EL1 and EL2 variants in that the openings are not as extremely transient. As seen in the T908N trace, there are in fact relatively long openings with several brief closings within to generate burstlike behavior. An intraburst mean open time of ∼90 ms and a mean burst duration of ∼200 ms can be derived. The brief closings appeared as intraburst closings with a time constant of ∼15 ms and intraburst time constant of ∼800 ms. The overall open probability is 0.14. The mean conductance is just a little less than the major wild-type conductance. This mutant was studied also at the higher temperature of 35 °C (Fig. 5) at which its difference from the wild type was more apparent in the current tracing. The final disease-associated mutant analyzed, P1013L, in the fifth exterior loop exhibited robust wild-type-like behavior, and consistent with its 36Cl efflux ability, it has aPo of 0.5, higher than the wild type. However, because the gating of some of the other less severely impaired mutants became more obvious at a higher temperature, this variant was assessed also at 35 °C (Fig. 5). The conductance remained unaltered but thePo was reduced to approximately half of that of the wild type. Thus although replacement of this hydroxyl amino acid does not destabilize the channel to the extent of several of the other mutations, it does have some impact. Although only a relatively small proportion of the large number of mutant versions of CFTR detected in CF patients have been expressed in heterologous systems, the analysis of those that have has been informative in several ways (for reviews see Refs. 10Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, and 16Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S47-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of greatest impact was the finding that the ΔF508 mutation that is present on at least one allele in 90% of patients caused defective biosynthetic maturation (12Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). A considerable number of missense mutations has a similar consequence (13Seibert F.S. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Riordan J.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other single residue substitutions alter specific properties of the CFTR ion channel (14Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). For example a nucleotide binding domain mutation, G551D, precludes virtually all activity and R-domain mutations have a variety of effects (15Pasyk E.A. Morin X.K. Zeman P. Garami E. Galley K. Huan L.J. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31759-31764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Substitutions in membrane-spanning sequences may alter conductance, selectivity, occupancy, or gating of the pore (16Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S47-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Missense mutations changing residues in the cytoplasmic loops separating the transmembrane helices have relatively minor effects on channel gating and regulation, but the majority of them prevent normal processing and maturation of the polypeptide, as does ΔF508 (13Seibert F.S. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Riordan J.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Of missense mutations identified in codons for residues in extracytoplasmic loops, only R117H, which occurs relatively frequently in patients, has been studied in any detail (2Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). It was found to mature when heterologously expressed but the whole-cell current it generated was much reduced compared with wild type. Single channel conductance was diminished only a small amount but open probability was reduced because of altered gating. Our observations are generally in agreement with those, although the replacement of the large positively charged arginine residue by histidine had much less effect on gating than the other substitutions at this position. Each of those three drastically altered gating. This effect was most extreme with the hydrophobic leucine residue at this location precisely at the junction of EL1 and TM2. In this case, only extremely brief openings were detected. These were only slightly longer when either a cysteine or a proline was in this position. The charge-reversal mutation, E116K, at the immediately preceding position had a remarkably similar effect to that of the most perturbing substitutions of Arg-117. Hence these two contiguous oppositely charged amino acids seem essential for maintenance of the open state. Although prolines often are considered crucial structure-determining residues, replacement of Pro-111 had less impact than some of the other changes. The P111L variant in contrast to all the other EL1 mutants differed from wild type only at elevated temperatures. The substitutions at residues 110, 109, and 108 were similar to Glu-116 and Glu-117 changes in causing a very unstable open state. The E217G mutant in EL2 had a similar effect. Hence the overwhelming consequence of disease-associated mutations in EL1 and EL2 is destabilization of the CFTR channel open state. The T908N mutation in EL4, which is novel in that it results in the introduction of an additional consensus site forN-glycosylation that is used (17Hammerle, M., Aleksandrov, A. A., Chang, X.-B., and Riordan, J. R. (2001) Glycoconj. J., in press.Google Scholar), also alters channel gating. Thus although the P1013L change in EL5 did not seem to compromise channel activity except at higher temperatures, all of the others analyzed seriously detracted from the ability of CFTR to sustain a stable open pore. This suggests that these short loops that link the extracellular ends of the TMs that are believed to form the pore may be crucially involved in maintaining their precise orientation or relationship to each other. The restraint on the TMs by these short loops, in contrast to the freedom that the much longer cytoplasmic loops may allow, conjures up an image somewhat different from that provided by the low resolution three-dimensional structural image of P-glycoprotein (18Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In that case, the funnel-like formation suggested was narrow on the cytoplasmic side and wide on the exterior face of the membrane. However, because there are as yet not even low resolution images of CFTR, extrapolation of the effects of mutagenesis on function to structural interpretations may be misleading. Nevertheless, analysis of this set of disease-associated mutations in the extracytoplasmic loops has provided interesting results, some of which might not have been expected. The ELs are the only parts of the protein in which none of the mutations studied had strong effects on biosynthetic processing, suggesting that recognition of mutant CFTR by endoplasmic reticulum quality control occurs primarily on the cytoplasmic rather than the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Second, none of the mutations prevent channel opening, but most of them preclude formation of a stable open-state structure implying that the ELs may play an essential role in this function.

Although apoptotic stimuli that elicit responses vary from cell to cell, there seems to be a basic biochemical machinery underlying the process of regulated programmed cell death. Growing evidence suggests that apoptosis is mediated by the activation of a family of cysteine proteases, known as caspases, which cleave target proteins immediately after specific aspartic acid residues (4Budihardjo I.

However, the functional significance of the majority of these cleavage events and their exact roles in the execution of apoptosis remain largely to be unraveled.Caspase-mediated cleavages can initiate their deadly assault on the cell by inactivating proteins necessary for cell survival or structural integrity. Meanwhile, caspase-dependent cell killing also requires the activation of proapoptotic proteins. Protein kinases emerge as the direct substrates and effectors of caspases (11Bokoch G.M.

For example, two antiapoptotic protein kinases, Raf-1 and Akt, are inactivated by caspase-mediated proteolytic degradation (13Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

In each case, caspase cleavage generates a constitutively active kinase by removing inhibitory domains from the proteins. Importantly, the active fragments then act as signals propagating the apoptosis processes.Etk/Bmx (epithelial and endothelial tyrosinekinase or bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X) is a member of the Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) tyrosine kinase family (24Qiu Y.

Each kinase has a unique expression pattern, and Etk is commonly expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and monocytes/macrophages including prostate tissues (24Qiu Y. Robinson D.

Recent studies suggest that various signals transmitted by the Btk family members play central but diverse modulatory roles in cell growth and differentiation (35Hsueh R.C. Scheuermann R.H. Adv.

Rev. 2000; 175: 120-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence implicate Btk family members in the apoptosis pathway. Interestingly, both Btk and Etk are reported to be able to induce pro- as well as antiapoptotic signals. For instance, Btk and Itk are known to play vital roles in B cell and T cell development by protecting these cells from apoptosis (30Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 39Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Sher A. Varmus H.E. Lenardo M.J. Schwartzberg P.L.

Btk is also shown to be an inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptotic signal in B cells by its direct association with the death receptor Fas, blocking the Fas-FADD interaction (41Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistent with its antiapoptotic role is the finding that Btk activates a survival signal pathway involving Akt and NFκB (42Bajpai U.D. Zhang K. Teutsch M. Sen R. Wortis H.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43Kitaura J. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kawakami Y. Kikkawa U. Kawakami T. J. Exp.

In contrast, Btk is also involved in transmitting apoptosis signals, since an engineered variant of B cell line DT-40, which lacks both alleles of Btk, became resistant to UV-induced apoptosis (45Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Etk also seems to play dual roles in apoptosis. Overexpression of Etk renders prostate cancer cell line LNCaP more resistant to photodynamic therapy or thapsigargin-induced apoptosis (46Xue L.Y. Qiu Y. He J. Kung H.J. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas it sensitizes mast cell line 32D toward apoptosis upon treatment with G-CSF (47Ekman N. Arighi E. Rajantie I. Saharinen P. Ristimaki A. Silvennoinen O. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4151-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). How the Btk family kinases assume such a paradoxical role in apoptosis is unclear. One possibility we considered is that posttranslational modification converts these kinases into functionally opposite isoforms.In this report, we explore the possibility that Etk can be converted to a proapoptotic form after caspase cleavage. We provide evidence that Etk is an in vitro and in vivo substrate for caspase 3 during apoptosis. Using point mutants, we mapped the cleavage site to be Asp242 in the SH3 domain. The cleavage separates the N-terminal PH and SH3 domains from the C-terminal SH2 and catalytic domains. The C-terminal fragment of Etk exhibits increased kinase activity and sensitizes prostate cancer PC3 cells toward apoptosis in response to apoptosis-inducing stimuli. To our knowledge, this is the first case where Btk family member is shown to be a caspase target. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation as to how Etk can both be anti- and proapoptotic.DISCUSSIONThere is very strong evidence that caspases participate in the apoptotic process. The identification of caspase substrates provides a means to understand the often complex and diverse apoptotic pathways. In this study, we describe a tyrosine kinase Etk as a direct substrate for caspases. Both recombinant caspases 3 and 8 cleave Etk, although with different efficiency, and generate an identical cleavage pattern, suggesting some degree of functional redundancy within the caspase family (8Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). The data also raise the possibility that Etk can alternatively be proteolyzed by caspase 8 in some caspase 3-deficient cells. A single amino acid change from Asp242 to Ala abolishes such a cleavage and unambiguously identifies the cleavage site to be DFPD242↓W. While this sequence does not match any known caspase cleavage sequence, DXXD is a consensus recognition motif of caspase (8Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar, 60Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

It is interesting that among the Btk family kinases, the DFPD↓W sequence is uniquely present in Etk despite the overall structural homology of Btk family kinases. There are, however, two putative caspase 3 cleavage motifs in Btk. One of them, DPKD401↓L, is located in the proximity of the kinase domain (Fig. 6 B), the cleavage of which should in theory also generate an active kinase without a PH domain. The kinase activity of Etk/C is 4 times higher than that of the wild type. This activation is similar in magnitude to that caused by either deletion of the PH domain (24Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) or competitive binding of PTPD1 to the PH domain (61Jui H.Y. Tseng R.J. Wen X. Fang H.I. Huang L.M. Chen K.Y. Kung H.J. Ann D.K. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41124-41132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of these data are consistent with the model that the PH domain negatively regulates the kinase activity of Etk in a manner similar to that proposed for Itk (54Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).The proteolysis of ectopically expressed Etk/wt occurs within 2 h in response to anti-Fas antibody treatment (Fig. 7). However, at this time point, no biochemical or morphological manifestations of apoptotic cell death could be observed, suggesting that Etk cleavage and its activation may be involved in the apoptosis process. This is reminiscent of several other protein kinases, such as MEKK-1 (17Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and PAK2/human PAK65 (18Lee N. MacDonald H. Reinhard C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L.T. Proc.

Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), that are also activated by caspase-mediated cleavage. A common feature of these kinases is that overexpression of caspase-truncated kinase induces apoptosis of cells. In our case, however, introduction of caspase-truncated Etk/C does not commit the cell to apoptotic demise but enhances apoptosis induced by extracellular stimuli (Fig. 9). These data suggest that Etk might not play a role in the initiation of apoptosis but contributes to the propagation or amplification of the apoptosis signal. How Etk does this is presently unclear. It is conceivable that the cleavage and activation of Etk might deregulate the activity of downstream targets. This is supported by the findings that apoptosis induced by Fas ligation (62Eischen C.M.

This suggests that Btk family kinases may act as apoptotic switches and that their activities can influence both pro- and antiapoptotic signal molecules. Depending on the cell contexts and the forms of the kinases, as the present study suggests, the balance could be tilted in either direction. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Btk was shown to inhibit B cell apoptosis induced by Fas ligation (41Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This inhibition is due to a direct interaction between Fas and Btk, via the PH domain, which interferes with Fas-FADD association. The activated and associated Btk kinase is apparently important in this inhibition process. If, however, Btk is cleaved by a caspase, which separates the PH domain from the kinase domain, the apoptosis process will be enhanced. This could be one reason why, in Fas-mediated apoptosis, Btk family kinases could be both anti- and proapoptotic.In summary, we show in this report that a tyrosine kinase, Etk/Bmx, can be a substrate of a caspase(s). The resulting truncated molecule contains an intact SH2 domain and kinase domain. This molecule has an enhanced kinase activity and, while not apoptotic on its own, possesses an ability to enhance apoptosis induced by other agents. Our findings offer an alternative mechanism to explain the dual roles of Etk (or Btk family kinases in general) in apoptosis. The identification of new substrate(s) and interacting protein(s) as the consequence of Etk cleavage should provide insights into the apoptosis mediated by these family kinases. Apoptosis (or programmed cell death) is a fundamental and complex biological process that enables an organism to eliminate unwanted or defective cells through an orderly process of cellular disintegration (1Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 2Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

Although apoptotic stimuli that elicit responses vary from cell to cell, there seems to be a basic biochemical machinery underlying the process of regulated programmed cell death. Growing evidence suggests that apoptosis is mediated by the activation of a family of cysteine proteases, known as caspases, which cleave target proteins immediately after specific aspartic acid residues (4Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 5Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

To date, a long list of caspase substrates has been identified (7Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 8Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

However, the functional significance of the majority of these cleavage events and their exact roles in the execution of apoptosis remain largely to be unraveled. Caspase-mediated cleavages can initiate their deadly assault on the cell by inactivating proteins necessary for cell survival or structural integrity. Meanwhile, caspase-dependent cell killing also requires the activation of proapoptotic proteins. Protein kinases emerge as the direct substrates and effectors of caspases (11Bokoch G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). For example, two antiapoptotic protein kinases, Raf-1 and Akt, are inactivated by caspase-mediated proteolytic degradation (13Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of ATM generates a kinase-inactive protein and prevents DNA repair and DNA damage signaling (14Smith G.C. di Fagagna F. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6076-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cleavage of focal adhesion kinase by caspases interrupts the assembly of the focal adhesion complex, resulting in cell death (15Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp.

By contrast, the activities of several kinases are stimulated by caspase cleavage, such as MEKK-1 (17Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M.

In each case, caspase cleavage generates a constitutively active kinase by removing inhibitory domains from the proteins. Importantly, the active fragments then act as signals propagating the apoptosis processes. Etk/Bmx (epithelial and endothelial tyrosinekinase or bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X) is a member of the Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) tyrosine kinase family (24Qiu Y. Robinson D.

Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, and LDL receptor mRNA levels and SREBP-1 and -2 protein expression were estimated in villus cell populations from duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. SREBP-1a was a minor transcript in hamster intestine, and its gene expression was not altered by changes in dietary cholesterol flux. In contrast, SREBP-1c gene expression was increased by dietary cholesterol and decreased by cholesterol depletion. mRNA levels for SREBP-2 and the other sterol-responsive genes were increased in intestines of animals on the cholesterol depletion diet but minimally suppressed if at all, by the diet enriched in cholesterol. In general, the amount of the precursor form of SREBP-1 was higher in cells of the upper villus and lower in cells of the lower villus. SREBP-2 precursor was higher in cells of the lower villus and lower in cells of the upper villus. Protein expression of precursor correlated with the location of gene expression for SREBPs. The amount of precursor mass of SREBP-2 was not altered by cholesterol feeding but was increased by cholesterol depletion. The mature form of SREBP-2 was in very low abundance and difficult to detect in intestines of animals fed control chow or cholesterol. It was readily detectable and increased in intestines of animals on the cholesterol-depletion diet. The diets did not significantly alter the amount of precursor or mature forms of SREBP-1. Cholesterol feeding had no effect on cholesterol or fatty acid synthesis, whereas synthesis of these lipids was increased in intestines of hamsters on the cholesterol-depleted diet. These results suggest that SREBP-1a has little or no role in regulating intestinal cholesterol synthesis. It is postulated that under basal conditions, SREBP-1c regulates intestinal fatty acid synthesis and SREBP-2 regulates cholesterol synthesis. Following marked changes in cholesterol flux across the intestine, SREBP-2 assumes the role of SREBP-1 and regulates both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1982461902,"One of the hallmarks of ionizing radiation exposure is the formation of clustered damage that includes closely opposed lesions. We show that the Ku70/80 complex (Ku) has a role in the repair of closely opposed lesions in DNA. DNA containing a dihydrouracil (DHU) close to an opposing single strand break was used as a model substrate. It was found that Ku has no effect on the enzymatic activity of human endonuclease III when the substrate DNA contains only DHU. However, with DNA containing a DHU that is closely opposed to a single strand break, Ku inhibited the nicking activity of human endonuclease III as well as the amount of free double strand breaks induced by the enzyme. The inhibition on the formation of a free double strand break by Ku was found to be much greater than the inhibition of human endonuclease III-nicking activity by Ku. Furthermore, there was a concomitant increase in the formation of Ku-DNA complexes when endonuclease III was present. Similar results were also observed with Escherichia coli endonuclease III. These results suggest that Ku reduces the formation of endonuclease III-induced free double strand breaks by sequestering the double strand breaks formed as a Ku-DNA complex. In doing so, Ku helps to avoid the formation of the intermediary free double strand breaks, possibly helping to reduce the mutagenic event that might result from the misjoining of frank double strand breaks.

Ionizing radiation generates a wide spectrum of DNA damages including single-stranded breaks, base lesions, abasic sites, double-stranded breaks, multiple damage sites, and DNA-protein and DNA-DNA cross-links (1Huttermann J.

The energy from low linear energy transfer-ionizing radiation is not dispersed uniformly in the absorbing medium but is dispersed along the tracks of the charge particles (3Hall E.J. Radiobiology for the Radiobiologist. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1994: 17-27Google Scholar). These nonrandom ionized tracks, consisting of “spurs” and “blobs” when traversing a DNA molecule, will generate lesions that are clustered within a small region (3Hall E.J. Radiobiology for the Radiobiologist. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1994: 17-27Google Scholar). These clustered lesions commonly referred to as multiple damage sites are the hallmarks of exposure to ionizing radiation (4Ward J.F. Radiat.

The composition of lesions within these clusters is not clear; however, they are expected to consist predominantly of a random mixture of abasic sites, base lesions, and strand breaks (6Sutherland B.M.

Recently, it was demonstrated that base lesions that are in close proximity to each other are repaired at a reduced rate as compared with isolated base lesions.

Ku70/80 complex dihydrouracil In this study, we show that Ku binds to a nick opposite of DHU, leading to an inhibition of endonuclease III activity. Furthermore, we show that the presence of Ku at the nick helps to prevent the formation of free double strand breaks by tethering the new ends generated by endonuclease III-induced cleavage. Based on these observations, we suggest that the formation of the DNA-Ku complex immediately after the enzymatic processing of the closely opposed lesion is important for channeling the double strand break directly to the end-joining reaction to avoid the possibility of aberrant recombination through the misjoining of different molecules containing double strand breaks. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon and purified by polyacrylamide gel (15%) electrophoresis as described previously (18Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol.

It is expected that incubating duplex N with endonuclease III at room temperature will generate a double strand break. Duplex L differed from duplex N only in that it lacked a nick.

Ku was purified by Dr. David Chen according to an earlier published procedure (21Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Endonuclease III was assayed in a standard reaction buffer (10 μl) containing 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 fmol of DNA substrate, and 20 fmol of endonuclease III. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 10 min (22Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8200-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of polyacrylamide gel-loading buffer (90% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heated to 90 °C for 10 min. 3–5 μl of the reaction were loaded onto a 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 2000 V for 1.5 h. The polyacrylamide gel was then dried, and the amount of endonuclease III-induced nicks was estimated by using the STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the amount of double strand breaks induced by endonuclease III, at the end of 10 min of incubation, reactions were stopped with the gel-loading buffer and then assayed with 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The double strand break assay is identical to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay described below. The binding reaction (10 μl) was performed in a standard endonuclease III reaction mixture containing 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 fmol of DNA substrate, and increasing amounts of Ku (10–300 fmol). In some reactions, 20 fmol of endonuclease III were added. After 10 min at 37 °C, 5 μl of the reaction mixtures were added to 5 μl of polyacrymide gel-loading buffer and heated to 90 °C for 10 min. The amount of endonuclease III-induced nicks was assayed as described in the previous section. The remainder (5 μl) of the binding reaction was subjected immediately to electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described below. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide at 19.76/0.24 ratio as described previously (18Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The gels were pre-electrophoresed in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.3 and 2.5 mm EDTA) at 300 V (4 °C) for 30 min. Samples were loaded onto the gel, and electrophoresis was continued at 300 V (4 °C) for an additional 150 min. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. The radioactive bands in the dried gels were quantified with the STORM PhosphorImager. Dihydrouracil, a product of the anoxic radiolysis of deoxycytidine is readily recognized by human and E. coliendonuclease III (20Ikeda S. Biswas T. Roy R. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Kurosky A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Ku in the repair of closely opposed lesions, duplex N that contained a DHU in close proximity opposite to a nick was used as a substrate for endonuclease III. Endonuclease III-induced cleavage of the DNA strand containing DHU of duplex N will generate an additional nick opposite to the pre-existing nick that is separated from each other by only three nucleotides. At room temperature, this will result in a double strand break that can be detected by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Ku is known to bind to DNA ends and nicks (23Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 299-316Google Scholar, 24Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and thus it might interfere with endonuclease III activity on duplex N. In contrast, Ku would be expected to have little or no effect on the cleavage activity of endonuclease III on duplex L. Fig. 1 shows the effect of Ku on the human endonuclease III activity on DNA duplex L in which the DHU-containing strands were labeled at their 5′ ends with32P. Ku is known to bind to only DNA ends and nicks and has not been shown to have any endonuclease activity. Fig. 1 Ashows that incubating with increasing amounts of Ku did not lead to an appreciable nicking of duplex L (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–7). A small amount of background cleavage (approximately 5–10%) was frequently observed with the DNA preparations. Because Ku does not cleave DNA-containing dihydrouracil, no detectable double strand breaks were observed in the presence of increasing amounts of Ku (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–7). Double strand break was assayed by the formation of a species migrating faster than the free DNA substrate. Double strand break formation was assayed with nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an assay that is identical to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay used for detecting the various Ku-DNA complexes. Under these electrophoresis conditions, the various Ku-DNA complexes that migrated slower than the free DNA substrate were readily observed. Incubating duplex L with human endonuclease III led to a substantial cleavage occurring at the dihydrouracil lesion (Fig. 1 B, lane 1); however, incubating endonuclease III with increasing concentrations of Ku had little or no effect on the human endonuclease activity on duplex L (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–7). Because cleavage of duplex L by human endonuclease III will only lead to a nick in a duplex DNA, no appreciable amount of double strand breaks was observed when duplex L was incubated with endonuclease III (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–7). However, when duplex N was used as a substrate, low concentrations of Ku (below 50 fmol) had little effect on the human endonuclease III activity (Fig.2 B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–4); however, at higher concentrations of Ku (above 50 fmol), the inhibition of human endonuclease III activity was observed (Fig. 2 B, compare lane 1 with lanes 5–7). At low concentrations of Ku, the observed endonucleolytic activity of human endonuclease III was also accompanied by a concomitant generation of free double strand breaks (Fig. 2 D, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–4). Since higher concentrations of Ku (above 100 fmol) were found to inhibit the nicking of duplex N, the formation of free double strand breaks was also inhibited at higher Ku concentrations.Figure 2Effect of Ku on human endonuclease III activity on duplex N. Legend is identical to that of Fig. 1, except that duplex N was used as the DNA substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Similar results were also obtained with E. coli endonuclease III with the exception that increasing concentrations of Ku appeared to have a nonspecific inhibitory effect on duplex L (Fig.3 B, lanes 1–7) and duplex N (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–7). Like the results obtained for human endonuclease III, increasing concentrations of Ku did not lead to an appreciable production of double strand breaks with duplex L (Fig. 3 D). As expected, increasing Ku concentrations led to an increased inhibition of double strand breaks formation induced by E. coli endonuclease III (Fig. 4 D).Figure 4Effect of Ku on E. coliendonuclease III activity on duplex N. Legend is identical to that of Fig. 1, except that human endonuclease III was replaced with E. coli endonuclease III on duplex N.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The gel data presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 are qualitative. To obtain quantitative analysis of these observations, these experiments were repeated three times, and the amount of endonuclease III-induced nicks and double strand breaks was quantified using a PhosphorImager. The average amount of nicks or double strand breaks generated by endonuclease III was plotted against the amount of Ku present during the reactions. Fig. 5 A shows that increasing concentrations of Ku had no effect on the human endonuclease III activity on duplex L, even at 15-fold molar excess (300 fmol) over human endonuclease III. Similarly, low concentrations of Ku (below 50 fmol) did not affect the human endonuclease III activity appreciably on duplex N (Fig. 5 B); however, at higher concentrations of Ku (above 50 fmol), the inhibition of human endonuclease III activity was observed (Fig. 5 B). It is important to point out that at low concentrations of Ku, the observed human endonuclease III activity on duplex N was paralleled by the formation of free double strand breaks induced by endonuclease III; however, at higher concentrations of Ku, the formation of free double strand breaks was inhibited to a greater extent than the production of nicks by human endonuclease III (Fig. 5 B). At 100 fmol of Ku (5-fold molar excess of Ku70/80 over endonuclease III), human endonuclease III-nicking activity was inhibited by ∼20%; however, at the same concentration, the formation of free double strand breaks was inhibited by >75%. The discrepancy observed between the amount of human endonuclease III-induced nicks and free double strand breaks suggests that in the presence of Ku, a substantial amount of the double strand breaks induced by human endonuclease III did not result in free double strand breaks but was sequestered and held together by Ku as a DNA-Ku complex. Similar results were also obtained with E. coli endonuclease III with the exception that Ku appeared to have a weak nonspecific inhibitory effect (Fig. 5 C). At higher concentrations of Ku,E. coli endonuclease III activity was inhibited ∼30% for both substrates duplexes L and N (Fig. 5 C). Similar to the results obtained for human endonuclease III, the increasing concentrations of Ku led to a much greater inhibition of the amount of free double strand breaks formed as compared with the amount of nicks generated by E. coli endonuclease III (Fig.5 D). Fig. 5 show that the amount of free double strand breaks did not correspond to the actual amount of nicks induced by human and E. coli endonucleases III in duplex N, suggesting that most of the double strand breaks were sequestered and bridged by Ku as DNA-protein complexes. Under nondenaturing conditions, it is clear that Ku forms various complexes with both duplexes N and L (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Cand D). These DNA-Ku complexes were observed as slower migrating species than the substrate DNA. It is known that Ku will bind to the termini of a double-stranded DNA as a DNA-protein complex. In addition, Ku can translocate along the DNA (25de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), allowing additional Ku molecules to bind to the free DNA ends. As a result, Ku binds to a double-stranded DNA like beads on a string and generates multimeric Ku-DNA protein complexes. With Ku covering a 20–25-nucleotide footprint, it is likely that a 56-mer duplex DNA can interact with Ku, generating complexes containing 1, 2, or 3 Ku proteins (25de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,26Frit P. Calsou P. Chen D.J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because endonuclease III reactions were performed at 37 °C, the binding assays were also performed at 37 °C. In the absence of endonuclease III incubating duplex oligonucleotides with Ku, three major slow migrating bands (complexes I, II, and III) were observed (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, C and D, arrows marked I, II, and III). It is interesting to note that at 37 °C and at Ku protein concentrations below 50 fmol, little or no stable binding of the Ku complex to duplex oligonucleotides was observed (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, C, lanes). However, when binding reactions were performed at 20 °C, the formation of complexes I and II can be readily observed even at 10 fmol of Ku (1:1 Ku/DNA ratio, data not shown). Similarly, the incubating duplex oligonucleotides with endonuclease III and increasing concentrations of Ku also generated three DNA-Ku complexes (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, D). To have a quantitative estimate on the interactions of Ku with duplexes N and L, each of the radioactive bands corresponding to the various forms of Ku-DNA complexes was quantified using a PhosphorImager and plotted as a function of Ku concentrations. Fig. 6 shows that when duplex L was used as a DNA substrate, little or no stable binding of Ku to DNA was observed at Ku concentrations below 50 fmol. At 300 fmol of Ku, ∼30% of the DNA was bound with two molecules of Ku (complex II), presumably one at each end of the DNA. A smaller amount of complex I was observed. It is interesting to note that under the reaction conditions used, the amount of complex II formed was higher than the amount of complex I. Because duplex N is 56 nucleotides long, it is possible that the binding of more Ku molecules to the DNA might promote interactions among the Ku molecules, leading to increased stability for the DNA-Ku complex II as compared with DNA-Ku complex I. Only a small amount of complex III was formed even at concentrations above 200 fmol. In the presence of human endonuclease III (Fig. 6 B), the interaction of Ku with the DNA substrate led to an appreciable increase in complex II, and as much as 50% of labeled DNA was bound as complex II. A similar increase in the level of complex II was also observed with E. coli endonuclease III (Fig. 6 C). It is possible that the binding of endonuclease III at the nick (generated by the action of endonuclease III) or DHU lesion helps to stabilize complex II, thus leading to an apparent increase in the amount of complex II when endonuclease III is present. However, the levels of complexes II and I were less affected by the presence of either human or E. coli endonuclease III (Fig. 6, B andC). In the absence of endonuclease III, the binding of Ku to duplex N was similar to that observed for duplex L. No appreciable stable binding of Ku to duplex N was observed at concentrations below 50 fmol. Three species of Ku-DNA complex were observed at higher concentrations of Ku (data not shown). The formation of form I and II complexes was readily observed, whereas the form III complex was only observed at relatively high concentrations of Ku. Similarly, incubating duplex N with human endonuclease III and increasing the amounts of Ku led to a significant increase in the formation of complex II and a slight increase in that of complex I (data not shown) while substantially inhibiting the formation of free double strand breaks. The parallel between the formation of complex II and the reduction in the number of free double strand suggests that the double strand breaks formed were sequestered by Ku and migrated as DNA-protein complexes. Similar results were also observed with E. coli endonuclease III (data not shown). It was shown earlier that base excision repair enzymes, such as endonucleases III and VIII and formamidopyrimidine-N-glycosylase, can efficiently remove 1 of 2 closely opposed base lesions (8Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and produce a nick close to the remaining lesion on the opposite strand. The removal of the remaining base lesion is thereby inhibited. This inhibition was thought to be important to reduce the possibility of generating free double strand breaks by these repair enzymes. However, prolonged incubation or the use of excess amounts of these N-glycosylases can eventually convert all closely opposed lesions in DNA to frank double strand breaks. In humans, double strand breaks are primarily repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining pathway involving Ku (13Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis .

A. 1996; 93: 10285-10290Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although free double strand breaks are repaired readily in mammalian cells, it is nevertheless desirable to avoid this formation to reduce the frequency of misjoining, which might result in translocation mutagenesis. In the processing of closely opposed base lesions, a nick is generated in close proximity opposite to the remaining base lesion. We showed that Ku binds to duplex N and inhibits endonuclease III activity on DHU lesion opposite to a nick, suggesting that Ku might have a role in modulating the repair of closely opposed base lesions. It has been estimated that a human cell has as many as 500,000 molecules of Ku (24Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the abundant Ku is always in excess over endonuclease III and other repair N-glycosylases. Our results suggest that in vivo Ku will inhibit the action of endonuclease III on a lesion opposite to a nick. It is also interesting to point out that Ku was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of nucleotide excision repair proteins to a linear DNA (27Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that the binding of Ku to the nicked DNA will either help to recruit DNA polymerase and ligase to the nick or provide extended time for these enzymes to repair the intermediary nick. A model for the role of Ku in the mediation of repair of the closely opposing lesion is depicted in Fig. 7. It has been shown that the binding of Ku to a nick does not inhibit the ligation reaction catalyzed by either DNA ligase II or III. In fact, the binding of Ku enhances these reactions (14Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recently, Ku-DNA complex was shown to recruit DNA ligase IV and also interact directly with the human DNA ligase IV (29Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the binding of Ku to a nick will affect the rate of repair synthesis by DNA polymerase. Once the nick is repaired, Ku should dissociate from the DNA, allowing further excision of the remaining base lesion by human endonuclease III. However, if the removal of the remaining lesion occurs before all the nicks are repaired, any double strand DNA breaks generated will be sequestered by Ku and channeled directly into the end-joining repair pathway. In that case, no intermediary free double strand breaks are formed, reducing the possibility of the misjoining of DNA ends. We thank Dr. Bernard Weiss for critical reading of the manuscript."

These data strongly suggest that induction of Par-4 is an important and necessary event in the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's presenilin-1 mutations and is very likely involved in the abnormal processing of APP during the apoptotic process. To provide better solutions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is very important to reconcile amyloid/apoptosis hypotheses of AD and examine how Par-4 might alter APP processing during apoptosis, leading to increased production of the neurotoxic Aβ 1–42. The cell types responsible for overproduction of Aβ 1–42 are not completely known, although it has been suggested that Aβ 1–42 is produced by human central nervous system neurons from APP695 (1Greenfield J.P.

Human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells have many features that resemble human neurons in the central nervous system (21Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Neill D. Hughes D. Edwardson J.A. Rima B.K. Allsop D. J. Neurosci.

Importantly, compared with many other human neuronal cell lines, IMR-32 cells have been shown to be able to synthesize a large amount of endogenous APP751 and APP695 and secrete a significant amount Aβ 1–42 together with Aβ 1–40 (21Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Neill D. Hughes D. Edwardson J.A. Rima B.K. Allsop D. J. Neurosci.

Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Neill D. Hughes D. Edwardson J.A. Rima B.K. Allsop D. J. Neurosci.

Lett. 1999; 273: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that IMR-32 cells may provide a unique system to examine the possible role of Par-4 in APP processing. We report in this study that overexpression Par-4 increases secretion of Aβ 1–42 from IMR-32 cells after trophic factor withdrawal by a mechanism involving interaction of Par-4 with other proteins via the leucine zipper domain. In addition, we provide evidence showing that the increase in secretion of Aβ 1–42 induced by Par-4 is a caspase-dependent event and occurs when apoptotic cascades are initiated. Human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. To express the full-length Par-4 in IMR-32 cells, we subcloned a full-length Par-4 cDNA into the expression vector pRc/CMV, yielding a recombinant construct pCMV-Par4, in which the expression of the transgene was driven by enhancer-promoter sequences from the immediate early gene of the human cytomegalovirus. This construct encodes a 1.2-kilobase RNA species and a full-length 38-kDa Par-4 protein. To address the role of the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 in IMR-32 cells, we subcloned the cDNA of the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 into the pREP4 expression vector, where the expression of the transgene is under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter. pREP-Leu.zip encodes an ∼400-base pair RNA species and the ∼10-kDa leucine zipper domain of Par-4 protein. IMR-32 cells were transfected with pCMV-Par4 or pREP-Leu.zip or co-transfected with pCMV-Par4 and pREP-Leu.zip using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and stable transfectants were selected for 4 weeks using G418 (for pCMV-Par4-transfected cells) and/or hygromycin (for pREP-Leu.zip-transfected cells). Overexpression of Par-4 and/or Leu.zip in IMR-32 cells did not significantly affect the viability of these cells under basal conditions. Selected clones of transfected cells were maintained in the culture medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml; for pCMV-Par4-transfected cells) or hygromycin (400 μg/ml; for pREP-Leu.zip-transfected cells) or both for co-transfected cells. For control purposes, parallel cultures of IMR-32 cells were stably transfected with the pRc/CMV and pREP4 vectors alone. After the cells became confluent in the culture flasks, the culture medium was replaced with fresh media, and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C to condition the medium for Aβ measurement. Trophic factor withdrawal was initiated by washing cultures four times with Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) with subsequent incubation in 1 ml of Locke's buffer. Levels of Par-4 in cultured IMR-32 cells were determined by Western blot analysis as described in our previous studies (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Western blot images were acquired and quantified using Kodak Image Station 440 CF and Kodak Digital Science 1D 3.0.2. software. Generation and characterization of the affinity-purified anti-Par-4 antibody have been described previously (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The total amount of cellular APP in various transfected cell lines was measured by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (22C11; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) that recognizes the N terminus of human APP. Equal loading was verified by probing with the anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 levels in the conditioned media were measured using a fluorescence-based sandwich ELISA described previously (19Guo Q. Sebastian L. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Glazner G.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The C-terminal-specific sandwich ELISAs use a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal region of human Aβ and two other antibodies specific for Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 (BIOSOURCE). Conditioned culture media were collected and subjected to the sandwich ELISAs according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard curves were generated using lyophilized synthetic human Aβ 40 and human Aβ 42 standards. The standard Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides were chemically modified by the manufacturer to reduce aggregation of the peptides. Parallelism between the standard Aβ peptides used in this study and the native Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides in terms of their immunoreactivity and reliability in the ELISA has been well characterized by the manufacturer. The specificity and sensitivity of the ELISAs have also been characterized by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was quantified with a fluorescence plate reader with excitation at 460 nm and emission at 560 nm. Because absolute values of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 secreted by IMR-32 cells under basal culture conditions showed some variability among and even within cell lines, the ratio (percentage) of Aβ 1–42 to the total amount of Aβ (Aβ 1–40 plus Aβ 1–42), which remains statistically consistent under basal culture conditions among the various cell lines, was used to measure the changes in the relative amount of Aβ 1–42 secreted from transfected IMR-32 cells. Apoptosis was quantified in cultures stained with the fluorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 as described previously (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Hoescht 33342-stained cells were visualized and photographed under epifluorescence illumination (340 nm excitation and 510 nm barrier filter) using a ×40 oil immersion objective (200 cells per culture were counted, and counts were made in at least six separate cultures per treatment condition). Samples were analyzed without knowledge of the treatment history of the cultures. Levels of caspase-3 activity were quantified using a method that employed DEVD, a pseudosubstrate and inhibitor of caspase-3 (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were incubated for 20 min in the presence of 0.02% digitonin plus 10 μg/ml biotinylated DEVD-CHO (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (2 ml/wash), and fixed for 30 min in a cold solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by a 30-min incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg/ml Oregon Green-streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal images of cellular fluorescence (corresponding to conjugates of activated caspase-3 with DEVD-biotin) were acquired (488 nm excitation and 510 nm emission). All images were acquired using the same laser intensity, offset, and electronic gain to allow quantitative comparisons of relative levels of fluorescence in cells. The average pixel intensity/cell body was determined using Fluoview 2.0 software. To establish the role of Par-4 in Aβ secretion and its possible relationship to apoptotic cell death and to address the ability of the leucine zipper domain to mediate Par-4 actions in neural cells, we generated IMR-32 cell lines overexpressing full-length Par-4, Leu.zip alone, or a combination of full-length Par-4 and Leu.zip. In previous studies, we established that the leucine zipper domain fragment of Par-4 acts as a dominant negative regulator of Par-4 activity when expressed in neural cells, possibly by competitively abrogating the binding of Par-4 to other proteins (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). On Western blots, the Par-4 polyclonal antibody recognized full-length Par-4 (38 kDa) and Leu.zip (10 kDa) (Fig.1). We chose for study two to three clones of each of the cells overexpressing full-length Par-4, Leu.zip, and Par-4+Leu.zip, based on their similar levels of expression of Par-4 and/or Leu.zip (Fig. 1). Western blot analyses showed that levels of full-length Par-4 protein were ∼8-fold higher in cell lines transfected with Par-4 cDNA compared with untransfected, vector-transfected, and Leu.zip-transfected cell lines. Bands of the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 were clearly identified in cells transfected or co-transfected with Leu.zip cDNA. Note that overexpression of Par-4 and/or Leu.zip did not significantly affect the levels of the endogenously expressed APP in the various cell lines used in this study. Overexpression of Par-4 did not result in a significant increase in spontaneous apoptosis in IMR-32 cells. To examine whether overexpression of Par-4 and/or Leu.zip alters Aβ secretion from IMR-32 cells under basal conditions, levels of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 in the conditioned media of various cell lines were measured using a highly sensitive fluorescence-based sandwich ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned culture media of wild type and vector-transfected control IMR-32 cells were about 11–12%. Overexpression of Par-4, overexpression of Leu.zip, or co-expression of Par-4 and Leu.zip did not result in significant changes in the values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned culture media of various transfected IMR-32 cell lines, indicating that Par-4 does not alter APP processing under basal culture conditions. Because Par-4 increases the vulnerability of neuronal cells to apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal and Aβ (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and because APP has been reported to be processed in neuronal cells during apoptosis by some cell death proteases (12LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Reinhard F.B. Schuckert O. Evin G. Masters C.L. J. Biol.

Time course analyses of secretion of Aβ peptides in IMR-32 cells showed that values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in untransfected and vector-transfected control cells and in cells overexpressing Leu.zip remained statistically unchanged for up to 8 h after trophic factor withdrawal. This indicates that trophic factor withdrawal itself is not sufficient to induce a significant increase in secretion of Aβ 1–42 in IMR-32 cells (Fig.3). However, overexpression of Par-4 drastically increased the Aβ1–42/Aβtotalratio in the conditioned media about 6–8 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3). Consistent with a dominant negative mode of action of Leu.zip involving protein-protein interactions, co-overexpression of Leu.zip completely abolished the adverse effect of Par-4 on Aβ secretion, indicating that actions of Par-4 in Aβ secretion require its interaction with other protein(s) via the leucine zipper domain (Fig. 3).Figure 3Par-4 significantly increases secretion of Aβ 1–42 from transfected IMR-32 cells after trophic factor withdrawal: complete blockade by co-overexpression of Leu.zip. Cultures of the indicated clones of transfected IMR-32 cells were deprived of trophic support for the indicated time periods, and values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned culture media of transfected IMR-32 cells were measured by sandwich ELISAs. Note that the values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in untransfected and vector-transfected control cells and in cells overexpressing Leu.zip remained statistically unchanged after trophic factor withdrawal. However, overexpression of Par-4 drastically increased the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned media. This effect of Par-4 was not observed until ∼6 h after trophic factor withdrawal.

ANOVA was performed with Scheffe's post hoc tests.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that Par-4 increases Aβ 1–42 secretion by initiating early apoptotic cascades, we performed additional experiments to examine whether Par-4 increases the vulnerability of IMR-32 cells to apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal. Fig. 4 shows the impact of overexpression of Par-4 on apoptosis of IMR-32 cells. Each of the cell lines was deprived of trophic support for up to 48 h, and cells with apoptotic nuclei were counted. Basal levels of apoptosis ranged from 2–5% among the various cell lines. Forty-eight h after trophic factor withdrawal, apoptosis was found in 33–42% of the control cell lines and in cells overexpressing Leu.zip. Levels of trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis were significantly increased to about 74% in cells overexpressing Par-4. Co-overexpression of Leu.zip completely blocked trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis and the pro-apoptotic actions of Par-4. These results clearly demonstrate that Par-4 does promote apoptosis in IMR-32 cells after trophic factor withdrawal. Because cysteine proteases of the caspase family have a prominent role in apoptosis, we examined the levels of caspase-3 activity and determined whether Par-4 played a role in caspase activation in IMR-32 cells after trophic factor withdrawal. As shown in Fig. 5, trophic factor withdrawal-induced caspase activation was exacerbated in cells overexpressing Par-4, and Leu.zip suppressed caspase activation induced by Par-4, indicating an important role for Par-4 in IMR-32 cells in the early period of the apoptotic cascades before caspase activation. To determine whether the exacerbated caspase activation was responsible for the increase in Aβ 1–42 secretion after trophic factor withdrawal, we examined whether the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor BD-fmk could block the Par-4-induced increase in Aβ 1–42 secreted by IMR-32 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the Par-4-induced increase in secretion of Aβ 1–42 after trophic factor withdrawal was significantly attenuated by inhibition of caspase activation. Thus, 8 h after trophic factor withdrawal, the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned medium of cells overexpressing Par-4 was reduced from 57% without BD-fmk treatment to 23% with BD-fmk treatment. These results strongly suggest that Par-4 increases secretion of Aβ 1–42 largely through a caspase-dependent pathway.Figure 5Early and exacerbated activation of caspase activity in cells overexpressing Par-4 after trophic factor withdrawal. Cultures of the indicated clones of transfected IMR-32 cells were deprived of trophic support for the indicated time periods, and levels of cellular DEVD fluorescence, a measure of caspase-3 activity, were quantified. Note that trophic factor withdrawal-induced caspase activation was significantly exacerbated in cells overexpressing Par-4 as early as 2 h after trophic factor withdrawal. Co-overexpression of Leu.zip completely blocked the effect of Par-4 on caspase activation.

Parallel cultures were prepared and deprived of trophic support for 8 h without BD-fmk pretreatment. Values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned culture media of transfected IMR-32 cells were measured by sandwich ELISAs.

Notably, overexpression of Par-4 and/or Leu.zip did not significantly affect the levels of the endogenously expressed APP in the various cell lines used in this study. We found that Par-4 increases secretion of Aβ 1–42 from IMR-32 cells after trophic factor withdrawal. We further addressed some key questions about the mechanisms by which Par-4 causes the observed increase in Aβ 1–42 production. We found that Par-4 induced an early and exacerbated activation of caspase-3 activity that preceded the increase in Aβ 1–42 secreted by IMR-32 cells. Inhibition of caspase activity by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor BD-fmk significantly attenuated the Par-4-induced increase in Aβ 1–42 production. These results strongly suggest that Par-4 is a novel mediator of aberrant APP processing and that Par-4 increases secretion of Aβ 1–42 largely through a caspase-dependent pathway after apoptotic cascades are initiated. Overexpression of Par-4 did not result in a significant increase in spontaneous apoptosis in IMR-32 cells, indicating that Par-4 overexpression alone is not sufficient to induce apoptosis. These findings are consistent with those of our previous study of cultured prostate tumor cells and PC12 cells, in which overexpression of Par-4 in transiently or stably transfected cells did not induce apoptosis (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 17Guo Q. Xie J. Du H. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Par-4 or Leu.zip or co-expression of Par-4 and Leu.zip did not result in significant changes in the values of the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned medium of various transfected IMR-32 cell lines under basal culture conditions. This result is in sharp contrast to the reported effect of mutant presenilins, where secretion of Aβ 1–42 from human as well as rodent neural cells was significantly increased by overexpression of mutant presenilins even under basal culture conditions (1Greenfield J.P. Gross R.S. Gouras G.K. Xu H. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D72-D83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hardy J.

Most importantly, however, overexpression of Par-4 drastically increased the Aβ1–42/Aβtotal ratio in the conditioned media about 6–8 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3), indicating that Par-4 may have a significant impact on APP processing under apoptotic conditions. It is noteworthy that the Par-4-induced increase in Aβ 1–42 secretion did not occur until 6–8 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3). This is the time when most IMR-32 cells overexpressing Par-4 were still alive and morphologically well preserved, but the apoptotic process should have been irreversibly triggered in most of the cells after trophic factor withdrawal. Time course analysis of caspase activation demonstrated that exacerbated caspase activation induced by Par-4 in IMR-32 cells was apparent as early as 2 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 5), indicating that Par-4 increases secretion of Aβ 1–42 after initiation of apoptotic cascades. To determine whether the exacerbated caspase activation was responsible for the increase in Aβ 1–42 secretion after trophic factor withdrawal, we examined whether the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor BD-fmk could block the Par-4-induced increase in Aβ 1–42 secreted by IMR-32 cells. Our results clearly demonstrated that the Par-4-induced increase in secretion of Aβ 1–42 is largely a caspase-dependent event. The effects of Par-4 on secretion of Aβ 1–42 were consistently blocked by co-expression of the dominant negative regulator of Par-4 activity, the leucine zipper domain. The results demonstrate that the actions of Par-4 on APP processing, like its actions in apoptotic pathway (16Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), require its interaction with other proteins via the leucine zipper domain. The proteins that interact with Par-4 and regulate (directly or indirectly) APP processing are unknown. However, recent study showed that Par-4 interacts with the regulatory domains of the ζ and λ forms of protein kinase C and inhibits their enzyme activity (24Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The possible implications of these interactions in APP processing need to be examined carefully because several studies have indicated that protein kinase C-dependent pathways might participate in regulation of APP processing (25Rossner S.

The data provided in this study reconcile the amyloid/apoptosis hypotheses of AD and suggest that abnormal processing of APP and increased production of Aβ 1–42 may occur as a result of initiation and execution of apoptotic cascades, such as aberrant induction of Par-4 expression and activation of caspases after trophic factor withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W2128605269,"The sst2 somatostatin receptor is an inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor, which exhibits anti-tumor properties. Expression of sst2 is lost in most human pancreatic cancers. We have cloned 2090 base pairs corresponding to the genomic DNA region upstream of the mouse sst2 (msst2) translation initiation codon (ATG). Deletion reporter analyses in mouse pituitary AtT-20 and human pancreatic cancer PANC-1, BxPC-3, and Capan-1 cells identify a region from nucleotide −260 to the ATG codon (325 base pairs) showing maximal activity, and a region between nucleotides −2025 and −260 likely to comprise silencer or transcriptional suppressor elements. In PANC-1 and AtT-20 cells, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β up-regulates msst2 transcription. Transactivation is mediated by Smad4 and Smad3. The cis-acting region responsible for such regulation is comprised between nucleotides −1115 and −972 and includes Sp1 and CAGA-box sequences. Expression of Smad4 in Smad4-deficient Capan-1 and BxPC-3 cells restores TGF-β-dependent and -independent msst2transactivation. Expression of Smad4 in BxPC-3 cells reestablishes both endogenous sst2 expression and somatostatin-mediated inhibition of cell growth. These findings demonstrate that msst2 is a new target gene for TGF-β transcription regulation and underlie the possibility that loss of Smad4 contributes to the lack of sst2 expression in human pancreatic cancer, which in turn may contribute to a stimulation of tumor growth.

Among the wide spectrum of biological functions exerted by the ubiquitous regulatory neurohormone somatostatin, its action as an inhibitor of cell proliferation and endocrine and exocrine secretory processes, together with its immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties have lately raised great interest in cancer research. Cellular mechanisms that are induced by somatostatin include inhibition of adenylate cyclase, modulation of K+ and Ca2+channels, and protein dephosphorylation. The biological effects of somatostatin are mediated through its specific binding to a family of G protein-coupled receptors (ssts)1 encoded by five different genes (sst1-sst5) (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 2Epelbaum J. Dournaud P. Fodor M. Viollet C. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 25-44PubMed Google Scholar).Studies with CHO cells expressing each sst subtype reveal a predominant role of sst2 in mediating the antiproliferative effect of somatostatin analogs (3Buscail L. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, sst2 induces transient association and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which in turn, associates with and dephosphorylates activated insulin receptor and its substrates leading to inhibition of the insulin mitogenic signal (4Lopez F. Esteve J.P. Buscail L. Delesque N. Saint-Laurent N. Theveniau M. Nahmias C. Vaysse N. Susini C. J. Biol.

Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that sst2 expression disappears in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and their metastases and is also absent in most human pancreatic adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines (6Buscail L. Saint-Laurent N. Chastre E. Vaillant J.C. Gespach C. Capella G. Kalthoff H. Lluis F. Vaysse N. Susini C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1823-1827PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism responsible for this loss is currently unknown. In non-sst2-expressing human pancreatic cancer cells BxPC-3 and Capan-1, heterologous expression of sst2 triggers an increase in somatostatin expression and secretion that induces an autocrine inhibition of cell proliferation (7Delesque N. Buscail L. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Muller C. Weckbecker G. Bruns C. Vaysse N. Susini C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 956-962PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of sst2 reverses the malignant properties of these cells and induces an anti-tumor bystander effect highlighting the tumor suppressor properties and the potential therapeutic interest of sst2 in pancreatic cancer (7Delesque N.

Human Gene Therap. 1999; 10: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In recent years, considerable effort has been directed at understanding the molecular alterations that occur in pancreatic carcinoma. The loss of negative growth constraints as a result of dysregulation in TGF-β-dependent pathways may significantly contribute to the malignancy of this tumor type (9Korc M. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1998; 7: 25-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII) heterodimerizes with and phosphorylates type I TGF-β receptor, which in turn initiates signaling by phosphorylating intracellular targets, the most important of which are Smad proteins (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 11Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 leads to heterodimerization with Smad4 and translocation of the hetero-oligomeric complex into the nucleus, where it affects transcription of specific genes by either binding directly to DNA or by complex formation with other components (11Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Smad4, also known asDPC4 is mutated or deleted in ∼50% of pancreatic cancers (12Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar), and it has been clearly established that Smad4 mutations interfere with the signaling pathway that mediates TGF-β−induced growth suppression in pancreatic cancer cells (13Grau A.M. Zhang L. Wang W. Ruan S. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Zhang W. Chiao P.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3929-3934PubMed Google Scholar). However, until now, very few Smad4-regulated genes have been identified. They include plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (14Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

Woltje M. Schonwetter N. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The authors identified two short exons separated by introns larger than 25 kbp located upstream from the first coding exon, and three tissue and cell specific promoters located each at the 5′ border to the referred exons. In addition, sequence information corresponding to a 3.8 kbp region upstream from the hsst2 start codon (20Greenwood M.T. Robertson L.-A. Patel Y.C. Gene. 1995; 159: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and a novel initiator element (SSTR2inr) (21Pscherer A. Dorflinger U. Kirfel J. Gawlas K. Ruschoff J. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6680-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have recently been reported. Whereas several studies have pointed out important modulators of sst2 expression, very little information concerning the potential involvement of transcriptional mechanisms has been brought up. Thus, growth factors, somatostatin, glucocorticoids, and estrogens have been demonstrated to regulate sst2 mRNA expression levels (22Vidal C. Rauly I. Zeggari M. Delesque N. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Vaysse N. Susini C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bruno J.F. Xu Y. Berelowitz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bruno J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Given the tumor suppressor properties displayed by sst2, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying its transcriptional regulation is of great interest. The aims of this work were: (1) to describe a novel msst2 promoter sequence and to identify potentially relevant transcriptional regulatory elements, (2) to characterize the transcriptional activity of 5′ deleted promoter fragments in different cellular contexts, and (3) in view of the critical role of TGF-β transduction pathways in the negative control of cell growth, to explore the possibility that TGF-β and associated signaling molecules Smad3 and Smad4 contribute to the transcriptional regulation of msst2.DISCUSSIONThis work provides novel information on the msst2somatostatin receptor promoter sequence and functional organization. Promoter sequence-based analysis has further enabled the identification of potentially important regulatory regions. Moreover, we demonstrate that msst2 is transcriptionally induced by TGF-β and identify the region that includes the cis-acting element(s) required for this up-regulation. In addition, we provide evidence that the tumor suppressor Smad4 (DPC4) plays a central role in TGF-β-dependent msst2 transcriptional induction. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of Smad4 is sufficient to restore sst2 expression and re-establish somatostatin-induced growth inhibition in Smad4-deficient human pancreatic cancer cells, which lack endogenous sst2 receptors.The cloning and sequencing of 2090 nucleotides upstream of themsst2 start codon has allowed the identification of sequences of potential regulatory interest as they may participate in both constitutive and induced sst2 promoter activities. Thus, the presence of a Sp1 and a USF/MLTF site suggests the possibility of a cell cycle-dependent regulation of msst2 (38Lania L. Mallejo B. de Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 39Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In addition, the presence of the consensus sequence for TEF, a member of the leucine zipper transcription factor family that exhibits thyrotroph-restricted expression during embryogenesis (40Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and for the adult pituitary restricted factor Pit-1/GHF-1, may suggest an important role for sst2 during embryonic development and maintenance of a differentiated phenotype of pituitaries (41Castrillo J.M. Theill L.E. Karin M. Science. 1991; 253: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cis-acting elements such as C/EBP and H-APF-1, known to mediate transcriptional activation of acute phase response genes in response to diverse cytokines (42Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) might be involved in msst2 transcriptional activation by proinflammatory cytokines (43Takeba Y. Suzuki N. Takeno M. Asai T. Tsuboi S. Hoshino T. Sakane T. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 2128-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, the presence of a cluster of three half-sites of the consensus ERE could be related to the reported estrogen-dependent sst2 up-regulation (24Xu Y. Berelowitz M. Bruno J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5070-5075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Reporter assays performed in mouse pituitary AtT-20 and human pancreatic cancer PANC-1, BxPC-3, and Capan-1 cells reveal that themsst2 promoter is organized in distinct functional regulatory regions. A proximal region comprising 325 nucleotides upstream of the ATG includes the minimal promoter and displays maximal transcriptional activity. Because a consensus AP1 site is located within this region, members of the c-Jun and c-Fos transcription factor family might account for some of the activity observed. A distal region consisting of the following upstream ∼1700 nt is likely to comprise silencers or transcriptional repressor elements, because transcriptional activity of reporter constructs comprising different 5′ length tracts of this region decreases as the length of the 5′-end portion increases. Despite differences in basal transcription levels, reporter assays performed with analogous regions of thehsst2 promoter and cell lines of breast and neuronal origin reveal a similar activity profile (21Pscherer A. Dorflinger U. Kirfel J. Gawlas K. Ruschoff J. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6680-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Xu Y. Berelowitz M. Bruno J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This result, together with the following additional features shared by hsst2 and msst2: (i) high sequence homology within the ∼120 nucleotides upstream from their corresponding ATG start site, including the hsst2 initiator element (SSTR2inr, Refs. 20Greenwood M.T. Robertson L.-A. Patel Y.C. Gene. 1995; 159: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Xu Y. Berelowitz M. Bruno J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), (ii) transcriptional start site position and splicing acceptor site consensus sequence found to be functional in msst2 (19Kraus J. Woltje M. Schonwetter N. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and (iii) additional stretches of significant sequence homology, would suggest that both promoters have similar functional organization and might share regulatory features.A growing body of evidence indicates that loss of responsiveness to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β may enhance the ability of tumor cells to invade surrounding tissue structures during malignant progression through stimulation of angiogenesis, immunosupression, and synthesis of extracellular matrix. In pancreatic cancer, a defect in TGF-β signaling appears to be crucial to the aggressiveness and growth advantage of this tumor type (44Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M. Lopez M.E. Kobrin M.S. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 45Wagner M. Kleeff J. Lopez M.E. Bockman I. Massaque J. Korc M. Int. J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative TGF-βRII mutant in several targeted epithelial tissues, reveal increased proliferation and severe perturbed differentiation restricted to pancreatic acinar cells (48Bottinger E.P. Jakubczak J.L. Roberts I.S. Mumy M. Hemmati P. Bagnall K. Merlino G. Wakefield L.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2621-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Additionally, somatic inactivation of the tumor suppressor Smad4, whether as a result of homozygous deletion or mutation, has been observed in ∼50% of human pancreatic carcinomas (11Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Finally, a correlation between the lack of Smad4 activity and unresponsiveness to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition has been established in a number of human pancreatic cancer cell lines (12Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar).The present work demonstrates the transcriptional activation ofmsst2 by TGF-β. Indeed, assays carried out in AtT-20 and PANC-1 cells reveal a 2-fold increase of Luc12 construct transcription levels after treatment with TGF-β. Analogous discrete TGF-β-mediated transactivation has been reported for other reporter gene constructs (17Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 49De Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B.

Therefore, msst2 is recognized as the first G-protein-coupled receptor-encoding gene transcriptionally up-regulated by TGF-β. On the other hand, we provide evidence that Smad4 plays a crucial role in this activation. Overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant Smad4-(1–514) in PANC-1 cells abrogates TGF-β-dependent msst2 promoter activation. Moreover, whereas transient expression of Luc12 construct in human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 and Capan-1 cells, which lack Smad4 expression, results in lack of TGF-β induction; restoration of Smad4 expression reestablishes TGF-β-mediated msst2 promoter induction to a level comparable with that observed in PANC-1 cells containing functional Smad4. These results underscore a central role for Smad4 in msst2 up-regulation. In addition, our results suggest that Smad3 alone does not activate transcription but acts in concert with Smad4 to induce TGF-β-independent msst2 transcription. This is in agreement with the required cooperation of both Smad proteins in a heteromeric complex and their capacity to act as ligand-independent activators when transiently overexpressed (36Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 52Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the msst2 promoter by Smad4 in the absence of Smad3 and/or TGF-β in BxPC3 cells and not in Capan 1 cells could reflect a different expression level of endogenous Smad3 molecules in these cells as reported for other cell types (53Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, for a given cell line, transcriptional activation of Luc12 construct reaches similar maximal levels in each of the referred situations. This might suggest that the response is at a saturating level and/or that other nuclear factors are required for greater induction. Supporting the former hypothesis would be the enhanced expression of TGF-β isoforms in several human pancreatic cancer cell lines (54Friess H. Yamanaka Y. Buchler M. Ebert M. Beger H.G. Gold L.I. Korc M. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 846-856Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar).Recent evidence indicates that Smad3 and Smad4 can directly bind to specific DNA sequences in either artificial or natural TGF-β-inducible promoters and thus activate gene transcription. To date, such sequences (CAGA-box) have been identified in the promoter of the human PAI-1 and PDGF-B genes (33Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether direct binding of Smad proteins to these closely related DNA sequences is sufficient to confer maximal TGF-β-induced transcription. It is interesting that Sp1 binding activity has been attributed to TGF-β responsive elements identified in the promoter of p15INK4B (56Li J.M. Nichols M.A. Chandrasekharan S. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. J.

Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3738-6733Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of themsst2 promoter reveals that the region between nt −1115 and −972 is required for msst2 TGF-β-dependent up-regulation. Furthermore, this region functions as an enhancer in the context of a heterologous promoter. It is tempting to propose the neighboring Sp1 site and CAGA-box like sequence identified in this region (nt −1009 to −999 and −986 to-978, respectively) as the cis-acting elements responsible for the transcriptional activation induced by TGF-β.In addition, our results demonstrate that overexpression of Smad4 in human Smad4-deficient BxPC-3 cells devoid of endogenous sst2, restores both endogenous expression of functional sst2 receptors as demonstrated by mRNA, immunoblotting and binding studies, and somatostatin-induced cell growth inhibition. This suggests that Smad4 can activate the human sst2 promoter in pancreatic cells. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that Sp1 and CAGA-box like sequences are also present in the hsst2 promoter. In addition, these results demonstrate that Smad4 is a key transactivator that regulates sst2 gene expression and suggest that the lack of Smad4 may be responsible in part for the loss of sst2 expression in human pancreatic cancers, which in turn may contribute to a gain of tumor growth advantage. Strikingly in this respect is the fact that aberration of the Smad4 gene observed in human pancreatic cell lines or orthotopic xenografts of human pancreatic carcinoma correlates with the loss of sst2 (3Buscail L.

Torrisani, unpublished results. In conclusion, the results obtained recognize msst2 as a TGF-β-regulated gene and identify Smad4 as a critical element in such regulation. The ability of Smad4 to restore the expression of sst2, one of the key negative control elements of cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells raises the possibility that functional Smad4 is required for TGF-β-mediated induction of sst2 and subsequent somatostatin-mediated growth inhibition. In consequence, the lack of sst2 induction as a result of Smad4 inactivation may represent a new possible molecular mechanism contributing to the growth advantage of pancreatic tumors. Among the wide spectrum of biological functions exerted by the ubiquitous regulatory neurohormone somatostatin, its action as an inhibitor of cell proliferation and endocrine and exocrine secretory processes, together with its immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties have lately raised great interest in cancer research. Cellular mechanisms that are induced by somatostatin include inhibition of adenylate cyclase, modulation of K+ and Ca2+channels, and protein dephosphorylation. The biological effects of somatostatin are mediated through its specific binding to a family of G protein-coupled receptors (ssts)1 encoded by five different genes (sst1-sst5) (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 2Epelbaum J. Dournaud P. Fodor M. Viollet C. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 25-44PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with CHO cells expressing each sst subtype reveal a predominant role of sst2 in mediating the antiproliferative effect of somatostatin analogs (3Buscail L. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N.

Upon ligand stimulation, sst2 induces transient association and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which in turn, associates with and dephosphorylates activated insulin receptor and its substrates leading to inhibition of the insulin mitogenic signal (4Lopez F.

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 15850–15853; Dominguez, R., Freyzon, Y., Trybus, K. M., and Cohen, C. (1998) Cell 94, 559–571). Contact is maintained between two domains, the relay and the converter, in both of these angular states. Therefore it has been proposed by Dominguez et al. (cited above) that this contact is critical for mechanically driving the angular change of the lever arm domain. However, structural information is lacking on whether this contact is maintained throughout the actin-activated myosin ATPase cycle. To test the functional importance of this interdomain contact, we introduced cysteines into the sequence of a “cysteine-light” myosin motor at position 499 on the lower cleft and position 738 on the converter domain (Shih, W. M., Gryczynski, Z., Lakowicz, J. L., and Spudich, J. A. (2000) Cell 102, 683–694). Disulfide cross-linking could be induced. The cross-link had minimal effects on actin binding, ATP-induced actin release, and actin-activated ATPase. These results demonstrate that the relay/converter interface remains intact in the actin strongly bound state of myosin and throughout the entire actin-activated myosin ATPase cycle. Crystal structures of the myosin motor domain in the presence of different nucleotides show the lever arm domain in two basic angular states, postulated to represent prestroke and poststroke states, respectively (Rayment, I.

These results demonstrate that the relay/converter interface remains intact in the actin strongly bound state of myosin and throughout the entire actin-activated myosin ATPase cycle. cysteine-light polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Myosins are molecular motors that transduce the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work in the form of the vectorial translocation of substrate actin filaments. In the swinging lever arm model of actin-myosin motor action, myosin binds to the actin with its globular catalytic domain and then rotates its carboxyl-terminal lever arm domain (reviewed in Ref. 5Goldman Y.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The anchoring of the end of the lever arm domain results in the translocation of the catalytic domain and the attached actin filament. Crystal structures of the motor domain of myosin show the lever arm domain in two basic angular classes, which have been postulated to represent prestroke and poststroke states (2Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 3Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C.

Scallop myosin complexed with ADP has been crystallized in a third angular state, proposed as a myosin·ATP actin-detached state (7Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Recent dynamic studies of the lever arm position using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer measurements support a swing of the lever arm from a prestroke state to a poststroke state through an angle of more than 70 degrees (4Shih W.M. Gryczynski Z. Lakowicz J.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The lever arm domain consists of a disc-shaped “converter domain” from which a long α-helix, bound by two calmodulin-like light chains, emerges. In both crystal states, the converter domain maintains a contact on a face of its radial edge to a rigid helix extending from the lower domain of the large cleft, referred to as the relay helix (3Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). This helix has to undergo a small conformational change, primarily a rigid body translation and rotation, to accommodate the angular rotation of the converter domain. Because this domain-domain interface is maintained between the two angular states, it has been proposed that this interface is important for mechanically driving the angular change. However, structural information is lacking as to whether this contact is maintained throughout the actin-activated myosin ATPase cycle, including in an actin strong binding state. We have used a cysteine engineering approach to address the question as to whether the relay/converter contact is maintained in the actin strongly bound state. We constructed myosinII alleles containing cysteine-light mutations (C49S, C312Y, C442S, C470I, C599L, and C678Y) (4Shih W.M. Gryczynski Z. Lakowicz J.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and substituted cysteine codons into positions corresponding to either residue 499 or 738 or both (Fig. 1). We show that the mutant myosins are functional in vivo and in vitro. The cross-linked myosin (containing cysteines at both positions 499 and 738) retained the ability to bind to actin in the absence of ATP as well as the ability to be released from actin in the presence of ATP. The cross-linked myosin also retained actin-activated ATPase activity. The changes made in a given mutant myosin are described within parentheses. For example, myosin(CL, I499C) refers to a full-length myosin gene with the cysteine-light (CL)1 mutations (C49S, C312Y, C442S, C470I, C599L, and C678Y) (4Shih W.M. Gryczynski Z. Lakowicz J.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the mutation I499C. Subcloning procedures were carried out using standard protocols (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). myosin(CL, I499C), myosin(CL, R738C), and myosin(CL, I499C, R738C) were generated by splice overlap extension mutagenesis (9Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using myosin(CL) as a template. Myosin genes were subcloned into the expression vector pTIKL-Myo. The introduced mutations were verified by dideoxy-DNA sequencing. The S1 gene fragments were then subcloned into pTIKLOES1, an expression vector for producing S1 with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag on the heavy chain. The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: I499C-F, 5′-TATCTTAAAGAGAAATGTAATTGGACTTTCATC-3′; I499C-R, 5′-GATGAAAGTCCAATTACATTTCTCTTTAAGATA-3′; R738C-F, 5′-GATCCAGAACAATATTGTTTCGGTATCACCAAG-3′; and R738C-R, 5′-CTTGGTGATACCGAAACAATATTGTTCTGGATC-3′. Dictyostelium cells were grown in HL-5 medium as described previously (10Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 22 °C in HL-5 supplemented with 17% FM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Transformations were performed as described previously (11Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mhcA null cell line HS1 was transformed with 10 μg of each of the pTIKL-Myo plasmids bearing wild type or mutant versions of the full-length myosin, whereas the AX3-ORF+ cell line was transformed with 10 μg of each of the pTIKLOES1 plasmids bearing wild type or mutant versions of the S1 fragment of myosin. Clonal cell lines that grew in the presence of HL-5 supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 8 μg/ml G418 were isolated, and these cell lines were further characterized. Cells were grown on plates to near confluence before they were transferred to shaking flasks. Cells were diluted to 4 × 104 cells/ml in 25 ml of total volume HL-5 in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks and shaken at 200 rpm at 22 °C for 6 days. A small aliquot was removed at regular intervals, and the number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer. Dictyostelium S1 His6 was expressed in DictyosteliumAX3-ORF+ cells (grown in suspension) and purified as described (12Giese K.C. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). S1 ATPase activities were measured as the release of labeled Pi using γ-32P, as reported previously (12Giese K.C. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plotted points and error bars of Fig. 5 represent measurements from three independent trials for each of two different protein preparations. Cross-linking was induced by the addition of 25 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) to S1 at a concentration of 1–2 μm. The buffer conditions were 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mmNaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 mmdithiothreitol. (The Cys499-Cys738 disulfide cross-link is not reduced by 1 mm dithiothreitol under nondenaturing conditions.) Disulfide cross-linking was assayed by mobility shift in SDS-PAGE behavior in the absence of reducing agent. Confirmation of disulfide bond formation was made by SDS-PAGE analysis in the presence of reducing agent reversing the mobility shift. The buffer conditions used were 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. For the noncompetitive assay, S1 (0.8 μm final concentration) was mixed with F-actin (3.0 μm final concentration) for 10 min, and then the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant and the resuspended pellet were examined by SDS-PAGE to determine whether the S1 cosedimented with the F-actin. The same assay was repeated in the presence of 2 mm Mg-ATP. For the competitive assay, the same procedure was used but with S1 at a final concentration of 1.3 μm and F-actin at a concentration of 0.5 μm. Dictyostelium cells that lack the myosinII gene are unable to divide in suspension, instead becoming large and multinucleate before eventually lysing and dying (13De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 14Knecht D.A. Loomis W.F. Science. 1987; 236: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus the transformation of the mutant myosinII gene into these myosinII null cells can lead to a simple assay for in vivo function (assaying for the rescue of the growth in suspension defect). The ability to rescue an in vivo defect serves as a useful benchmark to demonstrate that mutant myosins behave in a functional manner. The design of this experiment relies on the un-cross-linked double-cysteine mutant myosin to behave in a functional manner and then to assay for biochemical differences upon specific cross-linking. Arg738 (with its β and γ carbons) and Ile499 form part of the hydrophobic interface between the relay helix and the converter domain, respectively (Fig.1). Disruption of this hydrophobic interface thus could potentially be destabilizing for the myosin. Cysteines are relatively hydrophobic, however, and should be good candidates for replacement side chains for packing in the interface. Fig. 2 shows a growth curve examining the growth of Dictyostelium cells that were missing the genomic copy of myosinII but were supplied with another copy on an extrachromosomal plasmid. All of the mutant myosinII genes introduced (myosin(CL), myosin(CL, I499C), myosin(CL, R738C), and myosin(CL, I499C, R738C)) rescued growth in suspension to a rate comparable with that of the wild type. The parent strain lacking a copy of myosinII, however, failed to grow in suspension. Therefore it appears that the introduction of either cysteine, both individually or in tandem, is well tolerated by the structure of myosin. According to the crystal structures available, the side chains of residues at positions 499 and 738 are in close proximity (2Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 15Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that cysteines placed at nearby positions in a structure usually can be induced to form a disulfide cross-link, which is catalyzed either by ambient oxygen or by a disulfide exchange reagent (16Falke J.J. Koshland D.E.J. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of two residues in the structure of a protein that are separated by a large number of residues results in a covalently closed large loop within the primary sequence. Denatured proteins containing such a loop might be expected to exhibit a different mobility during gel electrophoresis; examples have been found where cross-linking induces either a gel mobility increase (17Careaga C.L. Falke J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or a gel mobility decrease (18Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28234-28829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that treatment with the disulfide exchange reagent dithionitrobenzoate induces an SDS-PAGE mobility increase in over 85% of a cysteine-light myosin S1 only when cysteines are introduced at both positions 499 and 738 but not when the cysteines are introduced individually. This gel mobility shift is reversible if the protein is loaded onto the gel in the presence of a reducing agent such as β-mercaptoethanol. Thus a specific cross-link is formed between introduced cysteines at positions 499 and 738. Curiously, the disulfide cross-link that is formed is quite robust against reduction under native conditions. Overnight treatment in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, or 1 mm tricarboxyethylphosphine followed by passage through a Sephadex spin column (to remove the dithiothreitol) fails to significantly reduce the disulfide, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Only after SDS denaturation does the disulfide become accessible to reduction. In the absence of the disulfide exchange reagent and reducing agents, the un-cross-linked protein is converted slowly to the cross-linked form over a period of weeks when stored at 4 °C, presumably catalyzed by ambient dissolved oxygen (data not shown). Wild type S1 precipitates with F-actin in the absence of ATP during centrifugation at sufficient speeds. Small, unattached proteins sediment much more slowly and therefore remain in the supernatant. This assay can be used to investigate the binding of S1 to actin. The property of the cross-linked form of S1 (that it migrates more rapidly during SDS-PAGE, relative to the un-cross-linked form) lends itself as a special advantage in the F-actin cosedimentation assay because this assay allows for the analysis of the supernatant (actin-detached) and pellet (actin-attached) fractions using SDS-PAGE. Thus the behavior of the two forms can be analyzed simultaneously in the same sample volume. Fig. 4 A shows S1 binding to F-actin in the presence of excess F-actin and in the absence of ATP. Both the cross-linked and un-cross-linked forms of S1 cosediment with the F-actin. Fig. 4 A also shows S1 binding to F-actin in the presence of excess F-actin and ATP. Both the cross-linked and un-cross-linked forms of S1 are similarly released from the actin by the ATP. Fig. 4 B shows S1 binding to F-actin in the presence of limiting F-actin. If the cross-linked form of S1 had a significantly different binding affinity to F-actin as compared with the un-cross-linked form of S1, then the ratio of the un-cross-linked to cross-linked bands should be significantly different in the supernatant and pellet lanes. However, Fig. 4 B shows that no significant difference is evident. Thus the cross-link does not perturb the binding of myosin to F-actin in its strong affinity mode. The rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of myosin in the absence of F-actin is the product release (19Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2975-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The presence of F-actin stimulates the myosin to release its products more rapidly (20Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). We examined the actin-activated ATPase activity of the cross-linked form versus the un-cross-linked form to see if the actin stimulation of product release might be impaired. Fig. 5 shows that the actin activation of the cross-linked species is decreased by 29% and that the K m for the actin activation is decreased by 29%. The basal rate of ATP hydrolysis (i.e. in the absence of F-actin) is the same in the cross-linked and un-cross-linked forms. Thus phosphate release in the cross-linked myosin is still stimulated by F-actin, although the amount of the stimulation is slightly decreased. The crystal structures of the Dictyostelium myosinII catalytic domain have been solved in complex with a number of nucleotide analogues, including ADP beryllium fluoride (BeFx), ADP aluminum fluoride (AlF4−), and ADP vanadate (Vi), all thought to mimic myosin states with a weak affinity for actin. It is only upon phosphate release that the myosin can adopt a conformation that allows it to bind to actin with a strong affinity. The crystal structures fall into two basic conformational classes: one that is thought to represent the myosin with its lever arm in a putative poststroke angle and one that is thought to represent the myosin with its lever arm in a putative prestroke angle. The lever arm extends off from a 60-residue globular domain, often referred to as the converter domain. This converter domain shares in both structures a hydrophobic interface with the back end of the lower jaw of the large cleft of the catalytic domain, referred to as the relay helix, despite a 70° rotation of the converter domain between the two structures. Fig. 6 shows this interface in the two structures, as well as in an intermediate structure that was generated as an interpolation between the crystal structure models (4Shih W.M. Gryczynski Z. Lakowicz J.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Inspection of the crystal structures suggests a mechanical picture describing the sequence of forces that are behind the power stroke. It has been proposed that changes in the nucleotide binding site, triggered by the formation of a bond between the backbone amide of switch II residue Gly457 with the γ-phosphate in the prestroke state, are amplified into a larger change in the position of the relay helix. This change drives a rotation and translation of the lever arm through its converter domain (3Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 15Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). These structures, however, are thought to represent myosin in conformations that have a weak affinity to actin (21Werber M.M. Peyser Y.M. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7190-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Myosin undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to actin with a much higher affinity; this conformational change in myosin can be monitored by the pyrene labeling of Cys374 on actin (22Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or with mant-ADP in the active site of the myosin (23Woodward S.K. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These spectroscopic probes, however, give no structural details of the nature of this conformational change. Therefore currently there is no experimental evidence that allows one to build a reliable model of myosin in its strong affinity to actin state. One proposal has been that the large cleft completely closes to achieve this strong affinity to actin state (1Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15850-15853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). One possible extension of this model is that the complete closure of the large cleft causes the relay helix to slip away from the converter domain. The converter domain, after its release from the relay helix, snaps back to its poststroke conformation, thus completing the power stroke. In this model, the lever arm behaves as a torque spring that is wound by 70° by the back end of the lower jaw and then suddenly released once actin strong binding has been achieved. Another model is that the interface between the converter domain and the relay helix is maintained in the strong actin affinity state of myosin as well. In this case, the relay helix may mechanically transmit the changes to the lever arm both in the actin-detached stages (the recovery stroke) and in the actin-attached stages (the power stroke). If the first model were correct (that the interface must slip), then the cross-linking of the interface would prevent that slipping and should prevent the myosin from achieving its actin strong binding affinity state. On the other hand, if the second model were correct (that the interface is maintained during the whole cycle), then the cross-linking of the interface should have little or no effect on the transition to the strong affinity to actin state. Our experiments demonstrate that cross-linking these two domains together through a cysteine at position 499 on the relay helix and a cysteine at position 738 on the converter domain does not inhibit myosin from achieving a strong affinity to actin state nor does it inhibit the effect of ATP in shifting the myosin back to the weak affinity to actin state. Thus our results are consistent with the model that the interface is maintained both in the actin-detached and actin-attached stages of the actomyosin ATPase cycle.

The presence of a Tyr residue in the active site of DMSOR and BSOR that is missing in TMAOR has been implicated in the inability of TMAOR, unlike DMSOR and BSOR, to utilizeS-oxides. To test this hypothesis, Escherichia coli TMAOR was cloned and expressed at high levels, and site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to generate the Tyr-114 → Ala and Phe variants of Rhodobacter sphaeroides DMSOR and insert a Tyr residue into the equivalent position in TMAOR. Although all of the mutants turn over in a manner similar to their respective wild-type enzymes, mutation of Tyr-114 in DMSOR results in a decreased specificity for S-oxides and an increased specificity for trimethylamine-N-oxide (Me3NO), with a greater change observed for DMSOR-Y114A. Insertion of a Tyr into TMAOR results in a decreased preference for Me3NO relative to dimethyl sulfoxide. Kinetic analysis and UV-visible absorption spectra indicate that the ability of DMSOR to be reduced by dimethyl sulfide is lost upon mutation of Tyr-114 and that TMAOR does not exhibit this activity even in the Tyr insertion mutant.

These enzymes are ideal targets for spectroscopic and kinetic studies of the molybdenum center since they do not contain additional cofactors. In contrast, in all other molybdoproteins studied to date, the low energy absorption bands of the molybdenum atom are overshadowed by prosthetic groups such as hemes, iron-sulfur centers, and flavins.

Resonance Raman studies on BSOR and DMSOR indicate that both enzymes function by an oxo transfer mechanism whereby the oxo group from the substrate is directly transferred to the molybdenum atom (Fig.2) (15Garton S.D.

This process is reversible in DMSOR, and the ability of this enzyme to be reduced by dimethyl sulfide (Me2S) has been extensively studied (7McAlpine A.S. McEwan A.G. Bailey S. J. Mol.

However, resonance Raman analysis has indicated that BSOR is unable to be reduced with either Me2S or by biotin (16Garton S.D. Temple C.A. Dhawan I.K. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6798-6805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other than mutation of the protein ligands to the molybdenum in DMSOR and BSOR (18Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35086-35090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), no mutagenic studies have been reported for TMAOR, BSOR, or Rhodobacter DMSOR, and there is little information about the roles of other amino acids in enzymatic activity. Alignment of R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatusDMSOR to E. coli and S. massilia TMAOR andR. sphaeroides BSOR indicates 22% sequence identity and 48% sequence similarity between all five enzymes. Despite this similarity, there are striking differences in their physiological roles, electron donors, and substrate specificity. TMAOR functions as the final enzyme in the anaerobic electron transport pathway that utilizes Me3NO as the terminal electron acceptor (20Silvestro A. Pommier J. Pascal M.C. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although DMSOR also functions as a terminal enzyme during anaerobic respiration, it is able to utilize a greater variety of substrates including Me3NO and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (21Satoh T. Kurihara F.N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). BSOR, a cytoplasmic protein whose possible roles include scavenging biotin sulfoxide (BSO) to generate biotin and protecting the cell from oxidative damage (22Pierson D.E. Campbell A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2194-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), has also been shown to use a variety of S- and N-oxides (23Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3355-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structure of DMSOR has generated great interest in the role of the Tyr at position 114 during catalytic turnover of the enzyme. In the 1.3-Å crystal structure of R. sphaeroides DMSOR, the bis(MGD)Mo active site exhibits two different coordination geometries (5Hung-Kei L. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7673-7680Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the catalytically active, hexa-coordinated molybdenum site, the single oxo group is coordinated by Trp-116 (Fig. 3B), whereas in the inactive, penta-coordinated molybdenum environment, Tyr-114 is hydrogen-bonded to one of two oxo groups (Fig. 3C). Although sequence alignments have shown that BSOR contains a residue equivalent to Tyr-114, this residue is missing in E. coli and S. massilia TMAOR (Fig. 3, A and D). Since both BSOR and DMSOR are able to reduce a wide variety of S- andN-oxides whereas TMAOR shows a more limited specificity forN-oxides (24Iobbi-Nivol C. Pommier J. Simala-Grant J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Tyr-114 has been postulated to be responsible for this variance in substrate specificity (4Czjzek M. Dos Santos J.-P. Pommier J. Giordano G. Mejean V. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Buc J. Santini C.L. Giordani R. Czjek M. Wu L.F. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although R. sphaeroides DMSOR and BSOR were previously cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli (3Temple C.A. George G.N. Hilton J.C. George M.J. Prince R.C. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4046-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 1996; 1294: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), TMAOR has not been cloned previously. In the studies reported here,E. coli TMAOR has been cloned and the recombinant protein purified, setting the stage for a comprehensive study of the role of Tyr-114 in this family of enzymes. This residue has been mutated to both Ala and Phe in DMSOR, and a Tyr has been inserted into TMAOR in an equivalent position. The molybdenum coordination environment of the wild-type and mutant proteins has been probed using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The activities of both wild-type and mutant proteins have been analyzed by steady-state kinetics with both S- and N-oxides in the forward direction, and the efficiency of Me2S reduction of these enzymes has been measured. The presence of these mutations does not appear to affect stability or cofactor incorporation. The mutation of Tyr-114 in DMSOR does increase the specificity for N-oxides while decreasing the specificity for S-oxides, and insertion of the Tyr residue in TMAOR increases the specificity forS-oxides with a concomitant decrease in specificity forN-oxides. Mutation of Tyr-114 in DMSOR also results in inefficient reduction of the enzyme by Me2S. The first 117 nucleotides of theE. coli torA sequence encode a 39-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence that targets TMAOR to the periplasm and is cleaved to form the mature enzyme (27Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The structural gene for TMAOR without the periplasmic signal sequence was isolated from DH5α genomic DNA using PCR primers created from the E. coli K12 torAgene sequence (GenBankTM accession number X73888). One primer inserted an NdeI site and a new start codon immediately 5′ to the codon for the first amino acid of the mature protein, and the second created a HindIII site 36 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon. The resulting DNA segment containing the torA sequence was ligated directly into the pCR2.1 cloning vector using the Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The consensus sequence of three independent clones confirmed the previously published K12 sequence (27Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Primers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and automated sequencing was accomplished by the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. One plasmid clone containing a single polymerase error that changed Trp-576 to Ala was selected for further manipulations. Due to difficulties in growing cells containing the pCR2.1 cloning vector during mutagenesis, the TMAOR coding sequence was released with HindIII and transferred into the pBluescript II Ks(+) cloning vector (Stratagene). The polymerase error was repaired by site-directed mutagenesis on double-stranded DNA using the CLONTECH Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit to obtain pKJ125. This plasmid was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the coding sequence was ligated into the pET-29a(+) expression vector (Novagen) to form pKJ525 (Table I) which encodes for mature TMAOR. To aid in purification of the protein, the TMAOR coding region of pKJ125 was released with HindIII andNdeI and ligated into pET-28a(+) (Novagen) to create pKJ725, which encodes an N-terminal His6-tagged version of TMAOR. The coding sequence containing the structural gene, and the N-terminal His tag from pKJ725 was excised using HindIII andNcoI and ligated into the pTrc 99 A expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to form pKJ825.Table IE. coli expression plasmidsConstructVectorInsertKJ525pET-29a(+)TMAOR without periplasmic signal sequenceKJ725pET-28a(+)TMAOR with N-terminal His6 tagKJ825pTrc 99 ATMAOR with N-terminal His6 tagKJ830pTrc 99 ATMAOR+Y with N-terminal His6 tagJH720aHilton et al.(18).pET-28a(+)DMSOR with N-terminal His6 tagJH820bTemple and Rajagopalan (28).pTrc 99 ADMSOR with N-terminal His6 tagJN711pET-28a(+)DMSOR-Y114A with N-terminal His6 tagJN712pET-28a(+)DMSOR-Y114F with N-terminal His6taga Hilton et al.(18Hilton J.C.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert a Tyr residue between amino acids 119 and 120 of the TMAOR coding sequence in pKJ725. The sequence for the structural gene and the N-terminal His tag was excised using HindIII and NcoI and ligated into pTrc 99 A to form pKJ830. This plasmid expresses the TMAOR+Y variant of TMAOR, which contains a Tyr residue in a location equivalent to Tyr-114 in DMSOR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pJH118 (18Hilton J.C.

The mutated coding sequences were subsequently liberated using HindIII and NdeI and ligated into pET-28a(+) in frame with the N-terminal His6 tag to produce pJN711 and pJN712, the expression vectors for DMSOR-Y114A and DMSOR-Y114F, respectively. All of the pTrc 99 A-based expression vectors (pJH820 (28Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

The RK4353 strain was DE3-lysogenized using the λ DE3 lysogenization kit from Novagen to create the RK4353(DE3) strain. All of the pET-based expression plasmids (pJH720, pKJ725, pKJ525, pJN711, and pJN712) were transformed into these cells. The resulting strains were subsequently transformed a second time with pLysS (Novagen). Conditions for growth and expression were as described previously (3Temple C.A. George G.N. Hilton J.C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4046-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the exception that 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 34 μg/ml kanamycin were used as the sole antibiotics, and expression was induced with 40 μm IPTG. Cells expressing TMAOR were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl (PN buffer). Cell lysis was achieved by three passages through the 112-μm interaction chamber of a Microfluidics M110L Microfluidizer Processor at 16,000–18,000 pounds/square inch. The resulting extract was stirred at room temperature for 20 min with ∼10 μg/ml DNase I and then centrifuged at 11,000 ×g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 6.5 with HCl, heated in a boiling water bath to 65 °C, maintained at 65 °C for 1 min, cooled rapidly in an ice bath, and then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 25 min. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm; the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH, and the solution was centrifuged again. The supernatant was then equilibrated with 40 ml of Ni2+-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen) by gentle stirring at 4 °C for 15 min. This slurry was loaded onto a gravity flow column and subsequently washed with 2 column volumes of PN buffer at pH 7.5 containing 10 mm imidazole, 8 column volumes of the same solution at pH 8.0, and 3 column volumes of PN buffer, pH 8, containing 20 mm imidazole. TMAOR was eluted at pH 8.0 with PN buffer containing 200 mmimidazole. The fractions containing TMAOR were combined, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and purified using a Q-Sepharose fast protein liquid chromatography column with a 23-ml bed volume. The column was washed with 1 column volume of 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, followed by a 2-column volume 0–300 mmgradient of NaCl, and TMAOR was then eluted with a 2-column volume wash at 300 mm NaCl. The fractions containing TMAOR were combined and buffer exchanged into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using either dialysis or a 100-ml Superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column. Q-Sepharose fast flow and Superose-12 resin were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A more stable form of TMAOR was obtained by cycling the protein during purification. The clarified lysate was placed in a Coy anaerobic chamber containing a mixture of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen and reduced with dithionite in the presence of methyl viologen until a dark blue color was present. A 100 mm solution of Me3NO was then added in a dropwise fashion until the solution lost all blue color, and the process was repeated. The resulting solution was immediately brought to pH 6.5 for the heat step and further purification as already described. TMAOR+Y was purified in the same manner as the wild-type enzyme including the cycling step. Native DMSOR was purified fromR. sphaeroides (1Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and recombinant DMSOR, DMSOR-Y114A, and DMSOR-Y114F were purified from E. coli as described previously (18Hilton J.C.

The molybdenum content of the purified proteins was analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Zeeman 3030 atomic absorption spectrometer as described previously (18Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pure samples of DMSOR were quantitated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 200,000m−1 cm−1or 2.3 ml mg−1 cm−1(1Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem.

For quantitation of TMAOR or total protein, the Pierce BCA assay was used as described in the manufacturer's protocol, with purifiedR. sphaeroides DMSOR as the standard. Guanine analysis was performed as described previously (18Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

All spectra were recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and normalized to 5 mg/ml unless otherwise indicated. Dithionite-reduced spectra were recorded under anaerobic conditions as described previously (3Temple C.A. George G.N. Hilton J.C. George M.J. Prince R.C. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4046-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and re-oxidized spectra were obtained by the injection of anaerobic substrate directly into the cuvette containing the dithionite-reduced enzyme. To obtain Me2S-reduced spectra, purified recombinant DMSOR, DMSOR-Y114F, and DMSOR-Y114A were reduced under anaerobic conditions in the Coy chamber, re-oxidized with substrate, and dialyzed against 2× 1 liter of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. TMAOR and TMAOR+Y spectra were obtained using enzyme that had been cycled during purification. Enzyme was transferred in the Coy chamber to a cuvette and sealed before removal from the anaerobic environment. Anaerobic stock solutions of 2 m Me2S in ethanol and 2m Me2SO in water were added to the cuvette using a gas-tight syringe. Kinetic constants for DMSOR, DMSOR-Y114A, DMSOR-Y114F, TMAOR, and TMAOR+Y using Me2SO, Me3NO, methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), and adenosine-1N-oxide (ANO) as substrates were determined as described previously (18Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three to ten activity assays were performed for each of 5–10 different substrate concentrations.Km and kcat values were determined by direct fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kinetic constants for reduction of recombinant DMSOR, TMAOR, DMSOR-Y114A, DMSOR-Y114F, and TMAOR+Y using Me2S were determined using the method of Adams et al. (17Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8501-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Initial activity was measured aerobically after the addition of Me2S from a gas-tight syringe to a cuvette containing enzyme in the presence of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm phenazine methosulfate (PMS), and 0.04 mm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP). Background activity, obtained by the addition of anaerobic Me2S to a cuvette containing no enzyme, was subtracted to obtain all final activity numbers. All substrates were obtained from Sigma. Whereas E. coliTMAOR has previously been purified from source (30Silvestro A. Pommier J. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Yamamoto I.

Couillault C. Giordano G. Mejean V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the yield in both cases was substantially less than that obtained by the heterologous expression of R. sphaeroides DMSOR and BSOR inE. coli (3Temple C.A.

To facilitate purification of the large quantities of enzyme required for comprehensive studies on the role of the Tyr residue in DMSOR and TMAOR, E. coli TMAOR was cloned, homogeneously expressed, and purified. For overexpression, the gene for mature E. coli TMAOR with an added N-terminal His6 tag was placed into the pTrc 99 A vector. Three mutants were created to elucidate the role of Tyr-114. In DMSOR, this residue was mutated to either Ala or Phe. The latter retains the large phenyl ring but cannot form a hydrogen bond to the molybdenum oxo ligand. The mutated sequences were transferred into a vector to generate His-tagged versions of DMSOR-Y114A and DMSOR-Y114F. In TMAOR, a Tyr codon was inserted into the His-tagged coding sequence between residues 119 and 120 in a position corresponding to Tyr-114 of DMSOR (Fig. 3A). BL21(DE3), the standard E. coli strain used for expression of pET plasmids, appears to have difficulty expressing enzymes containing the molybdenum cofactor (33Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RK4353 is the base strain for an extensive series of cofactor biosynthesis mu insertion mutants (29Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was chosen as an alternative expression strain. Since expression from pET-based plasmids requires the presence of T7 polymerase, the RK4353 strain was DE3-lysogenized. The plasmids expressing TMAOR reductase with and without a His tag (pKJ525 and pKJ725), DMSOR (pJH720), DMSOR-Y114A (pJN711), and DMSOR-Y114F (pJN712) were transformed into RK4353(DE3) cells. The resulting strains were subsequently transformed with pLysS. Because of problems with cell stability as a result of DE3 lysogenization, an alternative expression system was created. Expression of R. sphaeroides DMSOR in the pTrc 99 A expression construct has been shown to produce a substantial improvement in yield and permits expression in an alternative cell strain without the presence of the T7 polymerase (28Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing His-tagged TMAOR, TMAOR+Y, and DMSOR in pTrc 99 A (pKJ825, pKJ830, and pJH820, respectively) were transformed into RK4353E. coli cells. All strains were grown and induced for 24 h under anaerobic conditions as described previously (3Temple C.A. George G.N. Hilton J.C. George M.J. Prince R.C. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4046-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the exception that kanamycin and chloramphenicol were used as antibiotics for all RK4353(DE3) pLysS strains containing pET-based plasmids, and ampicillin was used for all expression from RK4353 cells containing pTrc 99 A-based plasmids. The IPTG concentration had to be lowered to 10 μm for expression of proteins from the pTrc 99 A vectors to obtain a level of active protein equivalent to that expressed from the pET vectors when induced with 40 μm IPTG. Analysis of DMSOR has shown that the presence of a N-terminal His6 tag does not alter the activity of the protein (18Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the same was true for TMAOR, both the native and His-tagged versions of the pr"

However, we have found that several types of DNA damage, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are repaired with equal efficiency in both the transcribed and nontranscribed strands of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We further found that, in two mutant cell lines in which the entireAPRT promoter region has been deleted, CPDs are still efficiently repaired in both strands of the promoterlessAPRT gene, even though neither strand appears to be transcribed.

Again, we found similar rates of CPD repair in both strands of the APRT gene domain in both APRTpromoter-deletion mutants and their parental cell line.

In mammalian cells, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is thought to involve two distinct subpathways: transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which selectively and very efficiently repairs transcription-blocking damage in the transcribed strand of actively expressed genes, and global genomic repair (GGR), which is responsible for repairing damage in the nontranscribed strand and the rest of the genome (2Mellon I.

TCR occurs only in genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Cells from individuals with Cockayne's syndrome (CS) are competent in GGR but deficient in TCR (9Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F.

Interestingly, even though CS cells are deficient in TCR, repair in actively transcribed genes is still significantly more efficient that repair in inactive regions of the genome. Cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) patients are competent in repair of CPDs in transcriptionally active genes (with repair occurring primarily in the transcribed strand) but are defective in GGR (12van Hoffen A.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are profoundly deficient in global genomic repair of CPDs, typically showing efficient TCR of CPDs in the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes, but little repair in the nontranscribed strand, or in nontranscribed regions of the genome (2Mellon I.

Not all genes, however, show the characteristic pattern of preferential, TCR of transcription-blocking damage on the transcribed strand, originally described for the DHFR gene.

In XPC cells, CPDs in the 5′-portion of the ADA gene were found to be repaired much more efficiently in the transcribed strand than in the nontranscribed strand, but CPDs in the 3′-portion of the ADA gene were efficiently repaired in both strands (12van Hoffen A.

Furthermore, in a patient with severe combined immune deficiency, in which theADA promoter region has been deleted and the gene is not expressed, the efficiency of CPD repair was found to be only slightly reduced compared with that normally seen for the transcribed strand of an intact ADA gene (16Berkvens T.M. Gerritsen E.J.A. Oldenbeurg M. Breukel C. Wijneen J.T. van Ormond H. Vossen J.M. Van der Eb A.J. Khun P.M.

Efficient repair of CPDs on both strands of an actively transcribed mammalian gene has been reported for two other gene loci, the human β-actin gene (18Barsalou L.S. Kantor G.J. Deiss D.M. Hall C.E. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the Chinese hamster adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) gene (19Vreeswijk M.P.G. van Hoffen A. Westland B.E. Vrieling H. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31858-31863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, in both of these studies, the large size of the genomic fragment used to assay CPD repair, in relation to the size of the transcribed region of the gene, complicated interpretation of the results. In this study, we have carefully examined the kinetics, strand specificity, and transcription dependence of NER of UV-induced CPDs at the endogenous Chinese hamster APRT gene locus, in hemizygous CHO cell lines that contain only a single copy of this gene. In contrast to the preferential repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand, which is observed in the CHO DHFR gene, we have found that CPDs on both strands of the CHO APRT gene are repaired with equal efficiency. We observe a similar lack of strand specificity for repair of BPDE and CC-1065-induced DNA damage at theAPRT locus. We have further found that, in two mutant cell lines in which the entire APRT promoter region has been deleted, CPDs are still efficiently repaired in both strands of the promoterless APRT gene, even though neither strand appears to be transcribed. These results, which were initially obtained by Southern analysis using a relatively small DNA fragment that includes the entire APRT gene, have been confirmed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) analyses in which rates of repair were determined for each CPD site along each DNA strand in exon 3 of the APRT gene, in all three cell lines. Together, these results demonstrate that the highly efficient repair observed on both strands of the Chinese hamster APRT locus is not dependent on transcription of the APRT gene. The Chinese hamster CHO-AT3-2 cell line is hemizygous for the endogenousAPRT gene locus (20Adair G.M. Stallings R.L. Nairn R.S. Siciliano M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5961-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); these cells contain a single, actively transcribed APRT gene, which is located on the CHO Z7 chromosome. ATS-88 and T2S-24 are two spontaneous APRTpromoter deletion mutants, which were derived from CHO-AT3-2. For these experiments, cultures were grown to 50–70% confluence in 150-mm dishes, in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to UV irradiation, or treatment with BPDE or CC-1065, the medium was removed and cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). For UV treatments, cells were irradiated at a fluency rate of 1 J/m2/s, using GE1518 germicidal lamps (predominate emission, 254 nm) as the UV source. For BPDE or CC-1065 treatments, either BPDE (4 μm) or CC-1065 (60 nm) was added to cell cultures in 15 ml of DPBS, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (21Tang M.-s. Pao A. Zhang X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tang M.-s. Qian M. Pao A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2726-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After three rinses with fresh DPBS to remove the DNA-damaging agent, the cells were incubated in fresh medium with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (10 μm) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (1 μm). After incubation at 37 °C for various periods of time, the treated cells were lysed for DNA isolations. Cells were washed three times with DPBS, and lysed with lysing buffer (0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) at room temperature for 1 h. The proteinase K was removed by phenol extractions followed by diethyl ether extractions, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). RNA was removed by treatment with RNase A (0.4 μg/ml) followed by phenol and diethyl ether extractions and ethanol precipitation. For Southern blotting, DNAs were digested overnight with either Asp718 orBamHI (10 unit/μg of DNA) and checked for completeness of digestion by agarose gel electrophoresis. Replicated and nonreplicated DNAs were separated by the CsCl gradient centrifugation in a Ti 50 rotor (37 × 103 rpm for 64 h at 21 °C) (23Tang M.-s. Pfeifer G. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 139-153Crossref Google Scholar). Only the nonreplicated DNA was used for repair kinetics analysis. The UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins were purified as described previously (23Tang M.-s. Pfeifer G. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 139-153Crossref Google Scholar, 24Thomas D.C. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UvrABC reaction was the same as previously described (21Tang M.-s. Pao A. Zhang X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tang M.-s. Pfeifer G. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 139-153Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot containing 3 μg of DNA was reacted with UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC (330 nmol) each in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), at a final volume 100 μl at 37 °C for 90 min. The protein-DNA mixture was then ethanol-precipitated (with 15 μg of tRNA, as a carrier) and resuspended in 10 μl of TE buffer. The method was the same as previously described (22Tang M.-s. Qian M. Pao A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2726-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To induce DNA strand breakage at the CC-1065-DNA adducts site, 3 μg of DNA was added to 40 μl of solution containing 10 mm NaOH, 75% formamide, 2.5 mm Tris, and 0.25 mm EDTA. The mixtures were heated at 90 °C for 20 min and quenched in an ice bath. The DNA was incubated with T4 endoV (protein/DNA molar ratio 6:1, assuming the average DNA length is 14 kb) in a solution of 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 60 min. For Southern blotting, the protein-DNA mixture was ethanol-precipitated with 15 μg of tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of TE buffer. For LMPCR, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the mixtures were preincubated with the Escherichia coliphotolyase (0.5 μg/μg of DNA) at room temperature under yellow light for 3 min. The mixtures were then irradiated with 366-nm UV light (Sylvania 15-watt F15T8) for 60 min at room temperature at a distance of 5 cm to generate strand breakage (25Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Pfeifer G. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 199-209Crossref Google Scholar). After enzyme treatment, the DNA was purified by phenol and diethyl ether extraction, ethanol-precipitation, and then dissolved in TE buffer. DNA was denatured in 90% formamide at 37 °C for 60 min. Immediately after denaturation, the samples were electrophoresed at 5 V/cm for 3 h in a 0.5% agarose gel in TBE buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA) with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to an Oncor membrane. The DNA on the membrane was then hybridized with strand-specific DNA probes. pGEM-zf11(+)-APRT and pGEM-zf11(−)-APRT vectors were constructed by inserting a 3.9-kb BamHI fragment containing the CHO APRTgene into the pGEM-zf11(+) or (−) vectors. These two constructs allowed us to isolate either the transcribed (T) or the nontranscribed (NT) strand of the APRT gene. Single-stranded pGEM-zf11(+)-APRT or pGEM-zf11(-)-APRT DNA phages containing either the transcribed or nontranscribed strand of theAPRT gene, respectively, were isolated by infecting the vector-containing cells with carrier phage M13 K07. To generate32P-labeled DNA probes for either the T or NT strand, 0.1 μg of template DNA was added to reaction buffer containing 50 pmol of the appropriate strand-specific primer, 5 μmdGTP/dTTP/dATP, 5 units of Klenow fragment, and 16.7 pmol of [α-32P]dCTP, and the mixture was incubated at 18 °C overnight. For generation of the T strand-specific APRTprobe, we used a primer with the sequence: 5′-TGCGAGAAGCGGGACTGAAAA-3′. For generation of the NT strand-specific probe, we used a primer with the sequence: 5′-TGATCCATGCAAGACAAC-3′. To produce strand-specific probes for exon 3 of the APRT gene, a PCR-amplified fragment of the exon 3 region was used as the template and either T or NT strand-specific primer was used to perform separate linear PCR reactions. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium method (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed with a guanidinium solution (4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine) and genomic DNA was sheared with a 20-gauge needle. Total RNA was isolated by centrifugation through a 5.7 m CsCl gradient, at 35 × 103 rpm for 12–20 h. The pelleted RNA was then dissolved in TES (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Messenger RNA was isolated with the Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 mRNA kit. The RNA was then run in a glyoxal-Me2SO-NaPO4 gel, transferred to an Oncor membrane, and hybridized with strand-specific probes. The sequencing reactions were performed as described previously (27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8985) Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reactions (LMPCR) were performed as described (25Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Pfeifer G. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 199-209Crossref Google Scholar, 28Pfeifer G.P. Dammann R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar) with two modifications. T4 polymerase from Oncor, Inc. instead of Sequenase was used to perform the first primer extension reaction in LMPCR. A specific amount of32P-labeled linearized pBR322 plasmid DNA (about 20,000 dpm) was added to each sample at the beginning of the reaction as an internal standard. After LMPCR, equivalent counts of 32P, representing equivalent amounts of template DNA for each time point of the reaction, were loaded into each lane of the sequencing gel. PrimersAPRT 3-1 to 3-3 were used for detecting CPDs in the transcribed strand of APRT exon 3, and primersAPRT 3-4 and 3-5 were used for detecting CPDs in the nontranscribed strand. Because it was difficult to identify a third primer for the nontranscribed strand due to the sequence of the exon 3 region, primer APRT 3-5 was also used for probe synthesis. The sequences of the primers were: APRT 3-1, 5′-TCCTTACACCTCAGCCCTAAC-3′, Tm = 50.3 °C;APRT 3-2, 5′-CAGCCCTAACACGCCCCCTCTC-3′,Tm = 62.7 °C; APRT 3-3, 5′-GCCTAGACTCCAG GGGATTCTTGTT-3′, Tm = 59.1 °C; APRT 3-4, 5′-TGACCACCACCCCTAGCTTCT-3′,Tm = 55.1 °C; APRT 3-5, 5′-CCACCACCCCTAGCTTCTCCATGTTTC-3′, Tm = 64.5 °C. Autoradiographs were scanned with a Bio-Image Analyzer, using a 100 Visage whole-band analysis software program. The average number of damage sites per APRT fragment was calculated by the Poisson distribution equation: P(0) =e −n, where n is the number of UvrABC nuclease-sensitive sites (UNSS), or thermal-alkaline labile sites (TALS), or T4 endoV-sensitive sites (ESS). The ratio of labeling intensity of the full-length fragment from the enzyme (or heat)-treated sample to that of the untreated sample is equal to P(0). For the results from LMPCR experiments, the intensities of all CPD-site bands were compared after subtraction of background values obtained from T4 endoV-treated, nonirradiated control lanes. A repair kinetics curve was generated for each CPD position, and the time required for removal of 50% of the initial CPDs at each site was then determined from this curve. Statistical analyses of the quantitated repair rate data were carried out using StatView 4.01 (Abacus Concepts. Inc.) The CHO cell line AT3-2 contains a single, actively transcribed APRT gene (20Adair G.M. Stallings R.L. Nairn R.S. Siciliano M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5961-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This APRT hemizygous cell line was chosen for use in our experiments to avoid any potential complications of allelic differences in transcription or DNA repair. Exponentially growing cultures were treated with the DNA-damaging agents: UV, BPDE, or CC-1065. To assay the removal of DNA damage, cells were harvested at various times after treatment with damaging agents. For detection of UV-induced CPDs, DNAs isolated from UV-irradiated cells were treated with T4 endoV, which specifically cuts CPD sites (1Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). UvrABC nuclease was used to detect BPDE-DNA adducts in DNAs isolated from BPDE-treated cells (21Tang M.-s. Pao A. Zhang X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DNAs isolated from CC-1065-treated cells were subjected to thermal-alkaline treatment to allow detection of CC-1065-DNA adducts (22Tang M.-s. Qian M. Pao A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2726-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After these treatments, the resultant DNAs were denatured and separated by electrophoresis in an agarose gel; the separated DNAs were then transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with 32P-labeled, APRT-transcribed (T) or nontranscribed (NT) strand-specific probes. The results in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 show that even though the kinetics for the removal of these three different types of DNA damage are quite different, the time course of CPD photoproduct, BPDE-DNA adduct, or CC-1065-DNA adduct removal is similar for both strands of theAPRT gene. As a control to confirm that these cells have not lost their capacity for transcription-coupled repair, we also examined CPD repair in the T and NT strands of the DHFR gene. It has been previously shown that UV-induced CPDs are preferentially repaired in the transcribed strand of the DHFR gene in CHO cells (2Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar,21Tang M.-s. Pao A. Zhang X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results in Fig. 4 confirm that this is also the case in CHO-AT3-2 cells. Although 80% of CPDs are removed from the T strand of the DHFR gene by TCR within 24 h, only 15% of CPDs are removed from the NT strand (Fig. 4). The inefficient repair of CPDs in the NT strand of the DHFRgene seen in Fig. 4 shows that CHO-AT3-2 cells, like other CHO sublines (2Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 14Hwang B.J. Toering S. Franke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), are deficient in global genomic repair of CPDs; this is further demonstrated in Fig. 5, which shows that the majority of the CPDs in bulk genomic DNA remain unrepaired even after 24 h of incubation. Thus, our results demonstrate that, although repair at the CHO APRT gene locus is much more efficient than repair in bulk genomic DNA, there is no apparent strand specificity or preferential repair of damage on the transcribed strand; similar rates and extents of repair are seen for both strands of the APRT gene.Figure 2Removal of BPDE-DNA adducts from theAPRT gene in AT3-2 cells.

The data show a relatively symmetrical arrangement of the amino acid to base contacts, and a comparison of the bipolar contacts with that of a normal unipolar terminus suggests that the DNA-protein contacts play an important determinative role in generating polarity from structurally symmetrical RTP dimers. The amino acid to nucleotide contacts provided distance constraints that enabled us to build a three-dimensional model of the protein-DNA complex. The model is consistent with features of the bipolar Ter·RTP complex derived from mutational and cross-linking data. The bipolar terminus arrested Escherichia coli DNA replication and DnaB helicase and T7 RNA polymerase in vitro in both orientations. RTP arrested the unwinding of duplex DNA on the bipolar Ter DNA substrate regardless of the length of the duplex DNA. The latter result suggested further that the terminus arrested authentic DNA unwinding by the helicase rather than just translocation of helicase on DNA.

In many prokaryotic and some eukaryotic replicons, replication forks initiated at specific replication origins and moving bi-directionally are not terminated randomly but in regions delimited by polar replication termini (Ter).1 TheTer sites are usually short sequences that specifically bind to a replication terminator protein (RTP) and arrest fork moving in only one direction with respect to the origin but not the other. TheTer sites are usually located in two clusters of opposite polarity in such a way that the forks moving clockwise on a circular chromosome pass through the first cluster (that has the nonarresting polarity) and are arrested at the termini of the second cluster, which has blocking polarity. The same is true for forks moving in a counterclockwise direction (1Bastia D. Mohanty B.K. DePamphilis M. DNA replication in Eukaryotic Cells.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1996; : 177-215Google Scholar, 2Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. Mol. Microbiol... 1999; 31: 1611-1618Google Scholar). Each Ter site of Bacillus subtilis binds to two interacting dimers of RTP to arrest forks in a polar mode (3Carrigan C.M. Pack R.A. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol... 1991; 222: 197-207Google Scholar, 4Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar). Thus, there are two interesting mechanistic questions to be addressed in this context. First, how is the polarity of fork arrest generated, considering the fact that the dimeric RTP has a symmetrical structure (5Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. White S.W. Cell.. 1995; 80: 651-660Google Scholar). Second, what is the molecular mechanism of fork arrest (see reviews in Refs. 2Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. Mol. Microbiol... 1999; 31: 1611-1618Google Scholar and 6Wake R.G. King G. Structure.. 1997; 5: 1-5Google Scholar). In this study we have endeavored to address the first question. We have approached the question by determining the amino acid to nucleotide contacts of RTP bound to the novel naturally occurring bipolar terminus of the plasmid pLS20 (7Meijer W.J.J. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. de Boer A.L. Venema G. Bron S. Mol. Microbiol... 1996; 19: 1295-1306Google Scholar) and comparing and contrasting the results with similar contacts derived from a normal unipolarTer site. We have converted RTP to a site-directed chemical nuclease by coupling it to an organic Fe–EDTA conjugate at certain rationally selected critical amino acid residues that are known to be involved in contacting Ter DNA (8Ebright Y.W. Chen Y. Pendergrast P.S. Ebright R.H. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 10664-10670Google Scholar, 9Mazzarelli J.M. Ermacora M.R. Fox R.O. Grindley N.D. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 2979-2986Google Scholar, 10Pai K.S. Bussiere D.E. Wang F. White S.W. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 10647-10652Google Scholar) and have determined the site-directed cleavage maps of the bipolar replication terminus. Furthermore, using the crystal structure of RTP (5Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. White S.W. Cell.. 1995; 80: 651-660Google Scholar) and the cleavage maps mentioned above, we have constructed a model of the two dimers of RTP bound to the bipolar Ter. The model revealed a relatively symmetrical amino acid to nucleotide contact pattern that presumably contributed to nearly equal binding affinity of both subsites of the bipolar Ter to RTP. The results suggest that the pattern of protein-DNA interaction at the Ter sites is probably one of the parameters that generate polarity (or the lack of it) at the Ter sites. In the second part of this study, we have investigated the biochemical properties of the bipolar Ter with the goal of mapping the points of arrest of the helicase and T7 RNA polymerase at each end of the Ter site and have determined the minimal effective sequence necessary to arrest the helicase. We have determined an “activity footprint” of the contrahelicase activity of RTP on the bipolar Ter that showed that RTP was able to arrest helicase-catalyzed unwinding of double stranded DNA in a length-independent fashion over a range of a less than a 100 bp to over 1500 bp. This result is consistent with the notion that RTP arrested authentic DNA unwinding and not just helicase translocation. Thus, the data presented provide not only some insight into the molecular basis of the origin of polarity but also the characteristics of the bipolar terminus in vitro. The pUC18-IRI (BS3) and pUC18-IRI (BS3) Rev. plasmids were constructed by transferring anXbaI-HindIII fragment that contained the IRI (unipolar Ter) from the pET22b-BS3 and pET22b-BS3 Rev. plasmids (11Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1996; 15: 2530-2539Google Scholar) into the pUC18 vector. The pUC18/19-Bipolar plasmids were constructed by cloning a 46-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the bipolar Ter site into the pUC18/19 vectors. The plasmids pET22b-IRI, (pET22b-BS3) and pET22b-IRI Rev. (pET22b-BS3 Rev) contained a unipolar Ter site in opposite orientations. The pET22b-Bipolar and pET22b-Bipolar Rev. plasmids were constructed by cloning an NdeI-HindIII and anNdeI-EcoRI fragment from pUC18-Bipolar and pUC19-Bipolar plasmids, respectively, in the pET22b vector. M13mp19-Bipolar and M13mp18-Bipolar clones were made by cloning a 46-bp DNA fragment containing the bipolar terminus into the M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors, respectively. RTP contains a single and apparently solvent-inaccessible Cys at position 110 in the dimerization α-helix. No attempts were made to mutate this residue to a noncysteine moiety. Instead, additional Cys residues were introduced one at a time into the locations indicated (see Figs. 3 and 4) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange kit, Stratagene), and the residues were derivatized with EPD and cleavage reactions were performed as published (8Ebright Y.W. Chen Y. Pendergrast P.S. Ebright R.H. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 10664-10670Google Scholar, 10Pai K.S. Bussiere D.E. Wang F. White S.W. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 10647-10652Google Scholar). When DNA cleavage is catalyzed by an Fe–EDTA-conjugated DNA-binding protein, cleavage occurs at the C1′ and/or C4′ bonds of the sugar moieties within 3–4 Å from the location of the hydroxyradical generator, i.e. the iron atom. This iron atom, in turn, is located at a distance of 14 Å from the α-carbon atom of the conjugated cysteine (this assumes a fully extended conformation of the EPD chain). Therefore, the cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone occurs at a net distance of 14 ± 3–4 Å from the α-carbon of the cysteine. This allowed a distance constraint to be assigned between the locations of the cysteine conjugates on RTP and the corresponding cleavage sites on the DNA. The cleavage data were converted to distance constraints for use with the X-PLOR program package. These distance constraints were converted to an energy term for the molecular force field by being modeled as NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) restraints, a standard procedure in NMR structure refinement. This procedure does not implicate a direct energetic relationship between the Fe–EDTA and the contacted bases. Rather, utilizing the NOE term is a convenient way to translate the affinity cleavage data into distance constraints that can be used for automatic construction of the model. The model consists of two dimers of RTP positioned 15 Å from the axis of the terminus DNA (modeled as a linear duplex of B form DNA) with the dyad axis positioned parallel to the center of each of the two subsites within the duplex. Energy minimization was then used to construct the protein-DNA model. Although there are several simulation techniques that could be used to generate this model, the most successful simulation involved defining each secondary structure feature of the protein and each planar sugar moiety and base of the DNA as a rigid body that was allowed six degrees of freedom: three translational and three rotational. The relative positions of the atoms within such a rigid body are not allowed to change independently. Powell minimization was then used to gradually and reproducibly minimize the overall structure of the simulated structure. To maintain the integrity of the individual structural elements within the model, the energy terms used within the force field included van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding potentials, and bond energies.Figure 4Points of contact between amino acid residues of RTP and nucleotide residues of the unipolar ( IRI ) and bipolar termini. The unipolar terminus data are from Pai et al. (21Pai K.S. Bussiere D.E. Wang F. Hutchison C.A.I.II White S.W. Bastia D. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 3164-3173Google Scholar).

Panel B, contact points on the bipolar terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To maintain the integrity of the planar nucleotide bases, a planarity term was included to prevent buckling of the bases. It should be noted that the models yielded by the simulation are qualitative in nature and do not approach the rigor of an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. For example, whereas the simulations will provide information on how each dimer binds its cognate DNA, it is impossible to exactly define specific side chain-base contacts from the resulting model. Preparation of cell extracts and reaction conditions were as published (12Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P. Bastia D. Cell.. 1989; 59: 667-674Google Scholar) with some modifications. This was carried out as described (11Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1996; 15: 2530-2539Google Scholar,13Mohanty B.K. Sa hoo T. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 3051-3059Google Scholar). These have been described before (14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar, 15Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M.L. Manna A.C. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 29138-29144Google Scholar). Our first goal was to derive a picture of the arrangement of two interacting dimers of RTP at the bipolar Ter . A priori, a comparison of the bipolar Ter with a unipolarTer (IRI) sequence showed significant homology at the core sequence and very little at the auxiliary sequence (Fig.1 A). A closer look suggested that the auxiliary site-equivalent of the bipolar Ter has significant sequence homology with core sequence, and thus the bipolarTer may have two core sequences arranged in a head-to-head manner (Ref. 7Meijer W.J.J. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. de Boer A.L. Venema G. Bron S. Mol. Microbiol... 1996; 19: 1295-1306Google Scholar, see Fig. 1 A). To determine some of the key base to amino acid contacts between the two RTP dimers and the bipolarTer DNA, the protein was complexed with 5′end-labeled DNA and treated with dimethyl sulfate as described (14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar), and the methylated bases were mapped after depurination and β-elimination in sequencing gels. The summary of the comparative methylation protection data is shown in Fig. 1 B. A representative protection data of the top strand of the bipolar terminus is shown in Fig. 1 C. An examination of the guanine contacts of the bipolar Tersite showed a symmetrical pattern as contrasted with that of the normal unipolar Ter (IR1) site that showed more G contacts at its core sequence than the auxiliary site (Fig. 1 B). This result prompted us to investigate in more detail the amino acid to nucleotide contacts between RTP and the bipolar Ter site as described below. Ideally, one needs to solve the x-ray crystal structure of the RTP·Ter complex to develop a detailed picture of how the protein interacts with DNA. However, the co-crystals of bipolarTer·RTP complex that have been generated up to this time diffract to ∼6 Å. Although further improvement in resolution and the eventual determination of the structure looks promising, 2S. White, personal communications. we decided to approach the problem in another way. We converted RTP to a site-directed chemical nuclease and used it to generate an amino acid to nucleotide cleavage map of the RTP-bipolar Ter complex. The structure of (S)-(2-pyridylthio) cysteaminyl-EDTA (EPD), the exchange reaction with cysteine-substituted RTP, and the expected pattern of cleavage when the iron atom contacts the major as contrasted with the minor groove of the DNA are shown in Fig.2. The cleavage data were used along with computational methods described below, to construct a three-dimensional model of the RTP-bipolar Ter complex. Such models have served useful purposes for studies of DNA-protein interaction in solution and provide a useful adjunct to the co-crystal structures of the complexes. Also, x-ray crystal structures provide a snapshot of the protein-DNA complex that is constrained by the crystal lattice, whereas affinity cleavage, while lacking the accuracy of a crystal structure, serves to illuminate the nature of the nucleotide to amino acids contacts both in real time and in solution (8Ebright Y.W. Chen Y. Pendergrast P.S. Ebright R.H. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 10664-10670Google Scholar). We generated affinity cleavage maps as described below. Distance constraints were obtained from the cleavage data and were used to generate a model of the RTP-bipolar Ter complex as described in detail in a later section. The residues 56, 59, and 63, belonging to the α3 DNA-recognition helix and the residues 16 and 74 from the α1 helix and the β2 strand, respectively were separately mutagenized to cysteines, and the resulting mutant forms were coupled to EPD. The protein–Fe–EDTA conjugates were used to cleave bipolarTer DNA that was singly end-labeled at the 5′-ends after adding ascorbate to the reaction mixture. The cleavage pattern of some representative derivatives is shown in Fig.3. Controls are described in the legend to Fig. 3. Nonderivatized RTP did not cleave DNA either in the presence or in the absence of ascorbate. Wild-type RTP treated with EPD did not cleave DNA with ascorbate. Derivatized RTP needed ascorbate to generate hydroxy radicals that in turn cleaved DNA. It should be noted that the cleavages are expected to shift either to the 5′ or the 3′ side from the location of the iron depending on which groove of the DNA double helix contacted the iron atom (Ref. 16Oakley M.G. Dervan P.B. Science.. 1990; 248: 847-850Google Scholar; see Fig. 2). Thus residue 74, upon derivatization, produced a cleavage pattern that was shifted to the 3′ side, consistent with the contact of the β2 strands at the minor groove of Ter DNA (Fig.4). The residues 16 and 63 both contactedTer DNA at the center (Figs. 3 and 4). This result is consistent with the fact that Arg-16 and Glu-63 are located only 9 Å apart in the crystal structure of RTP (5Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. White S.W. Cell.. 1995; 80: 651-660Google Scholar). To make sure that the cleavage pattern was specific, we mutagenized the G residue of the bipolar Ter contacted by amino acid 56 to a T. This mutation on the bipolar Ter DNA caused the specific cleavage pattern to disappear and generated a more randomized and dispersed cleavage pattern in the mutant Ter (Fig.3 C), thus supporting the notion that the residue 56 to G contact was specific. It should be noted that the G contact described above is known to be necessary for stable binding of RTP to DNA (14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar). Residue 59, after derivatization, promoted several foci of cleavage on both strands of DNA (not shown) as contrasted with the simple cleavage patterns of derivatized 16 and 63 (Fig. 3, A andB). As in the previously published structure of the RTP-unipolar Ter (10Pai K.S. Bussiere D.E. Wang F. White S.W. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 10647-10652Google Scholar), the residues 16 and 63 of each RTP monomer interacted with the center of symmetry within each Bipolar Ter subsite (Fig. 4). A, B and C, D refer to the monomeric subunits of the two dimers of RTP (Fig. 4). The computational modeling of RTP-bipolar Ter complex is shown in Fig. 5. The α3 helices of both dimers are inserted into the major groove of the DNA duplex; the anti-parallel β-ribbons straddle the phosphate backbone and insert into the minor groove. The N-terminal arms are also properly positioned for interactions with the phosphate backbone if they were dropped (the arms are raised by crystal packing forces in the crystal structure and therefore remain in that position in the model). The major groove is forced open by the insertion of the α3 helices, and this necessitated a global compensation in the DNA structure by a shrinkage of the minor groove. This distortion disrupts the normal base pairing. This distortion in the DNA predominated near the center of the RTP dimer and at the ends of the anti-parallel β-ribbon. Overall, there was only a slight net curvature of the DNA consistent with published results (17Kralicek A.V. Wilson P.K. Ralston G.B. Wake R.G. King G.F. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 590-596Google Scholar). The distortions to the DNA were more equally distributed throughout the entire terminus, rather than there being more severe distortion within the core subsite (Fig. 5). A feasible dimer-dimer interaction can be investigated by rotating one dimer by 8–10 Å around the DNA axis. Whereas subsequent investigations are warranted, it is tempting to postulate that the bipolar terminus exhibits the bipolar blockage of the replication fork, because it is composed of two strong-binding subsites. Examination of the sequence of this terminus reveals that these two subsites, called core A and core B, show a strong similarity to the core subsite within the IRI (unipolar Ter) sequence. The critical guanines found in the core B (IRIB) subsite are also found here in equivalent positions, suggesting that each subsite within the bipolar terminus is indeed a “core”-type of subsite. This strong/strong binding arrangement yields a plausible explanation for the behavior of this terminus. Also, the pattern of contacts within both the subsites of the bipolar terminus is symmetrical. Interestingly, there are no contacts between residue 74 and the DNA in the border region between the subsites in the bipolar terminus. This is in contrast to the IRI terminus where residue 74 of thed-monomer makes several contacts. Whereas the exact reasons for this difference in binding remains elusive, it does show that RTP binds to unipolar and bipolar termini differently. A series of previous work has shown that two RTP dimers bind to the normal unipolar terminus in a cooperative manner (14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar, 18Lewis P.J. Ralston G.B. Christopherson R.I. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol... 1990; 214: 73-84Google Scholar, 19Langley D.B. Smith M.T. Lewis P.J. Wake R.G. Mol. Microbiol... 1993; 10: 771-779Google Scholar). First, the higher affinity core site is filled by one dimer and then the overlapping, weaker auxiliary site is filled by the second dimer. We wished to compare the pattern of RTP binding to the bipolar terminus site with that of the unipolar site. The IRI fragment (Fig.6, panel A, lane 1) showed the typical two-step mobility shift in the presence of RTP with the first shift corresponding to filling of the core site and with the second shift corresponding to filling of both the core and auxiliary site (Fig. 6, panel A, lanes 2–12). The fragment containing the bipolar terminus (Fig. 6, panel B, lane 1) when mixed with RTP also showed a two-step filling of its sites in a stepwise manner (Fig. 6, lanes 2–12). A very faint third shift was observed (7Meijer W.J.J. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. de Boer A.L. Venema G. Bron S. Mol. Microbiol... 1996; 19: 1295-1306Google Scholar), which might be because of aggregation of more RTP dimers on the site. We wished to characterize the bipolar terminus with regard to its ability to arrest replication forks in vitro and also to map the points of arrest of the newly synthesized DNA. Previously we have used a surrogate in vitro replication system of E. coli (4Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar, 14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar) to study the replication fork arrest by RTP because to date, active preparations of the DnaB homolog of B. subtilis have not been purified by any laboratory. Moreover, an efficient replication system that operates in crude extracts of B. subtilis has not been developed to date. We used four templates in this study. Fragments containing the IRI (TerI) site in either orientation were cloned in pUC18 plasmid and the bipolar terminus was cloned in pUC18 and pUC19 in either orientation with respect to origin of replication to generate four templates namely pUC18-IRI, pUC18-IRI Rev., pUC18-Bipolar, and pUC19-Bipolar for study (see “Experimental Procedures”). The plasmid DNA templates were replicated in vitro using theE. coli cell extracts in the presence or absence of different concentrations of RTP and the products were analyzed in a denaturing urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The pUC18-IRI Rev. template, containing the IRI site in nonfunctional orientation with respect to the origin, was replicated in the presence of various amounts of RTP (Fig. 7, panel A, lanes 1–4). As expected, RTP did not block the replication fork in this template (Fig. 7, panel A,lanes 2–4). On the other hand replication of the pUC18-IRI template containing the IRI site in functional orientation with respect to the replication origin, in the presence of various amounts of RTP showed a distinct termination product (Fig. 7, panel B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–4). A major band of about 600 bases and a minor band between 500 and 600 bp were observed. We have titrated RTP concentrations and have noticed that at high concentrations of RTP, the intensities of the bands corresponding to the replication fork arrest in pUC18-IRI template were reduced, either because of multiple stops or because of overall inhibition of replication (data not shown). The pUC18-Bipolar template replicated in the presence of 0.3, 0.6, and 2.4-fold RTP over template concentration showed a major blocked product smaller than 500 bases representing the leading strand block product and smaller blocked products of about 400 bases representing the lagging strand block products (compare Fig. 7, panel C, lane 1 with lanes 2–4, arrows). With high concentrations of RTP, the intensity of arrested products decreased and a greater number of bands appeared and total replication also decreased (lane 4). The pUC19-Bipolar template was replicated in the absence (Fig. 7, panel D, lane 1) or presence of 0.3, 0.6, and 2.4-fold RTP (Fig. 7, panel D, lanes 2–4). As in the case of the pUC18-Bipolar template, the pUC19-Bipolar template also showed replication arrest products. The major blocked product smaller than 500 bases represents the leading strand block product whereas minor blocked products of about 400 bases represent lagging strand block products. At high RTP concentrations, the number of bands increased and total replication seemed to decrease. It may be noted that the RTP concentrations needed to show blockage in pUC18-Bipolar and pUC19-Bipolar templates was lower in comparison to that needed in pUC18-IRI and pUC18-IR Rev. templates. We analyzed the labeled in vitro replication products further to determine the exact nucleotide sequence where replication was arrested in pUC18-IRI, pUC18-Bipolar, and pUC19-Bipolar templates. The pUC18-IRI template containing a unique XbaI site 140 bp upstream of the IRI site was digested with XbaI. The pUC18-Bipolar and pUC19-Bipolar templates containing twoPvuII sites as in the case pUC18/19 (at nucleotides 306 and 628) were digested with PvuII enzyme. The digestion products were run in a denaturing urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel along with pUC18-Bipolar sequencing ladder (data not shown). Fig. 11 Ashows the nucleotide sequence of IRI, where the leading strand is arrested by the RTP·IRI complex. The stop site matches the border of the minimal effective sequence needed to arrest the helicase (14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar,15Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M.L. Manna A.C. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 29138-29144Google Scholar). Fig. 11, panel B shows the nucleotide sequences on both sides of the bipolar terminus where replication fork is blocked by the RTP-Bipolar Ter complex. We have shown previously that RTP arrests replication by inhibiting the activity ofE. coli replicative helicase, DnaB (4Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar, 14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar). We wished to investigate the arrest of helicase in both orientations of the bipolar terminus. M13mp18 and M13mp19 clones containing the IRI site have been described (4Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar). The M13mp18-Bipolar and M13mp13-Bipolar templates were hybridized to 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides to generate the forked helicase substrates and were assayed for DNA unwinding activity of DnaB in the absence and presence of RTP. The gels were quantitated with a phosphorimager, and data were plotted as a graph in Fig.8. As expected, DnaB was arrested by RTP on the M13mp19-IRI template but not on the template M13mp18-IRI (4Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar,14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar). Unwinding was blocked on the M13mp19-Bipolar template (Fig. 8) as in M13mp19-IRI. However, in the case of the M13mp18-Bipolar template, RTP blocked oligonucleotide release by about 50% in contrast with only an ∼10% release in the case of M13mp18-IRI. Thus, although the bipolar terminus blocked replication and helicase activity from both orientations, one orientation of the terminus blocked the helicase more efficiently than the other. We further investigated helicase blockage by the bipolar terminus with heteroduplex substrates using a technique developed by us (14Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO, J... 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar, 15Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M.L. Manna A.C. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 29138-29144Google Scholar). The M13 universal forward primer labeled at the 5′ position was annealed to the four single-stranded DNA templates and was extended by DNA polymerase (sequenase) in the presence of all four dNTPs and one ddNTP (Fig. 9 A). Four sets of reactions were carried out, each containing a different ddNTP. Because equimolar amounts of DnaC stimulate DnaB helicase activity (20Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 2469-2475Google Scholar), we performed th"

To test this hypothesis, we injected a linearized, methylated, and partially single-stranded reporter plasmid into the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes and followed changes in the transcriptional activity after DNA replication. We find that dependent on Gal4-VP16, the action of DNA methyltransferase, and replication-coupled chromatin assembly DNA replication provides a window of time in which regulatory factors can activate or repress gene activity. Demethylation in the promoter region near the GAL4 binding sites of the newly synthesized DNA did not occur even though the Gal4 binding sites were occupied and transcription was activated.

Large repressor complexes containing methyl-CpG-binding proteins and histone deacetylases have been characterized (9Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N.

Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), directly linking CpG methylation to transcriptional repression. To achieve the precise epigenetic control of gene expression, the mechanisms of maintenance methylation, de novo methylation, and demethylation must be strictly regulated. Several mechanisms have been proposed to keep a promoter in a CpG island methylation-free state (reviewed in Ref. 12Hsieh C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Active demethylation occurs during early mouse development (13Oswald J. Engemann S. Lane N. Mayer W. Olek A. Fundele R. Dean W. Reik W. Walter J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 475-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, the existence of proteins exerting demethylase activity has been controversial and remains obscure (Ref. 14Wolffe A.P. Jones P.L. Wade P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5894-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and references therein). Alternatively, DNA replication might be involved in controlling the methylation state of promoters (15Matsuo K. Silke J. Georgiev O. Marti P. Giovannini N. Rungger D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Replicative processes might provide a window of opportunity for transcription factors to bind to hemimethylated DNA and thereby prevent remethylation and subsequent gene repression. Transcription factor binding might interfere with the remethylating activity of DNA methyltransferases at the replication fork (16Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslawsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Lin I.G. Tomzynski T.J. Ou Q. Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2343-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transcription factor binding during the replication of DNA leads to subsequent demethylation concomitant with DNA replication (18Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). InXenopus eggs it has been shown that replication, together with factor binding but not ongoing transcription, results in partial locus-specific demethylation (15Matsuo K. Silke J. Georgiev O. Marti P. Giovannini N. Rungger D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternatively, nonmethylated CpG islands may result from a transcriptionally active gene, the sequences of which also function as an origin of DNA replication at a very early developmental stage (19Antequera F. Bird A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R661-R667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). All enzymatic activities and co-factors necessary for efficient DNA replication are present in the Xenopus oocyte. Although oocytes do not initiate DNA replication on double-stranded DNA, they can convert single-stranded DNA into double-stranded DNA and support the concomitant assembly of chromatin. Previous studies using single-stranded unmethylated DNA showed the relief of nucleosomal repression by transcriptional activators and that the assembly of transcription complexes and replication-coupled chromatin assembly are highly competitive processes (20Almouzni G. Mechali M. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 17: 2033-2047Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we examine whether transcription factors compete with the DNA methylation maintenance machinery on CpG-methylated templates directly at the replication fork and whether this competition can determine the transcriptional fate of a reporter gene. Our approach is first to in vitro methylate linearized template DNA and subsequently to use the enzyme exonuclease III to generate unidirectional deletions. The modified DNA is then microinjected into frog oocytes. Using this partially single-stranded methylated template, we find that the stable binding of transcriptional activators or repressors during the synthesis of the second DNA strand programs the gene to remain either active or repressed. This programming is, under our experimental conditions, independent of complete demethylation near the binding site. Hence, factor binding during the time window of second strand synthesis might tag the sites for complete demethylation once replication is completed. The construct pGEMH2BLuc used in this study is derived from the vector PGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega). The plasmid was cut withEcoRI and HindIII and ligated with anEcoRI/HindIII fragment from the plasmid pE4 containing five Gal4 binding sites and the adenovirus E4 promoter (kindly provided by Mike Carey, University of California, Los Angeles). The minimal adenovirus E4 promoter was replaced with the TaqI/MluI fragment of the histone H2B promoter. The luciferase gene sequence ranging from +1 to +200 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using specific primers containing BamHI and SmaI restriction sites and was subsequently cloned into the SmaI/BamHI linearized vector. Expression plasmids encoding fusion proteins of MeCP2 and Gal4-VP16 used in this study are described in Ref.9Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar. Templates for second strand synthesis in vitro and in vivo were generated using exonuclease III (exo III)1 (Promega), which produces unidirectional deletions starting at the 3′ end. To protect one end from digestion, the plasmid pGEMH2Bluc was cut withKpnI and SmaI. Deletions were produced starting from the SmaI end and heading into the regulatory sites of the H2B promoter and upstream Gal4 sites. 10 μg of the linear fragment were incubated with 500 units of exonuclease III at 37 °C for 10 min in a buffer containing 66 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.66 mm MgCl2. To stop the reaction, samples were heat-inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min. The lengths of the deletions were determined by the treatment of aliquots from the reactions with mung bean nuclease to cleave single-stranded DNA overhangs and by comparing them with the size of the wild-type unmodified template. After purification of the modified DNA by standard methods, the fragments were either microinjected into oocytes or subjected to second strand synthesis in a cell-free egg extract derived from Xenopus laevis. All CpG sites in the plasmid PGEMH2BLuc were methylated in vitro using SssI methylase following the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). After phenol-chloroform extraction, the DNA was precipitated. The efficiency and amount of methylation were checked by restriction analysis with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleaseHpaII. Female frogs were primed with 200 IU of human choriogonadotropin, and eggs were dejellied and crushed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol as described (21Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 17: 2033-2047Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 5 μl of egg extract (50 μg of protein), 500 μm each dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, and 0.5 μCi of [32P]dATP were mixed with 500 ng of exonuclease III-digested template, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. The buffer system used contained 10 nm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mmcreatine phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, and 10 ng creatine kinase. The reactions were stopped with proteinase K and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were further purified using the Rapid PCR Purification system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Oocytes preparation and DNA and RNA microinjections were performed as described (22Li Q. Imhof A. Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5634-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed mRNA (2–5 ng) encoding the Gal4-hybrid protein was injected into the cytoplasm, and 6–8 h later 1 ng of DNA template was injected into each oocyte nucleus. Total RNA of the injected samples was precipitated, and the pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The transcription was monitored by primer extension as described (22Li Q. Imhof A. Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5634-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide complementary to the luciferase gene from +126 to +154 was used for primer extension analyses (5′-ATGTTCACCTCGATATGTGCATCTGTAAA-3′). Oocytes (20/sample) were injected with mRNA and template DNA as described above and homogenized in DNase I digestion buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol). The oocyte suspension was divided into four fractions and subsequently digested with 10–100 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 min and was stopped with 1 volume of 1% SDS/20 mm EDTA. The samples were then treated with 3 μl of DNase I-free RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C, and proteinase K was added for 2 h at 55 °C. Proteins were extracted with 1 volume of phenol-chloroform, and the clear supernatants were precipitated with isopropanol and washed with 70% ethanol. The DNA pellets were dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) and subjected to restriction digestion with 20 units of KpnI/sample. Digested DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels, blotted onto Hybond-N membranes, and hybridized with a random primed probe comprising the KpnI/HindIII fragment of the subcloned Gal4-H2B-Luciferase insert. Injected oocytes (20/sample) were homogenized in MNase buffer (DNase I buffer + 3 mm CaCl2). The oocyte extract was divided into four fractions and subsequently digested with increasing amounts (1–10 units) of MNase (Worthington) at room temperature for 15 min. Reactions were stopped with 1 volume of a buffer containing 1% SDS/20 mm EDTA. DNA was prepared according to standard methods and analyzed by electrophoresis, blotted, and hybridized as described above. To examine whether transacting factor binding interferes with the process of DNA remethylation during the time course of replicative processes, we used a single-stranded methylated H2B minimal promoter fused to five upstream Gal4 binding sites to assay for second strand synthesis and transcription (Fig.1 A). Because it is presently not possible to methylate cytosines efficiently within CpG sequences of single-stranded DNA using a bacterially derived methylase, we methylated double-stranded DNA and then generated heteroduplex DNA using exonuclease III, which creates unidirectional deletions starting from the 3′ end of the template. After linearization of the plasmid DNA with SmaI and KpnI and subsequent treatment with exonuclease III, we were able to generate deletions ranging from 400 to 3000 base pairs (Fig. 1 B). Using a low spin supernatant derived from X. laevis eggs (containing the functional replication machinery) we were able to demonstrate incorporation of radioactive nucleotides into newly synthesized DNA (Fig.2, A and B). Cleavage with HpaII and comparison of methylated and nonmethylated templates shows that there is no major change in the methylation status of all HpaII sites in the H2B promoter after DNA synthesis (Fig. 2, C and D,lanes 4-6). Aphidicolin sensitivity indicates that DNA polymerase α is responsible for the polymerizing activity (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 10-12). We conclude that in vitro methylated and further modified templates are subjected to second strand synthesis carried out by DNA polymerase α-primase.Figure 2Exo III-modified DNA is subjected to second strand synthesis carried out by DNA polymerase α present in X. laevis egg extract.

Weintraub H. McKnight S.L. Nature. 1983; 302: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of this effect is not known and may be explained by a decreased affinity of transacting factors for their cognate sequences. Transcription of microinjected linearized DNA into frog oocytes is restored by co-injection of strong activators like Gal4-VP16 (Fig.3 A, lanes 8,9, 12, 13, 16, and17). In contrast, when we use a supercoiled circular template, the stimulation of transcription caused by the activator is less pronounced (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2and 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Template methylation abolishes transcription completely in the absence of the activator (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7) (25Kass S.U. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 157-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Gal4-VP16 is capable of binding to methylated DNA when present before chromatin assembly rendering the microinjected templates transcriptionally active (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8,9, 12, 13, 16, and17). In addition, microinjected linear template DNA is sufficiently stable in the oocyte to allow efficient packaging into nucleosomal arrays during an incubation of 12 h after injection (Fig. 3 B). The key question to be addressed in our assays is whether binding of a transcriptional activator to its cognate sequence can overcome transcriptional repression caused by cytosine methylation concomitant with replication-coupled chromatin assembly during the step of DNA synthesis. We microinjected the RNA for Gal4-VP16 6 h prior to the injection of template DNA to enable the activator to be present during the synthesis of the new strand and replication-coupled positioning of the nucleosomes. The presence of Gal4-VP16 renders both the methylated double-stranded control template and the partially single-stranded methylated template transcriptionally active (Fig.4 A, lanes 7 and9). Transcription depends on the activation domain of VP16 (Fig. 4 C, compare lanes 2 and 3 withlanes 6 and 7). We next addressed the effects of the kinetics of chromatin assembly on transcription under these conditions. Double-stranded DNA is slowly packaged into chromatin, whereas single-stranded DNA is rapidly assembled into nucleosomes because of a replication-coupled mechanism (20Almouzni G. Mechali M. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 17: 2033-2047Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test the dependence of chromatinization in our system, RNA encoding Gal4-VP16 and CpG-methylated DNA were injected at different time points (as shown in the flow diagram in Fig.5 A). When present before chromatin assembly, Gal4-VP16 leads to transcriptional activation of both the double-stranded and exo III-treated template (Fig.5 B, lanes 1-4). But when the activator RNA is injected during or after replication-coupled chromatin assembly, the activating potential of Gal4-VP16 is decreased in the case of exo III-treated DNA (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7 and8 and lanes 11 and 12). As shown in a DNase I hypersensitivity assay (Fig. 5 D), the accessibility of Gal4-VP16 to its binding sites (and therefore the transactivating potential) decreases once rapid chromatinization after the injection of exo III-treated DNA occurs. DNase I-hypersensitive sites around the H2B promoter are lost when activator RNA is injected 2 h later than the partially single-stranded template (Fig. 5 D, lanes 7 and 8 and lanes 11 and 12).Figure 5Rapid chromatin assembly on the partially single-stranded methylated template leads to transcriptional repression. A, flow diagram showing the time course of RNA and DNA injection experiments. B, oocytes were microinjected with 2 and 5 ng of Gal4-VP16 RNA prior to template DNA (panel I, pre), at the same time with the DNA template (panel II, t=0), or 2 h after the DNA (panel III, post 2 h). Double-stranded was compared with exo III-treated DNA (lanes 1,2, 5, 6, 9, and10 versus lanes 3, 4,7, 8, 11, and 12). A quantification of the results is shown in C. A.U., arbitrary units. D, DNase I-hypersensitive site analysis for the conditions shown in B. After an incubation of 12 h the oocytes were crushed in DNase I buffer and subsequently treated with increasing amounts of DNase I (Promega). The reactions were stopped, and DNA was purified and digested withKpnI to counteract any possible religations that may have occurred in the oocyte. After electrophoresis DNA fragments were blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane and hybridized against a randomly labeled probe hybridizing from the beginning of the luciferase sequence to the Gal4 binding sites. Arrows denote the sites located in the promoter region of the template, which seem to be hypersensitive against DNase I treatment. H2BLuc denotes the position of the test RNA, and H4 denotes the position of the endogenous H4 RNA as an RNA recovery control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether second strand synthesis of methylated DNA provides a “window of opportunity” to assemble either an active or a repressive transcriptional state, we microinjected RNA encoding the MeCP2 repression domain, fused to a Gal4-DNA binding domain, into oocytes before injection of the nuclease-modified template DNA. MeCP2 has been reported to repress transcription in vivo by recruiting histone deacetylases (9Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar,10Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenmann R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). Incubation of the injected oocytes with increasing amounts of trichostatin A, a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases, relieved the transcriptional inhibition because of endogenous histone-deacetylase repressor complexes recruited to methylated DNA as compared with injection of non-trichostatin A-treated oocytes (Fig.6, compare lane 2 withlanes 3-6). However, in the presence of the hybrid MeCP2-Gal4, this alleviation of repression by trichostatin A is less pronounced (lanes 8-11). One explanation for this finding is the specific targeting of abundant protein repressor complexes to Gal4 binding sites upstream of the histone H2B promoter. The process of replication or second strand synthesis is therefore a time window for commitment of the transcriptional status toward repression. To determine whether binding of Gal4-VP16 precluded remethylation of newly synthesized templates, we performed restriction analyses to study the methylation status of microinjected DNA after the microinjection of either double-stranded or exonuclease III-treated single-stranded templates (Fig.7). It is apparent that the bulk of template treated with exonuclease is size-reduced (Fig. 7 A, compare lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, when injected into oocytes followed by purification and subsequent restriction, the full-length HindIII fragment appears, indicating the resynthesis of the second DNA strand (Fig.7 B, lanes 4, 10, and 12). The sensitivity of HpaII against restriction cleavage is restored in the case of the DNA that is injected in single-stranded methylated form (compare lanes 6 and 12). This indicates that no complete demethylation of both strands occurs either in the absence (Fig. 7 B) or presence (Fig. 7 C) of functional Gal4-VP16. On the contrary, no apparent de novomethylation is observed for the injected nonmethylated template (Fig.7 B, lanes 4-6), from which we conclude that demethylation is not induced by transcription factor binding near the HpaII sites within the H2B promoter in the frog oocyte during ongoing synthesis of the second strand under our experimental conditions. There are two major findings made in this study. First, transcriptional activators or repressors are capable of programming the transcriptional state in the context of methylated CpG dinucleotides within regulatory sites during DNA synthesis. Second, upon binding of transactivators, no demethylation events were observed on newly synthesized CpG-methylated DNA, indicating that the target sites for DNMTs are accessible even in the presence of site-specific DNA-binding proteins. Components of the DNA methylation machinery such as DNMT1 associate with replication foci (26Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30: 243-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNMT1 forms a complex with proliferating cell nuclear antigen in vivo (27Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibition of DNMT1 diminishes DNA replication, and DNMT1 interacts with histone deacetylases and the transcriptional repressor DMAP1 at replication foci (28Knox J.D. Araujo F.D.

Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that remethylation of newly synthesized CpG islands is directly coupled to the migrating replication fork. After DNA methylation and once chromatin is assembled, methyl-CpG-binding proteins could recruit histone deacetylases (9Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar, 10Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenmann R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). Methyl-CpG-binding proteins like methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 and -3 have been reported to bind hemimethylated DNA at the replication fork in late S phase (30Tatematsu K.I. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DNA methylation at specific cytosine residues might also serve as a signal recognized by the replication machinery, and this may lead to initiation of replication at more specific genomic sites. This mechanism may be used only by a subset of origins because not every origin of replication appears to have methylated CpG sequences (31Rein T. Kobayashi T. Malott M. Leffak M. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25792-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Little is known concerning factors that are involved in regulation of the cellular methylation pattern. DNA methylation at the specific dinucleotide sequence “CpG” plays a key regulatory role for the transcriptional activity for some loci and potentially for other nuclear processes like replication, DNA repair, and recombination (31Rein T. Kobayashi T. Malott M. Leffak M. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25792-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Hare J.T. Taylor J.H. Cell Biophys. 1989; 15: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, aberrant methylation of CpG islands in the vicinity of active promoters correlates strongly with the escape from normal cell cycle regulation and therefore oncogenesis (34Volkers N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 789-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, these CpG islands are methylation-free except for sequences located on the inactive X chromosome where CpG methylation is part of the cellular dosage compensation mechanism in females (reviewed in Ref. 35Richardson B. Yung R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 134: 333-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Progress has been made in elucidating the underlying mechanisms for specification and maintenance of an unmethylated CpG island. Protein-DNA interactions at specific CpG dinucleotides are crucial for defining the unmethylated state. In those studies the oriP region of the Epstein-Barr virus was used to demonstrate a site-specific demethylation once the specific factor Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 was bound followed by subsequent replication (18Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). DNA demethylation was shown to be a two-step process requiring transacting factor association and replication of a specific sequence. Other transcription factors were shown to operate in an analogous manner in other systems. It has been demonstrated for X. laevis embryos that a massive demethylation occurs at specific regulatory sites of reporter genes after the mid-blastula transition (15Matsuo K. Silke J. Georgiev O. Marti P. Giovannini N. Rungger D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the hypothesis that the replicative processes concomitant with the binding of transcription factors play a role in keeping a CpG sequence free of methylation. An alternative hypothesis is that active demethylating proteins are involved in establishing the demethylated state. The existence of such demethylases has been controversial (10Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenmann R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar, 11Wade P.A. Gregonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 36Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 18: 579-583Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). At present, to our knowledge none of the studies described attempted to address the question of how the transcriptional state of a gene is affected once the regulatory site for a transcription factor has been methylated and DNA synthesis of the second strand is ongoing. Two possible scenarios can be envisaged. (i) Binding of the transcriptional regulator and the remethylating activity like DNMT1 would compete for their target sites, depending on the affinity toward the particular site, and the influence of remethylation may dominate over transcription factor binding, resulting in transcriptional repression. (ii) Another possibility is that the transacting factor would dominate over remethylating activities and therefore program the transcriptional state, allowing rapid initiation of transcription. It is technically challenging to set up an experimental system that allows the investigation of newly synthesized methylated DNA and its effect on gene transcription. Because of the low activity of bacterial CpG methylases on single-stranded DNA, in vitroCpG methylation of single-stranded circular DNA is not efficient. To circumvent this problem we linearized plasmid DNA harboring regulatory sequences and then in vitro methylated the template DNA with the methylase SssI. To generate a partially single-stranded methylated template, we digested the linear DNA with exonuclease III, giving rise to unidirectional deletions of one strand as a function of time. The resulting heteroduplex DNA was used as a template in oocyte microinjection studies. From initial studies using oocyte microinjections, we concluded that linearized DNA is sufficiently stable in the oocyte after a 12-h incubation and is assembled into nucleosomes (see Fig. 3 B). However, as reported by others, linearization of supercoiled plasmid DNA leads to a decrease in transcriptional efficiency (23Harland R.M. Weintraub H. McKnight S.L. Nature. 1983; 302: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our studies confirmed these previous findings, but it became clear that binding of a strong transcriptional activator such as Gal4-VP16 is capable of overcoming the negative influence of template linearization on transcription. We tested other systems such as the thyroid hormone receptor-β-promoter and found that transcriptional efficiency is completely lost after linearization (data not shown). Using single-stranded circular DNA as a template for transcription, earlier studies have demonstrated that transcription complex formation and nucleosome assembly, involving all four core histones, are competitive processes (21Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 17: 2033-2047Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Via its interaction with the replication protein-proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the chromatin assembly factor-1 directs chromatin assembly of newly replicated DNA toward repression (37Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 38Moggs J.G. Grandi P. Quivy J.P. Jonsson Z.O. Hubscher U. Becker P.B. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that heavily methylated DNA-like repetitive sequences and satellite DNA replicate late in S phase and that transcription of these sequences is down-regulated. It is tempting to speculate that in order to render methylated genes transcriptionally active replication processes should provide a time window allowing genes to be programmed by functional transcription complexes. From our studies it became clear that the binding of transcriptional activators or repressors during the formation of the second strand and targeting them to a specific regulatory site are sufficient to direct the transcriptional status of a methylated promoter, perhaps by directly interfering with the chromatin assembly factor-1 chromatin assembly pathway.
