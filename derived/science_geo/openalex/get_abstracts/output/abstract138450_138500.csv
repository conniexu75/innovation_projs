https://openalex.org/W2124566107,"The worldwide incidence, morbidity, and mortality of allergic asthma are increasing. The pathophysiological features of allergic asthma are thought to result from the aberrant expansion of CD4(+) T cells producing the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5, although a necessary role for these cytokines in allergic asthma has not been demonstrable. The type 2 cytokine IL-13, which shares a receptor component and signaling pathways with IL-4, was found to be necessary and sufficient for the expression of allergic asthma. IL-13 induces the pathophysiological features of asthma in a manner that is independent of immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Thus, IL-13 is critical to allergen-induced asthma but operates through mechanisms other than those that are classically implicated in allergic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2125805192,"The pathogenesis of asthma reflects, in part, the activity of T cell cytokines. Murine models support participation of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the IL-4 receptor in asthma. Selective neutralization of IL-13, a cytokine related to IL-4 that also binds to the α chain of the IL-4 receptor, ameliorated the asthma phenotype, including airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophil recruitment, and mucus overproduction. Administration of either IL-13 or IL-4 conferred an asthma-like phenotype to nonimmunized T cell–deficient mice by an IL-4 receptor α chain–dependent pathway. This pathway may underlie the genetic associations of asthma with both the human 5q31 locus and the IL-4 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2078037416,"cAMP (3',5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger that in eukaryotic cells induces physiological responses ranging from growth, differentiation, and gene expression to secretion and neurotransmission. Most of these effects have been attributed to the binding of cAMP to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Here, a family of cAMP-binding proteins that are differentially distributed in the mammalian brain and body organs and that exhibit both cAMP-binding and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains is reported. These cAMP-regulated GEFs (cAMP-GEFs) bind cAMP and selectively activate the Ras superfamily guanine nucleotide binding protein Rap1A in a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent manner. Our findings suggest the need to reformulate concepts of cAMP-mediated signaling to include direct coupling to Ras superfamily signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2147869016,"Mechanosensitive ion channels play a critical role in transducing physical stresses at the cell membrane into an electrochemical response. The MscL family of large-conductance mechanosensitive channels is widely distributed among prokaryotes and may participate in the regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell. In an effort to better understand the structural basis for the function of these channels, the structure of the MscL homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined by x-ray crystallography to 3.5 angstroms resolution. This channel is organized as a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane alpha helices and a third cytoplasmic alpha helix. From the extracellular side, a water-filled opening approximately 18 angstroms in diameter leads into a pore lined with hydrophilic residues which narrows at the cytoplasmic side to an occluded hydrophobic apex that may act as the channel gate. This structure may serve as a model for other mechanosensitive channels, as well as the broader class of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2044080285,"Porous silica, niobia, and titania with three-dimensional structures patterned over multiple length scales were prepared by combining micromolding, polystyrene sphere templating, and cooperative assembly of inorganic sol-gel species with amphiphilic triblock copolymers. The resulting materials show hierarchical ordering over several discrete and tunable length scales ranging from 10 nanometers to several micrometers. The respective ordered structures can be independently modified by choosing different mold patterns, latex spheres, and block copolymers. The examples presented demonstrate the compositional and structural diversities that are possible with this simple approach."
https://openalex.org/W2077634599,"The regular cyclic fluctuations in vertebrate numbers have intrigued scientists for more than 70 years, and yet the cause of such cycles has not been clearly demonstrated. Red grouse populations in Britain exhibit cyclic fluctuations in abundance, with periodic crashes. The hypothesis that these fluctuations are caused by the impact of a nematode parasite on host fecundity was tested by experimentally reducing parasite burdens in grouse. Treatment of the grouse population prevented population crashes, demonstrating that parasites were the cause of the cyclic fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2084608838,"FhuA, the receptor for ferrichrome-iron in Escherichia coli , is a member of a family of integral outer membrane proteins, which, together with the energy-transducing protein TonB, mediate the active transport of ferric siderophores across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The three-dimensional structure of FhuA is presented here in two conformations: with and without ferrichrome-iron at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.5 angstroms, respectively. FhuA is a β barrel composed of 22 antiparallel β strands. In contrast to the typical trimeric arrangement found in porins, FhuA is monomeric. Located within the β barrel is a structurally distinct domain, the “cork,” which mainly consists of a four-stranded β sheet and four short α helices. A single lipopolysaccharide molecule is noncovalently associated with the membrane-embedded region of the protein. Upon binding of ferrichrome-iron, conformational changes are transduced to the periplasmic pocket of FhuA, signaling the ligand-loaded status of the receptor. Sequence homologies and mutagenesis data are used to propose a structural mechanism for TonB-dependent siderophore-mediated transport across the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2018312069,"Cocaine regulates the transcription factor CREB (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate response element binding protein) in rat nucleus accumbens, a brain region that is important for addiction. Overexpression of CREB in this region decreases the rewarding effects of cocaine and makes low doses of the drug aversive. Conversely, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant CREB increases the rewarding effects of cocaine. Altered transcription of dynorphin likely contributes to these effects: Its expression is increased by overexpression of CREB and decreased by overexpression of mutant CREB. Moreover, blockade of κ opioid receptors (on which dynorphin acts) antagonizes the negative effect of CREB on cocaine reward. These results identify an intracellular cascade—culminating in gene expression—through which exposure to cocaine modifies subsequent responsiveness to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2012972418,"CTLA-4, a negative regulator of T cell function, was found to associate with the T cell receptor (TCR) complex ζ chain in primary T cells. The association of TCRζ with CTLA-4, reconstituted in 293 transfectants, was enhanced by p56 lck -induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Coexpression of the CTLA-4–associated tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, resulted in dephosphorylation of TCRζ bound to CTLA-4 and abolished the p56 lck -inducible TCRζ–CTLA-4 interaction. Thus, CTLA-4 inhibits TCR signal transduction by binding to TCRζ and inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation after T cell activation. These findings have broad implications for the negative regulation of T cell function and T cell tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2109208582,"Brief bath application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) to hippocampal slices produces long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in CA1 that is (1) sensitive to postnatal age, (2) saturable, (3) induced postsynaptically, (4) reversible, and (5) not associated with a change in paired pulse facilitation. Chemically induced LTD (Chem-LTD) and homosynaptic LTD are mutually occluding, suggesting a common expression mechanism. Using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we found that induction of chem-LTD produces a persistent dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors at serine 845, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrate, but not at serine 831, a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). These results suggest that dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors is an expression mechanism for LTD and indicate an unexpected role of PKA in the postsynaptic modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2042704418,"During T cell activation, the engagement of costimulatory molecules is often crucial to the development of an effective immune response, but the mechanism by which this is achieved is not known. Here, it is shown that beads attached to the surface of a T cell translocate toward the interface shortly after the start of T cell activation. This movement appears to depend on myosin motor proteins and requires the engagement of the major costimulatory receptor pairs, B7-CD28 and ICAM-1–LFA-1. This suggests that the engagement of costimulatory receptors triggers an active accumulation of molecules at the interface of the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell, which then increases the overall amplitude and duration of T cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2066445645,"Sea ice exhibits a marked transition in its fluid transport properties at a critical brine volume fraction pc of about 5 percent, or temperature Tc of about -5 degreesC for salinity of 5 parts per thousand. For temperatures warmer than Tc, brine carrying heat and nutrients can move through the ice, whereas for colder temperatures the ice is impermeable. This transition plays a key role in the geophysics, biology, and remote sensing of sea ice. Percolation theory can be used to understand this critical behavior of transport in sea ice. The similarity of sea ice microstructure to compressed powders is used to theoretically predict pc of about 5 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2109161455,"Several early studies suggested that spikes can be generated in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but their functional significance and the conditions under which they occur remain poorly understood. Here, we provide direct evidence from simultaneous dendritic and somatic patch-pipette recordings that excitatory synaptic inputs can elicit dendritic sodium spikes prior to axonal action potential initiation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Both the probability and amplitude of dendritic spikes depended on the previous synaptic and firing history of the cell. Moreover, some dendritic spikes occurred in the absence of somatic action potentials, indicating that their propagation to the soma and axon is unreliable. We show that dendritic spikes contribute a variable depolarization that summates with the synaptic potential and can act as a trigger for action potential initiation in the axon."
https://openalex.org/W1994453752,"We have examined the trafficking and metabolism of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), an APP homolog (APLP1), and TrkB in neurons that lack PS1. We report that PS1-deficient neurons fail to secrete Aβ, and that the rate of appearance of soluble APP derivatives in the conditioned medium is increased. Remarkably, carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) derived from APP and APLP1 accumulate in PS1-deficient neurons. Hence, PS1 plays a role in promoting intramembrane cleavage and/or degradation of membrane-bound CTFs. Moreover, the maturation of TrkB and BDNF-inducible TrkB autophosphorylation is severely compromised in neurons lacking PS1. We conclude that PS1 plays an essential role in modulating trafficking and metabolism of a selected set of membrane and secretory proteins in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2110305967,"Acute changes in pressure or shear stress induce the rapid release of nitric oxide (NO) from the vascular endothelium resulting in vasodilation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates this flow-induced NO secretion. The subcellular location of flow-induced eNOS activity in the endothelium in vivo as well as the mechanisms by which hemodynamic forces regulate eNOS activity are unknown. The luminal cell surface of the endothelium, which is directly exposed to circulating blood stressors, has been examined for eNOS expression and functional activity. Immunoelectron microscopy of rat lung tissue shows eNOS labeling on the endothelial cell surface primarily within caveolae. Subcellular fractionation to purify luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes and their caveolae directly from rat lungs reveals that eNOS is not only concentrated but also enzymatically active in caveolae. Increasing vascular flow and pressure in situ rapidly activates caveolar eNOS with apparent eNOS dissociation from caveolin and association with calmodulin. Hemodynamic forces resulting from increased flow appear to transmit through caveolae to release eNOS from its inhibitory association with caveolin, apparently to allow more complete activation by calmodulin and other possible effectors. These data demonstrate a physiological relevant mechanotransduction event directly in caveolae at the luminal endothelial cell surface. Caveolae may serve as flow-sensing organelles with the necessary molecular machinery to transduce rapidly, mechanical stimuli and thereby regulate eNOS activity.

Caveolae may serve as flow-sensing organelles with the necessary molecular machinery to transduce rapidly, mechanical stimuli and thereby regulate eNOS activity. The vascular endothelium has evolved a set of adaptive responses to the changing hemodynamic mechanical forces imposed by the circulating blood. Both vascular tone (1Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M.

Shear forces generated from fluid flow very rapidly stimulate NO production (10Rubanyi G.M. Romero J.C. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J.

Pobey J.M. Furness J.V. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). NO is produced from the enzymatic conversion of l-arginine tol-citrulline through an isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) found in endothelial cells. How forces generated from fluid flow activate eNOS to rapidly release NO from vascular endothelial cells is unknown. It appears logical that the luminal surface of the endothelium, which is directly exposed to the blood flow and therefore expected to be sensitive to hemodynamic forces, would be a primary site for flow-responsive eNOS activity. However, cultured endothelial cells express eNOS primarily in the Golgi and cytoplasmic compartments (13O'Brien H.A. Young H.N. Pobey J.M. Furness J.V. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,14Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol.

More recent studies have shown that, when appropriately lipid acylated, eNOS can be targeted to membrane subfractions rich in caveolin and therefore assumed to be specialized plasmalemmal vesicles called caveolae (15Garcia-Cardena G.

Furthermore, eNOS may associate with the caveolar coat protein, caveolin, both in cultured endothelial cell lysates (15Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although caveolin at the cell surface is quite specific for caveolae, it can also be quite abundant in the trans-Golgi network, at least in cultured cells (21Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.K. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Probably because endothelial cells have remarkable plasticity with the ability to modulate their constitutive phenotype in response to their local tissue microenvironment (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J. Vascular Endothelium: Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Schattauer, Stuttgart1997: 77-95Google Scholar), it is not surprising that they tend to adopt a “de-differentiated” phenotype when grown in culture. Isolating and growing endothelial cells in culture decreases the cell surface density of caveolae (23Schnitzer J.E. Carley W.W. Palade G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H425-H437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may redistribute caveolin and possibly other caveolar molecules such as eNOS to other compartments such as Golgi. 2V. Rizzo, P. Oh, and J. E. Schnitzer, unpublished observations. 2V. Rizzo, P. Oh, and J. E. Schnitzer, unpublished observations. Last, one recent study has concluded from subfractionation analysis that caveolae lack signaling molecules such as eNOS and therefore cannot participate in cell surface signaling events (24Stan R.-V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, although critically important for understanding eNOS function, the precise subcellular location of eNOS and moreover, where physiologically active eNOS resides within the endothelium remain uncertain, especially under “native” conditions found in vivo. Caveolae are small plasmalemmal invaginations that can function in endothelium as dynamic vesicular carriers (25Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Science. 1996; 274: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Oh P. McIntosh P.D. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). They may also act as organized cell surface signal transduction centers (27Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The localization of signaling molecules within a small microdomain is likely to provide the proximity necessary for rapid, efficient, and specific propagation of signals to downstream targets (29Liu J.

Caveolin is a structural coat protein of caveolae that may act as a scaffold protein for a variety of lipid-anchored signaling molecules such as eNOS, G-proteins, Ras, and Src-like kinases (18Ju H.

The physiological relevance of this ability to associate as recombinant proteins in the test tube, however, remains undefined, especially under physiological conditions experienced in vivo. Here, we attempt to define eNOS localization in more definitive terms as it exists in endothelium in vivo as well as to examine the regulation and mechanism of eNOS activation under changing hemodynamic conditions in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with a 3:1 mixture of 10 mg/ml ketamine and 10 mg/ml xylazine per 100 g body weight. Following tracheostomy and thoracotomy, the lungs were inflated with approximately 3/4 tidal volume. The pericardium was removed and 200 units of heparin was injected into the right ventricle as an anticoagulant. After the thymus was removed to fully expose the pulmonary artery, a small cut was made in the right ventricle through which a catheter was fed and secured into the pulmonary artery. The left atrium was cut to allow for outflow and vascular fluid flow (mammalian Ringer's solution at 37 °C) was immediately established through the rat lungs at a pressure of 8–10 mm Hg (4–5 ml/min) for 5 min followed by perfusion for an addition minute at either 8–10 mm Hg (4 ml/min), 12–14 mm Hg (6.5 ml/min), or 18–20 mm Hg (10 ml/min). Flow rate was controlled by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) and pulmonary pressure monitored during lung perfusions. Immediately following vascular perfusion as described above, the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes and then their caveolae were isolated using an in situ silica coating procedure described previously (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J. Vascular Endothelium: Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Schattauer, Stuttgart1997: 77-95Google Scholar, 30Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J.

Briefly, the vasculature was immediately cooled to 10 °C by perfusion with cold MES-buffered saline (20 mm, pH 6.0) followed by a positively charged colloidal silica solution. Cross-linking of the silica particles by subsequent perfusion with polyacrylic acid created a stable adherent silica pellicle that marked this specific membrane of interest. This coating firmly attaches to the plasma membrane to increase its density and permit its purification by centrifugation to separate the silica-coated endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) from the starting whole lung homogenate (H). The silica-coated membrane pellets have many associated caveolae and display ample enrichment for various endothelial cell surface markers (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J.

Because eNOS is solubilized in detergents such as Triton X-100, even at low temperatures, the attached caveolae were sheared away from P in a detergent-free environment and purified by sucrose gradient floatation as described in our past work (22Schnitzer J.E.

Briefly, caveolin antibodies (10 μg; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were preabsorbed onto goat anti-mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) by a 2–4-h incubation at 4 °C. The antibody-bead conjugates were washed and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with purified caveolar fraction V (10–15 μg of protein). Beads with any attached membranes (B) were separated magnetically from unbound material (U), washed, and then processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with eNOS antibodies as described below. The rat lung vasculature was perfused at either 8–10 mm Hg (4 ml/min) or 18–20 mm Hg (10 ml/min) as described above. Following purification of luminal endothelial cell surface membranes (P), 500 μg of total protein from these preparations were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C with a buffered solution (20 mm MES, 20 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm each EDTA and EGTA, 4 mmtetrahydrobiopterin, and 1 mml-arginine) containing either 20 mm CHAPS (17Feron O.

Supernatant material was divided equally (100 μl volumes) and incubated for 1 h separately with either eNOS mAb or caveolin mAb-coated magnetic beads prepared as described above. Beads with any attached proteins (B) were separated magnetically from unbound material (U) and subjected to Western analysis. Similar control experiments were carried out using a purified nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma) to assess for possible nonspecific binding of the solubilized proteins. Various membrane (H, P, V, and P-V) and immunoprecipitated protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (5–15% gradient gels) followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose filters for immunoblotting as in our past work (30Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 33Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol.

Whole lung homogenate and purified luminal endothelial cell plasma membrane fractions were assayed for eNOS activity by measuring the conversion ofl-[3H]arginine intol-[3H]citrulline as described previously (35Garcia-Cardena G.

Briefly, 5 μg of protein from H, P, V, or P-V subfractions were incubated (50 μl total volume) in assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm vanadate) containing 1 mm NADPH, 4 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 nm calmodulin, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μml-arginine and l-[3H]arginine (0.2 μCi, 55 Ci/mol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Addition of 1 ml of cold stop buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm of each EDTA and EGTA) served to quench the reaction. The reaction mixture was passed over a Dowex AG 50WX-8 resin packed (1 ml) column, washed with 1 ml of distilled water, and collected directly into a 20-ml liquid scintillation vial. In some experiments, caveolae isolated from either lowest or highest flow conditions were preincubated (15 min) with the NOS inhibitor,N G-mono-methyl-l-arginine (1 mm) and subsequently assayed for eNOS activity. Cryo-ultramicrotomy and immuno-gold labeling techniques were used to localize and quantify the distribution of eNOS in endothelium in vivo as described previously (26.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). For immunolabeling, thin frozen sections of the rat lung tissue were quenched with either 10% fetal calf serum or 0.5% fish skin gelatin (10 min) and incubated for 30 min with either the eNOS mAb or the control mAb TE-1, which does not recognize any protein in the lung by Western analysis. After washing (4 × 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline), sections were incubated with gold-labeled reporter secondary antibody (5 nm gold goat anti-mouse IgG) for 20–60 min. Labeled sections were extensively washed, contrasted with 2% methylcellulose, 3% uranyl acetate, and examined with a Philips 300 electron microscope operating at 60 kV. By using a purification scheme which permits isolation, directly from tissue, of the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes normally exposed to the circulating blood which are then subfractionated to purify their caveolae (30Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), we found that eNOS was easily detected on the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) where it was enriched in the caveolae (5-fold more than P and 10–15-fold greater than plasma membranes stripped of their caveolae (P-V) (Fig. 1 A). In these samples, as in our previous reports (30Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 33Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), caveolin was enriched 15–25-fold in V relative to P. To be certain that eNOS was present within luminal plasma membrane caveolae, V was subjected to immunoaffinity isolation using a monoclonal antibody to caveolin. Consistent with a homogeneous population of caveolae in this fraction, silver stain following SDS-PAGE of immunoisolated samples indicated that >95% of the protein contained in the starting material was found in the bound fraction (B) (37Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 207AGoogle Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, Western analysis of the immunoisolated caveolae revealed the presence of eNOS and caveolin in these same vesicles. Nearly all (>95%) the caveolin and eNOS in starting material was in B while little remained in the unbound fraction (U). Controls performed in the absence of primary antibody or with clathrin antibody showed little to no evidence of caveolae binding (37Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 207AGoogle Scholar) and both eNOS and caveolin remained in U with no signal detected in B (data not shown). Thus, eNOS existed within the same low density caveolar vesicles that were coated with caveolin. To investigate caveolar localization of eNOS further, ultra-thin sections of whole rat lung tissue were probed with an eNOS monoclonal antibody and subsequently labeled with a gold-conjugated reporter antibody. Analysis by electron microscopy revealed significant eNOS labeling on the endothelial cell surface. As shown in Fig. 2, the eNOS distribution did not appear random over the endothelial cell surface but instead was found primarily within caveolae. eNOS was detected within single caveolae as well as caveolar clusters (Fig. 2,A and B). Caveolae associated with both the luminal and abluminal endothelial cell surface were labeled (Fig.2 C). In these same sections, much fewer gold particles was seen on other endothelial membranes including the Golgi network. Morphometric analysis (Table I) revealed that more than 60% (378 out of 615 particle counted) of the eNOS detected in the endothelium was associated with the plasma membrane with about one-half of the remaining 40% found to be “free” in the cytoplasm and the other 20% associated with other intracellular membranes. More importantly, the majority of eNOS (greater than 50% of all detectable eNOS) was found in caveolae. Thus, nearly 85% of the gold (eNOS) detected at the plasma membrane was associated with caveolae. Approximately 6.7 particles were found to be associated with each measured micron of caveolae membrane in comparison to only 0.92 particles per micron of plasmalemmal proper (Table I). Taken together with the biochemical analyses showing a similar level of enrichment in V versus P, it was apparent that eNOS resides primarily on the microvascular endothelial cell surface of the rat lung predominately concentrated in the caveolae.Table IAnalysis of eNOS localization in rat lung endothelium by immunogold electronmicroscopyEndothelial cellPlasma membranePMCytoplasmICMProperCaveolae% of total Au61.519.519952.5% of Au associated with membranes76.423.611.265.2% of Au associated with PM14.685.4Au/μm membrane0.92 ± 0.626.7 ± 1.6Ultrathin cyrosections immunolabeled with the monoclonal antibody to eNOS were examined and photographed by electron microscopy.

In order to examine whether eNOS was enzymatically active at the endothelial cell surface and its caveolae, we incubated various membrane subfractions in an assay buffer system containingl-[3H]arginine and determined eNOS enzymatic activity by measuring its conversion tol-[3H]citrulline. eNOS in the caveolae purified from luminal membranes consistently demonstrated the greatest activity compared with the other membrane fractions tested (Fig.3).

These point sources of nutrients spread into spherical patches a few millimeters in diameter and sustained swarms of bacteria for about 10 minutes.

https://openalex.org/W2128834282,"Hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor–dependent long-term synaptic depression (LTD) is associated with a persistent dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors at a site (Ser-845) phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In the present study, we show that dephosphorylation of a postsynaptic PKA substrate may be crucial for LTD expression. PKA activators inhibited both AMPA receptor dephosphorylation and LTD. Injection of a cAMP analog into postsynaptic neurons prevented LTD induction and reversed previously established homosynaptic LTD without affecting baseline synaptic transmission. Moreover, infusing a PKA inhibitor into postsynaptic cells produced synaptic depression that occluded homosynaptic LTD. These findings suggest that dephosphorylation of a PKA site on AMPA receptors may be one mechanism for NMDA receptor–dependent homosynaptic LTD expression."

Many cells express several Gq-coupled receptors that regulate the location, intensity, and propagation of intracellular Ca2+ waves. For example, pancreatic acini respond to acetylcholine, bombesin, and cholecystokinin by activating the same set of Gq class proteins and mobilizing the same Ca2+ pool, but each receptor evokes distinct patterns of Ca2+ waves (3Xu X.

RGS4 is composed of a central domain of 120 amino acids that is homologous to other RGS proteins, termed the RGS box, flanked by less well conserved N- and C-terminal sequences (13Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In rat pancreatic acinar cells, RGS4 preferentially inhibited Gq/11-mediated signaling evoked by carbachol relative to bombesin and cholecystokinin regardless of the identity of the Gq class α subunit.2 Regulatory specificity was apparently conferred by direct or indirect interaction between RGS4 and the receptor. In the present study, we used deletion mutations to identify two domains in RGS4 that regulate agonist-dependent Ca2+ signaling. The RGS box accelerates GTP hydrolysis by Gαq whereas the N terminus conveys high affinity and receptor-selective inhibition. These combined activities are required for receptor selectivity and high potency inhibition of receptor-coupled Gq signaling. All recombinant RGS proteins were His6-tagged at the N terminus. Protein expression and GAP assays were performed as described (10Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

Measurement of Ca2+-activated Cl− current and Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells was exactly as described.2 The agonist-stimulated steady-state GTPase activity of reconstituted phospholipid vesicles that contained m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and heterotrimeric Gqwas assayed in the presence or absence of RGS proteins or peptides as described (14Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Single-turnover measurements of the hydrolysis of Gαq-GTP were performed as described (15Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]GTP bound to the R183C mutant of Gαq (chosen to slow hydrolysis and thus facilitate loading). To determine the domains of RGS4 that conveyed high potency and receptor-selective inhibition, rat pancreatic acinar cells were dialyzed with different recombinant RGS4 proteins through a patch pipette and exposed to 100 μm carbachol, the minimal concentration of carbachol needed to generate a maximal cellular response (16Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 17Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).2 Responses were detected as changes in current carried by a Ca2+-activated Cl−channel. In the control (Fig.1 a), carbachol evoked a typical biphasic Ca2+ response consisting of an initial spike caused by Ca2+ release from internal stores followed by a plateau current. Infusion of full-length RGS4 (10 pm) suppressed the initial Ca2+ release and caused subsequent oscillations in response to maximal carbachol stimulation. Increasing the RGS4 concentration to 100 pm further reduced the Ca2+ response to a low frequency oscillation. A similar transition from a sustained to a weak oscillatory response occurred when the carbachol concentration was reduced from 100 to 1 μm (16Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 17Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).2 This indicates that carbachol-evoked signaling in intact cells dialyzed with 100 pm RGS4 is functionally equivalent to a 100-fold decrease in the potency of carbachol stimulation. Exposing cells to higher concentrations of carbachol did not change the inhibitory effect of RGS4 on Ca2+ release. Two other proteins related to RGS4, RGS1, and RGS16 (13Druey K.M. Blumer K.J.

Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 10Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), has no effect on Gq-mediated signaling (data not shown). We next tested the effect of the RGS domain of RGS4 (4Box) (Fig. 1,d–f). Although full-length RGS4 and 4Box accelerated GTP hydrolysis by purified Gαi1 with equal potency in vitro (10Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), 4Box was approximately 104-fold less potent than full-length RGS4 in inhibiting in vivoCa2+ signaling. For example, 10 pm RGS4 conferred partial inhibition of signaling whereas 100 nm4Box was required before partial inhibition was apparent (Fig. 1,b and d). Increasing the cellular concentration of full-length RGS4 gradually inhibited signaling, decreasing both the amplitude of the initial current spike and the frequency and amplitude of the subsequent current oscillations (Fig. 1, a–c). By contrast, dialysis with as much as 100 nm 4Box did not significantly reduce the initial current spike but caused rapid termination of signaling and obliterated subsequent oscillations in the continued presence of agonist (Fig. 1 d). These data also indicated that the mechanisms of inhibition by RGS4 and 4Box were qualitatively different, suggesting that inhibition by intact RGS4 involves more than just Gq GAP activity. To identify the flanking structure in full-length RGS4 that conveys high potency inhibition, we tested the activities of other deletion mutants. C-terminal truncation of RGS4 (RGS4ΔC) reduced its potency by about 100-fold (Fig. 1, g and h). For example, 10 nm RGS4ΔC inhibited the initial current spike to the same extent as did 100 pm full-length RGS4 and caused similar subsequent oscillations in response to 100 μmcarbachol (compare Fig. 1, c and h). This effect was not further characterized because deletion of the N-terminal sequence flanking the RGS box (RGS4ΔN) caused an even more dramatic reduction in potency and altered the mechanism of RGS4 inhibition to resemble that observed with 4Box (Fig. 1, i andj). Hence, the N terminus of RGS4 is essential for high potency inhibition and contributes significantly to RGS4 interaction with the receptor-Gq protein complex. Besides diminishing the effect and potency of RGS4 action, 4Box also lost selectivity among different receptors. RGS4 inhibits signaling preferentially through the m3 muscarinic receptor compared with the CCK receptor, assayed either separately or sequentially within the same cell (Fig. 2).2 By contrast, 4Box inhibited Ca2+ signaling by carbachol and CCK equivalently over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 2,c–f). These data suggest that terminal regions of RGS4 both enhance potency and mediate recognition of receptor. Next, we tested whether the 33-amino acid N-terminal peptide of RGS4 (P1–33) can itself alter Gq-mediated signaling. P1–33 (100 nm) both blocked the initial spike and converted the following sustained current to an oscillatory response (Fig. 2,g–i). Higher concentrations of P1–33completely blocked signaling by carbachol. In contrast, these concentrations of P1–33 had no effect on CCK signaling. Only at 1 μm P1–33 was the sustained response evoked by CCK converted to an oscillatory current. These data indicate both that P1–33 effectively inhibited Gq-mediated Ca2+ signaling and that inhibition retained the selectivity for the m3 muscarinic receptor over the CCK receptor that is characteristic of RGS4. We then tested the relative GAP activity of RGS4 and 4Box toward purified, recombinant Gαq proteins in vitro. In a solution phase, single-turnover Gαq GAP assay, RGS4 was about 10-fold more active than 4Box (Fig.3, a and c), in contrast to their equal potency when assayed with Gαi1(10Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We then compared the GAP activity of full-length RGS4 and 4Box on wild-type Gq in a steady-state, receptor-coupled in vitro assay. Phospholipid vesicles were reconstituted with m1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor and trimeric Gqαβγ, wherein steady-state GDP-GTP exchange on Gαq was agonist-dependent (14Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this assay, RGS4 was about 125-fold more potent than 4Box in stimulating steady-state receptor-dependent GTPase activity (Fig. 3, b andc). Phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor and trimeric Gαi1βγ revealed an even more pronounced difference between the relative activities of full-length RGS4 and 4Box (data not shown). These findings provide additional evidence that sequences flanking the RGS box are essential for optimal GAP activity in receptor-G protein-coupled signaling. The results in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 clearly show that 4Box has Gq-GAP activity but that the N-terminal domain of RGS4 both conferred receptor selectivity upon RGS4 action and increased its potency in intact cells. To address the mechanism of RGS4 action, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores was measured in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells. These cells sequester Ca2+ from the incubation medium into cellular organelles and retain Gq-coupled signaling in response to all agonists that act on acinar cells (3Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Xu X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11737-11744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This experimental approach facilitated addition of GTPγS to reverse inhibition by RGS4 as a test of its Gq GAP activity. As shown in Fig. 4 a, muscarinic stimulation released about 75–80% of the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Addition of 125 nm RGS4 inhibited more than 95% of the normal carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 f). Permeabilized cells were less sensitive to RGS4 than patch-clamped cells, probably because of a slower diffusion of proteins from the extracellular media into the cytosol. RGS4 inhibition was fully reversible by addition of GTPγS (Fig. 4 f), suggesting that inhibition of signaling reflects the GAP activity of RGS4 under these conditions. By contrast, addition of up to 1.4 μm 4Box to the incubation medium had no effect on carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 b) further demonstrating that full-length RGS4 inhibits Gq-coupled signaling far more potently than does 4Box. Consistent with its effects in intact cells, P1–33inhibited Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells in a receptor-selective manner (Fig. 4, c–e). Carbachol-evoked Ca2+ release was inhibited completely by 62 μm P1–33, with an IC50 of 25 ± 2 μm (n = 5). Similar measurements with CCK showed an IC50 for P1–33of 62 ± 5 μm (n = 3). Thus, in permeabilized cells, P1–33 inhibited Ca2+release evoked by carbachol 2.5-fold better than that evoked by CCK (Fig. 4 e). Several control experiments further indicated that inhibition by P1–33 was specific. First, cells responded normally to addition of IP3, even in the presence of 62 μm P1–33 (Fig. 4, c andd). Second, HT-31, another amphipathic peptide that disrupts protein kinase A anchoring to AKAPs (21Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on signaling in response to carbachol. Third, amino acid substitutions within P1–33 dramatically lowered its inhibitory activity (see legend to Fig. 4). Fourth, P1–33 preferentially inhibited signaling via the muscarinic receptor compared with the CCK receptor. An important distinction between P1–33 and RGS4 is that the inhibitory effect of P1–33 was not reversed by GTPγS (Fig. 4, c and d), indicating that its effect does not depend on Gq-GAP activity. Sequential addition of P1–33 and RGS4 blocked GTPγS-insensitive inhibition (Fig. 4 g), indicating the peptide and full-length RGS4 compete for binding to a subsite of the RGS4 binding site in the receptor-Gq complex. To further investigate P1–33 inhibition of Ca2+ release, we changed the order of addition of inhibitors and activators. If cells were exposed to P1–33, then carbachol, subsequent addition of either RGS4 or 4Box did not restore the ability of GTPγS to stimulate Ca2+ release (similar to Fig. 4 d). RGS4 and 4Box only worked when added prior to carbachol stimulation (Fig. 4,f–h). P1–33 does not prevent receptor-catalyzed GTP exchange on Gαq nor does P1–33 act as a Gq GAP (data not shown). This overall pattern of activities suggests that P1–33 binds at a site normally occupied by the N terminus of RGS4, and when added without 4Box, P1–33 blocks interaction of Gqwith its effector protein PLCβ. A final and distinctive activity of P1–33 was that exposure to both 4Box and P1–33 inhibited Ca2+release with greater potency than either added alone (compare Fig. 4,b, c, and h). Importantly, this inhibition was reversed by GTPγS, indicating that the GAP activity of 4Box was functional in permeabilized cells (Fig. 4, h andi). In cells dialyzed with P1–33 (10 nm) and 4Box (1 nm) through a patch pipette, at concentrations at which neither had activity on its own, the combination fully inhibited carbachol-evoked Ca2+ signaling (data not shown). Thus, the peptide P1–33 and 4Box mutually influenced the activity of each other in cells. We propose the P1–33 peptide facilitates 4Box interaction with the receptor complex (reflected by enhanced potency) and the 4Box alters the P1–33 binding site to relieve GTPγS-resistant inhibition. The analysis in Fig. 4 suggests two separate regions of RGS4 interact with the receptor complex to regulate Ca2+signaling. A combination of the N-terminal peptide P1–33and 4Box reconstituted the essential functions of RGS4, those of receptor specificity and GAP activity. Sequence divergence in the N terminus of different RGS proteins may convey regulatory specificity toward other receptor complexes, and this specificity may be retained in peptides analogous with P1–33. The N-terminal domain and RGS box of RGS4 cooperate via at least two discrete mechanisms to convey receptor-selective inhibition of G protein signaling. Inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by RGS4 was receptor-selective whereas inhibition by 4Box was not. Receptor selectivity of RGS4 inhibition was not influenced by the identity of the Gq class α subunit.2 Such selectivity suggests intact RGS4 interacts directly or indirectly with receptors, most likely through its N terminus. This is supported by the finding that RGS4 in patch-clamped cells was 10,000-fold more potent than 4Box and RGS4 had 125-fold higher Gq-GAP activity than did 4Box in an agonist-dependent in vitro assay. Finally, partial inhibition by RGS4 simultaneously decreased both the amplitude of the initial Ca2+ signal and the frequency of subsequent oscillations, suggesting recombinant RGS4 protein is active when dialyzed into patch-clamped cells and can preassemble with the receptor-Gq-PLCβ signaling complex. By contrast, 4Box preferentially inhibited signaling following the initial Ca2+ release evoked by carbachol and CCK. This suggests that 4Box is recruited only to active receptor complexes when production of the Gq-GTP substrate would be greatest, and thereby 4Box GAP activity would be most pronounced."

Here, using a site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody, we found that the expression of dominant active RhoA in COS7 cells induced moesin phosphorylation and the formation of microvilli-like structures at apical membranes where the Thr558-phosphorylated moesin accumulated, whereas the expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase inhibited both of these processes. The expression of dominant active Rho-kinase also induced moesin phosphorylation. When COS7 cells expressing moesin or moesinT558A (substitution of Thr by Ala) were cultured under serum-depleted conditions, there were few microvilli-like structures, whereas microvilli-like structures remained in the cells expressing moesinT558D (substitution of Thr by Asp). The expression of moesinT558A inhibited the dominant active RhoA-induced formation of microvilli-like structures. These results indicate that Rho-kinase regulates moesin phosphorylation downstream of Rho in vivo and that the phosphorylation of moesin by Rho-kinase plays a crucial role in the formation of microvilli-like structures.

The ERM (ezrin, radixin, andmoesin) family proteins function as cross-linking proteins between the plasma membranes and actin filaments (for reviews, see Refs. 1Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr.

The ERM family proteins are localized at the specific regions where actin filaments associate with plasma membranes such as microvilli at the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells, microvilli-like structures at apical membranes (apical membrane protrusions), cleavage furrows, ruffling membranes, filopodia, and cell-cell adhesion sites (1Arpin M.

The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of the ERM family proteins are thought to directly bind to some integral membrane proteins such as CD44 (4Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and actin filaments, respectively (5Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J.

The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the ERM family proteins mask each other, presumably through the intramolecular head-to-tail association between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains (7Gary R.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Once the ERM family proteins are activated, they appear to be translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membranes, where they serve as cross-linkers (1Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin.

Recent evidence suggests that the intramolecular suppression is released by acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, and the small GTPase Rho enhances the formation of the ERM family proteins-CD44 complex (9Hirao M.

A permeable cell reconstitution assay showed that the ERM family proteins are essential for Rho- and Rac-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (10Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J.

However, it has not been known whether Rho-kinase phosphorylates moesinin vivo, and the role of the phosphorylation of moesin remains to be clarified. Here we found that Rho-kinase phosphorylates moesin at Thr558 in vivo and that this phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the formation of microvilli-like structures.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe examined whether moesin was phosphorylated via the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway in COS7 cells by an immunoblot analysis with anti-pT558. pEF-BOS-HA-moesin, in which moesin was HA epitope-tagged at its NH2-terminal, was cotransfected into COS7 cells with the plasmids carrying the cDNA of Rho family members or Rho-kinase (Fig. 1). The level of HA-moesin phosphorylation at Thr558 was low in serum-depleted COS7 cells expressing HA-moesin alone. The expression of dominant active RhoA (RhoAV14) or constitutively active Rho-kinase (catalytic domain, CAT) induced moesin phosphorylation at Thr558 to severalfold. Dominant negative RhoA (RhoAN19) was inactive in this capacity. In the cells cotransfected with dominant active Rac1 (Rac1V12), the level of moesin phosphorylation at Thr558 slightly increased. Dominant active Cdc42 had no effects. Rho-kinase is composed of catalytic (CAT), coiled-coil (COIL), Rho-binding (RB), and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains (28Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T.

RB (941–1075 aa) and RB/PH(TT) (941–1388 aa), which encompasses the RB and PH domains, work as the dominant negative forms of Rho-kinase (38Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N.

Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). RB/PH(TT), which has point mutations in the RB domain and does not bind to Rho, inhibits the Rho-kinase activity without titrating out Rhoin vitro. 2M. Amano, K. Chihara, N. Nakamura, Y. Marsuura, and K. Kaibuchi, manuscript in preparation. In the present study, the effect of RhoAV14 was suppressed by RB and RB/PH(TT) (Fig. 1). The anti-pT558 recognized the proteins corresponding to endogenous ezrin as well as endogenous moesin (Fig.1). Because the sequence (553–563 aa) around the phospho-Thr558 that was selected as the antigen is completely conserved among the ERM family proteins, the anti-pT558 may recognize Thr567-phosphorylated ezrin. RhoAV14or CAT enhanced the phosphorylation of not only endogenous moesin but also that of endogenous ezrin to some extent (Fig. 1). Taken together, these results indicate that moesin is phosphorylated at Thr558 in COS7 cells in a Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent manner.Next, we determined the subcellular localization of Thr558-phosphorylated moesin in COS7 cells by an indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-pT558 (Fig.2). In serum-depleted COS7 cells expressing HA-moesin alone, the level of moesin phosphorylation at Thr558 was low, and phosphorylated moesin showed diffuse localization throughout the cytoplasm. When the cells were stimulated with 6 μm LPA or medium containing 10% FBS, the phosphorylation level of moesin was elevated and phosphorylated moesin was distributed into the microvilli-like structures at apical membrane. In the cells coexpressing RhoAV14, phosphorylated moesin specifically accumulated in the microvilli-like structures at apical membrane, which were similar to the LPA- or serum-induced apical structures (Fig. 2 A). We confirmed that the LPA-, serum-, and RhoA-induced structures, where phosphorylated moesin accumulated, were specifically present in the apical membrane by scanning along thez axis of the cell with a confocal laser scanning microscope (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows the immunolocalization of total HA-moesin and phosphorylated moesin in RhoAV14-expressing cells by double-labeled immunofluorescence. A merged image revealed that part of the expressed HA-moesin was phosphorylated and that the phosphorylated HA-moesin was specifically incorporated into the microvilli-like structures. In the RhoAV14-expressing cells, the phosphorylated moesin was partly colocalized with CD44, which is one of the partners of the ERM family proteins and accumulates in the microvilli-like structures (4Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The coexpression of RB/PH(TT) counteracted the effects of RhoAV14 (Fig. 2, A and B). The accumulation of phosphorylated moesin in microvilli-like structures was not observed in the cells transfected with RhoAN19(Fig. 2 A). We found that RB/PH(TT) and RhoAN19also inhibited the LPA- or serum-induced moesin phosphorylation and accumulation of moesin into the microvilli-like structures (data not shown). Rac1V12 failed to induce the localization of phosphorylated moesin in microvilli-like structures, but induced membrane ruffling-like structures, where phosphorylated moesin accumulated. Cdc42V12 did not show any morphological effects under the conditions. The expression of CAT induced moesin phosphorylation. The phosphorylated moesin by CAT accumulated not only in microvilli-like structures but also in large dot-like structures (Fig. 2 A) where CD44 and actin filaments accumulated (data not shown). Since CAT is known to induce the formation of both actin stress fibers and large dot-like aggregates of F-actin (38Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), the large dot-like structures consisting of phosphorylated moesin, CD44 and F-actin might appear in cells expressing CAT.Figure 2Localization of Thr558-phosphorylated moesin in COS7 cells. A, an indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the anti-pT558 was performed in COS7 cells. pEF-BOS-HA-moesin (4 μg) was cotransfected with pEF-BOS vector (12 μg) (a–c), pEF-BOS-Myc-RhoAV14 (4 μg) (d), pEF-BOS-Myc-RhoAV14 (4 μg) and pEF-BOS-Myc-RB/PH(TT) (8 μg) (e), pEF-BOS-Myc-RhoAN19 (4 μg) (f), pEF-BOS-Myc-CAT (4 μg) (g), and pEF-BOS-Myc-Rac1V12 (4 μg) (h). Total amount of plasmids was compensated with pEF-BOS vector. The cells were treated with 6 μm LPA (b) or medium containing 10% FBS (c) for 15 min, respectively. Phosphorylated moesin was labeled by anti-pT558. The arrowheads indicate the transfected cells. The arrows in g indicate the large dot-like structures. Bar, 10 μm. B, pEF-BOS-HA-moesin (4 μg) was cotransfected with pEF-BOS vector (12 μg) (a–c), pEF-BOS-Myc-RhoAV14 (4 μg) (d–f), or pEF-BOS-Myc-RhoAV14 (4 μg) and pEF-BOS-Myc-RB/PH(TT) (8 μg) (g–i). The total HA-moesin and phosphorylated moesin were doubly labeled by anti-HA Ab and anti-pT558, respectively. HA-moesin is shown in red(a, c, d, f, g, and i) and phosphorylated moesin is shown ingreen (b, c, e,f, h, and i). c,f, and i show merged images of a andb, d and e, and g and h, respectively.Bar, 10 μm. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To understand the role of the phosphorylation of moesin by Rho-kinase in the formation of microvilli-like structures, we produced the moesin mutants, HA-moesinT558A and HA-moesinT558D(substitution of Thr by Ala or Asp). HA-moesinT558A was not phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in vitro (data not shown). HA-moesinT558D was expected to mimic Thr558-phosphorylated moesin. To assess the formation of microvilli-like structures, anti-CD44 Ab staining was used as a marker for these structures. In the unstimulated cells into which the control vector was introduced, neither anti-CD44 Ab staining nor TRITC-phalloidin staining showed any specific accumulation in the microvilli-like structures (Fig.3, A and B). When cells expressing HA-moesin or HA-moesinT558A were cultured under serum-depleted conditions in the absence of RhoAV14, there were few microvilli-like structures (Fig. 3 B) and HA-moesin or HA-moesinT558A was diffusely present in the cytoplasm (data not shown). On the other hand, in the HA-moesinT558D-expressing cells microvilli-like structures remained (Fig. 3, A and B) and HA-moesinT558D accumulated in these structures (data not shown). When CD44 and F-actin were doubly labeled, the merged image showed that, in HA-moesinT558D-expressing cells, CD44 was colocalized with F-actin at microvilli-like structures (Fig.3 A). HA-moesinT558D may substitute for endogenous moesin and maintain the microvilli-like structures. When RhoAV14 was coexpressed with the HA-moesin or moesin mutants in COS7 cells, microvilli-like structures appeared in the cells expressing HA-moesin or HA-moesinT558D (Fig.3 B). It should be noted that the coexpression of HA-moesinT558D with RhoAV14 enhanced the formation of microvilli-like structures by about 2-fold. In contrast, the expression of HA-moesinT558A inhibited the formation of the RhoAV14-induced microvilli-like structures (Fig.3 B). Essentially similar results were obtained when the TRITC-phalloidin was used to assess microvilli-like structures instead of the anti-CD44 Ab (data not shown). HA-moesinT558A may inhibit the function of endogenous moesin as the dominant negative formin vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr558 by the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway plays a crucial role in the formation of microvilli-like structures.Figure 3Effects of moesin mutants on the formation of microvilli-like structures in COS7 cells. A, the patterns of anti-CD44 Ab and TRITC-phalloidin staining in HA-moesinT558D-expressing cells. CD44 and F-actin were doubly labeled in COS7 cells into which pEF-BOS vector (0.1 mg/ml) (a–c) or pEF-BOS-HA-moesinT558D (0.1 mg/ml) (d–f) were microinjected in the absence of RhoAV14. CD44 is shown in green(a, c, d, and f). F-actin is shown in red (b, c, e, and f). c and f show merged images ofa and b, and d and e, respectively.

Chen X.Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We recently found that MRCKβ, which is one of the isoforms of MRCK, binds GTP-bound Rac as well as GTP-bound Cdc42 and that MRCKβ phosphorylates moesin in vitro. 3N. Nakamura, M. Amano, Y. Fukata, N. Oshiro, T. Leung, L. Lim, and K. Kaibuchi, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it is possible that MRCK participates in the phosphorylation of moesin downstream of Cdc42 or Rac1. The ERM (ezrin, radixin, andmoesin) family proteins function as cross-linking proteins between the plasma membranes and actin filaments (for reviews, see Refs. 1Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Trends Biochem.

The ERM family proteins are localized at the specific regions where actin filaments associate with plasma membranes such as microvilli at the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells, microvilli-like structures at apical membranes (apical membrane protrusions), cleavage furrows, ruffling membranes, filopodia, and cell-cell adhesion sites (1Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Trends Biochem.

The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of the ERM family proteins are thought to directly bind to some integral membrane proteins such as CD44 (4Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and actin filaments, respectively (5Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J.

The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the ERM family proteins mask each other, presumably through the intramolecular head-to-tail association between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains (7Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Martin M. Andreoli C. Sahuquet A. Montcourrier P. Algrain M. Mangeat P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Once the ERM family proteins are activated, they appear to be translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membranes, where they serve as cross-linkers (1Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Trends Biochem.

Recent evidence suggests that the intramolecular suppression is released by acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, and the small GTPase Rho enhances the formation of the ERM family proteins-CD44 complex (9Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). A permeable cell reconstitution assay showed that the ERM family proteins are essential for Rho- and Rac-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (10Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The ERM family proteins are phosphorylated in growth factor-stimulated cells (11Bretscher A. J.

In thrombin-activated platelets moesin is phosphorylated at Thr558 (13Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol.

This phosphorylation is observed at filopodia in macrophages and thought to be required for the stable interaction of moesin with actin (14Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H.

https://openalex.org/W2153704590,"Recent genetic and molecular biological analyses have revealed many forms of inherited channelopathies. Homozygous ataxic mice, tottering(tg) and leaner (tg la) mice, have mutations in the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel α1A subunit gene. Although their clinical phenotypes, histological changes, and locations of gene mutations are known, it remains unclear what phenotypes the mutant Ca2+ channels manifest, or whether the altered channel properties are the primary consequence of the mutations. To address these questions, we have characterized the electrophysiological properties of Ca2+channels in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where the P-type is the dominant Ca2+ channel, dissociated from the normal, tg,and tg la mice, and compared them with the properties of the wild-type and mutant α1A channels recombinantly expressed with the α2 and β subunits in baby hamster kidney cells. The most striking feature of Ca2+ channel currents of mutant Purkinje cells was a marked reduction in current density, being reduced to ∼60 and ∼40% of control in tg and tg la mice, respectively, without changes of cell size. The Ca2+channel currents in the tg Purkinje cells showed a relative increase in non-inactivating component in voltage-dependent inactivation. Besides the same change, those of thetg la mice showed a more distinct change in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, being shifted in the depolarizing direction by ∼10 mV, with a broader voltage dependence of inactivation. In the recombinant expression system, thetg channel with a missense mutation (P601L) and one form of the two possible tg la aberrant splicing products, tg la (short) channel, showed a significant reduction in current density, while the other form of thetg la channels, tg la(long), had a current density comparable to the normal control. On the other hand, the shift in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was observed only for the tg la(long) channel. Comparison of properties of the native and recombinant mutant channels suggests that single tottering mutations are directly responsible for the neuropathic phenotypes of reduction in current density and deviations in gating behavior, which lead to neuronal death and cerebellar atrophy.

Ca2+ controls diverse cellular processes, which include muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and other forms of secretion, gene expression, and cell proliferation (1Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To evoke these cellular responses, Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane makes a major contribution to augmenting the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. In neurons, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are one of the major transmembrane pathways, together with Ca2+-permeable ligand-gated channels. Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have defined several types of Ca2+ channels in neurons. There are at least five types of high-threshold Ca2+ channels (L, N, P, Q, and R) and a low-threshold Ca2+ channel (T) (2Bean B.P. Annu. Rev.

At the molecular level, the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are composed of the main pore-forming α1 subunit and the accessory α2 and β subunits (6Ahlijanian M.K. Westenbroek R.E. Catterall W.A.

It is generally accepted that the α1ACa2+ channel corresponds to the functionally defined P- and Q-type isoforms, which are produced from the same gene by alternative splicing (13Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 291-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and/or have different subunit compositions (14Stea A.

The P-type was first described in cerebellar Purkinje cells as a Ca2+ channel that is not blocked by ω-conotoxin GVIA or dihydropyridines (15Llinás R. Sugimori M. Lin J.W. Cherksey B. Proc. Natl.

A. 1989; 86: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), but is highly sensitive to ω-agatoxin (ω-Aga) 1The abbreviations used are: ω-Aga, ω-agatoxin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RFLP, restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism; bp, base pair(s); BHK, baby hamster kidney.

The Q-type is identified in cerebellar granule cells and is similar to the P-type channel, but has a lower sensitivity to ω-Aga IVA, and exhibits faster inactivation kinetics (17Randall A. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2995-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several types of these Ca2+ channels are co-localized in a single neuron and are believed to contribute to fine tuning of neuronal activity, because each type of Ca2+ channel is modulated in a different manner. Although the critical role of Ca2+ channels, particularly the P- and N- types, for transmitter release in the synaptic terminals has been well established (18Hirning L.D. Fox A.P. McCleskey E.W. Olivera B.M. Thayer S.A. Miller R.J. Tsien R.W. Science. 1988; 239: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi T. Momiyama A. Nature. 1993; 366: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), the roles of Ca2+ channels in integration of signals or synaptic plasticity have been poorly understood. Recent genetic and molecular biological analyses have identified that mutations of the gene encoding the Ca2+ channel α1A subunit cause cerebellar ataxia and other forms of neurological disorders. A missense mutation was found in thetottering (tg) mice, which display a delayed-onset, recessive disorder consisting of ataxia, motor seizure, and absence seizure resembling petit mal epilepsy (20Fletcher C.F.

Thetg mutation causes substitution of leucine for proline at a position close to the conserved pore-lining region (P region) in the extracellular segment in the second repeat. Mice with an allelic tottering mutation leaner (tg la), which causes severer symptoms, were found to have a single nucleotide substitution at an exon/intron junction, which results in skipping the exon/intron, or results in failure to splice out the succeeding intron. In both cases, the tg la mutation causes truncation of the normal open reading frame and expression of aberrant C-terminal sequences. Furthermore, in the human α1ACa2+ channel gene, missense mutations were found in familial hemiplegic migraine, mutations disrupting the reading frame in episodic ataxia type-2 (21Ophoff R.A.

Here, in order to disclose the causative relationship among the tottering mutations, the affected Ca2+ channel properties, and the neurological disorders, we made comprehensive comparison of the mutant Ca2+ channel properties in native Purkinje cells of tottering tg andtg la mice, where many other factors can affect the channel phenotype, and in the recombinant expression system, where direct effects of the mutations can be evaluated precisely. C57BL/6Jtg and C57BL/6J-Os+/+tg la strains were introduced from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) to the Eisai Tsukuba Research Laboratories. The mice were provided with a commercial diet (CE-2, Nihon Clea, Tokyo, Japan) and water ad libitumunder conventional conditions with controlled temperature, humidity, and lighting. The oligosyndactylism (Os) heterozygous phenotype is a marker for the tg la heterozygote of tg. A PCR-RFLP method was developed to distinguish between genotypes of tg andtg la mice. In the case oftg la, its genotypes can be inferred by theOs phenotype which is tightly linked withtg la. However, since recombination betweentg la and Os, which leads to an error in tg la genotyping, is possible, we developed a PCR-RFLP method also for tg la genotyping. We first obtained the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the tg andtg la mutations using GenomeWalkerTMkit for Mouse (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturers instruction. First PCR was done with an adapter primer 1 (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and a gene-specific primer, with the parameters consisting of 7 cycles of 25 s at 94 °C and 4 min at 72 °C, 32 cycles of 25 s at 94 °C and 4 min at 67 °C with a final extension for 4 min at 67 °C in MiniCycerTM (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). The resulting PCR products were amplified using a nested adapter primer 2 (5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGT-3′) and a nested gene-specific primer. The conditions of nested PCR consisted of 5 cycles of 25 s at 94 °C and 4 min at 72 °C, 22 cycles of 25 s at 94 °C and 4 min at 67 °C with an additional 4 min at 67 °C. The oligonucleotides used for the cloning are summarized in Fig. 1. The nested PCR products were TA-subcloned to pT7Blue(R)T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Nucleotide sequences were determined by a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA) using T7 and U19 primers with an ABI PrismTM 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). PCR conditions for sequencing were 25 cycles of 10 s at 96 °C, 5 s at 50 °C, and 4 min at 60 °C in GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). The nucleotide sequences of 1633- and 2099-bp genomic fragments including the tg and tg lamutation were determined (GenBank/EMBL accession numbers, AB011275 andAB011276, respectively). PCR primers for amplifying genomic fragments necessary fortg and tg la genotyping were designed based on the above mentioned sequence results. Primers designed were: 5′-GGAAACCAGAAGCTGAACCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATGGAGGAATTCAGGG-3′ (antisense) for tg, and 5′-ACGAAGGCGGCATGAAGGAGA-3′ (TGLA-1; sense) and 5′-TTCCATGGGGAGGTAGTGTT-3′ (TGLA-5R; antisense) fortg la. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tail as follows: a mouse tail tip about 2 mm in length was cut and put into a 0.5-ml tube with a safety lock. Forty μl of distilled water and a drop of mineral oil (Sigma) were added. The sample was heated at 96 °C for 10 min, and then treated with proteinase K at 55 °C for 90 min. One μl of the DNA-extracted solution was used as a template for PCR. The PCR parameters consisted of 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting PCR products were digested with AciI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) andBsaJI (New England Biolabs) for tg andtg la genotyping, respectively. The digested products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2.0% agarose/Et-Br gel and typed. Digestion with the enzymes yielded the following fragments: 295 bp in tg/tg, 127 and 168 bp in +/+, and 127, 168, and 295 bp in tg/+; 229 bp intg la/tg la, and 91 and 138 bp in +/+ (Fig. 1 C).

The PCR product was digested with BglII and NcoI, and the yielded mouse fragment was substituted for the correspondingEcoRI(1568)/HindIII(2210) sequence of the rabbit α1A (BI-2) cDNA in the recombinant plasmid pK4KBI-2 (24Niidome T.

For construction of expression cDNA encoding thetg la (long)-α1A (BI-2) subunit mutant with intron, a partial genomic α1A DNA was first isolated from B6.AKR-tg la/tg la mouse liver, by PCR amplification using KlenTaq Polymerase (CLONTECH), the primers TGLA-1 (5′-ACGAAGGCGGCATGAAGGAGA-3′) (sense) and TGLA-5R (5′-TTCCATGGGGAGGTAGTGTT-3′) (antisense). A partial mouse α1A cDNA was also isolated from C57BL/6J (B6) mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA, by PCR amplification using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), the primers mBI-7 (5′-CCTCAAGCACTCAGTGGATGCTAC-3′) (sense) and mBI-8 (5′-GTCAATATCTTCGTGGCCTTGATC-3′) (antisense). A PCR fragment amplified using the mouse α1A cDNA, a primer mBIBg-1(+) (5′-GTGGGCAAGATCTATGCCGCCATG-3′) (sense) and a primer TGLA-3R (5′-GCCAGTCTTCTGGAACATCTC-3′) (antisense), and a PCR fragment amplified using the mouse genomic α1A DNA, and a primer TGLA-2 (5′-GAGATGTTCCAGAAGACTGGC-3′) (sense) and TGLA-5R, were combined with primers mBIBg-1(+) and TGLA-5R for further PCR.

Purkinje cells were freshly dissociated from 18- to 30-day old mice under ether anesthesia. The procedure for obtaining dissociated cells from mice is similar to that described elsewhere (25Wakamori M. Hidaka H. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 585-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Coronal slices (400-μm thick) of cerebellum were prepared using a microslicer (DTK-1000, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan). After preincubation in Krebs solution for 40 min at 31 °C, the slices were digested: first in Krebs solution containing 0.01% Pronase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 25 min at 31 °C and then in solution containing 0.01% thermolysin (type X, Sigma) for 25 min at 31 °C. The Krebs solution used for preincubation and digestion contained the following (in mm): 124 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose. The solution was continuously oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Then the brain slices were punched out and dissociated mechanically by the use of fine glass pipettes having a tip diameter of 100–200 μm in a standard perfusing solution. Dissociated cells settled on tissue culture dishes (Primaria number 3801, Nippon Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) within 30 min. Purkinje cells were identified by their large diameter and characteristic pear shape because of the stump of the apical dendrite. To make a sufficient space-clamp of the Purkinje cell body, Purkinje cells lacking most of dendrites were used throughout the present experiments. BHK cells were transfected with the pAGS-3 recombinant plasmid pAGS-3a2 (26Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and pCABE (24Niidome T. Teramoto T. Murata Y. Tanaka I. Seto T. Sawada K. Mori Y. Katayama K. Biochem.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar), and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G-418 (600 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersberg, MD), to first establish a BHK line, BHK6, with stable expression of the α2/δ and β1a subunits. BHK6 cells were subsequently transfected with the tg mutant construct pK4KBI-tg using Tfx-50 reagents (Promega, Madison, WI), and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing methotrexate (500 nm) (Sigma), to obtain a BHK line, BHK-BI-tg, stably expressing the α1A subunit with the tg mutation and the α2/δ and β1a subunits. Electrophysiological measurements and Northern blot analysis were employed to identify functional expression of the α1A channel in BHK-BI-tg. To transiently express tg la mutant α1A channels, BHK6 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid pK4KBI-tg la (long) or pK4KBI-tg la (short) plus pH3-CD8 containing the cDNA of the T-cell antigen CD8 (28Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Cells were trypsinized, diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated onto Celldesk (Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) 18 h after transfection. Then cells were subjected to measurements 48–66 h after plating on the coverslips. Cells expressing α1A channels were selected through detection of CD8 coexpression using polystyrene microspheres precoated with antibody to CD8 (Dynabeads M-450 CD8; DYNAL, Oslo, Norway). Electrophysiological measurements were performed on Purkinje cell and BHK cells. BHK cells, stably expressing wild-type or tg-α1A channel, were seeded onto plastic coverslips, Celldesk, and incubated in culture medium for 5–8 days. Currents were recorded at room temperature (22–25 °C) using whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) or an EPC-7 (List Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter, 1.1 mm inner diameter; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) using a model P-87 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., San Rafael, CA). The patch electrodes were fire-polished. Pipette resistance ranged from 1 to 2 megohm when filled with the pipette solutions described below. The series resistance was electronically compensated to >70% and both the leakage and the remaining capacitance were subtracted by −P/6 method. Currents were sampled at 100 kHz after low pass filtering at 10 kHz (−3 db) using the 8-pole Bessel filter (Model 900, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) in the experiments of activation kinetics, otherwise sampled at 10 kHz after low pass filtering at 2 kHz (−3 db). Data were collected and analyzed using the pCLAMP 6.02 software (Axon Instruments). Ba2+currents were recorded in an external solution that contained (in mm): 3 BaCl2, 155 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium-OH). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 85 Cs-aspartate, 40 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 ATPMg, 5 HEPES, 10 creatine phosphate (pH adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH). In the experiments with ω-Aga IVA, the external solution was always supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml cytochrome c. Cytochrome c at 0.1 mg/ml had no effect on Ba2+ currents. Rapid application of drugs were made by a modified “Y-tube” method. Details of this technique have already appeared (30Wakamori M. Strobeck M. Niidome T. Teramoto T. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The external solution surrounding a cell recorded was completely exchanged within 200 ms. Statistical comparison between normal and mutant mice or mutant channels was performed by Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). The cell-attached patch recording technique was used to measure single-channel currents (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). Patch electrodes were coated with silicone (KE-106, Shinetsu Silicone, Tokyo, Japan) and had resistance of 5–8 megohms. The bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.2 mmEGTA, pH 7.4, with KOH. The composition of the pipette solution was 110 mm BaCl2 and 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with Ba(OH)2. Voltage steps with duration of 150 ms were given every 2 s from a holding potential of −100 mV. The data, low-passed filtered at 1 kHz (−3 db, 8-pole Bessel filter), were digitized at 10 kHz and analyzed using the pCLAMP 6.02 software. The records were corrected for capacitative and leakage currents by subtraction of the average of records without channel activity. Mouse α1A genotypes were determined prior to electrophysiological characterization of Ca2+ channel currents in Purkinje neurons. PCR and subsequent digestion of the resulting products by the restriction enzymes AciI andBsaJI, whose sites are only present in normal genomes, distinguished tottering (tg) andleaner (tg la), respectively, from normal genotypes (Fig. 1). Cerebellar Purkinje neurons were freshly dissociated from 18- to 30-day old normal (C57BL/6J, n = 13), tg(n = 9), and tg la mice (n = 7). We first compared maximum amplitudes of currents evoked by step pulses from a holding potential (V h) of −80 mV in 3 mmBa2+ solution (Fig. 2). In normal mice, maximum amplitudes varied from 1.21 to 12.54 nA, whereas they were reduced in tg mice and tg lamice; their maximum amplitudes were at most 5.39 and 4.67 nA, respectively. The mean amplitudes for tg mice (2.95 ± 0.25 nA, n = 27) and tg la mice (2.09 ± 0.17 nA, n = 25) were significantly smaller than that for normal mice (5.09 ± 0.29 nA,n = 67). The tg la mice grow up slowly presumably due to malnutrition, which might cause a smaller cell size, consequently resulting in the smaller amplitude. However, the cell capacitance was very similar among the three groups. The mean capacitance was 16.7 ± 0.5 pF (n = 67) for normal mice, 18.0 ± 0.8 pF (n = 27) for tgmice, and 17.4 ± 0.8 pF (n = 25) fortg la mice, indicating that cell bodies of cerebellar Purkinje neurons grow up similarly in regard to morphology. The current density, current amplitude divided by cell capacitance, is also an index for comparison of channel activity among the three groups. The current density for both tg mice (184.2 ± 18.1 pA/pF, n = 27) and tg lamice (122.8 ± 9.0 pA/pF, n = 25) is significantly lower than that for normal mice (333.4 ± 18.1 pA/pF,n = 67). During preparation of this article, reduction in Ca2+ channel currents in tg laPurkinje cells was reported (31Lorenzon N.M. Lutz C.M. Frankel W.N. Beam K.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4482-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Do the natural mutant mice exhibit diminished P-type Ca2+channel activity? We examined this question with a P-type Ca2+ channel blocker, ω-Aga IVA. Application of 100 μm ω-Aga IVA reduced the current density to 25.5 ± 2.5 pA/pF (n = 7) in normal mice, indicating that more than 90% of high threshold current in cerebellar Purkinje cells flow through the P-type Ca2+ channel. This result confirms the previous observation in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (32Mintz I.M. Adams M.E. Bean B.P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 33Melliti K. Bournaud R. Bastide B. Shimahara T. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showing that ω-Aga IVA inhibits around 90% of total Ca2+current. The current density insensitive to ω-Aga IVA was 21.7 ± 5.9 pA/pF (n = 4) in tg mice and 29.8 ± 2.6 pA/pF (n = 12) intg la mice. The residual current density intg la mice was higher than that in normal mice, but the values were not different substantially among the three groups. It is concluded that current amplitude and current density of P-type Ca2+ channel are reduced in tg andtg la mice. Furthermore, ω-Aga IVA-insensitive Ca2+ channels, whose amplitude is not affected by the mutations, do not compensate cerebellar Purkinje cells for low channel activity. Fig. 3 shows Ca2+ channel currents and their current-voltage (I-V) relationships in Purkinje cells from normal and mutant mice. Ba2+ currents were elicited with 30-ms depolarizing pulses from aV h of −80 mV to test potentials from −50 to 50 or 60 mV with increments of 10 mV in 3 mm Ba2+solution. The current density was significantly lower at test potentials between −20 and 20 mV for tg mice and between −40 and 20 mV for tg la mice. The Ba2+ currents in normal and tg mice were similar in the I-V relationship with currents first detectable at voltages near −40 mV, grew to reach the maximal amplitude around −20 mV and then declined toward a zero current asymptote with further depolarization. However, the I-V relationship for tg la m"

https://openalex.org/W2091966204,"Exocytosis-mediated glutamate release from ribbon-type synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar cells was studied using AMPA receptors and simultaneous membrane capacitance measurements. Release onset (delay <0.8 ms) and offset were closely tied to Ca2+ channel opening and closing. Asynchronous release was not copious and we estimate that there are approximately 5 Ca2+ channels per docked synaptic vesicle. Depending on Ca2+ current amplitude, release occurred in a single fast bout or in two successive bouts with fast and slow onset kinetics. The second, slower bout may reflect a mobilization rate of reserve vesicles toward fusion sites that is accelerated by increasing Ca2+ influx. Bipolar cell synaptic ribbons thus are remarkably versatile signal transducers, capable of transmitting rapidly changing sensory input, as well as sustained stimuli, due to their large pool of releasable vesicles."

Recent developments in methodology allow computation of both the sign and the magnitude of these rotation angles. However, a general strategy for assigning the individual contributions that atoms and functional groups make to the optical rotation angle and, more generally, to the molecular chirality has remained elusive. Here, a method to determine the atomic contributions to the optical rotation angle is reported. This approach links chemical structure with optical rotation angle and provides a quantitative measure of molecular asymmetry propagation from a center, axis, or plane of chirality."
https://openalex.org/W2006610332,"Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) plays an important role in expression of many cytokine genes including interleukin-2 and interleukin-4. However, its role in interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression is not well understood. In the current studies, two strong NFAT-binding sites in the IFN-γ promoter were identified by DNase I footprint analysis at positions −280 to −270 and −163 to −155. NFATp bound independently to both sites and was required for the formation of a composite element with AP-1 spanning position −163 to −147. In Jurkat T cells and primary lymphocytes, activation-induced expression of IFN-γ reporter constructs containing point mutations in either NFAT site or the AP-1 component of the composite site was decreased by ∼40–65%. Despite elimination of both strong NFAT-binding sites, the IFN-γ promoter remained completely sensitive to inhibition by cyclosporin. This suggests that other elements in the IFN-γ promoter, such as the IFN-γ proximal element, are sufficient for cyclosporin sensitivity of this gene. Ying-Yang 1 (YY1), a potential inhibitor of IFN-γ expression, binds to sites located between the two NFAT sites. Mutation of the YY1 sites alone had little effect on IFN-γ promoter activity. However, mutation of both the NFAT and YY1-binding sites abolished activation-induced expression in primary murine splenocytes but not in Jurkat T cells.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic NFAT components belong to a large family of regulatory transcription factors comprised of at least four members, NFATp (NFAT1), NFATc (NFAT2), NFAT3, and NFAT4 (NFATx), which are differentially expressed in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells (18McCaffrey P.G.

In T cells, NFATp is expressed in both unstimulated and stimulated cells, whereas NFATc is expressed primarily in activated cells (18McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M.

The interferon-γ (IFN-γ) gene is cyclosporin-sensitive, but the mechanism for cyclosporin sensitivity of this gene has not been fully elucidated. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the region between −108 and −40 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcription start site in the IFN-γ promoter is able to confer activation-specific, cyclosporin-sensitive expression in T cells (25Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Within this region, one target of the inhibitory effect of cyclosporin is the IFN-γ proximal element (−73 to −48 bp), which binds multiple transcription factors but not NFAT (26Penix L.A. Sweetser M.T. Weaver W.M. Hoeffler J.P. Kerppola T.K. Wilson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31964-31972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Further upstream the IFN-γ promoter contains several sequences that are homologous to NFAT-binding sites in the IL-4 gene (27Campbell P.M. Pimm J. Ramassar V. Halloran P.F. Transplantation. 1996; 61: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NFATp has been shown to bind to one of these sites, and it was proposed that calcineurin-inducible transcriptional factors act at this site to enhance IFN-γ expression (28Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The role of NFAT in the function of the IFN-γ promoter was more fully explored in the current studies. NFAT bound to additional sites in the IFN-γ promoter, and the two strong binding sites were required for maximal expression of an IFN-γ reporter construct containing 538 bp of the IFN-γ promoter. However, these two NFAT-binding sites were not required for cyclosporin sensitivity. In contrast to results seen with the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters, transient cotransfection studies suggested that NFAT was not a limiting factor for IFN-γ gene expression in Jurkat T cells. In primary murine splenocytes, which have lower levels of endogenous NFAT protein, overexpression of NFATp or NFATc enhanced expression of the IFN-γ promoter. YY1 is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein, which can activate, repress, or initiate transcription depending on the context in which its binds (29Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). YY1 is constitutively expressed and is known to interact with other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation such as c-Myc (30Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that YY1 inhibits basal IFN-γ expression through two mechanisms: binding to an AP-2-like repressor protein, and competition with AP-1 for DNA binding (37Ye J. Ghosh P.

In this work, the YY1-binding sites, which are located between the two strong NFAT-binding sites in the IFN-γ promoter, did not mediate inhibition of basal expression of IFN-γ. Furthermore, in contrast to its putative role as an inhibitor of IFN-γ expression, YY1 appeared to play a positive role in initiating IFN-γ gene expression in primary murine splenocytes. A line of Jurkat T cells, which expresses IFN-γ following activation, was maintained as described previously (25Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Splenocytes obtained from B10.BR or C57Bl/6 mice, which were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our specific pathogen-free facility, were depleted of erythrocytes with an ammonium chloride lysis solution (0.15m NH4Cl, 1 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA). The remaining mononuclear cells were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), GlutaMAX, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin plus 3 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) prior to electroporation. Rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies to AP-1 proteins, YY1, and Oct-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and are as follows: anti-pan-Jun (c-Jun/AP-1(D)), anti-c-Jun-specific (c-Jun/AP-1(N)), anti-YY1 (C-20), and anti-Oct-1. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to NFATp was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit antiserum to members of the NF-κB family including p50 (1141, directed against a peptide containing residues 2–16 of human p50), p65 (1226, directed against a peptide containing the carboxyl-terminal 14 residues of human p65), and c-Rel (265) were provided by Nancy Rice (National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD) (39Rice N.R.

Point mutations in the NFAT-, AP-1-, and YY1-binding sites were made in the context of the full-length IFN-γ promoter (pIFN-538) by polymerase chain reaction-site directed mutagenesis. The NFAT-binding site mutations contained a GG to TT substitution, which disrupts NFAT binding. The AP-1-binding site mutation (a CT to AA substitution at −151, −150) disrupts AP-1 binding but not NFAT binding to the NFAT −160 site. For the NFAT −160 mutation (N160) and the AP-1 −160 mutation (AP160), a 280-bp BglII/Kpn fragment containing the substitution was subcloned into pIFN-538Δ−177/−109. A 360-bpXba/BglII fragment with the NFAT −280 substitution was subcloned into pIFN-538Δ−214/−178 for the NFAT −280 mutation (N280), and into the N160 construct for the double NFAT mutation (N160/N280). Point mutations in the Y1 site alone (a T to A substitution at −201) or in this site and the Y2 site (a GG to CA substitution at −218, −217) are known to disrupt YY1 binding at these sites (38Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The YY1 mutations were then inserted into the wild-type pIFN-538 (Y1 or Y1Y2) or double NFAT mutant −538 construct (NY1 or NY1Y2). The sequence of each construct was confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing (Perkin-Elmer). All of the IFN-γ promoter constructs mentioned above were subcloned into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3, from Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmids containing the full-length coding regions for each of the NF-AT genes (NF-ATp, NF-ATc, NF-AT3, and NF-AT4) were subcloned into the Rous sarcoma virus expression vector pREP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (20Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg/106 cells of an IFN-γ β-galactosidase plasmid and 0.54 μg/106 cells of control β-actin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 by electroporation (ECM600, BTX Inc., San Diego, CA) as described previously (25Penix L.

In cotransfection experiments, the total amount of plasmid per cuvette was kept constant by addition of control pREP4 plasmid. After electroporation, the cells were either not stimulated or stimulated with ionomycin (1.5 μm) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 25 ng/ml), with or without pretreatment with cyclosporin A (CSA, 500 ng/ml) for 20 min as described previously (25Penix L.

Cell lysates were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red as substrate (40Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Coberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar) and corrected for transcription efficacy by normalizing to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase content as described previously (25Penix L.

In the transfection experiments involving primary lymphoid cells, murine splenocytes were harvested and treated with 3 μg/ml ConA 21 h prior to transfection to allow uptake of DNA (41Cron R.Q. Schubert L.A. Lewis D.B. Hughes C.C.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 splenocytes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of IFN-γ firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of control plasmid containing the β-actin promoter driving Renillaluciferase in 0.25 ml of complete media (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin) by electroporation (Bio-Rad, 250 V, 960 microfarads). After electroporation, the cells were rested for 2 h and then stimulated with 25 ng/ml PMA and 1.5 μm ionomycin or media alone. In certain experiments, some cells were treated with cyclosporin A (1 μg/ml) for 35–45 min prior to stimulation. Lysates were harvested at 5 h and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity utilizing a Dual Luciferase Reporter kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Values are reported as relative light units after correction for transfection efficiency by normalization to the β-actin promoter driving Renillaluciferase. In the cotransfection experiments, the splenocytes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of IFN-γ firefly luciferase reporter and 10 μg of the appropriate NFAT expression vector without addition of the β-actin promoter Renilla luciferase plasmid. Values are reported as absolute light units without correction for transfection efficiency by normalization to the β-actin promoter, since overexpression of NFAT proteins in murine splenocytes increased β-actin promoter expression compared with the control pREP4 vector (data not shown). The DNA template for the footprinting experiments was made by end labeling a human (−350 to +50) IFN-γ promoter fragment at either end. The binding reactions and DNase I digestions were carried out as described previously (8Rooney J.W. Hoey T. Glimcher L.H.

This suggests that unlike other cyclosporin-sensitive promoters of lymphokines expressed in T cells, cyclosporin sensitivity of the IFN-γ promoter may not be due to the inhibitory effects of this drug on NFAT activation. However, it is possible that NFAT proteins bind at other sites within the full-length promoter (27Campbell P.M. Pimm J. Ramassar V. Halloran P.F. Transplantation. 1996; 61: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol.

To address this possibility, DNase I footprint analysis of the IFN-γ promoter was performed using recombinant NFATp, AP-1 (c-Jun and Fra-1) and ATF-2 proteins (Figs. 1 and2). AP-1 and ATF-2 proteins were used because they are known to bind to the IFN-γ promoter (26Penix L.A. Sweetser M.T. Weaver W.M. Hoeffler J.P. Kerppola T.K. Wilson C.B. J. Biol.

Recombinant NFATp bound strongly and independently to two regions protecting nucleotides spanning positions −280 to −265 and −168 to −153 bp relative to the transcription start site (Figs. 1 A, lane 12, andB, lane 3, and 2 B, lane 2). The most distal NFAT site, which is referred to as the NFAT −280 site, contains a consensus NFAT-binding sequence at position −280 to −270 and is identical to the recently described C3–3P site that binds both NFAT and NF-kB proteins (28Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The second NFAT site contains a consensus NFAT-binding sequence at position −163 to −155 and is referred to as the NFAT −160 site. The ability of NFATp to bind the NFAT −160 site is a novel finding. AP-1 (c-Jun plus Fra-1) bound independently to two previously defined sites (Figs. 1B, lane 4, and 2B, lane 3) as follows: the distal element at position −98 to −72 (25Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and a second site at position −196 to −183 (38Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R.

NFATp also protected a region spanning position −106 to −91 just 5′ to the distal element but bound weakly and only in the presence of AP-1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5; Fig.2 B, lane 4). NFATp did not bind to more proximal regions of the IFN-γ promoter, such as the proximal element (Fig. 2,A and B).

Single point mutations within the pma2 gene were previously identified that improved H+-ATPase activity and allowed yeast growth at pH 4.0. The aim of the present study was to identify most of the PMA2 positions, the mutation of which would lead to improved growth and to determine whether all these mutations result in similar enzymatic and structural modifications. We selected additional mutants in total 42 distinct point mutations localized in 30 codons. They were distributed in 10 soluble and membrane regions of the enzyme. Most mutant PMA2 H+-ATPases were characterized by a higher specific activity, lower inhibition by ADP, and lower stimulation by lysophosphatidylcholine than wild-type PMA2. The mutants thus seem to be constitutively activated. Partial tryptic digestion and immunodetection showed that the PMA2 mutants had a conformational change making the C-terminal region more accessible. These data therefore support the hypothesis that point mutations in various H+-ATPase parts displace the inhibitory C-terminal region, resulting in enzyme activation. The high density of mutations within the first half of the C-terminal region suggests that this part is involved in the interaction between the inhibitory C-terminal region and the rest of the enzyme.

The plasma membrane H+-ATPase in plants and fungi is an electrogenic pump that couples ATP hydrolysis to proton transport out of the cell. This enzyme is composed of a single type of subunit of about 100 kDa and belongs to the P-type ATPase family characterized by a phosphorylated intermediate during catalysis (1Pedersen P.L.

The pleiotropic responses to TGF-β are mediated via ligand-induced heteromeric complex formation by type I (TβR-I) and type II (TβR-II) serine-threonine kinase receptors. Several studies have shown that TβR-II acts as a primary receptor, binding TGF-β and phosphorylating TβR-I, whose kinase activity then propagates the signals. Therefore, intracellular proteins that interact with type I receptors are likely to play important roles in TGF-β signaling.

STRAP associates with both functional TβR-I and TβR-II in vivo. Overexpression of STRAP leads to inhibition of TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation. It also shows synergistic inhibition of TGF-β signaling in concert with Smad7, but not with Smad6, as measured by TGF-β-dependent transcriptional reporters.

Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor, which is a constitutively active kinase, transphosphorylates the type I receptor at serine and threonine residues clustered in the GS domain (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that TβR-I, acting downstream of TβR-II, is directly involved in transducing TGF-β signals to downstream effectors, including SMAD proteins (3Heldin C.-H.

Pathway-restricted SMADs interact transiently with and are phosphorylated by specific activated type I receptors. Smad2 and Smad3 mediate signaling by TGF-β and activin, whereas Smad1 and Smad5 are involved in BMP signaling. Smad4 is a common mediator of TGF-β, activin and BMP signals (3Heldin C.-H.

Using genetic complementation in yeast, a serine-threonine kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, TAK1, was identified as an alternative mediator of TGF-β signals (9Yamaguchi K.

Using yeast two-hybrid screens, several candidates interacting with TβR-I or TβR-II have been identified that may modulate receptor signaling. The FK506 and rapamycin-binding immunophilin, FKBP12, interacts with unstimulated TβR-I and other type I receptors. FKBP12 is not a substrate for the receptor kinase but inhibits its signaling function (10Wang T. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K.

Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), little is known about its role in TGF-β signaling. The C-terminal portion of TRAP-1 is sufficient for interaction with activated TβR-I and was shown to inhibit TGF-β signaling (14Charng M.J. Zhang D. Kinnunen P. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9365-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, TRIP-1 was identified as a TβR-II interacting protein, whose functional importance is not known (15Chen R.-H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the nature and mechanism of activation of TGF-β receptors at the cell surface has been described and the roster of potential regulators of TGF-β signaling continues to expand, little is known at the molecular level about the signaling mechanisms immediately downstream of TGF-β receptors. To search for intracellular signal mediators that interact with the cytoplasmic region of TβR-I, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid system. One of the identified clones encoded a novel, WD domain-containing protein (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), STRAP, which interacts with both type I and type II TGF-β receptors in vivo. Moreover, we show that this gene is evolutionarily conserved and can negatively regulate gene expression from TGF-β-responsive promoters. A mouse embryonic cDNA expression library in yeast Y190 was used for two-hybrid screening as described (17Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

Shah P. Donahoe P.K. Wang X.-F. Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (R4C, amino acids 146–501) was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pAS2. The resulting clones were subjected to yeast mating assay for interaction specificity using the Y187 strain of the opposite mating type containing the unrelated proteins p53, lamin, SNF1, and CDK2 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and were tested for β-galactosidase activity. Clones specific for R4C were further tested for specific interaction. STRAP cDNA was used as a probe to screen a mouse embryonic (8.5–9.0 days postcoitus) cDNA library in λZAP II (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The inserts of five clones of thirteen positive clones showed an in-frame stop codon (TGA) 72 base pairs upstream from the ATG start codon and Kozak consensus sequence (20Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar). The GenBank™ accession number for STRAP isAF096285. A blot (CLONTECH) containing mRNA (2 μg/lane) from multiple mouse tissues was prehybridized and hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was probed with32P-labeled STRAP and actin cDNAs sequentially. Similarly, a membrane (CLONTECH) containing genomic DNA (4 μg/lane) from various eukaryotic species, digested withEcoRI, was probed with 32P-labeled STRAP. The complete coding region of STRAP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), with one copy of the Flag epitope in-frame to the C terminus to generate STRAP-Flag. Similarly STRAP-HA was made. All receptor constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Joan Massagué. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with indicated plasmids using a calcium-phosphate precipitation method (21Datta P.K. Bagchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25392-25399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 40 h, cells were washed and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml of each of leupeptin, pepstatin and aprotinin). Cleared cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (IBI, Eastman Kodak), anti-TβR-I polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-TβR-II polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by adsorption to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and tagged proteins were immunoblotted with either anti-Flag antibody or anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y11, Santa Cruz) and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Transfected COS-1 cells were affinity labeled using 125I-TGF-β1 by chemical cross-linking as described (22Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and affinity labeled receptor complexes coprecipitated with STRAP were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Mv1Lu or its derivative R1B/L17 cells were seeded at 40−60% confluence in 12-well plates and transfected 24 h after plating using a DEAE-dextran transfection method (Promega). After overnight recovery cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% fetal bovine serum with or without 100 pm TGF-β1 for 20 h. Luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were measured in an Analytical Luminescence Labs Monolight 2010 Luminometer. Using the cytoplasmic domain of type I TGF-β receptor from rat (R4C) as the bait, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (17Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). One clone encoded FKBP12.6, a related member of the FKBP family that shares many structural and functional similarities with FKBP12 (23Lam E. Martin M.M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C. Fleischer S. Lukas T. Abraham R.T. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Wiederrecht G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26511-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The remaining clone encoded a novel WD domain-containing protein, designated STRAP. The specificity of the interaction between R4C and STRAP in yeast was tested using several unrelated proteins (data not shown). None of these control proteins interacted with STRAP. When R4C was tested, positive interaction was detected with STRAP and FKBP12.6. The specificity and strength of the interaction between R4C and STRAP in the yeast system was further investigated by the quantitative β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1 A). The interaction of STRAP with R4C was weaker than that of FKBP12.6, which interacted strongly. The STRAP clone yielded a 1648-base pair cDNA with an open reading frame of 351 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Screening of another mouse embryonic cDNA library with the STRAP cDNA as probe resulted in the isolation of five clones that yielded 1.8-kb cDNAs with an in-frame termination codon (TGA) preceding the putative initiating methionine of the STRAP open reading frame. The in vitro translated STRAP migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Sequence analysis indicates that STRAP contains six WD domains. A search of GenBank™ using BLAST and the alignment program MegAlign revealed maximum similarity (∼19%) in the amino acid level with another WD repeat protein TRIP-1, a TGF-β type II receptor interacting protein (15Chen R.-H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Some of these similarities are among the conserved amino acid residues within the WD repeats. To analyze the expression pattern of the STRAP gene, Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from different mouse tissues was performed (Fig. 2 A). A major transcript of 1.8 kb was detected in all tissues examined, with the highest levels in liver and testis and lesser abundance in spleen. In some tissues, larger transcripts were detected. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from different cell lines including Mv1Lu, 293R, R1B/L17, COS-1, and MCF7 showed one message of 2.0 kb (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from different species was performed using the STRAP cDNA as a probe. The presence of different size fragments in all species tested indicated conservation of the STRAP gene from yeast to mammals (Fig. 2 B). To investigate the association of STRAP with TβR-I in vivo, STRAP-Flag was transfected into COS-1 cells alone or in combination with HA-tagged wild type and several mutant forms of TβR-I. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Flag, and each immunoprecipitate was then probed with antibodies to HA. A comparable amount of TβR-I was detected in each immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3 A,first panel, lanes 4–7), revealing that TβR-I can be coimmunoprecipitated with STRAP. Reciprocal experiments in which proteins immunoprecipitated by antibodies to TβR-I were blotted with an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3 A, second panel) confirmed the association of STRAP with ligand-free TβR-I. This association was minimally affected by the mutations K232R (kinase negative), T204D (constitutively active), or 185–204 (activation incompetent) in TβR-I (24Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To determine whether STRAP can also interact with TβR-II, similar experiments were performed using HA-tagged TβR-II coexpressed with STRAP-Flag (Fig. 3 B). TβR-II was coimmunoprecipitated with STRAP (top panel) and vice versa (bottom panel), demonstrating that STRAP interacts with TβR-II in vivo. But STRAP did not interact under similar conditions with the unrelated proteins RhoB or Smad1 when coexpressed in COS-1 cells (data not shown). HA-tagged STRAP also associated with Flag-tagged receptors, demonstrating that the association was independent of the epitope tag employed. Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation of both receptors with STRAP (lane 3) was not affected by the treatment of cells with TGF-β1 (Fig.3 C, lane 4). Finally, we examined the association of STRAP with the TGF-β receptor complex in affinity cross-linking experiments. 125I-TGF-β1-bound TβR-I-TβR-II heteromeric complexes could be coimmunoprecipitated with STRAP (Fig.3 D). Thus, STRAP associates specifically with TβR-I and TβR-II in mammalian cells. To explore the functional significance of the interaction between STRAP and TGF-β receptors we focused our analyses on a TGF-β-responsive reporter, p3TP-Lux, which contains elements from the PAI-1 promoter and drives expression of a luciferase reporter gene (24Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). TβR-I restores responsiveness to TGF-β in transfected RIB/L17 cells (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of STRAP suppressed the TGF-β-induced increase in luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of p3TP-Lux by TGF-β was decreased from 51- to 23-fold by 1 μg of STRAP expression plasmid. Analogous inhibition was observed in HepG2 cells using another TGF-β-responsive reporter (CAGA)9MLP-Luc, which contains multiple Smad3/Smad4 binding CAGA boxes upstream of a minimal adenovirus major late promoter (data not shown) (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Dijke P.t. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). To examine whether STRAP can cooperate with inhibitory SMADs in the inhibition of TGF-β-induced transcription, Mv1Lu cells were transfected with the reporter p3TP-Lux and expression plasmids as shown in Fig. 4 B. Smad7 inhibited TGF-β1-induced luciferase activity as expected (7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.-Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Smad7 with STRAP resulted in synergistic inhibition of p3TP-Lux transactivation in response to TGF-β. However, STRAP did not synergize with Smad6, an antagonist of BMP signaling (6Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with the (CAGA)9 MLP-Luc reporter. These results suggest that STRAP can function as a negative regulator of transcription by TGF-β. Members of the TGF-β family exert a wide range of biological effects on a large variety of cell types. Numerous studies have been conducted to understand the signal transduction pathways downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex. Recent evidence suggests that SMAD proteins are clearly crucial for signal transduction by members of the TGF-β family (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 4Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that other signaling pathways may exist for transducing specific signals. The SMAD signaling pathways, which offer combinatorial diversity, can be modulated at multiple levels. At the receptor level, the immunophilin FKBP12 binds to TβR-I and inhibits its signaling function (10Wang T. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T.

Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and TRIP-1 (15Chen R.-H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) similarly might have regulatory roles. In our study, the findings that STRAP associates with both types of TGF-β receptors and inhibits TGF-β induced transcription in concert with its synergistic inhibition with Smad7 suggest that STRAP is a potential candidate in mediating TGF-β signals. We also report here the interaction between TβR-I and FKBP12.6, a member of the FKBP family (23Lam E. Martin M.M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C. Fleischer S. Lukas T. Abraham R.T. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Wiederrecht G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26511-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This interaction may also have some inhibitory effect in TGF-β signaling, like FKBP12. Sequence analysis of the predicted open reading frame encoding STRAP revealed it to be a member of the family of WD repeat proteins (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). WD repeat proteins appear to serve regulatory functions in various cellular processes. Many WD repeat proteins are involved in signal transduction, such as the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, RACK1, PLAP, the regulatory subunit of phosphatase 2A, or TRIP-1 (26Klages S.A. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Many WD repeat proteins help to assemble macromolecular complexes, as shown for the β-subunit of G proteins (27Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Such proteins present a changeable surface for protein-protein interaction and are capable of protein-induced conformational changes. STRAP associates with both receptors, and it can form homo-oligomers (data not shown) most likely through WD repeats. STRAP showed synergistic inhibition of TGF-β signaling with Smad7, as measured by the p3TP-Lux and (CAGA)9 MLP-Luc reporters. Smad7 interacts with the TGF-β type I receptor in the presence of TGF-β, thereby blocking the association, phosphorylation, and activation of Smad2 and Smad3, thus inhibiting TGF-β signaling (7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.-Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 8Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). It is possible that STRAP stabilizes the complex between Smad7 and the receptors to inhibit TGF-β-dependent gene transcription. In contrast, STRAP did not synergize with Smad6. This is consistent with both a distinct mechanism of inhibition for Smad6 and its primary role in regulating BMP signals (6Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Analogous to the recruitment of signaling components to receptor tyrosine kinases, STRAP may be involved generally in recruiting downstream regulatory molecules to the receptor serine-threonine kinases. Future studies will investigate the involvement of STRAP in TGF-β signaling via SMADs or other pathways. We thank S. Elledge, J. Massagué, E. Olson, M. Kawabata, X.-F. Wang, P.

The sarcoglycan complex contributes to maintenance of sarcolemma integrity. A shared feature of four types of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is that mutations in a single sarcoglycan gene result in the loss of all sarcoglycans at the sarcolemma. The mechanism of destabilization is unknown. We report here our findings of sarcoglycan complex biosynthesis in a heterologous cell system. We demonstrate that the sarcoglycans are glycosylated and assemble into a complex that resides in the plasma membrane. Complex assembly was dependent on the simultaneous synthesis of all four sarcoglycans. Mutant sarcoglycans block complex formation and insertion of the sarcoglycans into the plasma membrane. This constitutes the first biochemical evidence to support the idea that the molecular defect in sarcoglycan-deficient LGMD is because of aberrant sarcoglycan complex assembly and trafficking, which leads to the absence of the complex from the sarcolemma.

The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) 1The abbreviations used are: DGC, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex; SG, sarcoglycan; LGMD, limb girdle muscular dystrophy; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a group of integral and membrane-associated proteins located in the sarcolemma of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers (for review see Refs. 1Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar and 2Straub V. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The DGC consists of dystrophin, the syntrophins, α- and β-dystroglycan, and sarcoglycan, which is composed of four distinct transmembrane glycoproteins named α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan (SG) (for review see Refs. 1Campbell K.P.

Sarcospan (25 kDa), a recently identified member of the DGC, is unique in that it is predicted to contain four transmembrane domains (3Crosbie R.H. Heighway J. Venzke D.P. Lee J.C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31221-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The DGC spans the sarcolemma and forms a functional link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton via the laminin-binding protein α-dystroglycan and the actin-binding protein dystrophin. The DGC is thought to stabilize the membrane against contraction-induced damage (4Petrof B.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 179: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

In each of these diseases a mutation in any one sarcoglycan gene results in the deficiency of the entire sarcoglycan complex. Genetic studies identified the BIO14.6 hamster as an animal model for sarcoglycan-deficient LGMD2F because of a deletion in the δ-SG gene (10Nigro V. Okazaki Y. Belsito A. Piluso G. Matsuda Y.

In this animal, dystrophic features are evident in skeletal and cardiac muscle (11Homburger F. Baker J.R. Nixon C.W. Whitney R. Med.

We reported the first example of sarcoglycan gene transfer and successful intervention of disease progression in the BIO14.6 hamster, employing a recombinant δ-SG adenovirus as a vehicle for gene transfer (14Holt K.H.

Our work demonstrated that the sarcoglycan complex is a requisite component of the DGC for stable anchorage of α-dystroglycan to the extracellular face of the sarcolemma, as well as maintenance of an intact sarcolemma. Despite rapid advances regarding the genetic defects that cause LGMD, little is known about the molecular defect underlying the disease. Furthermore, the sarcoglycan-deficient limb girdle muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of diseases (15Vainzof M. Passos-Bueno M.R. Canovas M. Moreira E.S. Pavanello R.C.M. Marie S.K.

Genet. 1996; 5: 1963-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and it will be important to understand how individual mutations abrogate sarcoglycan complex assembly. Mutations may result in the complete absence of messenger RNA for that gene, or alternatively an aberrant protein may be synthesized. In either case, protein trafficking miscues may result that block sarcoglycan complex biosynthesis. Maturation and trafficking of another integral membrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel, have been extensively studied. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in epithelial ion transport, often because of the loss of functional CFTR from the cell surface (16Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5946) Google Scholar). The majority of CF mutations affect maturation of the CFTR by altering the secondary structure and normal processing. The misfolded protein is targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (17Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 18Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

A similar defect in sarcoglycan biosynthesis and trafficking may underlie LGMD, although no studies have been performed to date to address this issue. Our goal was to develop a cell culture system for the analysis of sarcoglycan complex biosynthesis. We reasoned that a heterologous cell system that lacks muscle-specific proteins would be ideal for studying both normal and mutant sarcoglycans. We report here expression of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells utilizing a high efficiency transfection protocol. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the sarcoglycans are glycosylated and assemble into a tight complex that resides in the plasma membrane. Individually expressed sarcoglycans were likewise glycosylated; however, they were located in internal membrane pools. Strikingly, mutant sarcoglycan constructs engineered to recapitulate known human mutations were found to abrogate sarcoglycan complex assembly and targeting to the plasma membrane. These results strongly suggest that the molecular defect in sarcoglycan-deficient LGMD results from the aberrant assembly and trafficking of the sarcoglycan complex to its final destination, the sarcolemma. Furthermore, these results provide compelling support for the idea that sarcoglycan complex assembly requires concomitant synthesis of all four sarcoglycans. The Myc-tagged human α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and δΔ SG pcDNA3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression constructs have been described (14Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Straub V. Venzke D.P. Duclos F. Anderson R.D.

For the βΔ-SG and γΔ-SG deletion mutants, stop codons were introduced immediately following amino acids 150 and 173, respectively. All constructs were sequenced by the DNA Core Facility at the University of Iowa. CHO cells were maintained in α-minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with nucleosides and 10% fetal bovine serum.

We engineered cytomegalovirus expression vectors encoding full-length human α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG, as well as sarcoglycan deletion constructs that recapitulate mutations found in LGMD patients. All constructs contain a Myc epitope tag at the intracellular tail. A schematic representation of these proteins is shown in Fig.1. Overall, the sarcoglycans share a similar topology with a single transmembrane domain. The sarcoglycans are all glycosylated and possess clusters of cysteine residues in their extracellular domains. The sarcoglycan expression constructs were introduced into CHO cells by electroporation (estimated transfection efficiency of 90%). To evaluate the extent of glycosylation, cell extracts were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGaseF and analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Fig.2 A). All of the sarcoglycans are glycosylated, as evidenced by a decrease in molecular weight following PNGaseF treatment. Based on this crude estimation, the extent of glycosylation appears similar whether the proteins are expressed individually or all four together (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that the proteins are properly folded and competent to move through the glycolytic pathways. Next, to determine where the sarcoglycans reside within the cell, we examined the cytosolversus membrane distribution of the proteins. The sarcoglycans were found exclusively in the membrane fractions (Fig.2 B, lanes 2–6). As a control, the cytosolic adapter protein Grb2 was found in the soluble fraction (Fig.2 B, lane 7). One remarkable feature of the sarcoglycan complex isolated from native tissue is that the complex is resistant to disassembly under extreme conditions of detergent or alkaline pH (21Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Yamamoto H. Mizuno Y. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Jung D. Leturq F. Sunada Y. Duclos F. Tome F.M.S. Moomaw C. Merlini L. Azibi K. Chaouch M. Slaughter C. Fardeau M. Kaplan J.C. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To that end, we performed biochemical experiments to determine whether the sarcoglycans expressed in CHO cells assemble into a stable molecular complex. Cells transfected with individual sarcoglycans or with all four sarcoglycans were treated with NHS-biotin, a hydrophilic probe for surface molecules. This probe forms a covalent bond with free amines in surface proteins of living cells, and the biotin moiety then functions as a tag for precipitation with avidin-Sepharose. Fig.3 A demonstrates that in cells expressing α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG, the sarcoglycan complex is resident at the cell surface (lane 11). In contrast, in cells expressing any single sarcoglycan, little if any sarcoglycan protein appears at the cell surface, even in this overexposed blot (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7–10). This experiment has been replicated in at least six independent experiments. As a control, lysates were examined by 9E10 immunoblotting to confirm that similar amounts of sarcoglycan proteins were synthesized in all cells (Fig. 3A,lanes 2–6). To demonstrate formation of a stable molecular sarcoglycan complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitations using monoclonal antibodies against individual sarcoglycans. Immune complexes were analyzed by 9E10 immunoblotting, and as shown in Fig. 3 A (lane 12), α-, γ-, and δ-SG co-immunoprecipitate as a complex with β-SG. Specific immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibodies against α-, γ-, and δ-SG also resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of all other sarcoglycans (data not shown). Finally, we performed linear sucrose gradient fractionation of lysates from cells expressing α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG. As shown in Fig.3 B, the sarcoglycans migrate as a complex that peaks in fractions 3–5. Together these data provide strong evidence that simultaneous expression of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG in CHO cells results in the formation of a tight molecular complex. Furthermore, these results suggest that surface membrane localization of sarcoglycans depends on the coordinate synthesis and assembly of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG into a molecular complex. Most missense and deletion mutations known to cause LGMD are concentrated in the extracellular domains of the sarcoglycan proteins. With this in mind, we engineered sarcoglycan extracellular deletion mutants. The βΔ-SG mutant construct was designed to remove a large portion of the extracellular domain (see Fig. 1). In addition, the γΔ- and δΔ-SG constructs recapitulate known mutations causing LGMD2C and LGMD2F, respectively (8Noguchi S. McNally E.M. Othmane K.B. Hagiwara Y. Mizuno Y. Yoshida M. Yamamoto H. Bönneman C.G. Gussoni E. Denton P.H. Kyriakides T. Middleton L. Hentati F. Hamida M.B. Nonaka I. Vance J.M. Kunkel L.M. Ozawa E.

Genet. 1996; 14: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). For completeness, an α-SG deletion mutant was also constructed; however, expression was too low for use in this study. Lysates prepared from cells transfected with three normal sarcoglycans and the corresponding single deletion mutant were fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions and analyzed by 9E10 immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 4 A, the deletion mutants were expressed at levels comparable with the normal sarcoglycans, and like the normal proteins, the mutants were highly enriched in membranes. This was expected as the deletion mutants retain their transmembrane domains. In the case of the βΔ-SG, the large region removed from this protein includes the potential consensus site for N-linked glycosylation. In fact, this protein is not glycosylated nor does it interfere with glycosylation of the other normal sarcoglycans as shown in Fig. 4 A(lanes 4 and 5). We next performed biochemical experiments to evaluate what effects mutations in individual sarcoglycan proteins might have on the assembly and localization of the complex as a whole. Living cells expressing normal copies of α-, γ-, and δ-SG, as well as the mutant βΔ-SG, were treated with the membrane-impermeant surface label NHS-biotin. Biotinylated surface molecules were recovered using avidin-Sepharose, and the complexes were analyzed by 9E10 immunoblotting. The sarcoglycan complex is readily detected at the surface of cells expressing α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG, as demonstrated earlier (Fig. 4 B, lane 4; Fig. 3 A, lane 11). Dramatically, the sarcoglycan complex is nearly absent from the surface of cells expressing α-, βΔ-, γ-, and δ-SG (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). Lysates from these cells were examined by 9E10 immunoblotting to confirm that similar amounts of each sarcoglycan were in fact synthesized (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). This observation, together with the fractionation data, implies that the normal sarcoglycan proteins (α-, γ-, and δ-SG) are trapped in internal membrane pools because of the presence of the βΔ-SG mutant protein. To assess molecular interactions of sarcoglycans expressed in the presence of a single deletion mutant, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. α-SG immunoprecipitations were performed from cells expressing α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG (Fig.4 B, lane 6), α-, βΔ-, γ-, and δ-SG (Fig. 4 B, lane 7), α-, β-, γΔ-, and δ-SG (Fig. 4 B, lane 8), or α-, β-, γ-, and δΔ-SG (Fig.4 B, lane 9), and the immune complexes were examined by 9E10 immunoblotting. β-, γ-, and δ-SG proteins were co-precipitated with α-SG from cells expressing all four normal copies of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). In contrast, only α-SG is efficiently immunoprecipitated from cells expressing one mutant sarcoglycan and three normal sarcoglycans (Fig. 4 B, lanes 7–9). In each case, similar amounts of all four sarcoglycans were present (Fig.4 A), so changes in protein expression levels because of the co-expression of a mutant construct cannot account for the disruption in sarcoglycan complex assembly. Interestingly, the normal proteins expressed together with βΔ-SG appear fully glycosylated (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that the block in sarcoglycan complex assembly occurs after glycosylation. This result clearly demonstrates that the assembly of a sarcoglycan complex requires four normal copies of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG. Finally, to substantiate our idea that the mutant sarcoglycans block sarcoglycan complex assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane, we looked at the localization of these proteins in cells by immunofluorescence. In cells expressing α-, β-, γ-, and δ-SG, the 9E10 antibody detected the sarcoglycan complex at surface membrane structures (Fig. 4 C, panel a). In addition, there was a considerable amount of signal in various intracellular membrane compartments, which we attribute to the high levels of expression. In contrast, in cells expressing α-, βΔ-, γ-, and δ-SG, the 9E10 antibody did not detect sarcoglycans at the surface, and instead the proteins were concentrated in regions around the nucleus (Fig. 4 C, panel c). Our interpretation of this finding is that sarcoglycans that fail to assemble because of the presence of the βΔ-SG are not competent for trafficking to the plasma membrane. The cells were imaged using differential interference contrast optics to clearly define the cell borders (Fig.4 C, panels b and d). Despite recent advances in our understanding of the genetic defects in individual sarcoglycan genes that underlie autosomal recessive sarcoglycan-deficient LGMD, essentially nothing is known about the molecular defect that results in loss of the entire sarcoglycan complex from the sarcolemma. We have employed a heterologous cell system to study sarcoglycan complex assembly. The strength of this system is that mutations in individual sarcoglycans can be assessed in terms of their impact on sarcoglycan complex assembly. Additionally, this model system may be useful as a tool to discover pharmacological interventions to overcome the blockade in complex assembly and trafficking. Details about the molecular defect in sarcoglycan biosynthesis gained from this work will help direct efforts aimed at developing therapies for LGMD.

https://openalex.org/W1972644575,"In mossy fiber synapses of the hippocampal CA3 region, LTP is induced by cAMP and requires the synaptic vesicle protein rab3A. In contrast, CA1-region synapses do not exhibit this type of LTP. We now show that cAMP enhances glutamate release from CA3 but not CA1 synaptosomes by (1) increasing the readily releasable pool as tested by hypertonic sucrose; (2) potentiating release evoked by KCl depolarization, which opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; and (3) by enhancing Ca2+ action on the secretory apparatus as monitored by the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin. In rab3A-deficient synaptosomes, forskolin still enhances KCl- and sucrose-induced glutamate release but not ionomycin-induced release. Our results show that cAMP has multiple actions in mossy fiber synapses, of which only the direct activation of the secretory apparatus requires rab3A and functions in mfLTP."
https://openalex.org/W1993589817,"Abstract α-Neurexins (Iα, IIα, and IIIα) are receptor-like proteins expressed in hundreds of isoforms on the neuronal cell surface. The extracellular domains of α-neurexins are composed of six LNS repeats, named after homologous sequences in theLaminin A G domain, Neurexins, andSex hormone-binding globulin, with three interspersed epidermal growth factor-like domains. Purification of neurexin Iα revealed that it is tightly complexed to a secreted glycoprotein called neurexophilin 1. Neurexophilin 1 is a member of a family of at least four genes and resembles a neuropeptide, suggesting a function as an endogenous ligand for α-neurexins. We have now used recombinant proteins and knockout mice to investigate which isoforms and domains of different neurexins and neurexophilins interact with each other. We show that neurexophilins 1 and 3 but not 4 (neurexophilin 2 is not expressed in rodents) bind to a single individual LNS domain, the second overall LNS domain in all three α-neurexins. Although this domain is alternatively spliced, all splice variants bind, suggesting that alternative splicing does not regulate binding. Using homologous recombination to disrupt the neurexophilin 1 gene, we generated mutant mice that do not express detectable neurexophilin 1 mRNA. Mice lacking neurexophilin 1 are viable with no obvious morbidity or mortality. However, homozygous mutant mice exhibit male sterility, probably because homologous recombination resulted in the co-insertion into the neurexophilin gene of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, which is known to cause male sterility. In the neurexophilin 1 knockout mice, neurexin Iα is complexed with neurexophilin 3 but not neurexophilin 4, suggesting that neurexophilin 1 is redundant with neurexophilin 3 and that neurexophilins 1 and 3 but not 4 bind to neurexins. This hypothesis was confirmed using expression experiments. Our data reveal that the six LNS and three epidermal growth factor domains of neurexins are independently folding ligand-binding domains that may interact with distinct targets. The results support the notion that neurexophilins represent a family of extracellular signaling molecules that interact with multiple receptors including all three α-neurexins."
https://openalex.org/W1979466745,"The functional roles subserved by Gαz, a G protein α subunit found predominantly in neuronal tissues, have remained largely undefined. Here, we report that Gαz coupled neurotransmitter receptors to N-type Ca2+ channels when transiently overexpressed in rat sympathetic neurons. The Gαz-mediated inhibition was voltage dependent and PTX insensitive. Recovery from Gαz-mediated inhibition was extremely slow but accelerated by coexpression with RGS proteins. Gαz selectively interacted with a subset of receptors that ordinarily couple to N-type Ca2+ channels via PTX-sensitive Go/i proteins. In addition, Gαz rescued the activation of heterologously expressed GIRK channels in PTX-treated neurons. These results suggest that Gαz is capable of coupling receptors to ion channels and might underlie PTX-insensitive ion channel modulation observed in neurons under physiological and pathological conditions."

Transport is Na+-dependent, but the Na+-bile acid stoichiometry and electrogenicity of transport are not known. Studies in whole intestine, isolated cells, and ileal membrane vesicles have been unable to resolve this issue because transport currents are small and can be obscured by other ionic conductances and transport proteins present in these membranes. In this study, the human apical sodium-bile acid transporter was expressed in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack other bile acid transporters. The Na+-dependent transport of a fluorescent bile acid analog, chenodeoxycholyl-Nε-nitrobenzoxadiazol-lysine, was monitored by fluorescence microscopy in single, voltage-clamped cells. Bile acid movement was bidirectional and voltage-dependent with negative intracellular voltage-stimulating influx. A 3-fold reduction in extracellular Na+ produced a negative 52 mV shift of the flux-voltage relationship, consistent with a 2:1 Na+:bile acid coupling stoichiometry. No Na+- or voltage-dependent uptake was observed in nontransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results indicate that the cotransport of bile acids and Na+ by human apical sodium-bile acid transporter is electrogenic and bidirectional and is best explained by a 2:1 Na+:bile acid coupling stoichiometry.

Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids requires efficient bile acid absorption by the ileum.

Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). After uptake, the bile acids are transported transcellularly to the basolateral membrane (2Wilson F.A. Schultz T. Stanley S. Handbook of Physiology: The Gastrointestinal System IV. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1991: 389-404Google Scholar) and secreted into the portal circulation by a sodium-independent anion exchange mechanism (3Weinberg S.L. Burckhardt G. Wilson F.A. J. Clin.

Analysis of mRNA and protein expression revealed that ASBT is also expressed on the apical brush border membrane of renal proximal tubule cells (8Christie D.M. Dawson P.A. Thevananther S. Shneider B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G377-G385PubMed Google Scholar) and apical membranes of cholangiocytes lining the large bile duct units (9Lazaridis K.N. Pham L. Tietz P.

Schultz T. Stanley S. Handbook of Physiology: The Gastrointestinal System IV. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1991: 389-404Google Scholar). Electrogenicity of other transporters, particularly Na+-glucose and Na+-amino acid, has been definitively demonstrated by measuring the currents associated with transport (16Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Jauch P. Petersen O.H. Lauger P. J. Membr.

This has not been possible for the bile acid transporters because next flux is small and the detergent properties of the bile acids may activate ion channels (19Wehner F. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 424: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have therefore taken an alternative approach, directly monitoring the movement of a fluorescent bile acid analog in single, voltage-clamped CHO cells transfected with human ASBT. We have for the first time been able to definitively demonstrate electrogenicity and assess Na+:bile acid stoichiometry for a Na+-bile acid transporter. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in medium A that consisted of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4500 mg/literd-glucose and Ham's F-12 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable overexpression of the hASBT was achieved by cotransfecting the cells with pCMV5-hASBT (6Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and pSV3Neo using the calcium phosphate procedure as described (20Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein G.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Individual colonies were expanded in 24-well plates and screened for hASBT expression using [3H]taurocholate uptake assays. Functional expression of the hASBT protein in these cells has been previously demonstrated (21Craddock A.L. Love M.W. Daniel R.W. Kirby L.C. Walter H.C. Wong M. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G157-G169PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Taurocholic acid (2.0–2.6 Ci/mmol) and [2,4-3H]cholic acid (27.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled taurocholate and cholate were purchased from Sigma. For [3H]bile acid uptake assays, CHO-hASBT cells were incubated in medium B, which consisted of a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 137 mmNaCl or 137 mm choline chloride (6Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The fluorescent bile acid analogs cholylglycylamidofluorescein (CGamF), cholyl-Nε-nitrobenzoxadiazol-lysine (C-NBD-L), and chenodeoxycholyl-Nε-nitrobenzoxadiazol-lysine (CDC-NBD-L) were generous gifts of Drs. A. Hofmann and C. Schteingart. Uptake specificity and time course of uptake were measured in individual cells with a quantitative fluorescence imaging system, as described previously (22Maglova L.M. Jackson A.M. Meng X.-J. Carruth M.W. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.-T. Hofmann A.F. Weinman S.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were superfused at 37 °C with FBA-containing HEPES-buffered Na+-Ringer solution (144 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmNaH2PO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and cell fluorescence was measured at 5–10-s intervals. The total Na+ concentration was approximately 150 mm. Where indicated, Na+ was quantitatively replaced with tetramethylammonium. Simultaneous whole cell patch clamp and fluorescence microscopy were performed with a photometer-based quantitative fluorescence system as described previously (23Grüne S. Meng X.-J. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G339-G346PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-hASBT cells were grown in medium A on 5 × 5-mm glass coverslips and exposed to sodium butyrate (5 mm) for 16 h. Cells were pre-equilibrated with 1 μm CDC-NBD-L in HEPES-buffered Na+-Ringer solution for 30 min. Fluorescent cells were then subjected to whole cell patch clamp in the continued presence of CDC-NBD-L at 37 °C. From an initial holding potential of −30 mV, intracellular (pipette) voltage was changed at 1–2-min intervals to −90, or +30 mV as indicated. Cell fluorescence was measured at 10-s intervals during these voltage steps. The patch pipette was filled with a solution containing 115 mm potassium gluconate, 30 mm KCl, 0.47 mm CaCl2, 2.1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 3 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2. The total Na+ concentration was approximately 12 mm. In some experiments the bath solution Na+concentration was reduced by substitution of NaCl with tetramethylammonium chloride. Stoichiometry was determined by comparing the effects of Na+ gradients and voltage on transport. For a cotransport process with n mol of Na+ transported for each mol of univalent negatively charged bile acid, the free energy change associated with transport (ΔG) depends on the Na+ gradient, the bile acid gradient, and the voltage according to the following relationship. ΔG=nRT ln(Nai/Nao)+RT ln(Bi/Bo)+nFV−FVEquation 1 where n is the number of moles of Na+transported per mol of bile acid, R is the gas constant,T is the absolute temperature, Nai and Naoare the Na+ concentrations inside and outside the cell, Bi and Bo are the bile acid concentrations inside and outside the cell, F is the Faraday constant, andV is the transmembrane voltage. The reversal potential,V rev, is that voltage at which ΔGis zero and is simply as follows. Vrev=RT/F(1−n)·(nln(Nai/Nao)+ln(Bi/Bo))Equation 2 If Nao is suddenly reduced by a factor of xand assuming that all other parameters initially remain constant, we would predict a change in V rev according to Equation 3. ΔVrev=RT/F(1−n)·(nln(x))Equation 3 The expression plasmid pCMV5-hASBT was stably transfected into CHO cells, and clonal cell lines were selected. As seen in Fig.1 A, the uptake of taurocholate and cholate were saturable and Na+-dependent. There was little appreciable bile acid uptake in the absence of Na+ or in the parental CHO cells (data not shown). At 137 mm Na+, analysis of the concentration dependence of bile acid transport revealed apparentK m values of 12 and 37 μm for taurocholate and cholate, respectively. Fig. 1 B shows that these data fit the Hill equation well with Hill coefficients near 1.0 for both taurocholate and cholate, suggesting that bile acid binding sites are either single or noninteracting in the transporter complex. Previous studies of the FBA, CGamF, C-NBD-L, and CDC-NBD-L have shown that uptake is specific for bile acid transporting cells such as hepatocytes and displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics (22Maglova L.M. Jackson A.M. Meng X.-J. Carruth M.W. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.-T. Hofmann A.F. Weinman S.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these FBA are also substrates for the hASBT, we measured accumulation of these analogs after a 5-min incubation in either parental CHO-K1 or transfected CHO-hASBT cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, CHO-hASBT cells efficiently transported both NBD-labeled bile acids, C-NBD-L and CDC-NBD-L, but failed to take up the fluorescein-labeled bile acid, CGamF. There was no appreciable uptake of any FBA in the parental CHO-K1 cells, and uptake was entirely Na+-dependent (data not shown). Initial uptake rates of CDC-NBD-L were saturable with a K m of 13.1 μm (Fig. 2 B) and a Hill coefficient of 1.07 (Fig. 2 C). These kinetic constants were close to those observed for taurocholate. CHO-hASBT cells were pre-equilibrated for 30 min with 1 μm CDC-NBD-L and subjected to whole cell patch clamp in the continued presence of the FBA. The cells were clamped at three different voltages, cell fluorescence was measured at 10-s intervals, and the rate of change of fluorescence with time was compared at the different clamp voltages. Fig. 3 A demonstrates an example of cell fluorescence changes in one cell during this protocol. At −30 mV, fluorescence was relatively constant, but at −90 mV the cell fluorescence increased over time and at +30 mV fluorescence decreased. Control experiments were performed to exclude the possibility that fluorescence changes were due to other voltage-dependent phenomena such as increasing cell volume or fluorophore leak. No voltage-dependent fluorescence changes were observed with either a nontransported fluorescent dye, carboxyfluorescein, or with CDC-NBD-L when the bath temperature was cooled to 10 °C to inhibit activity of the membrane transporter (data not shown). These results demonstrate that voltage-induced fluorescence changes result from either inward or outward transport of CDC-NBD-L. Fig. 3 B shows the results from 10 cells clamped under this protocol. CDC-NBD-L movement was bidirectional and voltage-dependent. Increasing inside negative voltage stimulated uptake and inside positive voltage resulted in net efflux. The direction of change was not affected by the order in which the voltage clamps were performed. To assess stoichiometry of voltage-dependent Na+-bile acid cotransport, we examined the relationship between the electrical and chemical driving forces for transport. Voltage dependence was first determined in control bath solution and then again while maintaining the patch clamp configuration in the same cells after reduction of bath Na+ concentration. The shift in the voltage dependence produced by this maneuver results from the additional inward electrical driving force necessary to balance the reduction in the inwardly directed Na+ gradient. Fig.4 demonstrates this relationship. The voltage at which cell fluorescence remained constant shifted by −52 mV after a 3-fold Na+ dilution and by −62 mV after a 10-fold dilution. This study has shown that transport of fluorescent bile acid derivatives by CHO cells stably transfected with hASBT is electrogenic. Previous studies of electrogenicity of ileal bile acid transport reached conflicting conclusions. Authors using similar vesicle techniques reported that Na+-bile acid cotransport was either electrogenic (11Lücke H. Gertraud S. Kinne R. Murer H. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Wilson F.A. Treanor L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or electroneutral (13Rouse D.J. Lack L. Life Sci. 1979; 25: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Barnard J.A. Ghishan F.K. Wilson F.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Barnard J.A. Ghishan F.K. Gastroenterology. 1987; 93: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A major limitation of these prior studies was the need to use an indirect approach to change membrane potential of vesicles. In most cases addition of valinomycin was assumed to hyperpolarize the vesicle interior, but these studies did not validate that the expected voltage changes actually occurred. In this study we used several approaches to circumvent these problems. We performed whole cell patch clamp to directly voltage clamp and measure the cell membrane potential and used a fluorescent bile acid derivative rather than naturally occurring bile acids. This allowed us to measure transport rates without having to directly measure transport currents. Unlike the case with more hydrophilic substrates such as glucose and amino acids (16Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Jauch P. Petersen O.H. Lauger P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Bergman J. Zaafani M. Bergman C. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), bile acid transport currents are extremely difficult to measure because the electrical currents resulting from bile acid transport are small. For the CHO-hASBT cells, the average V max was about 2 nmol/min/mg protein, which predicts transport currents of only 1.5 pA/cell. This compares with greater than 100 nA/cell for the Na+-glucose cotransporter in oocytes (16Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A second difficulty is that external bile acids have been shown to affect other conductive pathways (19Wehner F. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 424: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and bile acid-induced currents therefore do not necessarily represent current carried by the cotransport proteins. The hASBT-transfected CHO cells efficiently transported two NBD-labeled bile acids, C-NBD-L and CDC-NBD-L, but not a fluorescein-labeled bile acid, CGamF. Kinetic parameters for CDC-NBD-L transport were similar to that of taurocholate and uptake followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Earlier studies of hepatocytes (22Maglova L.M. Jackson A.M. Meng X.-J. Carruth M.W. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.-T. Hofmann A.F. Weinman S.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar) and Ntcp-transfected COS cells (24Boyer J.L. Ng O.-C. Ananthanarayanan M. Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1994; 266: G382-G387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had shown specific transport of both CDC-NBD-L and CGamF, and these differences reflect the more restricted substrate specificity of ASBT compared with that of the homologous Ntcp (21Craddock A.L. Love M.W. Daniel R.W. Kirby L.C. Walter H.C. Wong M. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G157-G169PubMed Google Scholar). These findings complement a recent report describing the in vivo transport properties of the fluorescent bile acid analogs (25Holzinger F. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H. Eming S.A. Monte M.J. Hagey L.R. Hofmann A.F. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1263-1271PubMed Google Scholar). In that study as well, C-NBD-L but not CGamF was transported by ileum. Our results clearly demonstrate that transport via the human ASBT is electrogenic and carries positive charge into the cell. The basic principal underlying these measurements is that once a steady-state concentration in a patched cell is reached, changes in cell fluorescence induced by voltage clamping the cell/pipette system result from flux of substrate between the cell and the bath. For this to be the case, there must be no voltage-dependent changes in cell fluorescence such as could result from voltage-dependent changes of the dye quantum yield or cell volume. We examined these possibilities under conditions in which transmembrane transport was abolished either with a nontransported dye or by low temperature. In both of these cases voltage changes had no effect on cell fluorescence. Another consideration is the possibility that appreciable amounts of dye diffuse from the cell to the pipette, confounding our analysis. Our previous studies have determined that diffusion of bile acids from cell to pipette is small and alters apparent uptake rates by only about 5% (23Grüne S. Meng X.-J. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G339-G346PubMed Google Scholar). The small magnitude of the effect is due to the high degree of intracellular binding of this hydrophobic substrate as well as the relatively small surface area of the pipette (26Weinman S.A. Maglova L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G922-G931PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular diffusion coefficients of bile acids are approximately 1000-fold lower than that predicted for simple aqueous diffusion (27LeSage G.D. Phinizy J.L. Robertson W.E. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104 (abstr.): 937Google Scholar). Although diffusion into the pipette is small, it can still affect the voltage at which cell fluorescence is constant. However, there is no voltage gradient between cell and pipette, and therefore changes in cell fluorescence that occur immediately after voltage shift reflect changes in transmembrane transport and not changes in cell to pipette diffusion. The stoichiometry of Na+-bile acid cotransport was assessed by comparing the effects of voltage changes and Na+gradient changes on the zero net flux voltage (V rev). Provided that only transmembrane flux is changed by voltage clamp, the immediate change inV rev after sudden reduction of extracellular Na+ is described by Equation 3. It predicts that for any given Na+ gradient change, the magnitude of ΔV rev is greatest for n = 2 and decreases as n increases. This can be understood because at higher coupling stoichiometry the transported complex has a greater charge and thus requires less of a voltage change to balance the chemical free energy component of the altered Na+gradient. The observed ΔV rev for a 3-fold reduction in bath Na+ was −52 mV. The theoretical value predicted from Equation 3 is −58.7 mV for n = 2 and −44 mV forn = 3. These theoretical values are expected to be upper limits for the observed change because the internal bile acid concentrations (Bi) may have decreased as a result of outward transport resulting from the reduction of bath Na+concentration. A slight reduction of Bi during the period of low Na+ exposure increases the inward bile acid gradient and thus reduces the magnitude of the negative voltage required to re-establish the zero flux condition. Such non-ideal effects would tend to decrease the observed ΔV rev. Because the observed value is greater than the upper limit for an n= 3 coupling and only slightly less than that for n = 2, we conclude that the most likely coupling ratio is 2 Na+per 1 bile acid, but we cannot definitively exclude a 3:1 ratio. This finding is consistent with kinetic measurements of the Hill coefficient for Na+ in these cells of approximately 2 (21Craddock A.L. Love M.W. Daniel R.W. Kirby L.C. Walter H.C. Wong M. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G157-G169PubMed Google Scholar) and the Hill coefficient for bile acid of approximately 1 (Figs. 1 and 2). The apical Na+-bile acid cotransporter cDNA encodes a polytopic membrane glycoprotein that shares considerable amino acid identity and remarkable structural similarity to Ntcp, the major Na+-dependent liver bile acid transporter (28Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence has now accumulated suggesting that Ntcp is also electrogenic including direct measurements of bile acid transport currents (29Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Weisiger R.A. Scharschmidt B.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G478-G485PubMed Google Scholar, 30Weinman S.A. Weeks R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G73-G80PubMed Google Scholar) as well as voltage dependence of fluorescent bile acid transport in hepatocytes (23Grüne S. Meng X.-J. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G339-G346PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the Ntcp transporter also shows a Hill coefficient of 1.9 for Na+and 1.0 for bile acid (28Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Considering the similarities in sequence and predicted structure for the Na+-bile acid transporters, it is likely that they share a common electrogenic mechanism. Previous ileal bile acid transporter modeling studies relied upon substrate binding properties and assumed an electroneutral transport mechanism. Based in part on this assumption, a model for the substrate binding site was proposed that encompassed a closely positioned negatively charged group for interaction with a single sodium ion (31Lack L. Environ. Health Perspect. 1979; 33: 79-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32Kramer W. Nicol S.B. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Fasold H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The previous model will have to be re-evaluated in light of the present study demonstrating electrogenicity. Electrogenicity confers two significant advantages for ileal bile acid transport. First, as described by Kimmich (33Kimmich G.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 114: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the driving force for uptake sets the upper limit for the concentrating ability of the system, but in practice gradients achieved are significantly lower due to leak pathways. In the case of intestinal bile acid transport, basolateral exit occurs by a passive transporter. Therefore, electrogenic uptake with a high Na+:bile acid coupling ratio at the apical membrane results in a much higher intracellular bile acid concentration and thus increases net transcellular transport. Secondly, electrogenicity of uptake provides a means for regulation of transport. Fasting (34Debnam E.S. Thompson C.S. J. Physiol. 1984; 355: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), aldosterone (34Debnam E.S. Thompson C.S. J. Physiol. 1984; 355: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (35Grubb B.R. Bentley P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: G211-G216PubMed Google Scholar) have all been shown to alter intestinal electrical gradients in the direction of hyperpolarization of the brush border membrane. These physiologic changes may provide the ileal intestinal cells with a mechanism to regulate bile acid uptake rates for optimal bile acid recycling and cytoprotection. In summary, this study is the first unequivocal demonstration of an electrogenic mechanism for a cloned Na+-bile acid transport protein. These results will be critical in modeling the structure-function relationship for this important but poorly understood class of Na+-coupled transport proteins. We thank Drs. A. Hofmann and C. Schteingart for kindly providing the fluorescent bile acid analogs and Drs. L. Reuss and S. King for helpful comments.

Mucin-type O-glycans are present in a wide variety of cells and play various roles in different cells. Mucin-type glycoproteins are also present in the plasma membrane, and they are often involved in cell-cell interaction (1Fukuda M. Fukuda M. Molecular Glycobiology.

Recent studies demonstrate that sialyl Lex and sialyl Lea in core 2 branches are highly correlated to tumor invasion and vessel invasion of colon carcinomas (15Shimodaira K. Nakayama J. Nakayama N. Hasebe O. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5201-5206PubMed Google Scholar), probably because tumor cells utilize selectin-carbohydrate interaction for their adhesion.In patients with immunodeficiency such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, AIDS, and leukemia, leukocytes in the peripheral blood express a substantial amount of core 2 branched oligosaccharides, while leukocytes of normal individuals do not express them (16Piller F.

Most recent studies employing transgenic mice demonstrated that such an overexpression of core 2 oligosaccharides weakens the interactions between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells or B lymphocytes, resulting in reduced immune responses such as delayed type hypersensitivity and immunoglobulin isotype switching (20Tsuboi S.

Poly-N-acetyllactosamine is a unique carbohydrate composed ofN-acetyllactosamine repeats (Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3)n. Poly-N-acetyllactosamines are susceptible to endo-β-galactosidase and larger than typical N-glycans orO-glycans containing only one N-acetyllactosamine in a side chain.

Since the majority of the products contained N-acetylglucosamine at the nonreducing ends, inefficient galactosylation by β4Gal-TI was a likely cause for the lack of poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis in core 2 branched oligosaccharides. These unexpected results prompted us to test if any of the new members of β4Gal-Ts, which have been identified recently (29Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

In this report, we summarize these findings and demonstrate that β4Gal-TIV (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is the enzyme involved in poly-N-acetyllactosamine extension of core 2 branched oligosaccharides. Moreover, we show that β4Gal-TIV is a rate-limiting factor and responsible for short poly-N-acetyllactosamine extension in core 2 branched O-glycans.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that β4Gal-TI, abundantly present in milk, cannot efficiently add a galactose residue to a core 2 branched oligosaccharide, GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAc (Figs. 1 and 2). This unexpected finding led us to discover that a novel member of the β4Gal-T family, β4Gal-TIV, is responsible for galactosylation of core 2 branched oligosaccharides and, together with iGnT, can form poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl core 2 branchedO-glycans (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5).After cloning β4Gal-TI from bovine and human milk (50Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. Meuth J.L. Fox J.L. Chang H. Kirsch I.R. Hollis G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1988; 157: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), β4Gal-TI has been the only β4Gal-T recognized until recently. The presence of additional members of β4Gal-TI was, however, suggested from the knockout of the β4Gal-TI gene in mouse, since the mice deficient in βGal-TI survived during embryonic development (53Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). More recent accumulation in the expressed sequence tag data base, PCR homology cloning, and purification and cloning of lactosylceramide synthase allowed several laboratories to isolate novel members of the β4Gal-T family, β4Gal-TII to β4Gal-TVI (29Almeida R.

There appear to be overlapping but different acceptor specificities in β4Gal-TI, -TII, and -TIII, and all of them are capable of adding a galactose residue to form N-acetyllactosamine in both glycoproteins and glycolipids. Except for β4Gal-TVI, which is mainly responsible for lactosylceramide synthesis from glucosylceramide, however, the roles of the novel β4Gal-Ts have been elusive. For example, β4Gal-TV, which is remotely related to β4Gal-TI, was reported to be inactive toward a glycolipid or glycoprotein acceptor (31Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).To our knowledge, the present study is the first report among novel members of β4Gal-Ts that a particular β4Gal-T, β4Gal-TIV, is exclusively responsible for forming specific structures. β4Gal-TIV is the most recently added member of the β4Gal-T gene family (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that β4Gal-TIV is very efficient in adding galactose to the core 2 branched oligosaccharide but inefficient in adding to N-glycan-related acceptors such as GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ→octyl. This finding is consistent with the previous report that β4Gal-TIV adds very little galactose to asialoagalactotransferrin, which contains only N-glycans (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results are also consistent with the report that β4Gal-TIV acts inefficiently on asialoagalactofetuin, since O-glycans in fetuin lack core 2 branches (54Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5704-5717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown in the previous report that β4Gal-TIV can act with reasonable efficiency on glycolipid acceptors (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We were thus concerned about whether the hydrophobic nature of the aglycon, p-nitrophenol in acceptors used, might affect the enzymatic reactions. We thus used a core 2 branched acceptor without an aglycon and found that β4Gal-TIV acts on this acceptor much better than β4Gal-TI, (Fig. 4,C and D), demonstrating that β4Gal-TIV efficiently acts on core 2 branched oligosaccharide regardless of whether or not a hydrophobic aglycon is attached. These results, taken together, support our conclusion that β4Gal-TIV and iGnT cooperatively form poly-N-acetyllactosamines on core 2 branched oligosaccharides initiated by C2GnT.The present study also demonstrated that poly-N-acetyllactosamines formed in core 2 branched oligosaccharides were shorter than those formed in N-glycan acceptors when both were synthesized under the same conditions (see Fig. 1 A and Fig. 5 B). This finding is consistent with the fact that core 2 branched O-glycans are mostly composed of those containing one or two N-acetyllactosamine units, while poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl N-glycans contain three or more N-acetyllactosamine units (4Fukuda M.

Moreover, the amount of poly-N-acetyllactosaminylated O-glycans is much less than that in N-glycans when N-glycans andO-glycans were analyzed in the same lamp molecules (55Maemura K. Fukuda M. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1994; 5: 2093Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) or the same CHO cells (46Merkle R.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

The present study also demonstrated that β4Gal-TIV, but not β4Gal-TI, drastically reduces its efficiency as acceptors become longer (Fig. 6, Table I). β4Gal-TIV was also shown to act less efficiently on longer lacto-series glycolipids than shorter ones (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results, combined together, indicate that β4Gal-TIV acts less efficiently on those containingN-acetyllactosamine repeats, synthesizing shorter poly-N-acetyllactosamines in core 2 branched oligosaccharides than poly-N-acetyllactosamines inN-glycans synthesized by β4Gal-TI.The formation of core 2 branched oligosaccharides has been found to be critical in many biological processes, as described in the Introduction. Further studies for understanding the biosynthesis of core 2 branches and its N-acetyllactosamine extension are expected to provide important insights into the physiological roles of core 2 branched oligosaccharides. Mucin-type O-glycans are present in a wide variety of cells and play various roles in different cells. Mucin-type glycoproteins are also present in the plasma membrane, and they are often involved in cell-cell interaction (1Fukuda M. Fukuda M. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1984: 1-52Google Scholar). For example,O-glycans present in eggs were shown to be a receptor for both mouse and sea urchin (2Florman H.M. Wassarman P.M.

A. 1997; 94: 3650-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In granulocytes, monocytes, and certain T lymphocytes, mucin-type O-glycans can carry sialyl Lex, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc→R, at their termini (4Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J.

Importantly, these selectins, in particular P- and L-selectin, preferentially bind to sialyl Lex in a limited number of mucin-type glycoproteins such as PSGL-1 (for P-selectin) and GlyCAM-1 and CD34 (for L-selectin) (12Sako D.

As shown previously, sialyl Lex and its derivatives of O-glycans in blood cells can be only formed on core 2 branches, Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcα→R (4Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12796-12806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24379-24386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that sialyl Lex and sialyl Lea in core 2 branches are highly correlated to tumor invasion and vessel invasion of colon carcinomas (15Shimodaira K. Nakayama J. Nakayama N. Hasebe O. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5201-5206PubMed Google Scholar), probably because tumor cells utilize selectin-carbohydrate interaction for their adhesion. In patients with immunodeficiency such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, AIDS, and leukemia, leukocytes in the peripheral blood express a substantial amount of core 2 branched oligosaccharides, while leukocytes of normal individuals do not express them (16Piller F. Le Deist F. Weinberg K. Parkman R. Fukuda M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Higgins E.A. Siminovitch K.A. Zhuang D. Brockhausen I. Dennis J.W. J.

Most recent studies employing transgenic mice demonstrated that such an overexpression of core 2 oligosaccharides weakens the interactions between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells or B lymphocytes, resulting in reduced immune responses such as delayed type hypersensitivity and immunoglobulin isotype switching (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30680-30687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that AIDS patients produce antibodies against leukosialin expressing core 2 branched oligosaccharides, possibly causing T lymphocyte depletion in those patients (22Ardman B. Sikorski M.A. Settles M. Staunton D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Lefebvre J.-C. Giordanengo V. Limouse M. Doglio A. Cucchiarini M. Monpoux F. Mariani R. Peyron J.-F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of a mucin-type glycoprotein carrying those oligosaccharides was shown to interfere with cell adhesion (24Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), while knockout of the leukosialin gene in mice resulted in hyperimmune responses (25Manjunath N. Correa M. Ardman M. Ardman B. Nature. 1995; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that poly-N-acetyllactosamine can be extended from core 2 branches, forming poly-N-acetyllactosaminylO-glycans (4Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol.

Poly-N-acetyllactosamine is a unique carbohydrate composed ofN-acetyllactosamine repeats (Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3)n. Poly-N-acetyllactosamines are susceptible to endo-β-galactosidase and larger than typical N-glycans orO-glycans containing only one N-acetyllactosamine in a side chain. Poly-N-acetyllactosamines provide the backbone structure for additional modifications, which are often cell type-specific oligosaccharides, such as sialyl Lex (1Fukuda M. Fukuda M. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1984: 1-52Google Scholar). These results, as a whole, indicate that core 2 branched oligosaccharides play critical roles in cell-cell interaction. These results indicate that it is crucial to understand the synthesis of core 2 branched oligosaccharide and its further extension to poly-N-acetyllactosamines. To this end, we have cloned the cDNAs encoding core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT) 1The abbreviations used are: C2GnT, core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; β4Gal-T, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase; Lex, Lewisx; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; pNP, p-nitrophenol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; iGnT, β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; iGnTc, a catalytic domain of iGnT. 1The abbreviations used are: C2GnT, core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; β4Gal-T, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase; Lex, Lewisx; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; pNP, p-nitrophenol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; iGnT, β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; iGnTc, a catalytic domain of iGnT.that forms a core 2 branch (27Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When we tried to synthesize poly-N-acetyllactosamine on core 2 branched oligosaccharides, iGnT and milk β4Gal-T (β4Gal-TI) failed to form poly-N-acetyllactosamines. Since the majority of the products contained N-acetylglucosamine at the nonreducing ends, inefficient galactosylation by β4Gal-TI was a likely cause for the lack of poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis in core 2 branched oligosaccharides. These unexpected results prompted us to test if any of the new members of β4Gal-Ts, which have been identified recently (29Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

This unexpected finding led us to discover that a novel member of the β4Gal-T family, β4Gal-TIV, is responsible for galactosylation of core 2 branched oligosaccharides and, together with iGnT, can form poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl core 2 branchedO-glycans (Figs.

There appear to be overlapping but different acceptor specificities in β4Gal-TI, -TII, and -TIII, and all of them are capable of adding a galactose residue to form N-acetyllactosamine in both glycoproteins and glycolipids. Except for β4Gal-TVI, which is mainly responsible for lactosylceramide synthesis from glucosylceramide, however, the roles of the novel β4Gal-Ts have been elusive. For example, β4Gal-TV, which is remotely related to β4Gal-TI, was reported to be inactive toward a glycolipid or glycoprotein acceptor (31Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).To our knowledge, the present study is the first report among novel members of β4Gal-Ts that a particular β4Gal-T, β4Gal-TIV, is exclusively responsible for forming specific structures. β4Gal-TIV is the most recently added member of the β4Gal-T gene family (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that β4Gal-TIV is very efficient in adding galactose to the core 2 branched oligosaccharide but inefficient in adding to N-glycan-related acceptors such as GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ→octyl. This finding is consistent with the previous report that β4Gal-TIV adds very little galactose to asialoagalactotransferrin, which contains only N-glycans (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results are also consistent with the report that β4Gal-TIV acts inefficiently on asialoagalactofetuin, since O-glycans in fetuin lack core 2 branches (54Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5704-5717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown in the previous report that β4Gal-TIV can act with reasonable efficiency on glycolipid acceptors (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We were thus concerned about whether the hydrophobic nature of the aglycon, p-nitrophenol in acceptors used, might affect the enzymatic reactions. We thus used a core 2 branched acceptor without an aglycon and found that β4Gal-TIV acts on this acceptor much better than β4Gal-TI, (Fig. 4,C and D), demonstrating that β4Gal-TIV efficiently acts on core 2 branched oligosaccharide regardless of whether or not a hydrophobic aglycon is attached. These results, taken together, support our conclusion that β4Gal-TIV and iGnT cooperatively form poly-N-acetyllactosamines on core 2 branched oligosaccharides initiated by C2GnT.The present study also demonstrated that poly-N-acetyllactosamines formed in core 2 branched oligosaccharides were shorter than those formed in N-glycan acceptors when both were synthesized under the same conditions (see Fig. 1 A and Fig. 5 B). This finding is consistent with the fact that core 2 branched O-glycans are mostly composed of those containing one or two N-acetyllactosamine units, while poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl N-glycans contain three or more N-acetyllactosamine units (4Fukuda M.

Moreover, the amount of poly-N-acetyllactosaminylated O-glycans is much less than that in N-glycans when N-glycans andO-glycans were analyzed in the same lamp molecules (55Maemura K. Fukuda M.

The present study also demonstrated that β4Gal-TIV, but not β4Gal-TI, drastically reduces its efficiency as acceptors become longer (Fig. 6, Table I). β4Gal-TIV was also shown to act less efficiently on longer lacto-series glycolipids than shorter ones (33Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S. Holmes E. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results, combined together, indicate that β4Gal-TIV acts less efficiently on those containingN-acetyllactosamine repeats, synthesizing shorter poly-N-acetyllactosamines in core 2 branched oligosaccharides than poly-N-acetyllactosamines inN-glycans synthesized by β4Gal-TI.The formation of core 2 branched oligosaccharides has been found to be critical in many biological processes, as described in the Introduction. Further studies for understanding the biosynthesis of core 2 branches and its N-acetyllactosamine extension are expected to provide important insights into the physiological roles of core 2 branched oligosaccharides. In the present study, we found that β4Gal-TI, abundantly present in milk, cannot efficiently add a galactose residue to a core 2 branched oligosaccharide, GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAc (Figs. 1 and 2). This unexpected finding led us to discover that a novel member of the β4Gal-T family, β4Gal-TIV, is responsible for galactosylation of core 2 branched oligosaccharides and, together with iGnT, can form poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl core 2 branchedO-glycans (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). After cloning β4Gal-TI from bovine and human milk (50Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. Meuth J.L. Fox J.L. Chang H. Kirsch I.R. Hollis G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of additional members of β4Gal-TI was, however, suggested from the knockout of the β4Gal-TI gene in mouse, since the mice deficient in βGal-TI survived during embryonic development (53Asano M.

It has been assumed that an analogous mechanism is responsible for the activation of membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP). Using recombinant wild-type MT1-MMP cDNA and mutant cDNAs transfected into COS-1 cells lacking endogenous MT1-MMP, we have examined the function of the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP was characterized by immunoblotting, surface biotinylation, gelatin substrate zymography, and125I-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2) binding. In contrast to wild-type MT1-MMP-transfected COS-1 cells, transfected COS-1 cells containing a deletion of the N-terminal propeptide domain of MT1-MMP or a chimeric construction (substitution of the pro-domain of MT1-MMP with that of collagenase 3) were functionally inactive in terms of binding of 125I-labeled TIMP-2 to the cell surface and initiating the activation of pro-gelatinase A.

During the process of activation of secreted latent MMPs in the pericellular and extracellular environment, conformational perturbation or limited proteolysis within the N-terminal propeptide domain causes a change in the molecule that disrupts the unpaired Cys-Zn2+ interaction and frees the Zn2+ to participate in proteolytic cleavage. The modified MMP then attacks the peptide sequence downstream of the PRCGVPD sequence in an autolytic manner and cleaves the propeptide, thus producing a lower molecular weight activated enzyme (popularly described as a cysteine switch or velcro mechanism (4Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar)). Activation of MMPs is inhibited by a family of proteins collectively known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) represent a newly described group of matrixins (5Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar) that are widely but selectively distributed in tissues. As the name implies, MT-MMPs are localized to the plasma membranes of cells by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (transmembrane domain; Ref. 6Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) followed by a short cytoplasmic sequence. MT-MMPs have been the subject of great interest because of their role in activating a secreted MMP, pro-gelatinase A, at the cell surface (5Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Expression of MT1-MMP in embryonic tissue (7Kinoh H. Sato H. Tsunezuka Y. Takino T. Kawashima A. Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar) and in malignant tumors has been correlated with the degree of activated gelatinase A in these tissues.The mechanism of pericellular activation of pro-gelatinase A appears to involve the formation of a unique bimolecular complex between TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP (5Sato H.

The C-terminal domain of pro-gelatinase A then binds to the available C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (stabilization site), forming a trimolecular complex (9Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannicov G.

According to this theory, a second MT1-MMP molecule (not complexed to TIMP-2) then attacks a single bond in complexed pro-gelatinase A, which is followed by an autolytic cleavage (11Atkinson S.J.

Excess TIMP-2 interferes with this activation mechanism by binding and inhibiting all available MT1-MMP molecules.A special feature of MT-MMPs, as well as stromelysin-3 (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), is a 10-residue insert immediately preceding the final processing site between the propeptide and catalytic domain, which harbors a paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme recognition motif (RXKR) (5Sato H.

Whereas the peptide sequence 2The numbering of amino acids of all proteins includes signal peptide sequence. 2The numbering of amino acids of all proteins includes signal peptide sequence. of the N-terminal domain of MT-MMPs shares more than 70% homology with naturally secreted matrixins between amino acids Met68 and Asp97, the peptide sequence (Ser34-Ala67) following the signal peptide of MT-MMPs shares <10% homology with secreted matrixins. Considerable sequence homology (>60%) between Ser34-Ala67of MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, and chicken MT-MMP (5Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M.

To examine this possibility, we have transfected COS-1 cells with human MT1-MMP cDNAs containing mutations within the propeptide domain. Whereas non-membrane-bound matrixins with critical mutations in the conserved PRCGVPD sequence of the N-terminal propeptide have been reported to be secreted as activated enzymes (stromelysin-1, collagenase, and matrilysin) (17Park A.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15831-15838Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that transfected COS-1 cells expressing a deletion or substitution of the N-terminal propeptide domain of MT1-MMP are functionally inactive in terms of activating pro-gelatinase A and binding TIMP 2. Thus, contrary to observations with secreted matrixins, retention of the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP on the cell surface is required to maintain certain biological functions of the enzyme. Other studies have likewise identified only the 63-kDa latent form of MT1-MMP in cells demonstrating MT1-MMP-induced pro-gelatinase A activation (21Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe structure and function of secreted matrixins have been the subject of intense scrutiny for the past decade. The unique feature of MT-MMPs is their insertion into the plasma membrane of cells by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids followed by a cytoplasmic sequence at the C-terminal tail of the molecule. Based on considerable homology with other members of the matrixin family, it has generally been assumed that other aspects of MT-MMP function, such as cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide domain during activation of the proenzyme, are analogous to secreted MMPs (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Because purified MT-MMPs cannot readily be evaluated in their membrane-bound state, supportive data for the pro-domain cleavage hypothesis has been derived from experiments using secreted mutant forms of MT1-MMP lacking the transmembrane domain (29Imai K. Ohuchi E. Aoki T. Nomura H. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2707-2710PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M.

Adkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar).In the current study examining native membrane-bound MT1-MMP, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal pro-domain of MT1-MMP expressed in transfected COS-1 cells is required for function of the intact membrane-bound enzyme (function defined as the activation of pro-gelatinase A and binding of TIMP-2). The presence of an intact N-terminal propeptide in MT1-MMP was documented using a specific antibody to the pro-domain. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that conformational effects induced by the plasma membrane provide functional activity to membrane-bound MT1-MMP without cleavage of the molecule (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In contrast, using detergent extracts of crude plasma membranes, we have confirmed that the pro-domain of MT1-MMP is not required for function of the soluble form of MT1-MMP.By transfection of mutant MT1-MMP cDNAs into COS-1 cells, we have demonstrated that deletion of the entire N-terminal propeptide sequence of MT1-MMP resulted in loss of both 125I-TIMP-2 binding activity and pro-gelatinase A activation function. Loss of function of this mutein was not attributable to a detectable defect in protein synthesis or insertion into the plasma membrane, as studied by cell surface biotinylation (Fig. 5). As anticipated, MTΔpro reacted with an antibody generated against a peptide sequence contained within the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP but did not react with an antibody against a pro-domain sequence of MT1-MMP. Based on the observation that cell membranes isolated from mutant MT1-MMP (MTΔpro)-transfected COS-1 cells exhibited gelatinolytic activity almost equivalent to that of wild-type MT1-MMP-transfected cells, it would appear that the mutant protein is properly folded and functional in the cell membrane. The fact that a chimeric mutant containing the N-terminal domain of collagenase 3 and the remainder of intact MT1-MMP (Col-3/MT) inserted into the plasma membrane was unable to bind TIMP-2 and activate pro-gelatinase A in intact COS-1 cells further emphasizes that the propeptide of MT1-MMP plays an essential role in the function of the molecule, presumably related to facilitating binding of TIMP-2. Our observation that TIMP-2 inhibited the gelatin-degrading activity of plasma membranes (nonsolubilized) isolated from wtMT1-MMP, but not membranes isolated from MTΔpro-transfected COS-1 cells, is consistent with TIMP-2 interacting with the propeptide domain of membrane-bound MT1-MMP. A deletion mutant of MT1-MMP lacking the region from Ser34 to Arg51 (MTΔ34–51) likewise lacked pro-gelatinase A activation function in transfected COS-1 cells. These data are consistent with the concept that the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence following the signal peptide of MT1-MMP (E36WLQ·YGYLPP47) is required for proper conformation and function of the enzyme in the plasma membrane. The high degree of homology in this propeptide sequence among MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, and chicken MT-MMP (>80% identify) and minimal identity with other MMPs is of special interest, because this sequence is unique only for membrane-bound MMPs. Of relevance to potential function of the pro-domain of other MMPs, the N-terminal propeptide of pro-gelatinase A has been reported to contribute to the binding of TIMP-2 (33Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Likewise, a conserved stretch of amino acids located in the comparable region of prostromelysin-1 and procollagenase-1 (L16VQKYLE22) appears to play a central role in maintaining the latency mechanism of secreted MMPs. The Tyr-Leu sequence of this region is conserved among most secreted matrixins but differs in MT-MMPs (W38L49) (34Freimark B.D. Feeser W.S. Rosenfeld S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26982-26987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our attempts to further explore the pro-domain of MT1-MMP by expressing other mutations in COS-1 cells have been frustrated by the observation that some of the mutant proteins are not identified in COS-1 cells as intact proteins at the anticipated molecular weight probably because of aberrant cleavages, autolysis, or fragmentation attributable to incorrect protein folding (i.e. single-amino acid deletion of Ser34 resulted in synthesis of a 40-kDa protein as demonstrated by immunoblotting, and deletion of G43YLPP47 resulted in total lack of expression of the protein; data not shown). Defective protein expression in cells transfected with mutations of the propeptide domain have been described previously with other MMPs (19Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.-C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Freimark B.D. Feeser W.S. Rosenfeld S.A. J. Biol.

Orgel D. Ulbrich N. Will H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) lacking the transmembrane domain have indicated that cleavage of the N-terminal domain of MT-MMPs (presumably by furin) is required for activation of pro-gelatinase A and binding to TIMP-2. Secreted MT1-MMP is capable of degrading interstitial collagens and extracellular matrix molecules. To resolve differences between these studies and our findings with intact cells, we performed a binding experiment using125I-labeled TIMP-2 and detergent-extracted proteins from transfected COS-1 cells. Using extracted membrane proteins rather than intact cells, 125I-labeled TIMP-2 bound to N-terminal propeptide-deleted MT1-MMP (MTΔpro) as well as wtMT1-MMP, but not to Col-3/MT or vector-transfected proteins. Likewise, solubilized MTΔpro, but not membrane-bound MTΔpro, was capable of activating pro-gelatinase A. These data indicate that soluble forms of MT1-MMP react differently than membrane-bound enzymes; Butler et al. (12Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clemens J. d'Ortho M.-P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) reached the same conclusion in kinetic studies of soluble and membrane-bound MT1-MMP. Stoichiometric concentrations of TIMP-2 (followed by formation of a triplex among plasma membrane MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and pro-gelatinase A) do not appear to be required for activation of pro-gelatinase A by (soluble) membrane domain-deleted MT1-MMP (12Butler G.S.

As with naturally secreted MMPs, TIMP-2 function is limited to binding and inhibition of soluble pro domain-deleted MT1-MMP (12Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S.

Co-transfection of COS-1 cells with both MTΔpro cDNA and MT1–109 cDNA resulted in reconstitution of MT1-MMP function; co-transfected cells activated recombinant pro-gelatinase A. Co-transfection of COS-1 cells with Col-3/MT cDNA and MT1–109 cDNA or MTΔpro cDNA and interstitial collagenase1–99 cDNA (containing signal and propeptide domains) did not reconstitute pro-gelatinase A activation function. 3J. Cao and S. Zucker, manuscript in preparation. These experiments suggest that the isolated pro-domain of MT1-MMP is capable of binding to MTΔpro in the plasma membrane and thereby reconstituting the function of MT1-MMP.The issue of whether cells contain non-TIMP-2-related receptors for gelatinase A is disputed (9Strongin A.Y.

Other investigators have been unable to reproduce this observation (12Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clemens J. d'Ortho M.-P. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; MTΔpro, propeptide-deleted MT1-MMP; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Col-3/MT, collagenase 3 and MT1-MMP; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wtMT1-MMP, wild-type MT1-MMP. 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; MTΔpro, propeptide-deleted MT1-MMP; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Col-3/MT, collagenase 3 and MT1-MMP; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wtMT1-MMP, wild-type MT1-MMP.matrixins) are a large family of neutral zinc endopeptidases, which display homologous structural features consisting of a N-terminal propeptide domain, a zinc-coordinated catalytic domain, and a C-terminal hemopexin- and vitronectin-like domain (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

During the process of activation of secreted latent MMPs in the pericellular and extracellular environment, conformational perturbation or limited proteolysis within the N-terminal propeptide domain causes a change in the molecule that disrupts the unpaired Cys-Zn2+ interaction and frees the Zn2+ to participate in proteolytic cleavage. The modified MMP then attacks the peptide sequence downstream of the PRCGVPD sequence in an autolytic manner and cleaves the propeptide, thus producing a lower molecular weight activated enzyme (popularly described as a cysteine switch or velcro mechanism (4Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar)). Activation of MMPs is inhibited by a family of proteins collectively known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) represent a newly described group of matrixins (5Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar) that are widely but selectively distributed in tissues. As the name implies, MT-MMPs are localized to the plasma membranes of cells by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (transmembrane domain; Ref. 6Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) followed by a short cytoplasmic sequence. MT-MMPs have been the subject of great interest because of their role in activating a secreted MMP, pro-gelatinase A, at the cell surface (5Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Expression of MT1-MMP in embryonic tissue (7Kinoh H. Sato H. Tsunezuka Y. Takino T. Kawashima A. Okada Y. Seiki M. J.

The mechanism of pericellular activation of pro-gelatinase A appears to involve the formation of a unique bimolecular complex between TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP (5Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J.

The C-terminal domain of pro-gelatinase A then binds to the available C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (stabilization site), forming a trimolecular complex (9Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannicov G.

According to this theory, a second MT1-MMP molecule (not complexed to TIMP-2) then attacks a single bond in complexed pro-gelatinase A, which is followed by an autolytic cleavage (11Atkinson S.J.

Using this experimental framework, we show the existence of three distinct activation states for α5β1integrin binding to adsorbed fibronectin for both passive, antibody-induced and active, cell-controlled activation. During the initial phase of adhesion, α5β1 integrin is activated in an energy-dependent process from the nonbinding ground state to an intermediate state in which the receptor binds fibronectin and provides significant mechanical coupling. In later stages of adhesion maturation, α5β1integrin is activated to a higher binding state, which provides significant increases in adhesion strength compared with the intermediate state. These multiple binding states most likely result from different integrin conformations and reflect distinct interactions between α5β1 and sites on adsorbed fibronectin. Multiple activation states for α5β1 suggest the existence of distinct stages in adhesion signaling and strengthening and can provide a versatile mechanism for the regulation of adhesive interactions.

Affinity modulation appears to be a common property of integrins, and the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 represents the best understood model. αIIbβ3 integrin does not bind to soluble fibrinogen on resting platelets, but it does bind upon activation by platelet agonists (1Hynes R.O.

Integrins can also be activated by external factors such as divalent cations and monoclonal antibodies (13Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14van de Wiel-Kemenade E. van Kooyk Y. de Boer A.J. Huijbens R.J.F. Weber P. van de Kasteele W. Melief C.J.M. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), providing a convenient system for examining the biochemical differences between the active and inactive receptor. For β1 integrins, antibody-induced activation results in considerable increases in binding affinity to soluble ligand, and these increases in binding affinity presumably lead to increases in cell adhesion (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the functional assays used in those studies cannot directly address whether the increases in adhesion result from variations in receptor-ligand interactions or events subsequent to the binding encounter, such as receptor clustering and secondary interactions with the cytoskeleton (16Lotz M.M. Burdsal C.A. Erickson H.P. McClay D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Using a novel method for measuring receptor-ligand binding under force, we demonstrate that β1 integrin activation results in increased cell adhesion through changes in the receptor-ligand binding strength and that α5β1 integrin exhibits multiple binding states for surface-adsorbed fibronectin (Fn). 1The abbreviations used are: Fn, fibronectin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sulfo-BSOCOES, bis(2-[sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxy]ethyl)sulfone. K562 cells (ATCC no. CCL-243) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. During cell growth, K562 cells were selected for growth in suspension as single cells, which results in the absence of detectable specific adhesion to Fn. K562 variants that do exhibit adhesion in the absence of activating agents can also be isolated. IMR-90 cells (ATCC no. CCL-186) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum + antibiotics. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) TS2/16 and HFN 7.1 (ATCC) and AIIB2 and BIIG2 (kindly provided by C. H. Damsky) were affinity-purified from hybridoma supernatants on protein G-Sepharose columns. mAb AG89 was isolated from mouse ascites as described previously (17Takagi J. Takashi I. Takada Y. Saito Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 111-117Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human plasma Fn and cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Ethidium homodimer was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Glass coverslips were purchased from Bellco (Vineland, NJ). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 0.9 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.4) + 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin + 0.1 mg/ml NaN3. Cells were incubated in primary antibody for 45 min at 4 °C, washed, incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-IgG for 45 min at 4 °C, and analyzed in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cell binding to soluble Fn was performed as described by Faull et al. (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted in 200-μl volumes, consisting of 100 μl of cell suspension (1.3 × 106 cells), 50 μl of125I-Fn, and 50 μl of activating antibody, buffer, or EDTA + NaN3. After incubating for 30 min under gentle agitation, 50-μl aliquots were layered in triplicate onto 300 μl of 200 mg/ml sucrose. Bound Fn was separated from unbound Fn by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min and quantified. For nonspecific binding, cells were incubated in 5 mm EDTA + 0.1 mg/ml NaN3. Cell adhesion was measured using a spinning disk device as described previously (18Garcı́a A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Garcı́a A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Glass coverslips were coated with Fn for 30 min at 22 °C and blocked in 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Adsorbed Fn was quantified using125I-Fn. K562 cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline + 2 mm glucose. IMR-90 cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA + 100 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and resuspended in adhesion buffer + 50 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Cells were seeded onto Fn-coated coverslips for 15 min and spun at a constant speed for 10 min. Adherent cells were fixed in 10% formalin + 1% Triton X-100 and stained with ethidium homodimer. Using a motorized stage and ImagePro analysis software, nuclei per microscope field were counted and normalized to the count at the disk center for which the applied force is zero. The adherent fraction f was fitted to a sigmoidal curve (f = 1/(1 + exp[b(τ − τ50)]), where τ is shear stress, τ50 is shear stress for 50% detachment, and b is inflection slope. For integrin cross-linking experiments, cells were seeded onto Fn-coated coverslips for 10 min, incubated in 1 mmsulfo-BSOCOES (Pierce) for 5 min, and then spun and analyzed as before. For long term assay, IMR-90 cells were plated on 2 μg/ml Fn in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + antibiotics and allowed to spread overnight. Cells were then spun in adhesion buffer containing 50 mg/ml dextran (M r 500,000). For immunostaining after spinning, cells were fixed, blocked in 50 mg/ml horse serum for 1 h, incubated in anti-β1 antibody for 1 h, and incubated in fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h. Monoclonal antibodies TS2/16 and AG89 were examined for passive activation of integrins on K562 and IMR-90 cells. These activating antibodies bind to different structural regions on the β1 subunit; TS2/16 binds near the ligand binding site, whereas the epitope for AG89 is located on the stalk region (17Takagi J. Takashi I. Takada Y. Saito Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 111-117Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry measurements demonstrated no differences in epitope expression or antibody access for these two antibodies for integrins expressed on K562 and IMR-90 cells (Fig.1). There are approximately nine times more β1 integrins on IMR-90 cells than on K562, and experiments with α5-specific antibodies revealed approximately 10–20% more α5β1 on IMR-90 than on K562. In the presence of saturating amounts of these activating antibodies, K562 cells exhibited monovalent binding to soluble Fn (Fig.2). Nonlinear curve fitting revealed no differences in apparent K D (90 nm) or receptor density (1.0 × 105/cell) between TS2/16- and AG89-treated cells. Therefore, both mAbs activate the same number of receptors, and the activated integrins exhibit similar binding kinetics for Fn. Binding of soluble Fn to α5β1integrin in untreated K562 cells was not distinguishable from background (cells treated with EDTA and NaN3). To analyze the integrin-Fn interaction for different integrin activation conditions, the receptor-ligand interaction must be isolated from other elements that influence adhesion. At saturating antibody levels, passive activation should provide uniform activation of the adhesion function in a fashion analogous to the soluble Fn binding function. Human K562 cells provide an ideal model for the functional analysis of the integrin-Fn interaction. These cells express only a single Fn receptor, α5β1 integrin (21Hemler M.E. Huang C. Schwarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3300-3309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, the integrin is expressed in a constitutively inactive form, which was passively activated with either TS2/16 or AG89 mAbs. Furthermore, we have developed experimental conditions for which antibody-activated K562 cells show no differences in adhesion strength between 5 and 15 min or at 15 min in the presence of NaN3, demonstrating no adhesion strengthening in these initial attachment times (19Garcı́a A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This lack of adhesion strengthening allows the isolation of the receptor-ligand interaction from the cytoskeleton and other mechanisms that may contribute to increased adhesion strength as a function of time. Cell adhesion to adsorbed Fn was quantified using a spinning disk device. This apparatus applies a linear range of hydrodynamic forces to a large cell population and provides absolute measurements of cell adhesion strength (18Garcı́a A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that adhesion strength increases linearly with ligand and receptor densities as predicted by a simple receptor-ligand model (19Garcı́a A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), τd=GψNRNL+λEquation 1 where τd is the shear stress for detachment,G is a geometric parameter related to cell shape and contact area, N R and N L are the receptor and ligand densities, respectively, and λ is the nonspecific adhesion. This analysis provides for the definition of a novel experimental parameter, the adhesion constant ψ, which is related to bond strength and receptor-ligand affinity and is governed by the integrin activation state. The fraction of adherent cells (f) plotted against shear stress (τ) fits a sigmoidal curve in which the shear stress for 50% detachment (τ50) represents the mean cell adhesion strength. For a saturated surface coating of 160 ng/cm2 Fn, K562 cells exhibited three different levels of adhesion, TS2/16 activation > AG89 activation > inactive control, as indicated by shifts in the detachment profile (Fig.3). Addition of either BIIG2 monoclonal antibody, which blocks α5 integrin (22Hall D.E. Reichardt L.F. Crowley E. Holley B. Moezzi H. Sonnenberg A. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2175-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), or HFN7.1 monoclonal antibody, which blocks the RGD cell binding site on Fn (23Schoen R.C. Bentley K.L. Klebe R.J. Hybridoma. 1982; 1: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), reduced the binding strength for either AG89- or TS2/16-activated cells to the untreated values (data not shown), demonstrating that the measured adhesion is a result of the α5β1integrin-Fn interaction. The mechanism of detachment was examined using the cell-impermeableN-hydroxysuccinimide ester sulfo-BSOCOES to cross-link integrins bound to Fn (19Garcı́a A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the presence of TS2/16, cross-linking bound integrins resulted in a >2.5-fold increase in adhesion strength compared with un-cross-linked controls, shown as a right shift in the detachment profile (Fig. 4). Similar results were observed in AG89-stimulated cells. Cross-linking cells without activated receptors yielded background levels of adhesion (Fig.4), indicating that the adhesive force is specifically provided by the bound receptors and that cross-linking of other surface molecules does not contribute to adhesion. The significant increase in adhesion strength as a result of cross-linking bound receptors demonstrates that detachment occurs at the integrin-Fn junction; the assay, therefore, measures the strength of this interaction. To examine the functional dependence of adhesion strength on Fn density, adhesion experiments were combined with Fn adsorption measurements (19Garcı́a A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). K562 adhesion strength increased linearly with Fn surface density for TS2/16 and AG89 over the full range of adsorbed Fn densities. Linear regression analysis (for each condition, n > 16 separate experiments) revealed extremely high statistical significance; the correlation coefficient was >0.92 and the p value was <10−9. Therefore, all of the variability of the data can be explained by a linear model. The linear regression slope for TS2/16 activation was 1.7 times the slope for AG89 stimulation (p < 0.001). For inactive α5β1 integrin, adhesion was independent of Fn and indistinguishable from background. In the presence of Mn2+ (1 mm), the increase in adhesion strength as a function of Fn surface density was indistinguishable from AG89-activated cells. We have previously demonstrated that initial adhesion strength increases linearly with ligand density, which is directly proportional to the number of receptor-ligand bonds (19Garcı́a A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This linear dependence of adhesion strength on ligand density suggests the absence of cooperative binding in these initial attachment times and serves as a basis for comparison with more complex model systems. Analysis of the slope of the adhesion strength-Fn surface density relationship provides direct information about the integrin-Fn interaction. The differences in slope for the different activation conditions arise from variations in the adhesion constant ψ, because there were no differences in activated receptor density N R (Fig. 2) or the geometric parameter G between TS2/16 and AG89 stimulation (see Equation 1). The parameter G is related to cell shape and contact area, and because K562 cells remain spherical and do not exhibit adhesion strengthening during these short attachment times,G is not expected to vary for the different activation conditions. ψ(0) represents the ground state for α5β1 on K562 cells for which no detectable binding of soluble Fn or binding strength above background could be detected. ψ(1) and ψ(2) represent distinct activated states of α5β1 integrin with distinct receptor-ligand binding strengths and presumably represent distinct antibody-induced structural conformations of the receptor. These multiple adhesion strengths were also observed in the presence of metabolic poisons (NaN3 + deoxyglucose), and for a particular antibody, there were no differences in adhesion strength in the presence or absence of these metabolic poisons, suggesting that the different adhesion strengths resulted from differences in the receptor-ligand interaction and not different signals arising from antibody binding. Finally, these multiple binding states were not apparent from solution binding experiments indicating distinct interactions between α5β1 integrin and binding sites on Fn exposed upon adsorption. Passive activation of surface-expressed integrins relied on the use of activating mAbs, and whereas it is expected that these mAbs represent conformations of β1integrin expressed on the cells used for the initial immunizations, the resulting antibody-induced conformations could be artifactual. To relate the findings on the K562 model system to normal activation processes, the initial activation and adhesion of IMR-90 fibroblasts were analyzed. Unlike K562 cells, IMR-90 cells express multiple integrins that bind to Fn, activate receptors when seeded on Fn, develop focal adhesions, and spread. In the initial 15 min of adhesion at 22 °C, these cells remained spherical, and there was no detectable spreading. Binding of mAbs to integrins on IMR-90 cells is similar to binding to integrins expressed in K562 (Fig. 1). Untreated IMR-90 cells exhibited linear increases in adhesion strength with Fn density in the initial 15 min of attachment (Fig.6). This linear relationship is equivalent to the linear dependence observed in K562 cells and suggests the absence of cooperative binding effects in these initial times. Experiments with α5 (BIIG2) and β1 (AIIB2) blocking antibodies demonstrated that α5β1is the only integrin contributing to this initial adhesion to Fn (Fig.7). Integrin activation required metabolic energy, as shown by background levels of adhesion for NaN3-treated cells (Figs. 6 and 7).Figure 7IMR-90 initial adhesion strength (mean ± S.E.) for 110 ng/cm2 Fn for different conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The adhesion analysis was then performed on IMR-90 cells in the presence of AG89 or TS2/16 for a comparison with the binding states observed in K562 cells. As for K562 cells, incubation with these activating mAbs resulted in linear increases in initial adhesion strength with ligand density (Fig. 6). Although AG89 binds to β1 integrins expressed on IMR-90 cells (Fig. 1), incubation with AG89 resulted in no differences in initial adhesion strength when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6). This correspondence between AG89-stimulated passive activation and normal activation suggests that the two conditions represent the same activation state. Incubation of IMR-90 cells with TS2/16 resulted in a significant increase (1.8×) in adhesion strength above the initial endogenous level of adhesion. TS2/16 resulted in the same relative increase in adhesion strength for both K562 and IMR-90 cells. These three adhesion levels in IMR-90 cells can be compared with those observed in K562 cells. For a particular activation state, the adhesion strength-Fn density slope for IMR-90 cells was approximately five times greater than for K562 cells. Variations in receptor density cannot account for this difference, because IMR-90 cells express only 10–20% more α5β1 integrin than K562 cells. These differences most likely result from early spreading of the IMR-90 cells and the resultant increase in the area of contact between cell and substrate, with a consequent increase in the total number of receptors bound to ligand. These results indicate that in the initial stages (15 min) of the adhesion process, IMR-90 cells activate α5β1 integrin to a state quantitatively equivalent to AG89 activation. To examine whether IMR-90 cells activate α5β1 integrin to a higher binding state in the later stages of adhesion, IMR-90 cells were allowed to spread overnight on Fn under serum-free conditions and spun in the absence or presence (15 min before spinning) of TS2/16 (Fig.8). For spread cells, τ50increased 10–20 times over the adhesion strength for 15 min. This increase reflects the subsequent adhesion strengthening response and concomitant cell shape change (compared with a round cell, a spread cell presents a decreased projected area, which reduces the applied drag). Cross-linking experiments to examine the detachment mechanism revealed that detachment still occurs at the integrin-Fn junction, even after cytoskeletal recruitment and focal adhesion formation. There was no difference in adhesion strength between spread cells in the absence (1630 ± 30 dynes/cm2) or presence (1600 ± 150 dynes/cm2) of TS2/16 (Fig. 8). Immunofluorescent staining revealed that TS2/16 penetrated and ligated integrins bound to the underlying Fn. Taken together, these findings show that, over time, cells activate α5β1 integrin from the intermediate state observed at the initial stages of adhesion to a higher binding state that is insensitive to further activation by TS2/16. TS2/16-mediated increases in adhesion strength were observed at earlier times, suggesting that this model is valid. The basis for the functional analysis presented here is specific measurements of the strength of the integrin-Fn interaction. Using K562 cells, we have developed an experimental system for which there is no strengthening of the initial adhesion; there are no differences in adhesion strength between 5 and 15 min or in the presence of metabolic poisons at 15 min. This lack of adhesion strengthening allows the isolation of the integrin-Fn interaction from secondary mechanisms, such as recruitment of the cytoskeleton, that contribute to adhesion strength over time. Furthermore, this analysis provides for the calculation of a novel experimental parameter (ψ) that is related to bond strength and binding affinity. This parameter is specific for a particular receptor-ligand interaction and is independent of geometry, ligand, and receptor densities. Using this experimental framework, we demonstrate that integrin activation results in linear increases in initial adhesion strength over the full range of adsorbed ligand densities, indicating that activation involves direct changes in the receptor-ligand interaction. The linear relationship between initial adhesion strength and ligand density was observed both for antibody-activated, nonspreading cells and for cells capable of integrin activation, focal plaque formation, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. This functional dependence suggests that there is an absence of cooperative binding effects and that modulation of the receptor-ligand interaction is the dominant mechanism for increases in adhesion strength during the initial stages of adhesion. The passive, antibody-induced activation model is critical to the present analysis because it provides a base line for comparison with the endogenous, cell-controlled activation model. For example, the fact that activating mAbs directed against different structural sites on the integrin produced different activation states for α5β1 on K562 cells provided additional benchmarks for the analysis of integrin activation in IMR-90 cells. Activation of β1 integrins by specific mAbs provides an important tool for the analysis of activation states, and this approach is widely used. In our application, we used saturating levels of mAb to ensure that all surface-expressed β1 integrins are activated and then measured the adhesion of cells expressing the uniformly activated receptors. This quantitative assay for adhesion provides a direct measurement of the functional consequences of shifts between different states and avoids the inherent limitation that these mAbs not only recognize different conformations of the receptor, but by converting or stabilizing a particular conformation, also perturb the equilibrium between the states. The argument for the two-stage activation model for normal IMR-90 fibroblasts is based first on the short term activation experiments (Fig. 6), which show that initial activation results in adhesion comparable with that produced by AG89 stimulation. This intermediate state could be enhanced by binding of TS2/16 to a higher state, equivalent to that observed for the K562 cells. This result demonstrates the potential for further activation of α5β1 integrin on IMR-90 cells. This ability of TS2/16 to increase adhesion is lost in spread IMR-90 cells. Note that long term effects of the addition of activating β1integrin mAbs on cell proliferation have been observed (24Lundell B.I. McCarthy J.B. Kovach N.L. Verfaillie C.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For spread IMR-90 cells, τ50 increases 10–20 times over the 15-min adhesion strength. This difference reflects, in addition to the higher binding state, the effects of receptor clustering, redistribution, and cytoskeletal associations that occur over time. In summary, this analysis provides evidence that the initial activation and adhesion of α5β1 integrin, which occur following the contact of the cell with adsorbed Fn, provide linear increases in adhesion strength with the number of receptor-ligand bonds. Whereas cytoskeletal proteins may play a role in this activation, it does not require receptor clustering, which would lead to cooperative binding and deviation from linearity. This does not exclude integrin clustering from contributing to increases in adhesion strength over time. It is likely that receptor clustering and cytoskeletal interaction will lead to nonlinear increases in adhesion strength as a function of ligand density, and several theoretical models predict this deviation from linearity (25Evans E.A. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 185-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Dembo M. Torney D.C. Saxman K. Hammer D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

However, our data indicate that one of the elements that contributes to increased adhesion over time is an increase in the strength of the receptor-ligand interaction. A mechanistic model for these differences in integrin functional binding is that the integrin exhibits at least three metastable conformational states (ψ(0), ψ(1), ψ(2)) that alter the extracellular domain and its interaction with the ligand. Previous models have identified two states, usually referred to as high and low or activated and inactivated states (5Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These different conformations can be induced passively, using external factors (antibodies that bind to structurally different extracellular regions of the receptor, Mn2+), and endogenously (cell-controlled inside-out signaling). The different conformations probably give rise to the different functional binding states through different interactions with distinct regions on the Fn, such as the RGD and PHSRN synergy sites (28Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Danen E.H. Aota S. van Kraats A.A. Yamada K.M. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21612-21618Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to differences in the extracellular domain-Fn interaction, these multiple conformational states may result in variations in intracellular regions of the integrin leading to different interactions with signaling and structural cytoskeletal components. The existence of multiple binding states for α5β1 suggests that there are distinct stages in adhesion signaling and strengthening that can provide a versatile mechanism for the regulation of adhesive interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2093254238,"Rat brain phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) belongs to a superfamily defined by the highly conserved catalytic motif (H(X)K(X)4D, denoted HKD. RPLD1 contains two HKD domains, located in the N- and C-terminal regions. Deletion mutants of rPLD1 that contained only an N- or C-terminal HKD domain exhibited no catalytic activity when expressed in COS 7 cells. However, when N-terminal fragments containing one of the HKD domains were cotransfected with a C-terminal fragment containing the other HKD domain, PLD activity was restored. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays showed that the N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1 were physically associated when expressed in COS 7 cells. In addition, deletion of 168 amino acids from the N terminus of rPLD1 significantly enhanced basal PLD activity while inhibiting the response to phorbol ester. Likewise, the coexpression of this truncated N-terminal half with the C-terminal half resulted in increased PLD activity. In summary, this study provides direct evidence that the enzymatic activity of rPLD1 requires the presence of the HKD domains in both the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule. More importantly, the two halves of rPLD1 can associate, and this may be essential to bring the two HKD domains together to form an active catalytic center. These findings provide new insights into the catalytic mechanism of enzymes of the PLD superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1976867304,"It has been proposed that Cys99 of human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is responsible for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) binding. To examine this possibility rigorously, we expressed rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) in Escherichia coli, with the homologous Cys331 to Ala mutation, and characterized structural and functional attributes of the purified, mutated enzyme. C331A-nNOS, as isolated, was catalytically incompetent. Upon prolonged incubation with l-arginine (l-Arg), not only BH4 binding but also catalytic activity could be restored. In contrast to wild-type nNOS (WT-nNOS), which exhibits an absorbance maximum at 407 nm that shifts immediately upon l-arginine addition to a high spin form, the C331A-nNOS mutant, as isolated, exhibited an absorbance maximum at 420 nm. C331A-nNOS, as isolated, did not bind detectable levels of either [3H]Nω-nitro-l-arginine or [3H]BH4, but [3H]BH4 binding was reinstated after extended incubation with excess l-arginine. On the other hand, C331A-nNOS and WT-NOS were identical with regard to imidazole binding affinity, CaM binding affinity, and rates of cytochrome cand 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction. EPR spectroscopy revealed conversion of low to high spin heme after extended incubation with high concentrations of l-arginine (0.1–10 mm). The estimated K d for l-arginine binding to C331A-nNOS was two orders of magnitude greater than WT-nNOS (>100 μm versus 2–3 μm). Here we propose that Cys331 plays an important role in stabilizingl-arginine binding to nNOS. Our findings suggest that the primary dysfunction in the C331A mutant of nNOS, as isolated, is disruption of the BH4-substrate binding interactions as broadcast from this mutated cysteine residue. Prolonged incubation withl-arginine appears to cause remodeling of the mutant protein to a form similar to that of WT-nNOS, allowing for normalized BH4 binding and nitric oxide synthetic activity. It has been proposed that Cys99 of human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is responsible for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) binding. To examine this possibility rigorously, we expressed rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) in Escherichia coli, with the homologous Cys331 to Ala mutation, and characterized structural and functional attributes of the purified, mutated enzyme. C331A-nNOS, as isolated, was catalytically incompetent. Upon prolonged incubation with l-arginine (l-Arg), not only BH4 binding but also catalytic activity could be restored. In contrast to wild-type nNOS (WT-nNOS), which exhibits an absorbance maximum at 407 nm that shifts immediately upon l-arginine addition to a high spin form, the C331A-nNOS mutant, as isolated, exhibited an absorbance maximum at 420 nm. C331A-nNOS, as isolated, did not bind detectable levels of either [3H]Nω-nitro-l-arginine or [3H]BH4, but [3H]BH4 binding was reinstated after extended incubation with excess l-arginine. On the other hand, C331A-nNOS and WT-NOS were identical with regard to imidazole binding affinity, CaM binding affinity, and rates of cytochrome cand 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction. EPR spectroscopy revealed conversion of low to high spin heme after extended incubation with high concentrations of l-arginine (0.1–10 mm). The estimated K d for l-arginine binding to C331A-nNOS was two orders of magnitude greater than WT-nNOS (>100 μm versus 2–3 μm). Here we propose that Cys331 plays an important role in stabilizingl-arginine binding to nNOS. Our findings suggest that the primary dysfunction in the C331A mutant of nNOS, as isolated, is disruption of the BH4-substrate binding interactions as broadcast from this mutated cysteine residue. Prolonged incubation withl-arginine appears to cause remodeling of the mutant protein to a form similar to that of WT-nNOS, allowing for normalized BH4 binding and nitric oxide synthetic activity. Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs, 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; eNOS, endothelial NOS; iNOS, inducible NOS; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; CaM, calmodulin; [3H]NNA, NSω-nitro-l-[3H] arginine; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DCIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol.

The three isoforms of mammalian NOS, namely neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS), and endothelial (eNOS), possess distinct patterns of expression, regulation, and intracellular localization. All isoforms in their dimeric, physiological forms contain tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (2Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol.

Whereas both nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed by particular cell types and are Ca2+/CaM-dependent, the immunostimulant-induced NOS isoform (iNOS) is conditionally expressed by diverse cell types and is Ca2+-independent (13Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). In the course of studies designed to identify the BH4binding site on nNOS, based on dihydrofolate reductase homology models, we identified a domain of nNOS (558–721) (see Scheme FS1) that binds [3H]Nω-nitro-l-arginine ([3H]NNA) without detectable affinity for BH4binding (14Nishimura J.S. Martásek P. McMillan K. Salerno J. Liu Q. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in other labs have confirmed that negatively charged residues in this region are specifically involved inl-arginine binding and that mutation of glutamic acid residues in the corresponding regions of human eNOS and murine iNOS (Glu361 and Glu371, respectively; Scheme FS1) selectively abolished l-arginine binding (15Chen P-F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding of l-arginine and/or BH4 have been shown to produce cooperative conformational alterations in the heme pocket of NOS, reflected by a conversion of the heme spin state equilibrium from the low to high spin form (17McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In murine iNOS, residues between 65 and 114 appear to be involved in dimerization and/or BH4binding (18Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on C99A mutational analysis, it was reported that Cys99 in human endothelial NOS is essential for BH4 binding (19Chen P-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility in nNOS, we expressed the rat nNOS holoenzyme in Escherichia coli with a corresponding mutation to C99A-eNOS (C331A). Because E. coliproduces neither BH4 nor calmodulin (CaM), nNOS expressed in this system permits the examination of BH4- and CaM-free enzyme and of the effects of subsequent reconstitution with these cofactors. Recently, Miller et al. (20Miller R.T. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Nishimura J.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15277-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) from this laboratory demonstrated the inability of the C331A-nNOS, as isolated, to transfer electrons from the flavoprotein domain to the oxygenase domain. This mutant protein was useful in demonstrating that superoxide anion (O⨪2) production could emanate solely from the reductase domain (20Miller R.T. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Nishimura J.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15277-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), independent of the heme domain. Herein we present a structure/function characterization of C331A-mutated nNOS. [3H]NNA was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA); NADPH, CaM, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose was a product of Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). The construct of C331A-nNOS was made using a site-specific mutagenesis approach. Using the site-specific oligonucleotide C331A-ApaLI-sense: TCATGTGCACAGAGCACATTGCCATGGGCT, and NOS Cys antisense: CATACTCGAGTCACCCCAGGTCCTTAAACCAGTC, a polymerase chain reaction product was obtained using WT-nNOS as a template. This polymerase chain reaction product was digested by ApaLI andNarI and resulted in a 236-base pair cDNA containing the desired mutation (codon TGC of cysteine changed to GCC of alanine). Using ApaLI, NarI, NdeI, andHindIII restriction sites, the mutation was first introduced into the heme domain of nNOS in the pCWori+ vector, first used by McMillan and Masters (17McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and later into holoenzyme nNOS according to Roman et al. (21Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Part of the cDNA obtained by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the previously constructed plasmid was sequenced using automated sequencing, and the introduced mutation was confirmed in the Center for DNA Technologies at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The remaining sequence was identical to WT-nNOS (9Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Plasmid C331AnNOS-pCW was co-transfected with the pgroELS plasmid in BL21 E. colicells (21Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Individual colonies were picked and grown overnight in TB medium in the presence of ampicillin and choramphenicol at 37 °C. Twenty-five ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate 400 ml of TB media in a 2.8 l Fernbach flask, which was shaken at room temperature until A 560 reached ∼ 0.8. At that time, the culture was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid, and a few grains of riboflavin. After IPTG induction, cells were grown in the dark at room temperature for 48 h and shaken at 225 rpm. Purification was performed as described previously by Romanet al. (21Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The protein is BH4-free as isolated becauseE. coli do not have the capacity to synthesize BH4 due to the absence of the enzyme, GTP cyclohydrolase. We studied the physicochemical properties of C331A-nNOS as isolated (nol-Arg added after affinity chromatography) and with increasing l-Arg concentrations (0.1–20 mm) for the time intervals of 1 min to 12 h (referred to as overnight incubation, O/N). Assay of125I-CaM binding was performed in 96-well microfiltration plates with GFB filter bottoms (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (22Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 5 pmol of nNOS (WT or C331A mutant), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm CaCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml β-lactoglobulin in a total volume of 100 μl. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C prior to filtration. All samples were analyzed in triplicate, and blank binding was defined as that observed in the presence of 10 mm EGTA. Assay of [3H]NNA and [3H]BH4 was performed in 96-well polyvinylidene difluoride microfiltration plates (Millipore) as described previously (14Nishimura J.S. Martásek P. McMillan K. Salerno J. Liu Q. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All reaction mixtures were assayed in triplicate and contained 10 pmol of nNOS (WT or C331A mutant) in a final volume of 100 μl. The hemoglobin NO⋅-capture assay was used to measure the rate of methemoglobin formation from oxyhemoglobin, using an extinction coefficient of 0.038 μm−1, as described previously by Shetaet al. (23Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method produces very similar results to that of the l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline assay as performed in our laboratory. A modified method of Masterset al. (24Masters B.S.S. Williams Jr., C.H. Kamin H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 565-573Crossref Scopus (623) Google Scholar) was used to measure cytochrome c and DCIP reductase activities in that 40 μm cytochromec or DCIP was used as the electron acceptor and 100 μm NADPH was the electron donor. Both WT-nNOS and C331A-nNOS enzyme preparations as isolated at 8 μmwere incubated with various concentrations of l-arginine (0.1–20 mm) and/or BH4 (300 μm) for a maximum of 12 h. The resulting enzymes were then used for assays or concentrated to 25–50 μm for EPR experiments. Samples (0.3 ml) for EPR measurements were prepared as described above, and spectra were recorded by a Bruker ESP-300 spectrometer operating at 9.45 GHz with a field modulation of 0.2 mT at 100 kHz. Measurements were carried out using an Oxford liquid helium flow cryostat (ESR-300). Microwave frequency was monitored by a frequency counter (HP-5350) and an NMR gauss meter (Bruker ER-035M) was used to determine the magnetic flux density. Reduced, CO-difference spectra were obtained using sealed cuvettes containing 0.33 μm enzyme, 0.5 μm CaM, 400 μm CaCl2, 200 μm NADPH, 100 μml-arginine, and 5 μmBH4 in CO-saturated 50 mm HEPES/KOH at pH 7.6. Difference spectra were recorded between 400 and 500 nm at 5-min intervals following the addition of CaM. The protein concentrations of WT-nNOS and C331A-nNOS were determined, based on heme content, by reduced CO-difference spectra (extinction coefficient of 100 mm−1 cm−1 for an absorbance difference between 444–475 nm). The average heme content of the nNOS protein was 80%. Sequence alignments revealed that cysteine 331 of nNOS is a conserved residue in all NOS isoforms reported to date, being a part of the absolutely conserved motif Cys-(X)4-Cys (SchemeFS1). Mutation of cysteine 331 to alanine, followed by expression in E. coli and purification, yielded pure enzyme devoid of detectable NO synthetic activity. Remarkably, overnight incubation with l-arginine at 4 °C (>1 mm) restored enzymatic activity to a level comparable with that of WT-nNOS (416 nmol/min/mg for C331A-nNOS versus 483 nmol/min/mg at 22 °C for WT-nNOS, measured by hemoglobin capture of NO⋅ at 22 °C). The removal ofl-arginine from C331A-nNOS, by passage of the enzyme through a Sephadex G-50 spin column, caused a complete loss of NO⋅ synthetic activity. The reincubation of enzyme overnight with l-arginine, however, restored activity, indicating that the continual presence of l-arginine is required to maintain an active C331A-nNOS enzyme. Although NO⋅ synthesis was deficient in the C331A-nNOS mutant, as isolated, reductase activity was preserved at a level comparable with that of WT-nNOS. The turnover number for the C331A-nNOS- and WT-nNOS-catalyzed reduction of cytochrome c and DCIP was in the range of 500–700/min in the absence of CaM. Upon addition of CaM, the reductase activity of C331A-nNOS and WT-nNOS increased to a similar extent, using either cytochrome c (8–10-fold increase) or DCIP (6–7-fold increase) as substrates. The absolute absorption spectrum of purified C331A-nNOS, as isolated, exhibited a Soret maximum at 420 nm, compared with 407 nm for WT-nNOS. While addition of l-arginine caused an immediate shift in the Soret absorption maximum of WT-nNOS to 400 nm, the absorption spectrum of C331A-nNOS was unaffected by acute l-arginine exposure. Nonetheless, the mutant protein was able to bind l-arginine after prolonged incubation, although arginine binding affinity was two orders of magnitude lower than that of wild-type nNOS (>100 μm versus 1 μm, respectively, as estimated from the spectral perturbation studies). Fig.1 shows the spectral shift in Soret maximum of C331A-nNOS to two different concentrations ofl-arginine. Only overnight incubation with 1 mml-arginine (which did not produce a maximal spectral shift) or higher introduced clear spectral changes toward high spin species with maximum changes observed using 10 and 20 mml-arginine. The removal of l-arginine from C331A-nNOS, as described above, caused a shift of the Soret maximum back to 420 nm, indicating formation of low spin species. The reincubation of enzyme overnight with l-arginine, however, reintroduced the spectral shift to high spin species, indicating that the continual presence of arginine is required to maintain the spin state equilibrium of C331A-nNOS enzyme in the high spin form. Whereas the above spectral studies suggested thatl-arginine binding to the C331A mutant of nNOS is defective, binding of the heme ligand, imidazole, was indistinguishable between C331A and WT-nNOS. Indeed, imidazole elicited an immediate spectral shift to low spin iron in both WT-nNOS and C331A-nNOS, accompanied by a comparable shift in the Soret absorption maximum to 430 nm. The imidazole effect was concentration-dependent and characteristic of a type II spectral change. The apparentK d for imidazole binding was 75 ± 5 μm for WT-nNOS and 71 ± 6 μm for C331A-nNOS, derived from Fig. 2 data. CO-binding to nNOS occurs to the ferrous, but not ferric, heme protein, and is manifest by a 443–445 nm absorption peak (5McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Detection of this peak is thus useful in assessing the extent and rate of electron transfer to heme in nNOS. The C331A mutant, as isolated, exhibited a markedly diminished rate of CaM-induced electron transfer from NADPH, through the flavins, to heme (Fig. 3 A), relative to the complete heme reduction observed with dithionite. This slow rate of CaM-induced heme reduction contrasts with the nearly 75% heme reduction observed after 30 min in the C331A mutant following overnightl-arginine repletion (Fig. 3 B) and WT-nNOS as isolated (not shown). The slow rate of CaM-induced heme reduction observed with the C331A-nNOS mutant could conceivably arise from a primary defect in the binding of either CaM orl-arginine. To test whether the defect was specifically in CaM binding, the concentration-dependence of 125I-CaM binding was assessed with wild-type and C331A mutant nNOSs in the presence of 100 μm calcium. CaM binding to wild-type and mutant nNOSs was indistinguishable (K d = 3–5 nm; data not shown). Studies were performed to assess the capacity of [3H]BH4to bind to C331A-nNOS. All binding reaction mixtures contained 1 mm arginine. Nonetheless, BH4 binding was undetectable in the C331A mutant as isolated, but became apparent after overnight exposure to 10 mm arginine at 4 °C (Fig.4). The K d for [3H]BH4 binding to the arginine-repleted C331A-nNOS mutant was 80 nm, similar to that of WT-nNOS. Functionality of the arginine binding site of C331A-nNOS, as isolated, was assessed by comparing the concentration-dependence of [3H]NNA binding with that of WT-nNOS. As shown in Fig.5, significant binding of [3H]NNA to WT-nNOS was only observed in the presence of BH4 (10 μm); the apparentK d for [3H]NNA binding was 45 nm. [3H]NNA binding to the C331A-nNOS mutant was identical in the absence and presence of BH4, but corresponded only to the low background level observed with WT-nNOS in the absence of BH4 (note the expanded ordinate scale in thebottom panel in Fig. 5). Thus, l-NNA binding is essentially abolished in the C331A mutant of nNOS, as isolated. EPR experiments were performed to identify possible differences in the heme environments of WT- and C331A-nNOS. As shown in Fig.6 A, a predominant fraction of the heme in WT-nNOS, as isolated, was in the high spin state. In contrast, in the C331A-nNOS mutant, as isolated, heme was predominantly in the low spin state (Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6 B shows the effect of increasing concentrations of l-arginine on the spin state of C331A-nNOS. Addition of 0.1 mml-arginine and overnight incubation resulted in a roughly equimolar mixture of high and low spin forms; note that this concentration of l-arginine is 100-fold theK d of WT-nNOS (∼1 μm). The addition of BH4 to the C331A-nNOS caused the appearance of a new species with gx = 8.3 (Fig.7 A). This species represents BH4 binding to a minority of the enzyme (∼10%), and it is more rhombic than any of the observed l-arginine analog complexes (25Salerno J.C. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11839-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, the BH4·C331A·nNOS complex is among the most rhombic ferri-heme thiolate high spin species yet seen. BH4 binding alone is ineffective in converting low spin or axial high spin forms of heme to native high spin forms. Additional BH4-induced changes in the nNOS heme environment are visible in the low spin region. The overnight incubation with BH4 results in an almost complete conversion of the C331A-nNOS heme to a new low spin state (Figs. 7 A and B). Whereas imidazole complexes of WT-nNOS exhibited three distinct resonant species, a single species was observed with the imidazole complex of C331A-nNOS (data not shown).Figure 7A, EPR of C331A-nNOS, as isolated, and the effect of incubation with BH4 or/andl-arginine for the indicated period of time (1 h or overnight (O/N)).

In the present study, mutational analysis was used to address the specific role of C331 in the binding of substrate and cofactor by rat nNOS and the spectroscopic and catalytic consequences of such a mutation. C331A-nNOS is homologous to a mutant human eNOS that was previously reported to be incapable of BH4 binding (19Chen P-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because E. coli do not possess a biosynthetic pathway for BH4, expression of C331A-nNOS inE. coli afforded us the opportunity to study the expressed mutant enzyme as isolated and then to assess the influence of BH4 and l-arginine supplementation on enzymatic properties. As isolated, the C331A-nNOS mutant did not produce detectable levels of NO⋅ when incubated with concentrations of substrates and cofactors that support maximal activity of WT-nNOS. Moreover, CO-difference spectra revealed a limited ability of heme in C331A-nNOS to undergo CaM-induced reduction by NADPH (Fig. 3). The slow development of the ferrous-CO complex of C331A-nNOS afterl-arginine repletion (indistinguishable from WT-nNOS) is consistent with previous studies (26Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Google Scholar, 27Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that have provided insight into this phenomenon. Inhibition of CO complex formation byl-arginine and BH4 appears to result from restricted access of CO to the ferrous heme iron (26Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Google Scholar, 29Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been estimated that 70–90% of the nNOS undergoing catalytic turnover is in the form of a ferrous nitrosyl complex (27Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that would also interfere with efficient CO binding. Finally, the rate of NO⋅ synthesis (and thus heme reduction) was shown to be dependent on the ability of the reductase domain to efficiently deliver electrons to the heme domain, and in the case of nNOS, this is not a limiting factor (28Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, heme reduction is fast, but capture of CO is a much slower process in the case of wild type enzymes. However, the rate-limiting step in the C331A-nNOS has become reduction of the heme by the flavoprotein domain (Fig. 3). Radioligand binding studies showed that differences in CaM binding by C331A-nNOS could not explain functional defects. Because C331A-nNOS (as isolated) and WT-nNOS were indistinguishable in cytochrome cand DCIP reduction assays, it would appear that the C331A mutant has a fully competent reductase domain. The low spin status of C331A-nNOS, as isolated, observed in EPR experiments and Soret circular dichroism results (data not shown), reveal an altered environment around the heme chromophore that is the likely explanation for inefficient electron transfer to heme and an essential lack of NO⋅ synthetic activity. In accord with this view, full NO⋅ synthesis activity and electron transfer from NADPH to heme was restored to wild-type levels after prolonged incubation of C331A-nNOS with a high concentration of l-arginine, which binds in the heme pocket of the oxygenase domain. As isolated, C331A-nNOS was unable to bind significant quantities of either [3H]BH4 or [3H]NNA, at radioligand concentrations 10–100-fold times the K dfor WT-nNOS. Because both BH4 and l-arginine bind within the heme pocket of NOSs, an altered heme environment in the C331A-nNOS mutant can explain the combined dysfunction in substrate and cofactor binding. It is notable that presumed heme ligands, such as 7-nitroindazole, have been reported to similarly perturb both NNA and BH4 binding to WT-nNOS (30Klatt P. Schmidt M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous with the rescue of NO⋅ synthetic activity, we found that BH4 binding to C331A-nNOS was restored by prolonged incubation withl-arginine. This finding implies two significant things about the C331A-nNOS mutant. First, the defect is not primarily in the BH4 site, as described previously for the eNOS mutant homolog (19). Indeed, BH4 binding is observed with the l-arginine pre-soaked C331A-nNOS mutant enzyme. Second, binding of BH4 and l-arginine restores the altered heme environment of the mutant enzyme to a condition resembling WT-nNOS. More revealing information about the mutant heme environment was obtained from EPR studies. EPR spectra of the C331A-nNOS were similar to the spectra of WT-nNOS (25Salerno J.C. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11839-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with the exception that a much higher proportion of the enzyme (∼70% of the ferri-heme, as isolated) (Fig. 6) was in the low spin state. This could reflect either reduced binding ofl-arginine by the mutant or, perhaps, an alteration in its heme environment. The radical signal at g = 2.0 of the flavosemiquinone is indistinguishable from the similar signal in WT-nNOS, consistent with a normal reductase domain of C331A-nNOS. Incubation with l-arginine at above K dconcentrations (relative to WT-nNOS) converted the spectrum of the mutant enzyme to a high spin state closely resembling that observed for the WT·nNOS·l-arginine complex. Addition of BH4 alone did not significantly perturb the spin state equilibrium, although small amounts of new high and low spin species were observed (Fig. 7). The addition of BH4 in the presence of l-arginine generated a significant new high spin species indicative of a ternary complex. Thus, the equilibrium EPR studies demonstrate that the C331A-nNOS mutant is capable of binding bothl-arginine and BH4, whereas binding rate and affinity may be diminished by an initially perturbed heme environment. A perturbed heme environment in the C331A-nNOS mutant was further indicated by effects of heme-binding ligands on EPR spectra. It is notable that imidazole and dithiothreitol both converted the C331A-nNOS rapidly to a single low spin species. While WT-nNOS appears to attain multiple imidazole plane orientations that have comparable free energies, imidazole in C331A-nNOS may optimize its interaction with heme, resulting in a single dominant species. The long duration required for ligand binding to C331A-nNOS, compared with WT-nNOS, suggests possible conformationally mediated events in agreement with the induced-fit theory (31Koshland Jr., D.E. Neet K.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1968; 37: 359-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The velocity of conformational changes could range from that limited by diffusion to extremely slow rates. We cannot exclude the possibility that mutation of Cys331 to Ala changes the structure, thus requiring substantial rearrangement to obtain optimal substrate binding and catalytic function (31Koshland Jr., D.E. Neet K.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1968; 37: 359-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In such cases, conformational changes are typically slow, as previously shown for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (32Kirschner K. Eigen M. Bittman R. Voigt B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported by Klatt et al. (33Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that BH4and l-arginine induced conversion of WT-nNOS into a stable homodimer that survives in 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. A later study by Klatt at al. (34Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) showed that heme is required for dimerization of nNOS and that heme-deficient enzyme bound neither BH4 nor l-NNA. We found that the oligomeric status of C331A-nNOS is dimeric, as isolated, and is not different from that of WT-nNOS, as judged from analytical centrifugation findings 2P. Martasek, B. Demeler, and B.S.S. Masters, unpublished observations. and the behavior of these two proteins on gel filtration chromatography (Superose 6 HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; data not shown). We conclude that despite an apparently “normal” oligomeric status and heme content, oxygenase domain functionality is significantly perturbed by mutation of Cys to Ala in position 331 of nNOS. Recently, a novel testis-specific form of nNOS was described. This form of nNOS is truncated in its NH2-terminal 336 amino acids but possesses NOS enzymatic activity comparable with that of its full-length counterpart (35Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Obviously, Cys331 is located within this truncated sequence. It remains to be seen if the truncation of the whole segment affects NO⋅ formation as the single site mutation does. Systematic truncation studies of nNOS were recently published (36Boyhan A. Smith D. Charles I.G. Saqi M. Lowe P.N. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These authors expressed protein containing residues 350–724 (Scheme FS1), which was found to bind heme but was unable to bind BH4 as well as l-NNA orl-arginine. We previously showed that protein containing nNOS residues 220–721 is able to bind NNA and that this binding is stimulated by BH4 (14Nishimura J.S. Martásek P. McMillan K. Salerno J. Liu Q. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, WT-nNOS contains a critical determinant for arginine/BH4 binding between residue 221 and 350. Boyhan et al. (36Boyhan A. Smith D. Charles I.G. Saqi M. Lowe P.N. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) further defined the critical region for l-arginine binding between residues 275 and 350, where Cys331 of nNOS is situated. In addition, studies by Rodriguez-Crespo et al. (37Rodriguez-Crespo I. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8530-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), employing progressive N-terminal deletions, led to the conclusion that the more drastic deletions, which included the analogous cysteine residue (Cys101) in bovine eNOS to Cys331 in nNOS (present work), resulted in a very unstable protein that could only be stored at ultra-low temperatures in high concentrations of l-arginine. During the original preparation of this manuscript, Crane et al. (38Crane B.A. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) reported the 2.7-Å resolution structure of iNOS dimer. Cys109 of mouse iNOS corresponds to Cys331 of rat nNOS (see Scheme FS1) and is located at the bottom of the dimer interface where it forms a disulfide bond with its Cys109symmetry mate. This region of the iNOS structure is disordered and precludes a detailed interpretation. Based on the existing mouse iNOS structure, the effects of l-arginine identified in this paper cannot be explained. On the other hand, our laboratory has recently solved the structure of the heme domain dimer of constitutive nNOS, at 1.9Å resolution. 3C. S. Raman, H. Li, P. Martásek, V. Král, B. S. S. Masters, and T. L. Poulos, unpublished observations. These experiments have revealed a hitherto undiscovered zinc tetrathiolate center (Zn-Cys-(Xaa)4-Cys) that requires the participation of cysteine 331 in nNOS in the binding of this metal. Since the studies reported in the present manuscript, as those of other workers, preceded this unique structural finding, it was not possible to predict the possible consequences of mutating one of these cysteine residues. Because of the fact that zinc tetrathiolate centers have been implicated in structural roles in other proteins across phylogenetic species, a most likely consequence of this mutation is to destabilize the structurally important interactions in nNOS, and it could explain similar structure-function consequences of mutations or deletions in eNOS (19Chen P-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Rodriguez-Crespo I. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8530-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By analogy with eNOS and iNOS (15Chen P-F. Tsai A-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is probable thatl-arginine binds to Glu592 of nNOS between the heme and CaM binding sites. It is also clear that the C331A mutation dramatically affects l-arginine binding to the enzyme. The EPR data indicate that the l-arginine binding site of C331A is less constrained than that of WT-nNOS, as indicated by the rhombicity of the ferri-heme thiolate species. To explain this and other observations reported herein, we propose that C331A bindsl-arginine weakly, and that by a very slow process, this binding brings about a conformational change in the protein that is conducive to the binding of BH4. In turn, binding of BH4 also may have an effect on the conformation of the active site region, thereby reciprocally strengtheningl-arginine binding. Thus, the earlier report that the Cys331 homolog in human eNOS (Cys99) is required for BH4 binding may be only partially true. Whereas BH4 binding alone is ineffective in converting low spin or axial high spin forms of C331A-nNOS to native high spin forms, Cys331 is needed for high affinity l-arginine binding, which limits the binding of BH4 to mutant as well as wild-type nNOS. Prolonged exposure to l-arginine reverses the C331A mutant phenotype, restoring both BH4binding and the capacity for NO⋅ synthesis.

Effects of phenylalanine and tyrosine on the formation and fate (partitioning) of tyrosine from the different sources were examined in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. Rates of tyrosine degradation, transport, incorporation into and release from protein, and synthesis from phenylalanine were measured as well as the intracellular dilution of labeled tyrosine and phenylalanine incorporated into protein. We found tyrosine had little effect on phenylalanine hydroxylation over a wide range of conditions, that transported tyrosine and tyrosine from phenylalanine are in different metabolic pools, and that there appears to be channeling of newly synthesized tyrosine during degradation. In addition, under some conditions, intracellular partitioning of tyrosine is determined by tyrosine concentration. Specifically, if extracellular tyrosine is low and phenylalanine is at a normal plasma level, tyrosine use in protein synthesis takes precedence over tyrosine degradation or export. It is proposed that the mechanism controlling this is kinetic, based on relative rates of tyrosyl-tRNA formation and tyrosine degradation and export.

A quantitative model of tyrosine and phenylalanine in-flow and out-flow in hepatocytes is given, incorporating tyrosine synthesis, degradation, plasma membrane transport, and tyrosine and phenylalanine use and release during protein turnover. In animals, tyrosine is formed by hydroxylation of phenylalanine in a reaction catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 245-319PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kappock T.J. Caradonna J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2659-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The reaction occurs almost exclusively in liver (3Hsieh M. Berry H.K. J. Exp. Zool. 1979; 208: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is the first step in phenylalanine degradation (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 245-319PubMed Google Scholar, 4Haley C.J. Harper A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and phenylalanine appears to be its primary regulator (5Shiman R. Gray D.W. J. Biol.

Since liver is the site of tyrosine degradation as well as formation, the size of the intracellular tyrosine pool and the relative rates of tyrosine synthesis and degradation might be expected to depend, at least in part, on tyrosine concentration. Tyrosine could directly or indirectly (e.g.through the phenylalanine hydroxylase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 245-319PubMed Google Scholar,8Duch D.S. Smith G.K. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 411-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) affect the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation, it could affect the rate of tyrosine degradation, or it could affect the disposition (metabolic routing) of tyrosine in the cell. The mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and all could operate, although a direct effect of tyrosine on phenylalanine hydroxylase has not, so far, been observed either in studies with purified enzyme or in the few in situexperiments that have addressed this question (9Carr F.P. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Historically, studies of regulation of the tyrosine pool have focused on tyrosine degradation, and most of the interest in degradation has been on control of tyrosine aminotransferase which catalyzes the first step in the pathway, deamination to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The tyrosine aminotransferase reaction, although reversible, is usually considered the rate-limiting and regulated step in tyrosine metabolism (see Refs. 10Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M.

It is the next reaction, oxidation ofp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate byp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxygenase (10Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1077-1106Google Scholar), that is the first irreversible step in tyrosine degradation. If or how the activity of this enzyme or any enzyme in subsequent steps in the pathway are regulated is not clear. All the reactions, the hydroxylation of phenylalanine (14Baker R.E. Shiman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9633-9639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and those in tyrosine oxidation (10Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1077-1106Google Scholar), are catalyzed by cytoplasmic enzymes.The present studies, which were directed at understanding the fate of newly synthesized tyrosine in liver, used primary rat hepatocytes maintained as nondividing, monolayer cultures as a liver model. The initial questions were to determine if and how tyrosine concentration affected tyrosine formation and distribution within the cell, and if tyrosine formed from phenylalanine had a fate different from tyrosine transported from the medium. The culture medium was defined and serum free; and in these cultures, rates of protein synthesis, urea synthesis, amounts and activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase and its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin as well as the activity and hormone responsiveness of tyrosine aminotransferase are comparable to those in rat liver (15Mitnaul L.J. Shiman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16.Wilt, S., Long-term Regulation of Phenylalanine Hydroxylase by Glucagon in Primary Hepatocytes.Ph.D. Thesis, 1993, Pennsylvania State University.Google Scholar). Although no evidence was found that tyrosine can regulate its own synthesis, the results did show that tyrosine from the medium and newly synthesized tyrosine are in different pools, that there appears to be metabolic channeling in tyrosine degradation, and that, under some conditions, the intracellular partitioning (the fate) of tyrosine in the cell is regulated. The studies provide a quantitative model of tyrosine and phenylalanine in-flow and out-flow in hepatocytes which takes into account tyrosine synthesis, degradation, plasma membrane transport, and tyrosine and phenylalanine incorporation into and release from cell protein.DISCUSSIONThe present work used primary rat hepatocytes in monolayer culture as a model system to examine effects of phenylalanine and tyrosine on formation and intracellular distribution of tyrosine in a liver cell. Rates of tyrosine synthesis, degradation, export, and incorporation into protein were measured as well as the intracellular dilution of the labeled tyrosine and phenylalanine incorporated into cell protein. We found that over a wide range of concentrations exogenous tyrosine had little effect on the rate of tyrosine formation from phenylalanine, which reinforced the idea that the role of phenylalanine hydroxylase is to degrade phenylalanine rather than to synthesize tyrosine, that the fate of the newly synthesized tyrosine could be accounted for by a kinetic scheme (Fig. 4) which took into consideration the significant in-flows and out-flows of tyrosine in the hepatocytes, and that tyrosine synthesized from phenylalanine and tyrosine transported from the medium are, at least partially, in different metabolic pools that are metabolized at different rates by the cells.Although it would seem to make metabolic sense, tyrosine does not appear to regulate tyrosine synthesis. Up to now, except for experiments with primary hepatocytes in suspension culture (9Carr F.P. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), systematic studies under controlled conditions have been with purified phenylalanine hydroxylase. The in situ studies presented here, which tested a wider range of tyrosine and phenylalanine concentrations than heretofore, agree with the earlier results. The only effect of tyrosine we have found is a relatively small (25%) decrease in the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation when phenylalanine concentration is low and tyrosine very high (Fig. 3). This effect could be due to competition for the transporter or have another source, but whatever its origin, it is only evident at >0.5 mmtyrosine (Fig. 2), well above the normal physiological range. Additional experiments, not shown but comparable to those presented, also showed little effect of tyrosine on phenylalanine hydroxylation. In these, we omitted culture hormones one at a time at total amino acid concentration of 1 and 10 times the normal rat plasma concentration. At each condition, tyrosine was also varied. In no case could we find evidence that in situ phenylalanine hydroxylase activity responded in a significant way to the size of the intracellular tyrosine pool.Tyrosine also does not appear to regulate tyrosine aminotransferase activity. Early findings in vivo had suggested that tyrosine could induce the transaminase, but this effect was later shown to be secondary to hormone release under the stress of the tyrosine injections (11Groenwald J.V. Terblanche S.E. Oelofsen W. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In agreement, we also found no evidence that changes in the amino acid concentration of the culture medium affected transaminase activity measured in situ or in culture extracts (not shown). So far, the known significant regulators of the transaminase are either hormones or second messengers (10Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1077-1106Google Scholar, 11Groenwald J.V. Terblanche S.E. Oelofsen W. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whose actions are to induce an increase in the amount of enzyme in the cell. It is generally assumed that through these effects the tyrosine aminotransferase reaction is the regulated and rate-limiting step in tyrosine degradation, although as Table III shows the latter is not true under all conditions.A regulatory mechanism that has received little attention, but which at low tyrosine concentrations appears to be particularly effective, is that the distribution (partitioning) of tyrosine within the cell depends on tyrosine concentration. At normal plasma or higher concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine, only a relatively small fraction of newly synthesized tyrosine was exported from the hepatocytes, the majority was degraded; and the fractions exported or degraded were largely unaffected by the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation or by the phenylalanine or tyrosine concentrations of the medium (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). If the culture medium lacked tyrosine and phenylalanine was at a normal plasma concentration (50 μm(27Tolman E.L. Schworer C.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4552-4560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), relatively little newly synthesized tyrosine was transported to the medium or degraded, the majority was incorporated into protein. An interesting consequence was that the absence of tyrosine from the medium had little effect on protein synthesis, at least for the 3-h duration of the in situassay. 4As the following calculations show, when cultures were shifted to a zero tyrosine medium, there was only enough free tyrosine in the cytoplasm to sustain protein synthesis for a few minutes. An average hepatocyte culture contained approximately 40 μg of DNA/dish with an intracellular volume of 15 μl/dish (15Mitnaul L.J. Shiman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and had rate constants of tyrosine export (k 2) and degradation (k 4) of 6 and 35 × 10−8 liter/min/μg of DNA, respectively (Table I). From these, the combined rate constant for tyrosine loss is about 1/min, corresponding to a tyrosine t 12 of about 0.7 min. Since in the experiments cultures were in 0 μm tyrosine medium for 120 min prior to addition of tracer amounts of labeled amino acids (see “Experimental Procedures”), there should have been no intracellular tyrosine remaining that had been carried over from the medium. (Relative amounts of [35S]methionine incorporated into cell protein at 0 and 250 μm tyrosine were 0.93 ± 0.03 and 1.00 ± 0.05, respectively.) Although some sort of intracellular compartmentation might be able to account for these results, a simpler mechanism is kinetic in which the rate of amino acid activation by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is faster than the rate of tyrosine degradation. Results in Fig. 3 B require only that the rate of reaction of the tRNA synthetase with tyrosine be at least 2.5 times faster than the combined rates of [3H]tyrosine degradation and export. The amount and activity of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in rat liver is consistent with this possibility (32Deak F. Denes G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would be effective because there is only a limited amount of free synthetase and tRNA in a cell and aminoacylation and loading onto tRNA are effectively unidirectional.If a kinetic mechanism involving rapid tRNA loading controls tyrosine distribution, one might also expect it to affect the fate of tyrosine released by protein turnover. The results in Fig. 3 support this possibility. It can be calculated from the data in the figure that at 0 μm exogenous tyrosine about 65% of the tyrosine released by protein turnover was reincorporated into cell protein (2.8 of 4.3 pmol/min/μg DNA). This percentage is essentially identical to the percent of newly synthesized [3H]tyrosine incorporated into protein under the same conditions, indicating that tyrosine from the two sources had quantitatively the same fate. This kinetic mechanism involving rates of tRNA loading provides an unsuspected (partial) answer to the problem of how effects of tyrosine depletion on cell viability are minimized. The efficiency of the mechanism in conserving tyrosine at low concentrations of exogenous tyrosine is striking, since tyrosine aminotransferase and tyrosine degradation were fully induced in these experiments.Relative to the rate of protein synthesis, there is little aminoacylated tRNA in liver. In the case of leucine, even with a high concentration of the amino acid (10 times the normal plasma value), the pool of [3H]leucyl-tRNA in perfused rat liver is completely incorporated into nascent protein within 2 min (33Flaim K.E. Peavy D.E. Everson W.V. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2932-2938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this includes the time required to chase free [3H]leucine from the tissue, the actual rate of turnover must be even faster. Aminoacyl-tRNA turnover in the cultured hepatocytes also appears rapid. Assuming a content similar to that in rat liver (33Flaim K.E. Peavy D.E. Everson W.V. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2932-2938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocytes will have about 0.5 pmol of tyrosyl-tRNA/μg of DNA, which is only a few percent of the calculated intracellular free tyrosine pool at a normal plasma level of tyrosine (80 μm (27Tolman E.L. Schworer C.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4552-4560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). At the rates of tyrosine incorporation measured here (∼5 pmol/min/μg of DNA (Table I)), the pool of tyrosyl-tRNA in an hepatocyte would undergo essentially complete exchange in less than a minute.Differences in degradation rates of exogenous (plasma) tyrosine and of tyrosine from phenylalanine have been reported before (34Moldawer L.L.K.I. Bistrian B.R. Blackburn G.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The experiments were with rats infused at a constant rate with labeled phenylalanine or tyrosine at either a normal or an ∼8 times normal concentration of phenylalanine. The authors found that only a minority of the tyrosine synthesized from phenylalanine appeared in the plasma (20 and 30% at normal and 8 times normal phenylalanine level, respectively), and inferred that tyrosine formed from phenylalanine was oxidized 2–3 times faster than tyrosine from the plasma. The present more direct and detailed studies in the primary hepatocytes support and extend these results.The origin of this difference in rates of degradation is of considerable interest. It could be due to differences in rates of transport of the two amino acids or to newly formed tyrosine being more accessible to the tyrosine catabolic enzymes than tyrosine from the medium. The first possibility seems unlikely, because, in bulk, phenylalanine and tyrosine are transported at essentially the same rate (13Salter M. Knowles R.G. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Salter M. Knowles R.G. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Kilberg M.S. Barber E.F. Handlogten M.E. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1985; 25: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) on the same transporter system in hepatocytes, the L system (35Cheeseman C.I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 55: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when leucine concentration is constant, as it is in our experiments, the total activity of the L transport system in hepatocytes does not appear to significantly vary (35Cheeseman C.I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 55: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The second possibility that newly synthesized tyrosine is more accessible to the tyrosine degradative enzymes than tyrosine from the plasma, that is that some form of metabolic channeling (36Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) is involved in degradation of tyrosine derived from phenylalanine, is consistent with all observations. Metabolic channeling in degradation of newly synthesized tyrosine implies the existence of at least two tyrosine pools with different kinetic properties. It could involve intracellular compartmentation or a physical association (proximity) of phenylalanine hydroxylase with enzymes involved in the initial steps of tyrosine degradation. The major argument against compartmentation is that phenylalanine hydroxylase (14Baker R.E. Shiman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9633-9639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the tyrosine catabolic enzymes (10Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1077-1106Google Scholar) are soluble, cytoplasmic proteins; the alternative, physical association of some of the enzymes, has yet to be tested.Whether the inability of exogenous tyrosine to decrease the degradation rate of newly synthesized tyrosine and of newly synthesized tyrosine to decrease the degradation rate of exogenous tyrosine are related to metabolic channeling is not clear, because they are also consistent with the degradative enzymes having high K m values. When α-ketoglutarate is saturating, tyrosine aminotransferase does have a high K m,Tyr (∼1.4 mm (37Granner D.K. Tompkins G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 633-637Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar)), but p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which catalyzes the next reaction, the first irreversible step in tyrosine degradation, does not; its K m is 10–25 μm(38Rundgren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5094-5099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5R. Shiman and D. W. Gray, unpublished results. The net effect is difficult to predict, because the equilibrium position and the apparentK m of the transaminase depends on the α-ketoglutarate/glutamate ratio and, hence, on the cell's metabolic status. The effect of changing this ratio was tested by addition of NH4Cl to the culture medium to decrease, through the action of glutamate dehydrogenase, the α-ketoglutarate concentration in the cells. In glucagon-free medium, 10 mm NH4Cl decreased the tyrosine degradation rate by 75% with a concurrent, corresponding increase in tyrosine transport from the cells (data not shown). Thus, a decrease in the α-ketoglutarate level changed the partitioning of tyrosine between export and degradation in an expected way, but only when tyrosine aminotransferase activity was relatively low. When glucagon was present and the transaminase induced, there was no effect of the NH4Cl on the partitioning of tyrosine, implying another step in the pathway was rate-limiting under these conditions. Normal plasma levels of tyrosine and phenylalanine (80 and 50 μm, respectively) were used in these experiments, and neither the NH4Cl nor glucagon concentrations affected the rates of phenylalanine hydroxylation or protein synthesis.The present results provide an outline of tyrosine and phenylalanine utilization and distribution in hepatocytes that is summarized in Fig.4. Despite its simplifications, the model and calculated rate constants have been quite successful in accounting for our results. This is exemplified in Fig. 5 A where the effects of a large range of tyrosine and phenylalanine concentrations and phenylalanine hydroxylase activities are fit quite well by the model. It is also shown in the consistency of the rate constants. For k 1 andk 6, where it was possible to obtain the rate constants by independent methods, the different values agree within error (Table I). There is remarkably good agreement, as well, between the rates of tyrosine and phenylalanine incorporation into hepatocyte protein (k 6 and k 8) and in their respective rates of incorporation into rat liver protein (Table I). 6The rates of incorporation of tyrosine and phenylalanine into rat liver protein are 4.2 ± 0.8 and 7.2 ± 0.3 pmol/min/μg of DNA, respectively. These were calculated from the rate of protein synthesis in perfused rat liver of 4 mg of protein/h/g liver (33Flaim K.E. Peavy D.E. Everson W.V. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2932-2938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the protein content of rat liver (200 mg/g liver (33Flaim K.E. Peavy D.E. Everson W.V. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2932-2938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the tyrosine and phenylalanine contents of rat liver protein (188 ± 29 and 349 ± 9 nmol/mg of protein (39Ward W.F. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3581-3587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and the protein to dna ratio of the hepatocyte preparations (16 μg of DNA/mg of protein). Finally, the rates of tyrosine incorporation and release from cell protein (k 6 and k 5 (Table I)) also agree within error, as would be predicted under the conditions of the experiments. The only caveat for some of the constants (k 6, k 8, andV m/K m) is that secreted protein was not taken into account when considering rates of amino acid incorporation into total protein. In consequence, rates of total protein synthesis are slightly underestimated. For the constants affected, the error is fairly small (≤10%), 7In the experiments, the total labeling period is 1 h. Since secreted protein accounts for <20% of total protein synthesis, and it takes ∼30 min from the time of label addition before significant labeled protein appears in the medium (data not shown), at most 10% of label incorporated is not taken into account in our calculations. which in most cases is less than the experimental errors in the values of the constants. Constants calculated using the phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio incorporated into protein are not affected by this problem. Thus far, results of all experiments have been consistent with the model.Several rate constants were obtained by measuring intracellular dilution of a labeled amino acid. This is an indirect method for studying the kinetics of amino acid transport and use, and its precision is limited. Nonetheless, it had distinct advantages for the questions we were asking. It measures transport into a specific amino acid pool, the one used for protein synthesis. It has allowed us to distinguish intracellular contributions of tyrosine from plasma, protein, and phenylalanine, to study in a controlled way the fate of an amino acid formed inside the cell, and to make a direct comparison of its rates of export, degradation, and incorporation into protein. The results have raised the possibilities of a kinetic control of tyrosine use and of a physical association of phenylalanine hydroxylase and enzymes of the tyrosine degradation pathway. In animals, tyrosine is formed by hydroxylation of phenylalanine in a reaction catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 245-319PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kappock T.J. Caradonna J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2659-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The reaction occurs almost exclusively in liver (3Hsieh M. Berry H.K. J. Exp. Zool. 1979; 208: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is the first step in phenylalanine degradation (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 245-319PubMed Google Scholar, 4Haley C.J. Harper A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and phenylalanine appears to be its primary regulator (5Shiman R. Gray D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4793-4800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shiman R. Benkovic S.J. Blakley R.L. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Pterins. 2.

Since liver is the site of tyrosine degradation as well as formation, the size of the intracellular tyrosine pool and the relative rates of tyrosine synthesis and degradation might be expected to depend, at least in part, on tyrosine concentration. Tyrosine could directly or indirectly (e.g.through the phenylalanine hydroxylase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 245-319PubMed Google Scholar,8Duch D.S. Smith G.K. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 411-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) affect the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation, it could affect the rate of tyrosine degradation, or it could affect the disposition (metabolic routing) of tyrosine in the cell. The mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and all could operate, although a direct effect of tyrosine on phenylalanine hydroxylase has not, so far, been observed either in studies with purified enzyme or in the few in situexperiments that have addressed this question (9Carr F.P. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Historically, studies of regulation of the tyrosine pool have focused on tyrosine degradation, and most of the interest in degradation has been on control of tyrosine aminotransferase which catalyzes the first step in the pathway, de"

The channel found in the sinoatrial node and on atrial myocytes, KACh, is formed from two homologous channel subunits, GIRK1 (KGA or Kir3.1) and GIRK4 (CIR or Kir3.4) (2Kubo Y. Reuveny E.

This channel is activated by the release of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve acting on the m2AChR, as well as by adenosine and other transmitters the receptors of which activate specific G proteins containing the Gαi subunit.

GIRK channels are part of the larger family of inward rectifier K+ channels the members of which have similar subunit topology, two or more membrane spanning domains connected by a pore-forming P loop that dips partially into the membrane. Interestingly, all known GIRK subunits and no other K+ channels (including other inward rectifier K+ channels) have a conserved peptide sequence, arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD), on their proposed extracellular surface between the putative first membrane spanning region and the P region (Fig. 1) (2Kubo Y.

These three amino acids form the recognition sequence for some of the ligands that bind to another class of membrane proteins, integrins (11Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The presence of this amino acid sequence on GIRKs suggests that these channels may directly bind to and be modified by integrins. Integrins are formed from two subunits, α and β, each with a single transmembrane domain. The extracellular portions of each subunit are involved in the recognition and binding to RGD sites on ligands, whereas intracellular portions associate with cytoskeletal proteins; integrins are thus ideally suited for roles in signal transduction, and complexes of intracellular signaling molecules and their activities are found associated with integrins. Their functions are diverse and include cell adhesion, migration, polarity, survival, growth, proliferation, differentiation, and alteration of gene expression (11Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin.

The cycling of integrin to and from the plasma membrane is important to its function in many cells and regulates the function of other molecules that bind to it (15Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R.

Could some actions of GIRK channels in excitable tissues be mediated by interaction with integrin and vice versa? We have begun to address this question by asking whether the function of GIRK channels is affected by a direct binding interaction with integrin. The results reported here address this question. GRGDSP peptide was made at the Biopolymer Synthesis Facility of the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology. The GIRK1 antibody was raised in rabbits against a peptide from the C terminus of rat GIRK1 (23Dascal N. Doupnik C.A. Ivanina T. Bausch S. Wang W. Lin C. Garvey J. Chavkin C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The GIRK4 antibodies were a rabbit antibody against a rat GIRK4 N-terminal peptide (Upstate Biotechnology; no longer available) and a guinea pig antibody against a mouse C-terminal peptide (a generous gift of Dr. Florian Lesage, Institut de Pharmacologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (24Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Fosset M. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28660-28667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). The integrin antibodies included 8C8, a mouse monoclonal anti-Xenopus β1 integrin antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and a rabbit antibody raised against the C terminus of chick β1 integrin (a generous gift of Dr. Richard Hynes, MIT (25Marcantonio E.E. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)). The pan-Trk antibody was TrkC-14, raised in rabbits against the C terminus of human TrkA precursor (Santa Cruz Biotech). The GIRK1 and GIRK4 cDNAs were both cloned into pMXT, a derivative of pBluescript containing β globin sequences known to stabilize transcripts in oocytes (26Silverman S.K. Kofuji P. Dougherty D.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15429-15434Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing a mismatch to these WT DNA templates were designed and used in PCR amplification to generate a mutant cDNA in which the RGD site of the protein was changed to RGE (codons CGG GGC GAA in GIRK1 and CGA GGT GAA in GIRK4). Full-length mutant clones were isolated and screened by dideoxy terminator sequencing. For CHO cell transfection, the WT GIRK4 construct was in pCDNA3; WT GIRK1 and mutant GIRK1 and GIRK4 cDNAs were subcloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Xenopus laevisoocytes were prepared and maintained essentially as described (27Quick M.W. Lester H.A. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 19: 261-279Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RNA was transcribed in vitro (mMessage Machine, Ambion) by T3 or T7 RNA polymerase for the GIRK subunits in pMXT and the m2AChR in pGEM, respectively. For most electrophysiological studies, oocytes were injected with 50 nl containing 1 ng of each of the WT GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunit cRNAs and the m2AChR cRNA in H2O. However, in electrophysiological experiments with the GIRK1*/GIRK4* channel, 10 ng of each GIRK subunit cRNA was injected. For experiments with the GRGDSP peptide, 100 μm peptide was included in the bathing medium just after injection of channel RNA into the oocytes and in all recording solutions. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 1–4 days after injection. For biochemical experiments, oocytes were injected with 5–10 ng of each GIRK subunit cRNA and assayed 2–4 days after injection. For metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, oocytes were injected with 50 nl containing the GIRK cRNAs (5–10 ng/oocyte) as well as 0.25 μCi [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For recording from transfected CHO cells, the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to cotransfect a combination of WT or mutant GIRK1 and GIRK4 and m2AChR (0.5 μg each/35-mm dish) and green fluorescent protein (pGreen Lantern, 0.125 μg/35-mm dish, Life Technologies, Inc.) DNA in serum-free medium, and recording was performed 24 h after transfection (28Ehrengruber M.E. Doupnik C.A. Xu Y. Garvey J. Jasek M.C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7070-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltage clamp recording was performed on X. laevis oocytes using an Axoclamp 2A amplifier (Axon Instruments). Data acquisition, voltage command signals, and analysis were executed using pCLAMP software (Axon). The initial recording solution was a high Na+ solution containing 98 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. To record inward GIRK currents, the solution was changed to either a 98 K+ or a 20 K+ solution similar to the high Na+ except that the NaCl was either fully replaced by KCl or partially replaced by 20 mm KCl. To activate the GIRK currents via the m2AChR, 1 μm ACh was included. In order to block GIRK currents, 300 μm Ba2+ was also included. GIRK currents were recorded using a voltage ramp from −80 to +30 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. Voltage jumps from the −80 mV holding potential to 0 mV and then to −100 mV were also performed in order to examine the activation kinetics of the GIRK channels. Whole cell patch-clamp recording from CHO cells was performed using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments). 3–5 MΩ electrodes were used to form high resistance seals on the cell membranes. The recording pipette solution contained 144 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 4 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm GTP, pH 7.2. Initial recording was performed in an external solution of low K+containing 140 mm NaCl, 30 mmd-glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The 98 K+ solution, with or without 5 μm ACh, was applied from movable tubes near the cell and contained 120 mm NaCl, 30 mmd-glucose, 25 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For coimmunoprecipitation from whole oocytes, 10–30 oocytes were homogenized in 10 μl/oocyte of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% CHAPS, 2 μm aprotinin, 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by 1 min of centrifugation at 16,000 × g, 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by incubation at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. Sepharose was removed by 20 s of centrifugation in a Picofuge (Stratagene). Primary antibody (GIRK1, GIRK4, anti-chick integrin β1, or pan-Trk) and protein G-Sepharose were added to the precleared lysate and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C and pelleted. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer, and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7% polyacrylamide for integrin and 10% for GIRKs). Plasma membranes were separated mechanically, with modifications from a previously described procedure (29Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were incubated for 10 min in ice-cold hypotonic solution (5 mm NaCl, 5 mmHepes, 0.07% SDS, containing protease inhibitors as described above). Plasma membranes together with vitelline membranes (extracellular collagen-like matrix) were removed manually with fine forceps. Six plasma membranes from each group were solubilized in SDS loading sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were separated on 7 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to visualize the integrin and the GIRK channels, respectively (Protean System, Bio-Rad). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized with Western blots or autoradiography in the following manner. For Western blots, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. After blocking, membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature, washed in blocking solution diluted 1:1 with PBS, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution. Proteins were visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Using antibodies from different species for the immunoprecipitation and immunoblot minimized their tendency to obscure the proteins of interest on Western blots of immunoprecipitated proteins. For the same reason, when visualization of immunoprecipitated GIRK proteins expressed in oocytes was desired, [35S]methionine was coinjected to allow for radioactive labeling of the channel proteins during synthesis and autoradiographic visualization of the proteins on nitrocellulose blots. Integrins were not labeled detectably by [35S]methionine because integrins are synthesized throughout oogenesis and before injection of the mRNA-[35S]methionine mixture, in contrast to GIRK1 and GIRK4, which are fully labeled because synthesis occurs only during the 2–4 days after injection of the mRNA-[35S]methionine mixture. Western blots with the 8C8 antibody used nonreducing conditions, because this antibody recognizes the nonreduced form of integrin. We used site-directed mutagenesis to alter the RGD site on both the GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits. The mutations, converting the aspartate to glutamate, change only the size of the amino acid side chains. Thus, they are unlikely to change channel expression or assembly while disrupting the integrin binding site. An asterisk is used to indicate subunits containing the RGE mutation. GIRK1/GIRK4 channel activity was assessed after co-injection of mRNA for the m2AChR, GIRK1, and GIRK4 into X. laevis oocytes. GIRK current was elicited with 1 μmACh, which stimulates the expressed m2AChR, activating endogenous Gi to liberate Gβγ, which in turn activates the expressed GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromultimeric channels. In Figs.2 and3 a, the ACh-evoked GIRK currents from various combinations of mutant and WT GIRK subunits are compared. Similar quantities of RNA were coinjected into the oocytes, except for the GIRK1*/GIRK4* construct, which had 10-fold more RNA, in the following combinations: GIRK1/GIRK4, GIRK1*/GIRK4, GIRK1/GIRK4*, and GIRK1*/GIRK4*. Recordings were made 2 days after injection. The data show that the GIRK1*/GIRK4, GIRK1/GIRK4*, and double mutant GIRK1*/GIRK4* combinations produced <25%, <10%, and <2% the current of WT channels, respectively (currents at −80 mV are directly compared in Figs. 2 a and 3 a). The amount of GIRK1*/GIRK4 current continued to increase on days 3 and 4 after injection and reached levels comparable to those measured on day 1 or 2 for WT channels. In contrast, after waiting several more days for expression, we never observed large currents from the GIRK1/GIRK4* or the double mutant channels. GIRK channels display activation in the absence of agonists in heterologous expression systems; these basal currents were decreased to the same extent as the ACh-evoked currents (Fig. 2 a). Even injecting larger quantities of RNA for mutant subunits (shown in Figs. 2 and 3 a for the GIRK1*/GIRK4* mutant) or injecting Gβ1γ2 mRNA directly (2Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 30Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (data not shown) did not rescue channel function. No obvious difference in the extent of inward rectification or voltage-jump kinetics of the currents was observed for mutant subunits (Fig. 2, b andc). These data show that mutation of the RGD site on the channel to RGE disrupts GIRK currents in oocytes, consistent with the idea that the channel and endogenous oocyte integrin interact. The GIRK4 subunit, furthermore, seems to have a more important role in this interaction than the GIRK1 subunit. Interestingly, although integrin commonly interacts with ligands such as extracellular matrix proteins or with molecules found on other cells, the interaction of integrin with the GIRK channel seems to be occurring on the same cell (11Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Figure 3Direct comparison of ACh-evoked mean currents ± S.E. for WT and RGD→RGE mutated GIRK channels. a, currents from oocytes measured at −80 mV; eachcolumn represents measurements from 4 or 5 oocytes as described in Fig. 2. b, currents from CHO cells measured at −120 mV 24 h after transfection for the m2AChR and for various combinations of WT and mutant GIRK subunits (0.5 μg of DNA from each construct/dish). Each column represents measurements from 3–5 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) WT and mutant channels were also expressed in CHO cells, which, unlike oocytes, express no endogenous GIRK subunits (31Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with DNA for the channel, m2AChR, and green fluorescent protein, which provided a visual indicator of cotransfected cells. ACh-evoked currents were compared beginning 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3 b). In the CHO cells, the GIRK1*/GIRK4 construct expressed as well as did the WT construct. Strikingly, any construct containing the GIRK4* subunit, either as GIRK1/GIRK4* or GIRK1*/GIRK4*, gave no detectable current. Thus, the relative importance of the GIRK4 subunit in the possible interaction of GIRK and integrin is revealed more dramatically by expression in the CHO cell system. Externally applied RGD-containing peptides are often used to compete for an interaction of integrin with its ligand, disrupting integrin activity and thus implicating a role for integrin in various cellular phenomena (20Chen B.-M. Grinnell A.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1578-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Arcangeli A. Bechetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. De Filippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M.R. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We performed similar experiments with expressed GIRK channels. GIRK activity was again observed after co-injection of mRNA for the m2AChR, GIRK1, and GIRK4 into X. laevis oocytes. In Fig.4, ACh-evoked GIRK currents from oocytes incubated in the absence or presence of 100 μm GRGDSP were compared 1 day after RNA injection. Peptide was added to the oocyte bathing medium immediately following RNA injection and was included in all of the recording solutions. Desensitization was measured as the fractional ACh induced current remaining 5 min after the peak current. The peptide produced no dramatic change in the peak amplitude (Fig. 4 a) or desensitization (Fig. 4 b) of ACh-evoked currents. That the GIRK channel binds to integrin is consistent with the mutagenesis studies described above (Figs. 2 and 3), but the lack of RGD peptide effects produced no further evidence for a direct interaction. The lack of effect with the RGD-containing peptide does not rule out an interaction between GIRKs and integrins, because the peptide may not be able to access the GIRK-integrin binding site or may not form a structure that competes effectively for a GIRK-integrin interaction. We initiated a series of studies to co-immunoprecipitate the channel and endogenous integrin from detergent-solubilized whole oocytes, with detection by Western blots and by autoradiography for the GIRK channels labeled radioactively during expression in oocytes. Fig.5, a and b, shows that the GIRK channel and integrin were co-immunoprecipitated from oocytes with antibodies specific for either protein. An anti-chick integrin antibody, against a highly conserved portion of the integrin β1 subunit, immunoprecipitated the radiolabeled WT GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits, as did the anti-GIRK1 antibody (Fig. 5 a, autoradiogram). Data from cells expressing either the GIRK1 or GIRK4 subunit (immunoprecipitated with the anti-GIRK1 and GIRK4 antibodies, respectively) confirm that the GIRK1 protein runs as a doublet of about 56–58 kDa and that the GIRK4 protein runs as a major band of about 45 kDa. Western blots performed with an anti-Xenopus β1 integrin antibody revealed that the anti-GIRK1 antibody immunoprecipitated the endogenous oocyte integrin from cells expressing both WT GIRK subunits, as did the anti-chick integrin antibody (Fig.5 b, immunoblot). Integrin β1 runs as a doublet due to differentially glycosylated forms (32Gawantka V. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Hausen P. Development. 1992; 115: 595-605PubMed Google Scholar). A control antibody that binds to neither integrin nor the channel, pan-Trk, immunoprecipitated neither the channel nor integrin, ruling out the possibility that these proteins bound nonspecifically to the Sepharose used during immunoprecipitation. These studies show directly that GIRK and integrin do bind to each other when the channel is expressed in heterologous cells. We performed similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the mutant GIRK subunits expressed in oocytes. If these mutations disrupt the binding of integrin to the GIRK channel, we would expect that the mutant channels and integrin would not co-immunoprecipitate. As shown in Fig. 5 a, although the anti-chick integrin antibody immunoprecipitated both coexpressed WT GIRK channel subunits, it did not precipitate either subunit of the GIRK1*/GIRK4* channel. Correspondingly, Fig. 5 b demonstrates that although the anti-GIRK1 antibody immunoprecipitated the integrin from cells expressing WT channels, it did not immunoprecipitate integrin from cells expressing the double mutant channels. As expected, the binding of the mutant channel to integrin appears to be disrupted, and this disruption apparently eliminates its ACh-activated current. Fig. 6,a and b, shows a comparison of the oocyte expression levels of GIRK channels composed of mutant versusWT subunits. After the oocyte was lysed, channel subunits were detected by Western analysis with antibodies specific to GIRK1 and GIRK4 (Fig.6, a and b, respectively). When WT or mutant subunits were expressed in oocytes, the total amount of each channel subunit protein was similar. Although roughly equal total amounts of protein were expressed for each channel combination, we found that less mutant channel protein reached the plasma membrane. The immunoblots in Fig. 6, c andd, compare the GIRK1 and GIRK4 channel subunit protein contained in manually isolated (29Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) plasma membranes of oocytes expressing WT and various mutant GIRK combinations. When either WT GIRK subunit was replaced by a mutated subunit, less GIRK1 (Fig.6 c) or GIRK4 (Fig. 6 d) subunit reached the plasma membrane, even though the total cellular expression levels of the mutant proteins are the same as WT. The diminution in plasma membrane expression was greatest when both GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits were replaced by the mutated subunit and was particularly striking for the more slowly migrating band corresponding to the glycosylated GIRK protein. In other experiments not shown, we injected oocytes with [35S]methionine as they expressed normal and double mutant GIRK channels, manually isolated the membranes, and used the GIRK1 antibody to immunoprecipitate the GIRK channel protein. We measured >3-fold and >10-fold less radioactivity in the unglycosylated and glycosylated bands, respectively, for the double mutant GIRK channels. Interestingly, when we purified a plasma membrane fraction by isolating various pools of oocyte membranes from a total membrane preparation on sucrose gradients (33Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sengelov H. Kjeldsen L. Kroeze W. Berger M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 804-810PubMed Google Scholar), we observed no difference in the amount of mutant and WT channel protein, possibly because the mutant GIRK proteins may reach a vesicle pool that cofractionates with the plasma membrane. The data presented here support the idea that the GIRK channel binds to integrin directly, that mutation of the integrin recognition site on the channel eliminates this binding, and that without this binding, the GIRK current decreases or is eliminated. Evidence for this view is provided by the observations that GIRK RGD → RGE mutants have disrupted function and that WT but not RGD → RGE mutants co-immunoprecipitate from total oocyte lysate. Expression of the mutant channel protein is comparable to that of WT, but decreased quantities of mutant GIRK protein reach the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). Most likely, the decreased quantity of mutant channel protein in the plasma membrane explains most if not all of the decreased current for mutant-containing constructs. The RGD → RGE mutation preserves the charge of the native amino acid and is thus unlikely to cause a major disruption of protein folding or membrane insertion. Recent atomic-scale crystallographic data on aStreptomyces lividans K+ channel suggest that this region of the channel is part of an extracellular “turret” on the channel (35Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5648) Google Scholar), conceivably poised to interact with the extracellular domain of an integrin molecule. Although such a mutation would be expected to destroy function if the aspartate residue interacts directly with permeant K+ ions, the structural data also argue against this possibility. Interestingly, although the RGD sequence is preserved in GIRK channels, it diverges slightly in other inward rectifiers, often forming an HGD motif, but the aspartate residue of the motif is well conserved throughout the family of inward rectifiers. The residue is clearly important in Kir1.1 (ROMK1), for instance, because an aspartate-to-histidine mutation produces a nonfunctional channel in one allele of Bartter syndrome (36Derst C. Konrad M. Kockerling A. Karolyi L. Deschenes G. Daut J. Karschin A. Seyberth H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This conservation is consistent with the idea that other inward rectifiers may also interact with integrin, a notion that we will explore in the future. We suggest that integrin plays a role in the insertion, degradation, or stability of GIRK proteins in the plasma membrane. Perhaps the plasma membrane expression of the RGD → RGE GIRK mutant subunits decreased because the mutant subunits cannot bind to integrin in internal membrane compartments. If the GIRK-integrin interaction is in an intracellular compartment, this explains how WT channel function is not altered by incubation with externally applied, RGD-containing peptides. Integrins themselves cycle in and out of the plasma membranes of neutrophils, and this system is stimulated by chemical signals in a Ca2+-dependent manner, allowing changes in the migration behavior of these cells (15Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 37Sengelov H. Kjeldsen L. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Borregaard N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 38Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Anderson H.C. Kishimoto T.K. Bainton D.F. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Integrin receptors in the plasma membrane of fibroblasts are also regulated; their stability in the membrane requires the transmission of adhesion-dependent signals (39Dalton S.L. Scharf E. Briesewitz R. Marcantonio E.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence exists that integrin regulates the localization of other proteins. For example, integrin mediates the internalization of adenovirus by binding the virus, which is then endocytosed along with integrin (17Li E. Stupack D. Klemke R. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of vitronectin is also regulated by integrin in a similar manner, requiring the prior activation of protein kinase C (16Panetti T.S. Wilcox S.A. Horzempa C. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18593-18597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,40Memmo L.M. McKeown-Longo P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 425-433PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins, particularly those including the integrin β1 subunit that binds with GIRK in our experiments, are associated with the cytoskeleton via direct interactions with talin, paxillin, tensin, and possibly other cytoskeletal proteins (12Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Therefore, the integrin-GIRK interaction may link the channel to the cytoskeleton. Several other channels have links to the cytoskeleton (41Srinivasan Y. Elmer L. Davis J. Bennett V. Angelides K. Nature. 1988; 333: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 42Sheng M.

Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), and previous studies show that the actin cytoskeleton helps to stabilize some inward rectifiers (48Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mechanical stress, presumably transmitted via cytoskeletal elements, affects both the integrin-mediated transduction pathway (49Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and GIRK activation (50Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is also possible that integrin may mediate intracellular signals that regulate GIRK plasma membrane localization. Integrin intracellular signaling has been associated with tyrosine kinases, including src and focal adhesion kinase, and small GTPases, especially rho. Many of these signaling molecules are associated with integrin in signaling complexes, which are in turn ultimately linked to the cytoskeleton. Focal adhesion kinase also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, of interest considering that phosphoinositides may be required for GIRK activation (51Huang C.-L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 52Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated signaling has also been associated with gene activation and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (12Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that one of these transduction pathways also modifies GIRK localization by either modifying its exocytosis, stability in the plasma membrane, or endocytosis. It is not yet known whether the possible direct interaction between GIRK channels and integrin affects signaling by integrin itself via one the signal transduction pathways associated with the C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of the integrin molecule. Neurite formation in neuroblastoma cell lines has been associated with integrin, with the activation of an inward rectifier K+ channel, and with tyrosine phosphorylation (22Arcangeli A. Bechetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. De Filippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M.R. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 53Bianchi L. Arcangeli A. Bartolini P. Mugnai G. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mechanosensitive processes, including stretch-induced release of neurotransmitter (20Chen B.-M. Grinnell A.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1578-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), have also been associated with integrin function. GIRK channels are mechanosensitive (50Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that GIRK and integrin may simultaneously be involved in mechanosensitive processes. Further studies may reveal details of the mechanism and physiological relevance of the GIRK-integrin interaction suggested by our data. We thank M. Jasek for help with CHO cells; T.

https://openalex.org/W2019335418,"Recently, we developed a covalent antithrombin-heparin complex (ATH) as a possible treatment for respiratory distress syndrome. ATH reacted rapidly with thrombin and efficiently catalyzed the inhibition of either thrombin or factor Xa by exogenous antithrombin. In order to investigate mechanisms for the conjugate's unusual anticoagulant properties, changes in fluorescence due to covalent linkage or addition of exogenous antithrombin were studied in relation to reaction with thrombin derivatives or factor Xa. The emission spectrum of ATH was similar to that of antithrombin plus heparin mixtures. ATH quickly inhibited thrombin or factor Xa activities, as measured by a fluorogenic substrate. Fluorescein-labeled heparin was displaced from either thrombin or active site blocked thrombin by ATH, indicating that thrombin must bind to the conjugate's heparin moiety. Interaction of thrombin with ATH's heparin component was confirmed by a slow reaction rate of conjugate with a thrombin mutant that has weak heparin binding. Total intrinsic fluorescence increased when exogenous antithrombin was added to ATH, indicating that the catalytic mechanism may occur through a second inhibitor binding site. Thus, ATH reacts directly with thrombin through a bridge mechanism and probably catalyzes the reaction of thrombin with antithrombin by a second binding sequence on its heparin chain.

We have recently prepared a covalent conjugate of human antithrombin (AT) 1The abbreviations used are: AT, antithrombin; SH, standard heparin; ATH, covalent antithrombin-heparin complex; FXa, factor Xa; FPR-thrombin, phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-thrombin; AFC-67, methyl-O-succinyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin. 1The abbreviations used are: AT, antithrombin; SH, standard heparin; ATH, covalent antithrombin-heparin complex; FXa, factor Xa; FPR-thrombin, phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-thrombin; AFC-67, methyl-O-succinyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin.and standard heparin (SH) called ATH (1Chan A.

The rationale for ATH synthesis was to construct an AT derivative that would have a sustained, increased antithrombotic activity and could be retained in the lung as a treatment for coagulation associated with respiratory distress syndrome. ATH was produced by incubation of AT plus SH, and the resultant complex was characterized by both an extremely fast reactivity with thrombin as well as an unexpected ability to catalyze the inhibition of thrombin by exogenous AT (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Experiments, using a rabbit jugular vein thrombosis treatment model, have shown that ATH also has greater antithrombotic activity in vivo than that of AT plus SH mixtures. 2Chan, A. K. C., Berry, L., Klement, P., Julian, J., Mitchell, L., Weitz, J., Hirsh, J., and Andrew, M. (1998)Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis, in press. 2Chan, A. K. C., Berry, L., Klement, P., Julian, J., Mitchell, L., Weitz, J., Hirsh, J., and Andrew, M. (1998)Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis, in press. The superior antithrombotic activity of ATH was achieved without a significant increase in hemorrhagic side effects, compared with the bleeding observed with SH at similar plasma activity levels.2 In addition, instillation of ATH in the rabbit lung led to high anti-factor Xa (FXa) activities in lavage fluid taken up to 48 h after instillation with no significant activity appearing systemically (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Inhibition of plasma thrombin generation on fetal distal lung epithelium by ATH was superior to that by AT plus SH (2Chan A.K.C. Berry B. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. O'Brodovich H. Andrew M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L914-L921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ATH has several of the properties required to potentially reduce the fibrin accretion that occurs during lung damage. Given that the rate for direct (noncatalytic) reaction of thrombin with ATH was ∼10 times faster than the reaction of thrombin with SH plus saturating amounts of AT (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), there was uncertainty whether direct thrombin inhibition by covalently linked AT and heparin followed the same mechanism as that of the noncovalent AT·SH complex. Covalent linkage of AT and heparin obviates the binding of inhibitor and catalyst, which is the rate-determining step in the reaction with thrombin (3Pletcher C.H. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5342-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, due to the fact that the reactive site of the AT in ATH is permanently activated by bound heparin (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is possible that interaction of thrombin with the ATH heparin chain may not be critical for increased reaction velocity. However, the heparin moiety in ATH may have increased negative charge density compared with SH, since heparin's anticoagulant activity is increased with greater sulfonation (4Ofosu F.A. Modi G.J. Blajchman M.A. Buchanan M.R. Johnson E.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More negatively charged heparin chains would more readily attract thrombin, since thrombin binding to glycosaminoglycans is charge-dependent (5Petersen L.C. Jorgensen M. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Catalytic activity of ATH for inhibition of thrombin by exogenous AT has been shown to be approximately 4 and 2 times greater than the corresponding activities for SH and heparin with high affinity for AT, respectively (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Catalysis of thrombin inhibition by heparin is known to require the binding of AT to a specific heparin pentasaccharide sequence (6Mille B. Watton J. Barrowcliffe T.W. Mani J. Lane D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29435-29443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After reaction with thrombin, the AT-thrombin inhibitor complex is released from the glycosaminoglycan chain so that the heparin molecule can bind another AT for thrombin inhibition. The exceptional catalytic activity of ATH was surprising due to the fact that the covalently linked AT cannot dissociate from the complex after reacting with thrombin. One possible explanation is that after direct reaction of ATH with thrombin, the noncovalent interactions of AT and heparin components in the conjugate may decrease, allowing the AT to freely rotate while still being covalently attached to the glycosaminoglycan chain. Thus, complexing with thrombin may result in allosteric effects that lower the noncovalent affinity between ATH's AT and heparin units, which would cause the pentasaccharide binding site to be available for catalysis of exogenous AT molecules. However, steric hindrance may prevent the approach of exogenous AT toward the pentasaccharide binding site for the covalently linked AT in ATH. Also, ATH may contain a second pentasaccharide, which could be responsible for catalyzing the thrombin plus AT reaction (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In order to further develop ATH as a therapeutic agent, a clear understanding of its anticoagulant properties is required. Previously, Olson and Shore (7Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that there is an increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of AT when it binds to the pentasaccharide sites on heparin. In addition, the emission intensity of fluorescein-labeled heparin changes, dependent on whether it is bound to macromolecules such as thrombin. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of both the direct and catalytic anti-thrombin activities of ATH using differential fluorescence and molecular filtration techniques. All chemicals were of analytical grade. The AT used in all experiments was human AT from Bayer (Mississauga, Canada). Heparin was either grade I-A, sodium salt, standard heparin (209 anti-factor Xa units/mg, obtained from porcine intestinal mucosa), from Sigma (Mississauga, Canada) or 18,000 molecular weight heparin (sodium salt, 212 anti-factor Xa units/mg, from porcine intestinal mucosa) from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The average molecular weights (determined by gel filtration) of SH, heparin from Alexis Biochemicals, and heparin isolated after protease treatment of ATH were 15,000, 18,000, and 18,000, respectively. ATH was prepared, as described previously (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), by incubation of AT and SH at 40 °C in pH 7.3 buffer, followed by purification on butyl-agarose and DEAE-Sepharose fast flow. The 18,000 molecular weight heparin was labeled with fluorescein by incubating 50 μl of 100 mg of fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma)/ml of dimethyl sulfoxide with 10 mg of heparin dissolved in 300 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.8, at 37 °C for 18 h, followed by neutralization of excess reagent with 10 μl of 1 m NH4Cl, pH 7.0, and gel filtration on a PD-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) Sephadex G-25 column in H2O to separate the products. Thrombin and FXa were both from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN), while phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-thrombin (FPR-thrombin; active site-blocked thrombin) was prepared by reaction of thrombin with d-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem). A thrombin mutant (R93) with substitution of alanine at Arg93, Arg97, and Arg101(8Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. Charles Esmon (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oklahoma City, OK). Substrate methyl-O-succinyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (AFC-67) was from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). The general protease P-5147, protamine sulfate, and polybrene were from Sigma, while DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephadex G-200 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 125I-Labeled AT was prepared using Na125I (NEN Life Science Products, Guelph, Canada) and Chloramine T (BDH, Toronto, Canada) (9Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar). All fluorometric determinations were made, with stirring, in 1 × 1-cm quartz fluorescence cuvettes, in a cuvette chamber heated at 25 °C, using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Experiments were carried out in 0.02m Tris·HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (except for spectral scans, which were run in 0.02 m phosphate 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4). Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of proteins were performed using excitation at 280 nm and (except for spectral scans) emission measurements at 340 nm (using a 290-nm filter). For reactions with AFC-67, excitation was at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm, while excitation was at 492 nm and emission at 522 nm in experiments using fluorescein-labeled heparin. All slit widths were 5 nm. The second order rate constants for inhibition of thrombin and FXa by ATH were determined. Thrombin (final concentration 2 nm) or FXa (final concentration 1 nm) was added, with rapid mixing (500–1000 rpm), to a fluorescence cuvette containing AFC-67 (final concentration 50 μm) and either ATH (final concentration 10 nm) or AT (final concentration 200 or 100 nm for thrombin or FXa, respectively) in 0.02m Tris·HCl 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, to make a total volume of 2000 μl. Fluorescence intensity due to the fluorophore released by substrate cleavage was monitored every 0.5 s. Fluorescence versus time was plotted in order to determine the progressive enzyme inhibition. Curves were fitted to the data using the following equation: fluorescence intensity =v f · t + (v o − v f)·(1 −e −k′·t)/k′, wherev f represents final steady-state rate,v o is the initial rate, k′ is the apparent rate constant for the change from v o tov f, and t is time in minutes (10Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Division of the apparent rate constant (k[app]) for enzyme inhibition by the inhibitor concentration gave the second order rate constant (k 2) for the reaction. In some reactions, SH was included in the inhibitor solution, prior to enzyme addition, at a final concentration of 0.06–6000 μg/ml. Similar experiments were performed with R93 (final reaction concentration = 2 nm). The interactions between various AT and heparin derivatives were investigated in order to further characterize the mechanisms for direct thrombin inhibition by ATH. Previous workers have demonstrated that the intrinsic fluorescence of AT is increased when noncovalently bound to heparin (7Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of protamine sulfate or polybrene addition on the interaction between AT and heparin in ATH or AT + SH mixtures (with or without the presence of FPR-thrombin) was determined by monitoring changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence (340 nm). Alternatively, fluorescein-labeled heparin (molecular weight 18,000) was mixed with either thrombin or FPR-thrombin, and the increase in emission from the fluorophore, due to decreased thrombin binding, was measured after addition of excess ATH or free heparin. Use of molecular weight 18,000 heparin was appropriate, given that it was previously determined that heparin chains in ATH are slightly longer than those of SH (∼18,000versus 15,000 molecular weight (1Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Examination of possible mechanisms for ATH's catalytic activities involved determination of the modes in which exogenous AT could bind to the conjugate. A mixture of 125I-AT plus excess ATH was gel-filtered on a Sephadex G-200 column (2.6-cm internal diameter × 46-cm height) in 0.15 m NaCl in order to determine if noncovalent 125I-AT·ATH complexes could form. To further evaluate AT binding to ATH, excess AT was added to ATH, and the resultant fluorescence was compared with the sum of emissions from similar quantities of AT and ATH to determine any net increase in fluorescence. Using the value for the increase in nmfluorescence of AT, when saturated with SH, the amount of AT bound to excess AT binding sites on ATH could be calculated. In order to characterize noncovalent AT binding sites on the heparin in ATH, the protein was removed from the ATH glycosaminoglycan chains. One ml of ATH (6.91 mg of AT, 1.76 mg of heparin) in 0.02 mphosphate 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3 (phosphate-buffered saline), plus 2 mg of P-5147 protease in 1.2 ml of 0.5 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, were heated in a sealed tube at 37 °C for 24 h, followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of 10 mg of P-5147/ml of 0.5m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, every 24 h up to a total time of 96 h. After dialysis against 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, the reaction mixture was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (15 ml of beads) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing the column with 0.01 m Tris·HCl, 0.25 m NaCl, pH 8.0, heparin was eluted with 0.01 m Tris·HCl, 2.0m NaCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated by pressure dialysis (under N2) versus 0.15 m NaCl. Heparin concentrate was gel-filtered on a 2.6-cm (diameter) × 46-cm (height) Sephadex G-200 column in 2 m NaCl, with heparin containing fractions being pooled and pressure-dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The final heparin isolated from ATH was free of AT and contaminating protease, as judged by alcian blue (for heparin) and Coomassie Blue (for protein) staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar). The capacity of the heparin from ATH to bind AT was compared with that for SH and 18,000 molecular weight heparin by measuring the increase in AT fluorescence (due to association with the heparin) when the protein was added to a known amount of glycosaminoglycan. In addition, either SH or heparin prepared from ATH was mixed with excess AT, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in 0.15 m NaCl. AT present in the collected fractions was determined by absorbance measurements at 215 nm, and the proportion of AT bound to heparin (peaks higher in molecular weight than that of free AT) was calculated. Given the number of moles of heparin combined with AT prior to gel filtration, the number of molecules of AT bound per heparin molecule could be estimated. Analysis of fractions (by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by alcian blue staining for glycosaminoglycan) from some of the Sephadex G-200 chromatographies was used to confirm recovery of heparin during gel filtration. Conformational changes in AT due to covalently bound heparin were assessed by comparing the emission properties of ATH to AT when each was excited at 280 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence of the AT component of ATH (nM fluorescence at 340 nm = 5.06) was elevated by 29% compared with native AT (nM fluorescence at 340 nm = 3.91). To determine if the difference in fluorescence intensities of ATH and AT was due to heparin binding, both AT-containing compounds were titrated with heparin. The addition of heparin to AT solution caused an increase in fluorescence (33%), which reached a maximum value slightly greater than that of ATH (Fig. 1). In contrast, the addition of heparin to ATH had no significant effect on fluorescence intensity. Since changes in topology of proteins can be more clearly determined by analyzing a variety of unsaturated residues (which emit at different wavelengths), the spectra of both ATH and AT, with or without added heparin, were obtained. As observed in the single wavelength measurements, the intensity of the fluorescence scan of ATH was greater than the scan of AT (Fig. 2). No difference in emission from 310–360 nm was detected for ATH compared with ATH plus added heparin. However, a dramatic increase in the fluorescence of AT was seen when combined with heparin. Interestingly, although the profiles of the emission spectra of ATH and AT plus heparin matched from λmax (340.5 nm) up to higher wavelengths, there was an increasing divergence from 325 to 310 nm (Fig. 2). Thus, even in the presence of heparin, the fluorescence intensity of AT was slightly decreased at the shorter wavelengths compared with ATH.Figure 2Fluorescence spectra of covalent antithrombin-heparin complex and antithrombin with or without added heparin. Fluorescence spectra (excitation = 280 nm; 6-nm slit widths; 290-nm filter) of 100 nm ATH (thin solid line), 100 nm AT (dotted line), 100 nm ATH plus 2 μm SH (dashed line), and 100 nm AT plus 2 μm SH (thick solid line) were each obtained in 0.02m phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rates of thrombin or FXa inhibition by either ATH or AT were determined. Results are shown in Table I. The second order rate constant for reaction of thrombin with ATH was 5000 and 4 times faster than for reaction with AT and AT plus heparin, respectively. The inclusion of exogenous heparin in reactions with thrombin plus ATH caused a significant decrease in the reaction velocity (Table I). In contrast, the second order rate constants for reaction of FXa with either ATH or AT plus heparin were comparable. Also, in the case of either ATH or AT, reactions with FXa were not inhibited by exogenous heparin at concentrations up to 40 μm (600 μg/ml, Table I). Inhibition of the FXa reaction with ATH or AT was only observed with very concentrated heparin solutions (0.4 mm).Table IInhibition of thrombin or factor Xa by either covalent antithrombin-heparin complex or antithrombin plus heparin mixturesExogenous [Heparin]k 2 for IIaaIIa, thrombin. + ATHk 2 for IIa + ATk 2 for Xa + ATHk 2 for Xa + ATμg/mlm−1min−1m−1min−1m−1min−1m−1 min−103.0 × 1096.0 × 1052.3 × 1089.9 × 1050.06NDbND, not determined.5.5 × 107ND7.0 × 1060.62.8 × 1096.0 × 1082.4 × 1085.1 × 10762.6 × 1097.3 × 1082.2 × 1081.6 × 108604.8 × 1082.4 × 1082.3 × 1082.1 × 1086006.8 × 1073.1 × 1071.7 × 1082.1 × 10860006.0 × 106ND2.5 × 107NDEnzymes (1–2 nm) were rapidly mixed with solutions containing inhibitors (≥10 nm) and the fluorogenic substrate AFC-67 under pseudo-first order conditions.

Since reaction of thrombin with ATH was significantly faster than the corresponding reaction of thrombin with AT + heparin (3 × 109 ± 0.5 × 109m−1 min−1 versus7 × 108 ± 0.7 × 108m−1 min−1; t test,p < 0.01), a number of experiments were performed to determine the relative importance of ATH's protein and glycosaminoglycan components. The addition of either protamine or polybrene (both of which bind to negatively charged heparin chains) to either ATH or AT plus heparin caused a reduction in the intrinsic fluorescence to levels that approached that of AT alone (Table II). These results indicated that a strong positively charged species could interfere with the noncovalent interactions between the heparin component in ATH and its endogenous AT moiety. Only the noncovalent binding of heparin and AT in ATH was affected, since native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of ATH plus protamine showed that ATH and the polycation migrated, slowly, as one large complex, without the release of AT (data not shown). Similarly, interaction between AT and heparin in either ATH or AT plus heparin mixtures bound to FPR-thrombin (active site-blocked thrombin) was decreased by polybrene, as shown by the characteristic drop in intrinsic fluorescence (Table II). The importance of binding of thrombin to the heparin constituent of ATH, during inhibition, was evaluated by competitive binding studies and using thrombin derivatives. Results are given in Table III. Both ATH and heparin were capable of displacing fluorescein-labeled heparin from active α-thrombin. This was evident because the decrease in fluorescence due to binding of labeled heparin by thrombin was partly reversed upon the addition of ATH or heparin (Table III). Removal of the fluorescein-heparin by ATH was due to competition for thrombin's heparin binding site and did not require reaction of thrombin with ATH's AT component, because a similar displacement of labeled heparin from FPR-thrombin could be achieved with ATH (Table III). Percentage reversals of the decrease in fluorescence of fluorescein-heparin, resulting from interaction with thrombin, by ATH (60 ± 3%) or heparin (71 ± 3%) were similar (p = 0.16, Student's t test). The reversal of fluorescein-heparin fluorescence reduction, due to FPR-thrombin binding, by ATH (59 ± 3%) compared with heparin (68 ± 2%) was also similar (p = 0.15). Further confirmation that interaction of thrombin with the ATH heparin moiety was important for inhibition was obtained from experiments with a thrombin derivative (R93) that had reduced binding to heparin due to a mutation at its anion binding exosite 2 (8Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second order rate constant for R93 reaction with ATH was calculated to be ∼100 times slower than that for reaction with native α-thrombin (2.6 × 107m−1 min−1, compared with 3.0 × 109m−1min−1 (Table I) for native thrombin).Table IIEffect of polybrene on the interaction of antithrombin and heparin in covalent antithrombin-heparin complex bound to active site-blocked thrombinComponents in solutionIntrinsic fluorescence intensityATH295ATH + FPR-IIa795ATH + FPR-IIa + PB730AT173AT + SH246AT + SH + FPR-IIa720AT + SH + FPR-IIa + PB635SH0PB0ATH + PB172AT + SH + PB173ATH + PS180AT + SH + PS173The effect of polybrene (PB) on noncovalent binding of the AT and heparin components of ATH or mixtures of AT plus SH, in the presence of active site-blocked thrombin (FPR-IIa), was determined by measuring intrinsic fluorescence (excitation/emission = 280/340 nm; slit widths = 2 nm). Elevated fluorescence due to heparin binding by AT was decreased with polybrene, indicative that noncovalent AT-heparin interactions were reduced.

Increased fluorescence of labeled heparin indicated interference with binding to the thrombin species. The concentrations of labeled heparin, thrombin, active site-blocked thrombin, ATH, and heparin used in the experiments were 50, 100, 100, 623, and 1988 nm, respectively.

Clear evidence for the existence of a second mammalian glycogenin-like species came from cDNA cloning (15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

Skurat A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 289-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these were used as probes to clone cDNAs corresponding to several alternatively spliced isoforms of what was termed glycogenin-2 (15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); the original muscle protein can be designated glycogenin-1 when necessary. Three different liver cDNAs were isolated that encode glycogenin-2α, -β, and -γ, species that differ in splicing at the NH2 terminus of the protein. By Northern analysis, messenger RNA hybridizing to a glycogenin-2 probe was most abundant in liver and heart with a lesser amount in pancreas. Recombinant glycogenin-2 had the biochemical properties expected of a glycogenin (15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results were intriguing and suggested that glycogenin-2 could have a role in liver glycogen metabolism. In the present paper, we describe further characterization of glycogenin-2, demonstrating its presence in human liver samples. Unlike glycogenin-1, stable overexpression of glycogenin-2 in Rat-1 fibroblasts results in a significant increase in glycogen accumulation in the cell, one of the first pieces of evidence for an active role of any glycogenin in the control of glycogen deposition. RD-ES cells, which are derived from human Ewing's sarcoma, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and 25 mm glucose. To test the effect of glucose on glycogenin-2, 80% confluent cells were switched to DMEM without glucose and cultured for 24 h before being assayed or refed with medium with 25 mm glucose for several hours. Cells harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were frozen in liquid nitrogenm and thawed cells were homogenized by repeated pipetting. A 16,000 ×g supernatant was obtained and glycogenin-2 signals detected by Western analysis as described previously (15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To study the interaction between glycogenin-2 and glycogenin-1, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-glycogenin antibodies followed by in vitro self-glucosylation assay under conditions described in the next paragraph. Frozen human livers obtained at autopsy were kindly provided by Dr. William F. Bosron, Indiana University School of Medicine. For Western analysis and glycogen preparation, frozen liver samples were homogenized by Polytron in 5 volumes of lysis buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were filtered through four layers of cheesecloth before being centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in the same volume as the supernatants, and both fractions were analyzed by Western analysis. Prior to immunoblot analysis, some samples were digested with 80 μg/ml α-amylase (Worthington) for 5 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2. To purify glycogen, 10% cold trichloroacetic acid was mixed with liver homogenates. After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g, a clear supernatant was obtained and was added to 4 volumes of cold ethanol to precipitate glycogen. Glycogen was collected by another 10-min 12,000 × g centrifugation. The glycogen pellet was washed twice with ethanol and resuspended in lysis buffer (to one third of the original volume) after being air-dried. Twenty μl of glycogen sample were subjected to Western analysis after α-amylase treatment. To immunoprecipitate glycogenin-1 or glycogenin-2 from liver samples, 1 ml of a 12,000 × g supernatant was first treated with α-amylase (80 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with the corresponding antibodies (1:1000 dilution) on ice for 1 h. Protein A-agarose (20 μl) was then added and samples rocked on a Nutator at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were washed first with 1 ml of buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.3 m NaCl and then with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1m NaCl. The resulting pellets were analyzed further. Where desired, immunoprecipitates were allowed to self-glucosylate for 30 min with 77 μm UDP-[U-14C]glucose (specific activity 265 mCi/mmol) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, at 30 °C. RT-PCR was used to analyze glycogenin-2 transcripts. RNA extraction from frozen human liver was performed using Tri Reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, liver samples were homogenized by Polytron in 10 volumes of Tri Reagent. After mixing with chloroform (0.2 volume of Tri Reagent) and centrifugation, the aqueous phase containing RNA was transferred to a new tube and precipitated with isopropanol (0.5 volume of Tri Reagent). The pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol and air-dried before being resuspended in water. For RT-PCR, 10 μg of total RNA was used for first strand synthesis utilizing the Superscript II reverse transcriptase system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The oligonucleotides used for first strand cDNA synthesis were CCCTTACTTTGTATGTTGGCAGTC and TTCTGTCAACGCTCTAGG. Two μl of product from the first stand reaction were used as a template for the following PCR, which was performed utilizing Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). To detect the presence of different NH2-terminally spliced glycogenin-2 isoforms, PCR reactions were conducted using primers straddling the splicing region: CGGCGCCACTGACCATGTC (+) and TTGGTGAGGGTGAGCCCGAG (−). Glycogenin-2 cDNA clones provided control templates to generate RT-PCR products corresponding to the different splice variants. The PCR conditions used were denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing at 57 °C for 1 min, followed by a 2-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate residues in glycogenin-2 with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pcDNA3-glycogenin-2β as a template. The mutagenic oligonucleotides for Y196F were: GTAGTAACACGATGTTCACTTACAGCCCTGCCTTC (+) and GAAGGCAGGGCTGTAAGTGAACATCGTGTTACTAC (−). The mutagenic oligonucleotides for Y198F were: CACGATGTACACTTTCAGCCCTGCCTTCAAG (+) and CTTGAAGGCAGGGCTGAAAGTGTACATCGTG (−). All DNA fragments that were manipulated in the course of the mutagenesis were sequenced (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) to confirm the mutation. Wild type and mutated glycogenin-2β inserted in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 were expressed in COS-1 cells. Conditions for transient transfection, cell extract preparation, self-glucosylation assay, and Western analysis were essentially as described before (15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glycogenin-2 signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the case of cotransfection of glycogenin-2 with glycogenin-1, 5 μg of pCMV-GN (17Skurat A.V. Cao Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14701-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in addition to glycogenin-2 plasmids and cells were left in glucose-free DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% FBS for 24 h before harvesting. After centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 ×g, supernatants from cells co-transfected with glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 were used to perform immunoprecipitation using anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were allowed to self-glucosylate, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel subjected to autoradiography. Rat-1 fibroblast cells were transfected with plasmid pcDNA3-GN-2α or pcDNA3-GN-2β-Y196F. Stable clones were selected using G418 (0.8 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc) as described by Skurat et al. (18Skurat A.V. Lim S.S. Roach P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Vector pcDNA3 alone, which expresses the neomycin gene, was used to make a negative control. Independent clones were isolated by cloning cylinders and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.4 mg/ml G418. Overexpression of glycogenin-2 was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies. Cells expressing glycogenin-2 were rinsed and homogenized in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended in the same volume as supernatant. Soluble and resuspended pellet fractions were used for glycogen measurements. Measurement of glycogen in the soluble and pellet fractions followed the method of Skurat et al. (19Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen levels in pellet fractions were expressed in terms of the protein concentration of the corresponding soluble fraction, so that the values for the soluble and pellet fractions are directly comparable. The starting plasmid was pGEX-HIBADH, from Dr. Robert A. Harris, Indiana University School of Medicine. It was derived from pGEX-KG (20Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) and contains an NdeI site in frame with GST immediately after a BamHI site and a glycine-rich linker. Wild type and tyrosine-mutated glycogenin-1 were excised from pET-15b-GN and pET-15b-GNF194 (10Cao Y. Steinrauf L.K. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) withNdeI-HindIII and ligated into a pGEX-HIBADH vector fragment after the plasmid had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were designated pGEX-GN and pGEX-GNF194. Expression and purification of GST or GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli were performed according to Guan and Dixon (20Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400-ml cultures of cells expressing GST alone or fusion proteins were grown at 37 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside once an absorption of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in GST lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine, and 0.1% Tween 20) and broken by passing through a French pressure cell followed by a 20-min 10,000 × g centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-agarose (Sigma) columns. Columns (∼1 ml) were then washed extensively with GST lysis buffer before proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmglutathione, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Eluted protein samples were dialyzed against GST lysis buffer to remove glutathione. Purified His6-tagged glycogenin-2α proteins derived from the same volume of bacterial culture were mixed with purified GST, GST-GN, or GST-GNF194 for 1 h at 4 °C before being applied to glutathione-agarose columns and washed extensively with GST lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with GST elution buffer. Eluted proteins were assayed for self-glucosylation activity followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Protein was quantitated by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE followed the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) as described previously (23Mu J. Cheng C. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26554-26560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our initial characterization of glycogenin-2 (15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we detected glycogenin-2 in a rat liver fraction and in H4IIEC3 cells. However, in the rat hepatoma cells, most of the glycogenin-2 was present as a free protein and only a small fraction required α-amylase treatment for its release. Since this result implied a potentially important difference between glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2, it was important to analyze glycogenin-2 in human liver tissue. Analysis of 12,000 × g supernatants from human liver extracts by Western analysis clearly indicated the presence of species of ∼66 kDa, the expected size of glycogenin-2 based on analysis of recombinant proteins (Fig.1 A). This species was only present after digestion of the sample with α-amylase. There was also a strong signal from a species with lower mobility than glycogenin-2 that was present whether the sample was treated with α-amylase or not (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 1 A). However, this signal is nonspecific and was also present when pre-immune serum was used for blotting (data not shown). Glycogenin-2 was also detected in the pellet fraction after prior treatment with α-amylase (data not shown). By using recombinant glycogenin-2 as a standard in the Western analysis, we estimated that the glycogenin-2 content in human liver is about 0.15 mg/g of tissue, distributed equally between the supernatant and pellet fractions as defined above. We also purified high molecular weight human liver glycogen using trichloroacetic acid precipitation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Glycogenin-2 was detected by Western analysis, but again only after α-amylase treatment (Fig.1 B). The preceding results led us to conclude that, in human liver, essentially all of the glycogenin-2 is covalently linked to glycogen, a substantial proportion of which is of highM r. Since human liver has inconveniences as an experimental system, we surveyed several human cell lines for expression of glycogenin-2. No glycogenin-2 signal was detected by Western analysis in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells, melanoma SK-MEL-1 cells, and breast adenocarcinoma Sk-Br-3 cells. The last mentioned cell line was selected because it was reported to contain glycogen granules (24Trempe G.L. Rec. Results Cancer Res. 1976; 57: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). The only cell line with which we observed a strong signal was human Ewing's sarcoma-derived RD-ES cells, which have been reported to contain glycogen (25Rosen G. Forscher C.A. Mankin H.J. Selch M.T. Holland J.F. Frei E.I. Bast R.C.J. Kufe D.W. Morton D.L. Weichselbaum R.R. 4th Ed. Cancer Medicine. 2. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 2503-2557Google Scholar). Using cells cultured in medium containing 25 mm glucose, anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies detected a major species at mass ∼66 kDa as well as a “smear” of species up to ∼120 kDa (Fig.2, lane 1). When the cells were switched to medium without glucose for 24 h (lane 2) or were treated with α-amylase, the smear disappeared. The higher M r species were restored when the glucose-starved cells were exposed to 25 mm glucose for 1 or 3 h (lanes 3and 4). We conclude that the higherM r species represent glycogenin-2 with intermediate levels of glucosylation, as can be seen for glycogenin-1 under appropriate circumstances (18Skurat A.V. Lim S.S. Roach P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, although we see glucose-dependent changes in glycogenin-2 glucosylation, we do not see stoichiometric conversion into highM r glycogen. In fact, the glycogen content in this cell line under our conditions of culture is relatively low, 8.2 μg of glycogen/mg of soluble protein, suggesting that the prevailing cellular conditions do not favor glycogen synthesis even at high glucose concentrations. Therefore, although the RD-ES cells are a useful source of glycogenin-2, they have limitations for the study of the role of glycogenin-2 in glycogen biosynthesis. Given the earlier results (14Smythe C. Villar-Palasi C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggesting that glycogenin-1 was present in rat and rabbit liver, it was of interest to analyze human liver for the presence of this protein. However, our anti-glycogenin-1 antibodies were generated with recombinant rabbit skeletal muscle protein and do not detect human glycogenin-1 in liver extracts by Western blotting. We were able to overcome this problem, at least qualitatively, because the antibodies are effective in immunoprecipitating human glycogenin-1 and the glycogenin can then be detected after self-glucosylation. With this analysis, we visualized a glucosylated species of ∼38 kDa corresponding to glycogenin-1 (data not shown; see similar experiments in Fig. 5). We also observed glucosylation of a species of ∼66 kDa with the same size as glycogenin-2. First, we conclude that there is glycogenin-1 in the liver extract. In addition, this result suggests that glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 can interact with one another. The self-glucosylation assay is in fact a very sensitive way to detect glycogenin-1 because of its relatively high self-glucosylating activity. From cDNA cloning, there are at least three different liver isoforms. The anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies available are not isoform-specific, and the predicted size differences among the isoforms are too small to assign isoforms based on protein size. Thus, we developed an RT-PCR method to distinguish the glycogenin-2α, -β, and -γ messages. Basically, a pair of primers straddled the regions of alternate splicing at the NH2 terminus so that products of slightly different size are generated (see standards in Fig.3). Using RNA prepared from human liver, a single discrete PCR fragment was obtained with size corresponding to glycogenin-2β (Fig. 3). Although not a quantitative measurement, this result suggests that glycogenin-2β is the major form expressed in human liver. Sequence alignment with glycogenin-1 indicates that glycogenin-2 has a tyrosine residue (Tyr-196 in glycogenin-2β) in correspondence with Tyr-194 of glycogenin-1, the residue known to be the site of carbohydrate attachment (14Smythe C. Villar-Palasi C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Cao Y. Mahrenholz A.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14687-14693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We individually mutated Tyr-196, as well as the adjacent Tyr-198, to Phe using site-directed mutagenesis. Similar levels of expression were achieved when wild type or mutated glycogenin-2β were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4). Self-glucosylation assays using COS cell extracts showed that mutation of Tyr-196 totally eliminated labeling of glycogenin-2. Mutation of Tyr-198 did not abolish the ability to self-glucosylate, even though the level of labeling was somewhat reduced. Similar results were obtained with purified, recombinant glycogenin-2 produced in E. coli except that in this case mutation of Tyr-198 had no effect on activity (data not shown). We conclude that, as in glycogenin-1, there is a single site of glucose attachment to glycogenin-2. Several lines of evidence suggest that glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 might interact with each other. As noted above, antibodies to glycogenin-1 immunoprecipitated a self-glucosylating species from human liver extracts with the size of glycogenin-2. Using H4IIEC3 cells, we were able to show that glycogenin-1 could be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies and vice versa (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with extracts from RD-ES cells, which express both glycogenin proteins (Fig.5). In immunoprecipitates, self-glucosylation of both glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 was detected no matter which anti-glycogenin antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation of glycogenin-1 with glycogenin-2 was also demonstrated in studies using extracts from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 (Fig.6). In this experimental system, anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies did not immunoprecipitate glycogenin-1 unless glycogenin-2 had been co-expressed. The interaction between glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 did not depend on the glucosylation state of glycogenin-2 since the same amount of glycogenin-1 was immunoprecipated whether glycogenin-2 was wild type or mutated at Tyr-196. The interaction of glycogenin-2 with glycogenin-1 was also demonstratedin vitro using purified recombinant proteins. Independently purified recombinant GST-tagged glycogenin-1 and His6-tagged glycogenin-2 were mixed before being applied to glutathione-agarose column, which should bind the GST tag specifically. The proteins were eluted with glutathione. Analysis of the eluted proteins indicated the presence of glycogenin-2 as well as glycogenin-1, even though only glycogenin-1 had the GST tag (Fig.7 A). In a control, His6-tagged glycogenin-2 incubated with GST did not bind to the GST-agarose. Similar co-elution of glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 was observed with wild type glycogenin-1 or a mutant with Tyr-194 replaced with Phe. This mutation destroys the ability of the protein to act as a glucose acceptor even though activity toward exogenous acceptors such as maltose is not affected (10Cao Y. Steinrauf L.K. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Cao Y. Mahrenholz A.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

In both cases, the glucosylation of glycogenin-2 was enhanced by the presence of glycogenin-1. Either the binding of glycogenin-1 allosterically activated glycogenin-2 or else the glycogenin-1 was able to transfer glucose to glycogenin-2. Rat-1 fibroblast cells stably expressing glycogenin-1 (GN23 cell line) have been described previously by Skurat et al. (18Skurat A.V. Lim S.S. Roach P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy, cells expressing wild type glycogenin-2α or glycogenin-2β-with Tyr-196 (GN2β-Y196F) mutated to Phe were generated. Western analysis with anti-glycogenin-2 antibodies confirmed the expression of both glycogenin-2 proteins (Fig. 8). Although a fraction of the wild-type glycogenin-2α was present as a free protein, the majority was associated with glycogen and required α-amylase treatment in order to be detected. In contrast, the mutant glycogenin-2, lacking the glucosylation site, was present entirely as a free protein, regardless of α-amylase treatment. Glycogen levels in these cells were compared with cells expressing pcDNA3 vector alone or the GN23 line that expresses glycogenin-1 (Fig.9). Consistent with previou"

We have identified a 70-kDa endonuclease (NUC70) that is activated in drug-induced apoptosis of human hematopoietic cells. We purified NUC70 to homogeneity and generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody to distinguish it from previously identified nucleases. Biochemical characterization of isolated NUC70 demonstrates that it is Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent and active over a pH range of 6–8. When incubated with isolated HeLa nuclei, NUC70 was capable of generating internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. This endonucleolytic activity was inhibited by Zn2+, aurintricarboxylic acid,N-ethylmaleimide, spermine, and iodoacetamide. Western immunoblots using the anti-NUC70 antibody and DNA-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assays indicate that NUC70 expression and activity is restricted to human hematopoietic cells. No such activity was detected in human epithelial cell lines or murine hematopoietic cells. We also observed no difference in levels of NUC70 expression between apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells, suggesting that activation of NUC70 may be by posttranslational modification. We demonstrate that NUC70 activity is diminished in cells pretreated with the caspase inhibitors z-DEVD-fmk, z-VAD-fmk, and Z-CH2-Asp-DCB. Time course studies of cytoplasmic and nuclear endonuclease activities during apoptosis show that NUC70 is a cytoplasmic endonuclease that is translocated to the nucleus after the initiation of apoptosis. We confirmed this with immunostaining studies using anti-NUC70 antibody.

Apoptosis is a physiological process of orderly cell death that occurs in response to a number of physiological, pathological, and cytotoxic insults. Apoptotic cells are identified morphologically based on compaction of chromatin against the nuclear membrane, condensation of the cytoplasm, and nuclear and cytoplasmic blebbing to form membrane-bound fragments that are phagocytosed by adjacent cells (1Kerr J.F.R.

Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 3Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). The morphological changes are paralleled by activation of a number of complex biochemical effector pathways that contribute to dissolution of cellular structural elements. One common end point of apoptosis is the reduction of high molecular weight genomic DNA into smaller oligonucleosomal fragments that can be effectively packaged. Chromatin condensation has been shown to be dependent on DNA digestion. The characteristic appearance of 180–200-base pair oligonucleosomal ladders on agarose gels in cells undergoing apoptosis is in contrast to the pattern of random DNA digestion occurring in the setting of necrosis and denotes the importance of activation of specific endonucleases in apoptosis, regardless of the stimulus for cell death (4Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mesner P.W. Budihardjo I.I. Kaufman SH. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 461-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Identification of apoptotic endonucleases has been limited by the low abundance of these proteins and by poor understanding of the complex patterns of their regulation. The first studies of apoptotic endonucleases in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis indicated that these enzymes are likely constitutive and are activated by Ca2+and inhibited by Zn2+ (6Compton M.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8288-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies in epithelial cells demonstrated Ca2+-independent apoptotic DNA degradation, suggesting that a family of apoptotic endonucleases exists and may differ according to tissue type (7Giannakis C. Forbes I.J. Zalewski P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus far, candidate endonucleases have been identified with differing biochemical characteristics, including pH and cation requirements as well as pattern of tissue expression. Because only a few of these endonucleases, caspase-activated nuclease and inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) 1The abbreviations used are: CAD, caspase-activated DNase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. NUC18, and the 27-kDa splenic endonuclease, have been purified or cloned (8Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18877-18880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is little information regarding their activation and interaction with other effector components of the apoptotic cascade. We have identified a 70-kDa apoptotic endonuclease activity in human hematopoietic cells in modified DNA-SDS-PAGE renaturation assays that is heat-stable and Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent and the activity of which is inhibited in the presence of inhibitors of caspase. We now describe the purification and biochemical characterization of NUC70 and demonstrate by immunohistochemistry that it is a cytoplasmic protein that is translocated to the nucleus early in apoptosis. Vincristine, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, VP-16, and chemicals and protease inhibitors for buffers were obtained from Sigma. Proteinase K, DNase, and RNase were obtained from Life Technologies. The caspase inhibitors z-DEVD-fmk, z-VAD-cmk, and Z-CH2-Asp-DCB were obtained from Oncogene Research (Cambridge, MA). Serine protease inhibitors TPCK and TLCK were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). SDS-PAGE reagents and prestained molecular weight markers were obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), and gels were made according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the modifications mentioned below. Human leukemia cell lines Nalm-6 (pre-B leukemia), Molt-4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Hut-102 (Sezary leukemia), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), and Jurkat (T-cell leukemia); murine cell lines S49(thymoma) and P388 (lymphoid neoplasm); and human epithelial cell lines A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), CACO2, and HT-29 (colon carcinoma) were used in this study. Cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (105units/liter), and streptomycin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell culture media, sera, and antibiotics were obtained from Life Technologies. Human CD34+ stem cells and mononuclear cells were obtained from patients on protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board. For large scale purification of NUC70, Nalm-6 cells were grown in 500 ml of culture medium in roller bottles. Cells seeded in 75-mm2 flasks at a semiconfluent density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence 10 μm vincristine. At different time points, cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min) and lysed in DNA lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were divided into two aliquots. The first aliquot was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. DNA concentration in the supernatant (fragmented DNA) and in the pellet (chromatin) was determined using the diphenylamine colorimetric assay for DNA as described by Gendimenico et al. (12Gendimenico G.J. Bouquin P.L. Tramposch K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was quantified by computing for % DNA fragmentation (fragmented DNA/(fragmented DNA + pellet DNA)). The second aliquot was processed for DNA extraction using 100 μg/ml proteinase K, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% (w/v) SDS and incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. Nucleic acid was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and treated with 1 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA samples (10 μg/lane) were loaded on a 1.8% agarose gel (with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide) and separated by electrophoresis using 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 89 mm boric acid). Gels were run at 50 V for 5 h, viewed on a UV transilluminator, and photographed. In experiments to determine the effects of protease inhibitors, cells were pretreated with 50 μm inhibitors (TPCK, TLCK, z-DEVD.-fmk, z-VAD-fmk, and z-CH2-Asp-DCB) for 1 h prior to induction of apoptosis with 10 μm vincristine and then processed. Total cell lysates were prepared by resuspending 106 cells in protein extraction buffer (0.5% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm B-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C, vortexed, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Caron-Leslie et al. (13Caron-Leslie L.M. Schwartzman R.A. Gaido M.L. Compton M.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were subjected to hypotonic shock using ice-cold 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. Nuclei were harvested by centrifugation (100 × g), and the resulting supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic extracts. The nuclei pellet was washed twice with the above buffer, and nuclear protein was extracted with 0.3 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 1 h on a moving platform. The chromatin material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells during apoptosis at different time points and analyzed using the DNA-SDS-PAGE method described below. Total cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration and nuclease activity was assayed using the method of McGrew and Green (15McGrew B.R. Green D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels (10%) loaded with 50 μg/ml high polymer calf thymus DNA (Sigma) according to the method of Laemmli using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed by washing the gels in renaturation buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide with DE-52 (Whatman). DE-52 was prepared by equilibrating 10 g of preswollen DE-52 in 200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with the same buffer before resuspending the resin in the renaturation buffer at a concentration of 0.1 g/ml. Gels were washed with two changes of the renaturation buffer for 30 min on a moving platform and then incubated in renaturation buffer without DE-52 for 60 min. After a brief rinse with distilled water, gels were placed in activation buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2), and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C to allow DNA hydrolysis. In experiments using different ion and pH conditions, gels were cut into strips and treated in the same manner with appropriate modifications of the activation buffer. The reaction was stopped by washing the gels in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and visualized and photographed under UV light using the UVP GDS 7500 gel documentation system (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). Images were quantified by densitometry and analyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image 1.61 program. The purification methods used were adapted from Chow and Fraser (16Chow T.Y.-K. Fraser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12010-12018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in their isolation of exo-endonucleases from Neurospora crassa. Briefly, 109 Nalm-6 apoptotic cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated using preparative electrophoresis (Model 491 Prep Cell, Bio-Rad) attached to a peristaltic pump (Model P1, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fraction collector (Waters, Bedford, MA). Fractions with activity as determined by cleavage of intact HeLa nuclei were pooled; simultaneously, fractions were concentrated and SDS was dialyzed off using equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) on Amicon (Beverly, MA) microconcentrators with a 30-kDa cut-off. The consolidated sample was loaded onto a SP-Sephadex C25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with the equilibration buffer and eluted with a NaCl (0.1–0.5 m) step gradient. Fractions with endonuclease activity were pooled and reconcentrated in equilibration buffer with 50 mm NaCl. The sample was then loaded onto a double-stranded DNA-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted in a manner similar to that described above. Endonuclease activity was detected in the fractions by concentrating 50 μl on a Speed-Vac Plus lyophilizer (Savant Instruments Inc. Farmingdale, NY) and assayed on DNA-SDS-PAGE gel as described previously. Fractions containing activity were quantified by measuring the ability to generate DNA laddering with isolated nuclei (6Compton M.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8288-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as fragmentation of 25% of the DNA from intact HeLa nuclei in 5 min in the presence of 5 mmCa2+ and 5 mm Mg2+ at 37 °C. Fragmented DNA was quantified using the diphenylamine DNA colorimetric assay (12Gendimenico G.J. Bouquin P.L. Tramposch K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and expressed as a percentage of the total nuclear DNA. Specific activity was expressed as activity units per mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization was performed using 4 units of enzyme incubated at different pH, ions and recognized nuclease inhibitors. Relative activity is expressed by quantifying experimental activity as a percentage of the standard nuclei assay described above. About 1 mg of purified NUC70 was obtained from the above purification scheme, bypassing the ion-exchange procedure (SP-Sephadex column). Fractions from the double-stranded DNA-cellulose column were lyophilized using Speed-Vac Plus. Polyclonal antibody (rabbit antiserum) production was subcontracted toZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) for their proprietary accelerated procedure (PolyQuick). Cell lysates from apoptotic and nonapoptotic Nalm-6 cells, were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 4 °C using 100 V. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, PBST (0.1% Tween-20, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 137 mm sodium chloride) for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-NUC70 antibody (dilution, 1:5000) for another 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times with PBST and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then developed using chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Images were developed on Kodak X-AR film. Nalm-6 cells (107 cells) were washed with PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 137 mm sodium chloride) and lysed with the addition of 1ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, l0 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) under nondenaturing conditions and incubation for 1 h with constant agitation on a vortex mixer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Supernatant was collected and precleared with 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected and incubated with 10 μg of anti-NUC70 antibody on a rocking platform for 12–16 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g) and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed for endonuclease activity on 10% DNA-SDS-PAGE gels. Nalm-6 cells were exposed to 10 μg/ml etoposide for 8 h to induce apoptosis. Cells were immobilized onto glass slides by cytospin (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), fixed and permeabilized by immersion in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C and air-dried. Slides were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min, incubated with anti-NUC70 antibody (dilution, 1:500) for 1 h, and probed with goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) together with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stain for 1 h. Slides were washed with PBS between buffer changes and mounted in glycerol. Immunofluorescent staining was viewed using a Nikon Optiphot 2 fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with mercury lamp and excitation filters for UV(365 nm) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (470–490 nm). Images were recorded using a Nikon photographic attachment (MicroFlex-UFX-DX), on Kodak ASA200 color film. Figures were scanned using Microtek ScanMaker IIXE and assembled using Adobe Photoshop. To identify the size and activity of putative apoptotic endonucleases, we fractionated whole cell lysates from apoptotic cells on DNA-SDS-PAGE gels under denaturing conditions using a technique adapted from McGrew and Green (15McGrew B.R. Green D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were exposed to alkaline pH to renature proteins in the presence of DEAE to remove SDS efficiently and allow restoration of enzymatic activities with minimum denaturation and degradation. Previous studies using a similar method have solely utilized the passive method of renaturation of Rosenthal and Lacks (17Rosenthal A.L. Lacks S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 76-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Endonuclease activity was defined as negative staining in the gels treated with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. Using this method on time and dose-dependent studies on apoptotic Nalm-6 cells, we detected a previously described constitutively active endonucleolytic activity that appeared as a triplet with an apparent molecular mass of 40–50 kDa in untreated cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) and that was unchanged or only slightly increased when cells were induced to undergo apoptosis (18Khodarev N.N. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 922-931PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang C. Robertson M.J. Schlossman S.F. Cell Immunol. 1995; 165: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified an endonuclease activity (NUC70) that was present only in minute amounts in untreated cells and that increased 10–50-fold as measured by densitometric analysis of DNA-SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1 B) in apoptotic cells. This increase in the 70-kDa activity was concordant with the appearance of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 A). The low level of basal expression in the untreated cells (lane 2) likely results from spontaneous apoptosis, which occurs in 1–5% of cells in culture as detected in our diphenylamine assays. The fact that the whole cell lysates examined in these experiments were prepared under denaturing and reducing conditions indicating that the renatured NUC70 activity was heat resistant and likely represented a single protein species. We next attempted to identify NUC70 activity in cells of different lineages. Apoptosis was induced in the epithelial cell lines MCF-7, T47D, CACO-2, HT-29, HeLa, and A549 using vincristine or VP-16 and in the hematopoietic cell lines Molt 4, CEM, Hut 102, Hut 78, K562, Jurkat, and Raji using vincristine, dexamethasone, and, for Jurkat cells, anti-CD95-antibody to induce Fas-mediated apoptosis. We found induction of NUC70 activity in all hematopoietic cell lines examined irrespective of the method used to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, no endonucleolytic activity representing a 70-kDa endonuclease was identified in any of the epithelial cell lines tested under conditions where apoptosis was induced as measured by DNA fragmentation, but the previously described 40–50-kDa endonuclease activity was identified in these cells (Fig. 2, A–D). This 40–50-kDa activity was also present in the hematopoietic cell lines. These data suggest that NUC70 activity is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage, whereas the 40–50-kDa endonucleases appear to be ubiquitously expressed. We next examined normal CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from CD34+ selected peripheral blood stem cell collections and lymphocytes from Ficoll-separated peripheral blood from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We found induction of NUC70 activity and a 50-kDa endonuclease when apoptosis was induced by exposure to 5 μm Fludarabine (Fig. 3). At 24 h, 40- and 90-kDa endonuclease activities were also observed in CD34+ cells. When we examined murine hematopoietic cell lines, including P388, S49, and 2E8, we detected a 40-kDa endonucleolytic activity and several smaller sized endonucleases but were unable to detect NUC70 activity when apoptosis was induced, suggesting that the murine analog of NUC70 may have a different molecular mass. Because it has been proposed that mycoplasma endonucleases may interfere with endonuclease renaturation assays (20Paddenberg R. Wulf S. Weber H. Heiman P. Beck L. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 105-119PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bendjennat M. Blanchard A. Lontfi M. Montagnier L. Bahraoui E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2210-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we assayed for mycoplasma infection in our cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ATCC) and treated cells with ciprofloxacin (Bayer) for 2 weeks (22Fleckenstein E. Uphoff C.C. Drxler H.G. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 1424-1434PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment did not affect the kinetics of NUC70 activation during apoptosis, and transfer of conditioned media from NUC70 positive Nalm-6 cells onto NUC70 negative cell lines (MCF-7 and A549) did not result in expression of NUC70. In cell lines that were positive for mycoplasma, we detected varying increases in the 40–50-kDa endonucleases described above (data not shown). Nalm-6 cells from which NUC70 was isolated and purified were mycoplasma negative by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We based our initial strategy for isolating NUC70 on its size under reducing conditions that indicate that it is a single protein species. With the aid of preparative electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad model 491), we were able to dramatically fractionate a whole cell lysate of 109apoptotic Nalm-6 cells, separating the 70-kDa endonuclease from other cellular endonucleases, including the previously described 40–50-kDa endonuclease triplet, by assaying fractions on a DNA-SDS-PAGE gel. Measurement of protein yield by Bradford assay (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) indicated that this step allowed us to obtain an approximately 1000-fold purification of NUC70. Unfortunately, we were unable to determine the amount of enzyme activity in the initial sample due to the nonspecific DNase content. To further isolate NUC70 from proteins of similar size, we separated the pooled fractions containing NUC70 activity by ion-exchange chromatography (SP-Sephadex column) and affinity chromatography (DNA-agarose column). Our early attempts at purifying NUC70 indicated that NUC70 does not bind to DEAE column under neutral pH conditions. This distinguishes NUC70 from other Ca2+/Mg2+endonucleases (11Montague J.W. Gaido M.L. Frye C. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18877-18880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chow T.Y.-K. Fraser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12010-12018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NUC70 activity elutes with 400 mmNaCl from SP-Sephadex column and with 200 mm NaCl from the DNA-agarose column. Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels of the fractions from these columns (Fig.4 A) showed a single band at 70 kDa, and incubation of these fractions with isolated HeLa nuclei generated apoptotic DNA laddering (Fig. 4 B). Our purification scheme is summarized in Table I. We estimate a 185-fold purification from the second step. Because we could not measure endonuclease activity in our first step, this is likely an underestimate, and according to measurements of protein content by Bradford assay, we may have a more than 1000-fold purification and an at least 100,000-fold enhancement of endonuclease activity. Because the difference between steps 3 and 4 is only 3-fold, we maximized our recovery by omitting step 3 in subsequent purifications. This increased recovery provided sufficient material for the biochemical characterization of NUC70 and for antibody generation.Table IPurification schemePurification stepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgunits/mgfold1.

DNA-agarose0.009467.550,053185 Open table in a new tab We further characterized isolated NUC70 by determining its optimum cation requirements and pH using the HeLa nuclei assay. As shown in Fig.5 A, NUC70 activity is optimum in the presence of both Ca2+ (2 mm) and Mg2+ (5 mm). However, these cations at higher concentrations inhibit NUC70 activity (Ca2+, IC50 = 6.5 mm; Mg2+, IC50 = 9 mm). Experiments in which Ca2+ or Mg2+ was used alone showed diminished NUC70 activity. Mn2+ and Co2+ did not stimulate NUC70 activity (Fig. 5 B), and Zn2+ inhibited even at low concentrations (IC50 = 0.25 mm). Assessment of NUC70 at different pH conditions indicated that NUC70 functions over a broad pH range. Optimal activity was seen at pH 7.0–7.2; however, 50% activity was observed at pH 5.7–7.0 and pH 7.5–8.0 (Fig. 5 C). We next examined the effect of identified nuclease inhibitors (16Chow T.Y.-K. Fraser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12010-12018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on NUC70 activity. Endonuclease activity was inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid (IC50 = 0.3 mm), spermine (IC50 = 2 mm),N-ethylmaleimide (IC50 = 0.6 mm), and iodoacetamide (IC50 = 0.5 mm) (Fig.4 D). G-actin, an inhibitor DNase I, did not affect NUC70 endonuclease activity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of the antiserum raised against NUC70 showed that dilutions up to 10,000-fold could identify the 70-kDa endonuclease protein in hematopoietic cells and on Western blots at a dilution of 1:5,000–1:10,000, suggesting that our polyclonal antibody preparation has high avidity. Further, anti-NUC70 antibody was capable of immunoprecipitating the 70-kDa endonuclease activity, as shown in Fig. 6. Immunoblots of untreated and apoptotic Nalm-6 cells demonstrate that the polyclonal anti-NUC70 antibody recognizes both the inactive and active forms of the protein, as shown in Fig.7 B.

It is uncertain, however, whether topoisomerases are also required for the initiation of replication. To investigate this point, we have performed pulse-chase experiments with SV40 minichromosomes as template to distinguish between the initiation and the elongation of replication. Using an unfractionated cytosolic extract as a source of replication functions, we found that the addition of topoisomerases at the initiation step significantly increased the number of active chromatin templates, whereas addition of topoisomerases at the elongation step had only minor effects. Minichromosomes with an extended chromatin structure as well as protein-free DNA required less topoisomerase for effective replication initiation. We could exclude the possibility that topoisomerases enhance the origin binding of T antigen, the SV40 replication initiator, and propose instead that the arrangement of nucleosomes influences the diffusion of supercoils during initial DNA unwinding. Efficient initiation therefore requires a high local concentration of topoisomerases to relax the torsional stress.

DNA replication is initiated by the helicase-promoted unwinding of the parental strands. This process generates positive superhelical stress that must be relaxed by DNA topoisomerases to allow continued replication fork movement (1Cairns J. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 6: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases I and II relax both positive and negative supercoiled DNA by transiently inducing single-stranded or double-stranded DNA breaks, respectively (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar).Genetic studies with yeast topoisomerase mutants have indicated that either topoisomerase I or II can serve as a swivel for DNA replication (3Brill S.J. Dinardo S. Voelkel-Meiman K. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1987; 326: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4Goto T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By using selective inhibitors or antibodies against the topoisomerases, the roles of these enzymes during SV40 minichromosome replication have been further elucidated. Thus, topoisomerase I was found to be specifically associated with replicating SV40 minichromosomes (6Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3675-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rainwater R. Mann K. Virology. 1991; 181: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 8Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3347-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and biochemical and electron microscopic methods further revealed that topoisomerase I acts close to the replication forks, presumably by relieving supercoiling tension in front of the advancing replication forks (9Snapka R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4221-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Avemann K. Knippers R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Whereas either topoisomerase I or II can provide the swivel activity necessary for the efficient synthesis of progeny SV40 DNA molecules (11Yang L. Wold M.S. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), topoisomerase II is uniquely required as a swivelase in the late stages of minichromosome replication and has an essential role during segregation of the daughter molecules after DNA replication (9; 11–15).The in vivo substrate for DNA replication is chromatin, and thus, topoisomerases have to relieve the torsional stress arising during replication on nucleosomally organized DNA. Analysis of topoisomerase cleavage sites in nucleosomal DNA has shown that the nucleosome positioning is a critical determinant for the activity of topoisomerases. Thus, topoisomerase II requires a free access to DNA, either through nucleosome-free regions or through the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes (16Capranico G. Jaxel C. Roberge M. Kohn K. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4553-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Udvardy A. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4973-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In fact, we could previously show that the accessibility to topoisomerases and consequently the efficiency of replication are regulated by the chromatin structure. Accordingly, we found that minichromosomes with a relaxed chromatin structure need less topoisomerase for an efficient replication compared with minichromosomes with a compact structure (18Halmer L. Gruss C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).However, recent studies have shown that neither topoisomerase I nor topoisomerase II was able to relieve the superhelical tension of covalently closed circular minichromosomes as generated by the unwinding by the SV40 T antigen (T-Ag) 1The abbreviations used are: T-Ag, T antigen; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: T-Ag, T antigen; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; bp, base pair(s).in a purified system. Only very early unwinding intermediates were found, suggesting that relaxation by topoisomerases is a critical step at the early stages of replication. In contrast, linear chromatin molecules, which do not accumulate torsional stress, were clearly unwound in a T-Ag-dependent manner (19Ramsperger U. Stahl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3215-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).To further elucidate the roles of topoisomerases during chromatin replication and to discriminate between their effects on initiation and elongation, we performed pulse-chase experiments. We found that the complementation of a replication-competent cytosolic extract by the addition of an excess of topoisomerases increases the number of initiation events but not the efficiency of chain elongation. To demonstrate that indeed the organization of the chromatin determines the requirement for an excess of topoisomerases, we used SV40 minichromosome templates that had been treated with trypsin to remove the amino-terminal histone domains. This leads to a more extended chromatin structure (20Quintini G. Treuner K. Gruss C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and reduces the amount of topoisomerases needed for an efficient initiation, indicating that nucleosome organization regulates the efficiency of topoisomerase activity and, thus, the efficiency of replication initiation.DISCUSSIONA first step during the initiation of replication is the recognition and binding of origin sequences by initiator proteins such as the Escherichia coli DnaA protein, the phage λO protein, the SV40 T-Ag, or the eucaryotic origin recognition complex (ORC) (reviewed in Ref. 39Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Once bound to the origin, initiator proteins recruit additional factors involved in the assembly and function of the replication machinery. A critical step in fork assembly is the initial separation of the two DNA strands by disruption of the hydrogen bonds, which is required for loading of the replication machinery and for providing the template for DNA synthesis. This step is performed by DNA helicases, such as the E. coli DnaB helicase, the SV40 T-Ag, or possibly the MCM proteins, which may function as DNA helicases in eucaryotic cells (40Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Unwinding of the DNA template and the progression of the replication fork create topological stress, which is eliminated by DNA topoisomerases. Helicases and topoisomerases may be part of a large replication complex (41Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indeed, a direct interaction between eucaryotic topoisomerase I and the SV40 T-Ag has recently been described (42Simmons D.T. Melendy T. Usher D. Stillman B. Virology. 1996; 222: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 43Simmons D.T. Roy R. Chen L. Gai D. Trowbridge P.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).We present evidence, that in addition to their known roles during the progression of the replication fork and the segregation of the daughter molecules, topoisomerases are a critical determinant for the efficiency of initiation of chromatin replication. We found by pulse-chase analysis that more chromatin molecules can start replication by increasing the amount of either topoisomerase I or II in the SV40 in vitro replication system. Thus, the nucleosomal structure itself can significantly influence the amount of topoisomerases needed for an efficient initiation.The influence of topoisomerases on the efficiency of chromatin replication are not entirely understood, but several possibilities may be considered. One possibility is that topoisomerases stimulate further binding of T-Ag to the SV40 origin sequences. This should, however, also increase the replication efficiency of protein-free DNA templates. This was not observed. Furthermore, by micrococcal nuclease footprinting we could demonstrate that the addition of topoisomerases did not increase the number of molecules containing bound T-Ag.A second possibility could be the activation of additional chromatin molecules with a nucleosomally organized origin. These molecules are otherwise inactive for replication in this system (28Cheng L. Kelly T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10910-10913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, they can be activated through specific remodeling of the chromatin structure at the origin sequences by the chromatin remodeling complex CHRAC (30Alexiadis V. Varga-Weisz P.D. Bonte E. Becker P.B. Gruss C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3428-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This complex contains topoisomerase II (36Varga-Weisz P.D. Wilm M. Bonte E. Dumas K. Mann M. Becker P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We show here that topoisomerases alone are not able to remodel the chromatin structure of a nucleosomally organized origin nor to activate these molecules for the initiation of replication.Our most interesting observation was that additional topoisomerases stimulate the initiation of replication from chromatin but not from protein-free DNA molecules. Thus a higher amount of topoisomerases seems to be necessary for the removal of topological links in chromatin compared with protein-free DNA. Positive supercoils, created by the unwinding of the origin sequences by T-Ag can freely diffuse over the whole molecule of protein-free DNA, but they may accumulate in front of the first nucleosome in chromatin (46Dröge P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus a higher local concentration of topoisomerases seems to be a logical consequence for the efficient removal of the arising torsional stress. Increasing the amount of topoisomerases could then activate further chromatin molecules, which have the T-Ag already bound.Interestingly, chromatin molecules containing modified nucleosomes, as created by the removal of the amino-terminal histone domains by trypsinization (18Halmer L. Gruss C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Quintini G. Treuner K. Gruss C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), require a lower amount of topoisomerases for an efficient initiation of replication. The amino-terminal tails stabilize both the nucleosomal structure by the interaction with nucleosomal DNA and the higher order chromatin structure by passing over and between the gyres of the DNA superhelix contacting neighboring nucleosomes (47Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that nucleosomes missing the amino-terminal tails represent a less stringent barrier for supercoil diffusion than the intact nucleosome.Physiological changes of the nucleosomal structure, comparable with the removal of the tails by trypsinization occur through post-translational modifications of the histone proteins as the acetylation of the core histones and the phosphorylation of histone H1 or the association with non-histone proteins like HMG (high mobility group)-17. In all these cases an increase in the replication efficiency was measured in vitro in comparison with control chromatin (21Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Alexiadis V. Halmer L. Gruss C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Vestner B. Bustin M. Gruss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9409-9414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This indicates that the nucleosomal organization is a critical determinant for replication initiation. Changes in nucleosomal structure can induce a more extended chromatin structure and, thus, a higher accessibility for topoisomerases. Furthermore these changes might facilitate the diffusion of supercoils, which otherwise accumulate in front of the replication machinery at the first nucleosome encountered. Thus by either modifying the nucleosomal structure, e.g. through histone modifications, or by increasing the amount of topoisomerases, the cell might be able to regulate the efficiency of the initiation of chromatin replication. DNA replication is initiated by the helicase-promoted unwinding of the parental strands. This process generates positive superhelical stress that must be relaxed by DNA topoisomerases to allow continued replication fork movement (1Cairns J. J. Mol.

Kelly T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10910-10913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, they can be activated through specific remodeling of the chromatin structure at the origin sequences by the chromatin remodeling complex CHRAC (30Alexiadis V. Varga-Weisz P.D. Bonte E. Becker P.B. Gruss C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3428-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This complex contains topoisomerase II (36Varga-Weisz P.D. Wilm M. Bonte E. Dumas K. Mann M. Becker P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We show here that topoisomerases alone are not able to remodel the chromatin structure of a nucleosomally organized origin nor to activate these molecules for the initiation of replication. Our most interesting observation was that additional topoisomerases stimulate the initiation of replication from chromatin but not from protein-free DNA molecules. Thus a higher amount of topoisomerases seems to be necessary for the removal of topological links in chromatin compared with protein-free DNA. Positive supercoils, created by the unwinding of the origin sequences by T-Ag can freely diffuse over the whole molecule of protein-free DNA, but they may accumulate in front of the first nucleosome in chromatin (46Dröge P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus a higher local concentration of topoisomerases seems to be a logical consequence for the efficient removal of the arising torsional stress. Increasing the amount of topoisomerases could then activate further chromatin molecules, which have the T-Ag already bound. Interestingly, chromatin molecules containing modified nucleosomes, as created by the removal of the amino-terminal histone domains by trypsinization (18Halmer L. Gruss C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Quintini G. Treuner K. Gruss C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), require a lower amount of topoisomerases for an efficient initiation of replication. The amino-terminal tails stabilize both the nucleosomal structure by the interaction with nucleosomal DNA and the higher order chromatin structure by passing over and between the gyres of the DNA superhelix contacting neighboring nucleosomes (47Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that nucleosomes missing the amino-terminal tails represent a less stringent barrier for supercoil diffusion than the intact nucleosome. Physiological changes of the nucleosomal structure, comparable with the removal of the tails by trypsinization occur through post-translational modifications of the histone proteins as the acetylation of the core histones and the phosphorylation of histone H1 or the association with non-histone proteins like HMG (high mobility group)-17. In all these cases an increase in the replication efficiency was measured in vitro in comparison with control chromatin (21Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Alexiadis V. Halmer L. Gruss C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Vestner B. Bustin M. Gruss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9409-9414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This indicates that the nucleosomal organization is a critical determinant for replication initiation. Changes in nucleosomal structure can induce a more extended chromatin structure and, thus, a higher accessibility for topoisomerases. Furthermore these changes might facilitate the diffusion of supercoils, which otherwise accumulate in front of the replication machinery at the first nucleosome encountered. Thus by either modifying the nucleosomal structure, e.g. through histone modifications, or by increasing the amount of topoisomerases, the cell might be able to regulate the efficiency of the initiation of chromatin replication.

https://openalex.org/W2046088674,"SFT (stimulator of Fe transport) is a novel transport protein that has been found to facilitate uptake of iron presented to cells as either Fe(II) or Fe(III). When HeLa cells are exposed to the iron chelator desferrioxamine, levels of SFT mRNA increase in an actinomycin D-sensitive manner. In contrast, cells exposed to high levels of iron down-regulate SFT expression in a time-dependent and reversible fashion. Thus, homeostatic regulation of SFT expression not only ensures that sufficient levels of iron are maintained but also limits excessive assimilation to prevent potentially harmful effects of this toxic metal. The unexpected observation that SFT transcript levels are up-regulated in hemochromatosis patients therefore suggests that enhanced SFT expression contributes to the etiology of this iron overload disorder.

The unexpected observation that SFT transcript levels are up-regulated in hemochromatosis patients therefore suggests that enhanced SFT expression contributes to the etiology of this iron overload disorder. Transport of iron by microbes, plants, and animals is a tightly regulated process that is limited to prevent harmful effects due to overload of this toxic metal (for a comprehensive review of this field, please see Ref. 1Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. Metal Ions Biol. Syst., Vol 35. Marcel Dekker, New York, 1998Google Scholar). Iron is taken up by bacteria through direct ferrous import systems (e.g. Feo of Escherichia coli) as well as siderophore-based mechanisms. Iron-responsive gene transcription through the regulator Fur is largely responsible for the control of bacterial iron uptake (2Ochs M. Veitinger S. Kim I. Welz D. Angerer A. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As reviewed by Eide (3Eide D.J. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), studies in yeast have further characterized the role of transport proteins (e.g. Fet4 and Ftr1), ferrireductases (e.g. Fre1 and Fre2), and oxidases (e.g. Fet3 and Fet5) in the membrane transport of iron and also have revealed iron-responsive transcriptional control involving the element Aft1. Like microbes and yeast, plants too display iron-regulated uptake (e.g. IRT1) (5Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Finally, advances made through functional expression cloning have most recently identified two mammalian iron transport systems. DCT1/Nramp2 mediates Fe(II) uptake (6Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L.

The latter appears to be first reduced in a copper-requiring process prior to SFT-mediated translocation of Fe(II) across the membrane bilayer (10Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol.

Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar) have reported the presence of DCT1/Nramp2 message in rat intestine, kidney, thymus, and brain, with low levels detected in testis, liver, colon, heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, lung, bone marrow, and stomach. This profile appears to overlap with the appearance of SFT transcripts, which have been found in human intestine, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovaries, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, with low levels observed for colon (9Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, while DCT1/Nramp2 transcripts are known to be increased in the intestine of iron-deficient animals (6Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar), regulation of SFT expression in response to iron levels has yet to be characterized.The critical need for iron transport regulation can be most readily recognized by the pathological consequences observed when control is lost in the human disease hemochromatosis. This genetic disorder promotes increased intestinal absorption and progressive tissue deposition of iron resulting in cirrhosis of the liver, hepatic carcinoma, congestive heart failure, endocrinopathies, and premature death. The recent elucidation of the gene for this disease led to the discovery that defects in a nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein, HFE, are responsible for the iron overload exhibited by patients (11Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo Jr., R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A. Hinton L.M. Jones N.L. Kimmel B.E. Kronmal G.S. Lauer P. Lee V.K. Loeb D.B. Mapa F.A.

Genet. 1996; 13: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). Although the mechanistic basis for the disease remains obscure, the fact that β2-microglobulin knockout mice display characteristics of iron overload associated with hemochromatosis patients confirms the relationship of an MHC class I-like molecule with iron metabolism (12Rothenberg B.E. Voland J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,13Santos M. Schilham M.W. Rademakers L.H.P.M. Marx J.J.M. de Sousa M. Clevers H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is estimated that 1 in 10–20 individuals carry the defective HFE allele and that 1 in 200–400 Caucasians are homozygous for the disease; thus, it is the most common defective genetic trait known in humans, more prevalent than cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, and muscular dystrophy combined. The recent confirmation of its prevalence has prompted some to refer to hemochromatosis as “the genetic disorder of the 21st century” (14Barton J.C. Bertoli L.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).We have investigated control of SFT expression by iron levels and as shown by the results presented here, we observe that iron chelation enhances accumulation of SFT transcripts and that SFT protein and message levels both decline when cells are exposed to high iron. Remarkably, however, we find that SFT mRNA is significantly higher in liver from hemochromatosis patients despite massive iron deposition within this tissue. Because mucosal uptake of Fe(III), but not Fe(II), is stimulated in the β2-microglobulin knockout mouse (15Santos M. Clevers H. de Sousa M. Marx J.J.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that a ferrireductase, an Fe(II)/Fe(III) transporter, or a complex contributing both functions is up-regulated when HFE function is compromised. Thus, our findings suggest that up-regulated expression of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) transporter SFT may contribute to the etiology of hemochromatosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 300 g/liter l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin as detailed previously (10Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells, obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, MD), were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were iron-loaded with addition of 65 μm Fe-NTA (1:1) to the culture medium for the times shown. These conditions are not necessarily selective for nontransferrin-bound iron uptake, but transferrin-independent iron transport has been demonstrated in studies employing Fe-NTA (16Inman R.S.

Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fe-NTA was chosen for this investigation, because NTA is membrane-impermeable and provides a stably chelated form of Fe(III); others have shown a 4-fold increase in cellular iron content under these experimental conditions (25Alvarez-Hernandez X. Nichols G.M. Glass J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This level of Fe-NTA (65 μm) had no apparent toxicity based on cell viability and growth. Although confluent cells down-regulate SFT expression in response to iron, the extent of down-regulation is greater in dividing cells and therefore all results shown are from experiments performed on subconfluent cultures except where noted. Tissue from hemochromatosis patients and control individuals was obtained from the NIH-funded Liver Tissue Procurement and Distribution System directed by Dr. Harvey Sharp (Fairview University Hospitals and Clinics, Minneapolis, MN).Total cellular RNA was isolated using RNAzol B according to the manufacturer's direction (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX). For Northern analysis, samples were electrophoresed on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell), UV-cross-linked, then probed with randomly primed32P-labeled SFT cDNA under high stringency conditions. Blots were washed twice with 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.18 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature, twice with 1 × SSPE containing 0.25% SDS at 37 °C, followed by a final wash in 0.1 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to film 5–14 days for autoradiography. Ribonuclease protection assays utilized a cDNA fragment of SFT containing the entire 3′-noncoding region (9Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) subcloned into pBSK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) such that EcoRI-linearized plasmid could be used as a template for in vitrotranscription of 32P-labeled antisense probe; in addition to ∼400 nucleotides of noncoding SFT sequence, probes contained ∼30 bases of vector sequence such that complete digestion could be verified by the difference in electrophoretic mobility of the protected fragment. Twenty μg of total RNA was hybridized to this probe (5 × 105 cpm) for 16 h at 50 °C. Nonhybridized probe was digested with a combination of ribonuclease A (40 μg/ml) and ribonuclease T1 (2 μg/ml) for 60 min at 30 °C; nucleases were subsequently digested with proteinase K (125 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the hybridized probes were precipitated with ethanol and heat-denatured at 85 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. The gel was then dried and exposed to film for autoradiography. Molecular biology reagents were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and U. S. Biochemical Corp. The data shown are from individual experiments and represent results obtained on multiple occasions under various experimental conditions for the different cell lines and tissue specimens.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo investigate regulation of SFT expression, Northern analysis was performed with total RNA from HeLa cells grown under low, normal, and high iron conditions (Fig. 1). Treatment with the iron chelater desferrioxamine to deplete cellular iron increases SFT transcript levels, while iron-loading induces down-regulation. As shown in Fig.2 A (top panel), SFT transcripts decline to barely detectable levels within 2 days of culture in medium supplemented with 65 μm Fe-NTA. Western analysis confirms the loss of SFT synthesis over precisely the same time frame (Fig. 2 B), indicating that levels of the transport protein closely correlate with the amount of its transcript. Down-regulation of SFT message in response to high iron is completely reversible, and basal levels are restored when HeLa cells are returned to normal culture conditions (data not shown; see below).Figure 2SFT and transferrin receptors are down-regulated in response to iron-loading. A, Northern analysis of total RNA (50 μg/lane) as described for Fig. 1 is presented to demonstrate the time course of down-regulation of SFT transcripts compared with transferrin receptor message (TfR) in HeLa cells. At time 0, culture medium was supplemented with 65 μm Fe-NTA, and cells were grown for the times shown prior to RNA isolation. Detection of transferrin receptor transcripts was as described previously (36Schonhorn J.E. Akompong T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3698-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). B, Western analysis of membrane protein from HeLa cells exposed to 65 μm Fe-NTA for the times shown (0–72 h). Briefly, confluent cells from a 100-mm dish were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmEDTA, then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 85 mmsucrose, 100 mm KCl, and 20 μm EGTA. After disruption of the cells by repeated freeze/thaw, post-nuclear supernatants were collected and membrane was then isolated by ultracentrifugation with a Sorval RP100AT3 rotor at 95,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. One-hundred μg of membrane protein was loaded in each lane and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was blocked, washed, and cut to probe with anti-SFT L4 antisera (1:200 dilution) and anti-Na,K-ATPase antisera (1:5000) as indicated in the figure. Following incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000), the staining pattern shown was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-L4 antisera has been characterized previously (9Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The anti-Na,K-ATPase antisera, which is specific for the α-subunit, was a generous gift of Dr. Lorraine Santy (Harvard). The latter can be detected as a broad band on nonreducing gels, but aggregates under reducing conditions. For this experiment, detection of the α-subunit serves as a sample-loading control for each gel lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transferrin receptor synthesis also is down-regulated in response to iron-loading. When cellular iron content is low, the binding of iron-responsive regulatory protein (IRP) to iron-responsive elements (IREs) present in the 3′-untranslated region protects the receptor message against degradation. The loss of IRP mRNA binding activity under high iron conditions leads to destabilization and transcript decay (26Klausner R.D. Raoult T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, loss of transferrin receptor mRNA upon iron-loading is significantly slower than the time course observed for SFT mRNA reduction (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the latter is regulated via different mechanism(s).HeLa cells were exposed to desferrioxamine in the presence or absence of actinomycin D to study the effects of the transcription inhibitor on the accumulation of SFT mRNA. As shown in Fig.3, the SFT message is significantly reduced in both control and desferrioxamine-treated cells upon treatment with this drug, indicating that the transcript half-life is <16 h. Time course experiments revealed a t 12 ∼ 6 h for SFT mRNA isolated from cells treated with or without desferrioxamine, confirming no significant change in decay rate upon iron chelation (not shown). Although desferrioxamine-induced up-regulation of SFT mRNA levels appears to be sensitive to actinomycin D, it is important to note that our data do not directly discriminate between transcriptional and post-transcriptional events mediating SFT down-regulation under high iron conditions. However, because the IRE hexanucleotide consensus sequence, which contributes to a stem-loop structure recognized by IRPs, does not appear within the 3′-untranslated region of SFT (9Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that modulation of SFT synthesis involves stabilization of its message through IRP-controlled mechanisms.Figure 3Actinomycin D blocks up-regulation of SFT in response to iron chelation. Northern analysis of total RNA (50 μg/lane) for HeLa cells treated overnight with or without 50 μm desferrioxamine in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D. Equivalent loading was confirmed visually by ethidium bromide staining prior to hybridization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder known and results in massive iron deposition in the parenchyma of liver, kidney, pancreas, and other tissues (11Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo Jr., R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A. Hinton L.M. Jones N.L. Kimmel B.E. Kronmal G.S. Lauer P. Lee V.K. Loeb D.B. Mapa F.A. McClelland E. Meyer N.C. Mintier G.A. Moeller N. Moore T. Morikang E. Press C.E. Quintana L. Starnes S.M. Schatzman R.C. Brunke K.J. Drayna D.T. Risch N.J. Bacon B.R. Wolff R.K. Nat.

Because of the functional role in iron transport implicated for SFT and the observed iron-dependent regulation of its expression, it was of interest to study levels of SFT in liver from hemochromatosis patients. Based on the results discussed above, a prediction would be that SFT transcripts are down-regulated in the disease state. Unexpectedly, ribonuclease protection experiments reveal that liver samples from hemochromatosis patients (Fig. 4, lanes 1-6) contain 5-fold higher levels of SFT mRNA compared with control individuals (Fig.4, lanes 7–10). Western blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of SFT protein in patient liver as well (not shown). One explanation for these observations is that liver cells differentially regulate SFT expression, and to examine this possibility, the properties of SFT expression in HepG2 cells were investigated. This well differentiated human hepatoma cell line synthesizes transferrin, expresses the transferrin receptor, and distributes iron between intracellular pools in a manner similar to liver. Nonetheless, ribonuclease protection experiments confirm the loss of SFT transcripts when HepG2 cells are grown in medium supplemented with 65 μm Fe-NTA for 8 days (Fig. 4, lane 11 versus lane 12). This effect is entirely reversible: basal levels of SFT are observed in cells cultured in high iron medium for 4 days, then returned to normal medium for 4 days (lane 13), while under the same regimen, cells first grown in normal medium, then in iron-supplemented medium, have reduced SFT transcript levels. Thus, the pattern of SFT expression in HepG2 cells markedly contrasts with the increased levels of SFT mRNA observed for hemochromatosis patients.Figure 4Expression of SFT in patients with hemochromatosis, control individuals, and HepG2 cells. RNase protection analysis was performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” using 5 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled transcripts. Shown are assays to compare the extent of RNase protection obtained upon hybridization with 20 μg of total RNA isolated from liver of patients diagnosed with hemochromatosis (lanes 1-6) and for control individuals (normal tissue pathology reported) (lanes 7-10). The control lane indicates extent of digestion without addition of sample RNA and probe lane indicates initial size of the 32P-labeled in vitro transcripts used for these assays (300 cpm loaded onto gel). Also shown are results obtained for 20 μg of total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells cultured under the following matched experimental conditions: no treatment (lane 11), cells exposed to 65 μm Fe-NTA for 8 days (lane 12), cells grown in medium supplemented with 65 μm Fe-NTA for 4 days and then returned to normal medium for 4 days (lane 13), cells grown in normal medium for 4 days and then grown in medium supplemented with 65 μmFe-NTA for 4 days (lane 14). To quantitate differences between patient and controls, bands were excised, and counts/min were measured by scintillation counting. After correction for background, the control group yielded values (±S.D.) for the protected fragment of 74 ± 11.2 cpm, while patient values (±S.D.) were measured to be 369 ± 67.9 cpm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Many studies of hemochromatosis patients have evaluated differences in other molecules involved in iron metabolism, including transferrin, transferrin receptor, ferritin, and IRPs, but strong evidence to support abnormal biosynthetic control of these factors in the disease is lacking. Pietrangelo et al. (27Pietrangelo A. Rocchi E. Ferrari A. Ventura E. Cairo G. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) specifically examined expression levels of factors involved in hepatic iron metabolism and concluded that their regulation was normal in hemochromatosis patients. Nevertheless, these individuals display high levels of transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and non-transferrin-bound iron; accumulation of iron from the latter fraction may play a major role in tissue damage (28Batey R.G. Fong P.L.C. Shamir S. Sherlock S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1980; 25: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Clearly, the deposition of non-transferrin bound iron into the liver is consistent with the now well characterized function of SFT to stimulate transferrin-independent uptake of Fe(III) (9Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The discovery that SFT expression is up-regulated in the liver of hemochromatosis patients suggests that it contributes to the etiology of this disease. While the observed iron-induced down-regulation of SFT expression in HepG2 hepatocytes argues that the patients may have lost some form of iron-regulated biosynthetic control, our studies do not exclude the possibility that up-regulation of SFT message levels is indicative of a specific liver detoxification response that is necessary for the clearance of excess iron incorporated due to enhanced dietary absorption. Unfortunately, the recent elucidation of the disease gene, HFE, yields little insight about how the reciprocal relationship between storage and transport of iron is lost in hemochromatosis. HFE is an MHC class I-like molecule that appears to be expressed in nearly all tissues (11Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo Jr., R. Ellis M.C.

Such a property, which so far has never been studied independently, is investigated here by a heterotypic cell fusion approach, using a clone of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells totally incompetent for neurosecretion that still largely maintains its typical molecular and cellular phenotype. When fused with wild-type partners of various species (rat, human) and specialization (PC12, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, HeLa), the defective cells reacquire their competence as revealed by the expression of their secretion-specific proteins. Fused wild-type cells therefore appear able to complement defective cells by providing them with factor(s) inducing the reactivation of their secretory program. The mechanism of action of these factors may consist not in a coordinate unblocking of transcription but in the prevention of a rapid post-transcriptional degradation of the mRNAs for secretion-specific genes.

Regulated exocytosis, a fundamental activity of neurosecretory cells, is among the processes most intensely investigated. So far, however, the studies have focussed primarily on the identification of the proteins involved and on the mechanistic interactions that underly vesicle discharge (1Rothman J.E.

In contrast, the way by which neurosecretory cells become competent for neurosecretion has received much less attention. Competence acquisition requires the appearance of specific organelles, dense-core (DV) 1The abbreviations used are: DV, dense-core vesicle(s); SLV, clear or synaptic-like vesicle(s); CgB, chromogranin B; Sph, synaptophysin; Syt, synaptotagmin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; SgII, secretogranin II. 1The abbreviations used are: DV, dense-core vesicle(s); SLV, clear or synaptic-like vesicle(s); CgB, chromogranin B; Sph, synaptophysin; Syt, synaptotagmin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; SgII, secretogranin II.and clear or synaptic-like (SLV) vesicles, an event that takes place during phenotype development. Because of this temporal coincidence, the first process is widely envisaged as a step of the second (5Anderson D.J.

To investigate the relationships between competence and phenotype, we used clones isolated from a neurosecretory cell model, the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 line (7Clementi E. Racchetti G. Zacchetti D.

Most PC12 clones, indicated here as wild-type clones, exhibit DVs from which exocytic release of secretory proteins and catecholamines occurs after appropriate stimulation. Moreover, Western blots, immunocytochemistry, and patch clamping document in these clones the expression and discharge of acetylcholine-containing SLVs (8Corradi N. Borgonovo B. Clementi E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An additional clone has been found to lack en block both types of secretory vesicles,i.e. to be neurosecretion incompetent, no matter whether analyzed at rest or after a variety of stimulatory treatments, while maintaining numerous markers typical of PC12 and other neurosecretory cells (7Clementi E.

These results suggest the lack in the defective clone of one or more factors that impart to the cells their neurosecretion competence, acting independently, at least in part, from the factors governing the rest of the phenotype (8Corradi N. Borgonovo B. Clementi E. Bassetti M. Racchetti G. Consalez G.G. Huttner W.B. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Biol.

Here we report direct evidence supporting this hypothesis, showing that defective PC12 cells reacquire their competence when fused to various types of wild-type cells, regardless of their species of origin and of their specialization. Moreover, molecular results suggest competence to be conferred not at the transcriptional but at a post-transcriptional level. Control (clones 15 and 251) and defective (clone 27) rat pheochromocytoma PC12 clones, all resistant to G418 due to their stable transfection with an appropriate construct, and the PC12-27 subclone (c7) resistant also to hygromycin-B and expressing the human isoform of chromogranin B (CgB) have been described (7Clementi E.

The diversity of defective PC12-27 with respect to control clones (such as PC12-15 and PC12-251, Fig.1 A) should first be discussed. In terms of microscopy (Fig. 1, A and B) and neurosecretory markers (7Clementi E. Racchetti G. Zacchetti D. Panzeri M.C. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Corradi N. Borgonovo B. Clementi E. Bassetti M. Racchetti G. Consalez G.G. Huttner W.B. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Biol.

Zacchetti D. Panzeri M.C. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PC12-27 cells, however, lack not only DVs and SLVs (7Clementi E. Racchetti G. Zacchetti D. Panzeri M.C. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but also their cargo and membrane proteins (including CgB, Fig. 1 B; SgII; VAMP-2; Syt; Sph) (7Clementi E. Racchetti G.

The defect of PC12-27 is not restricted to the secretory organelles but includes many (if not all) of the components participating in the regulated exocytosis/endocytosis cycle, such as the G protein, rab3a, and the tSNAREs present in the plasmalemma, syntaxin-1, and SNAP-25 (7Clementi E.

From here on the proteins mentioned so far will be referred to as secretion-specific. In conclusion, PC12-27 do not appear as undifferentiated cells. Rather, they are PC12 that, although possessing properties typical of the neurosecretory phenotype, are totally incompetent for regulated neurosecretion. To establish whether neurosecretion competence operates under positive or negative control, parallel cell aliquots of the defective 27 and the control 15 PC12 clones were loaded with either orange or green fluorescent vital dyes (18Jaroszeski M.J. Gilbert R. Heller R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), fused with PEG 4000 (19Galfré G. Howe S.C. Milstein C. Butcher G.W. Horward J.C. Nature. 1977; 266: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) and sorted by FACS. The cells exhibiting double fluorescence (Fig. 1 I), were processed by immunolabeling (confocal microscopy) and for electron microscopy. Of these fused cells, the homotypic 27/27 never showed appearance of DVs and secretion-specific proteins (Fig. 1 C and not shown), whereas the 15/15 never showed any loss of them (not shown). In contrast, over 90% of the 27/15 hybrids resembled controls in their punctate immunolabeling for DV and SLV proteins as seen already 48 h after fusion until weeks later (Fig. 1, D and Efor CgB and Fig. 1 F for Sph). At the electron microscope, numerous DVs were seen in the hybrids, localized preferentially below the plasmalemma (Fig. 1, G and H) as in control PC12 (23Banerjee A. Barry A.V. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, when a hybrid population was pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate, release of [35S]-CgB was found to take place by typical regulated exocytosis. Such a release, in fact, required a period of chase after the pulse, necessary for the transport of labeled protein to DVs, and depolarization (with high K+) in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 2) (8Corradi N.

This suggests neurosecretion competence to be controlled positively and not negatively. Further information was obtained by additional inter-PC12 fusions, carried out with two defective PC12 clones, both incompetent for neurosecretion, PC12-27 (8Corradi N. Borgonovo B. Clementi E.

Menegon A. Benfenati F. Toniolo D. Valtorta F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 12Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The 27/Trk hybrids, resistant to hygromycin-B, were identified by double immunostaining for TrkA and human CgB. Their neurosecretion competence was investigated by an antibody specific for the rat isoform of CgB, with consistently negative results. In fact, neither expression of the rat secretory protein nor changes in the distribution of the human CgB from Golgi to punctate were observed (not shown), suggesting that no complementation had taken place. The results therefore appear compatible with the possibility that the same regulatory factor(s) lacking in PC12-27 is (are) responsible also for the defect in the Trk clone. An important point that could not be established with the inter-PC12 fusion experiments is whether the competent phenotype of the hybrids resulting from the PC12-27 and PC12-15 fusions was due to the contribution of control cells, whose competence was unaffected by the fusion with defective cells, or also to competence reacquisition by the latter. In fact, no way was available to distinguish the products coded by the genes of the two partners. To investigate the question, the approach was extended to human cells, and CgB expressed by the hybrids was identified with specific anti-rat and anti-human antibodies. Two human lines were employed: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (Fig. 3, a,A, and A′), whose cells are able to acquire some neurosecretion competence upon differentiation (24Giudici A.M. Sher E. Pelagi M. Clementi F. Zanini A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 383-389PubMed Google Scholar), and epithelial HeLa (not shown). After fusion with PC12-27, the preparations were exposed to G418 to eliminate the unfused human cells, which are sensitive to the antibiotic. The rat/human hybrids were identified by specific immunostaining for various human antigens, including β1-integrin (15Fabbri M. Castellani P. Gotwals P.J. Kotelianski V. Zardi L. Zocchi M.R. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the unfused PC12-27, SH-SY5Y, and HeLa cells, as well as in all homotypic fusions, no signal for DV and SLV proteins could ever be appreciated (Fig. 3 A′ and not shown). In contrast, clear positivity was recorded in many but not all hybrids of both the PC12-27/SH-SY5Y (Fig. 3, B′ and C′) and the PC12-27/HeLa (Fig. 3, D′ and E′) type. Even more important, the CgB expressed by the hybrids was recognized specifically by the anti-rat antibody (Fig. 3, B′ and D′), for which human cells are negative (Fig. 3 A′), with a distribution coinciding with that of the other secretion-specific proteins, including Syt (Fig. 3, C′ and E′). In contrast with the anti-human CgB antibody, no immunostaining was appreciated. In terms of intensity and distribution, the signal for the rat CgB and the other vesicle proteins in PC12-27/SH-SY5Y hybrids resembled that of control PC12, whereas in PC12-27/HeLa it was less prominent and more clustered in areas that might correspond to the Golgi complex (Fig. 3, D′ and E′). In the latter, therefore, the intracellular traffic of secretion-specific proteins was possibly delayed. Still, a punctate distribution of the label was also visible (cf. Fig. 3, B′–E′ to Fig. 1, A andD–F), and typical DVs were recognized by electron microscopy (not shown). We conclude, therefore, that the neurosecretion competence established in the hybrids, no matter whether by fusion with SH-SY5Y or HeLa cells, was sustained by the expression of secretion-specific proteins encoded by genes of PC12-27 cells. In previous studies, Northern blot assays of PC12-27 cells had revealed the mRNAs levels for several missing cargo and membrane vesicle proteins to be much lower (0–8%) than in controls, with no major changes of their long term turnover (8Corradi N. Borgonovo B. Clementi E. Bassetti M. Racchetti G. Consalez G.G. Huttner W.B. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27116-27124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the defect of clone 27 consists of a blockade of transcription of the secretion-specific genes. When, however, run-on experiments were carried out (Fig. 4, left panel), the results appeared incompatible with the above conclusion, because of the three transcripts investigated, the PC12-27 signal was decreased (moderately) for only one (the vesicle membrane vSNARE, VAMP-2) and unchanged or even increased by 2-fold for the others (the secretory proteins, CgB and SgII) (Fig. 4, left panel). These major discrepancies between Northern blots and run-on results appeared specific to PC12-27 cells. When in fact a nonsecretory cell type (Fisher rat fibroblasts) was analyzed, a good match between the very low or negative Northern blots for the three mRNAs and the hardly appreciable (SgII) or completely negative (CgB and VAMP-2) run-on signals was observed (not shown). To explain the PC12-27 transcription results, a variety of control experiments were carried out. The possibility that the excess SgII run-on signal was due to transcriptional attenuation (25Miller H. Asselin C. Dufort D. Yang J.Q. Gupta K. Marcu K.B. Nepveu A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5340-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) could be excluded because (a) the results obtained with the whole cDNA were duplicated using probes containing either the 5′ or the 3′ sequences (Fig. 4, left panel) and (b) no additional mRNA fragments (including unspliced or partially spliced transcripts) but only the processed bands (accounting for ∼5% of controls) were revealed by RNase protection (Fig. 4, right panel). Moreover, when the latter assay was carried out in PC12-27 by using a sense RNA probe, no signal appeared, thus excluding transcription of the noncoding strand (26Farrell M.C.M. Lewis N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3400-3408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in the SgII gene (Fig. 4,right panel). Also unlikely appears a blockade of mRNA transport across the nuclear envelope, with ensuing retention into the nucleus. In fact, when the nuclear and cytoplasmic SgII and VAMP-2 mRNAs were assayed separately by Northern blot, their ratios were found to be the same in PC12-27 and PC12-15 clones (not shown), despite the huge differences of the absolute values. Taken as a whole, our fusion results provide information about neurosecretion competence. Only when the fusion of PC12-27 cells was homotypic or with the cells of another similarly defective PC12 clone, Trk, did the resulting cells remain incompetent; otherwise they were mostly competent for neurosecretion. Moreover, the results with rat/human hybrids (fusions of PC12-27 with either SH-SY5Y or HeLa) demonstrate that the competence was sustained by the reactivation of the PC12 program with expression of gene products that, before fusion, were not expressed in the defective clone. The simplest hypothesis that emerges from our data is that one or more regulatory factors are complemented by the partner to the defective cell and that this is enough to re-establish the competence of the latter. At the moment, we know neither the nature nor the timing of expression of these factors. They may be stably expressed by cells and preexist therefore fusions. Alternatively, expression could start only in the hybrid, in response to signals contributed by the fused PC12. In the study of the mechanisms that sustain competence expression, a complete dissociation was observed between RNase protection and Northern blot on the one side and run-on on the other side. The significance of these tests is different. The first two reveal the steady state levels of specific transcripts distinguishing in addition (RNase protection) unspliced and partially spliced fragments as well as other artifacts, which were not found in PC12-27 cells. Run-on, on the other hand, reveals the elongation of the transcripts taking place in isolated nuclei incubated in vitro (22Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience Publishers, New York1989: 4.10.1-4.10.4Google Scholar). In view of these differences, we cannot exclude that an inhibition of transcription, effective in intact cells, was relieved during isolation of the nuclei. It should be noted, however, that (a) to our knowledge a process of this kind has never been reported and (b) in our hands, it did not occur in a true non-neurosecretory cell type, Fisher rat fibroblasts. In addition, the PC12 results cannot be explained by the degradation of rapidly turning-over protein(s) specifically regulating the breakdown of secretion-specific mRNAs because preincubation with cycloheximide (7 μm for up to 5 h) did not induce appreciable changes of the SgII mRNA levels either in control or in defective PC12 (Northern blots, not shown). The hypothesis that we favor is therefore that in PC12-27 transcription of secretion-specific genes is followed by an extensive product degradation, not present in controls, occurring immediately after or even during the course of RNA synthesis. Direct evidence for the latter process is still missing in the present experimental model. However, RNA binding proteins regulating initial steps of gene product degradation have been described in the brain (25Miller H. Asselin C. Dufort D. Yang J.Q. Gupta K. Marcu K.B. Nepveu A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5340-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Farrell M.C.M. Lewis N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3400-3408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results identify one of the fundamental properties of neurosecretory cells, their competence for neurosecretion, as a regulated process that cells can lose en block by arresting the expression of their secretion-specific proteins without fully compromising their typical phenotype. Reappearance of rat secretion-specific proteins after fusion of defective PC12 to partners strongly suggests the existence of governing factor(s) that PC12-27 cells are unable to express. Our findings may ultimately open a new chapter in the field of neurosecretory cell differentiation. In addition, the discovery of new mechanisms could have impact also in applicative fields, such as cell engineering and cell transplantation where the role of neurosecretory cells has remained so far only marginal. We are grateful to Flavia Valtorta for the generous gift of the PC12-Trk defective clone, to Antonio Malgaroli and Mara Zocchi for the anti-Syt and anti-β1-integrin antibodies, to W. B. Huttner and H. H. Gerdes for the SgII and CgB genomic DNAs, and to Silvia Heltai for the FACS sorting experiments."

This work studies the influence of the Ras effector c-Raf-1 on the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) on Ha-Ras in vitro. Purified GEFs (the catalytic domain of yeast Sdc25p and the full-length and catalytic domain of mouse CDC25Mm) and the Ras binding domains (RBDs) of Raf-1 (Raf (1–149) and Raf (51–131)) were used. Our results show that not only the intrinsic GTP/GTP exchange on Ha-Ras but also the GEF-stimulated exchange is inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the RBDs of Raf. Conversely, the scintillation proximity assay, which monitors the effect of GEF on the Ras·Raf complex, showed that the binding of Raf and GEF to Ha-Ras·GTP is mutually exclusive. The various GEFs used yielded comparable results. It is noteworthy that under more physiological conditions mimicking the cellular GDP/GTP ratio, Raf enhances the GEF-stimulated GDP/GTP exchange on Ha-Ras, in agreement with the sequestration of Ras·GTP by Raf. Consistent with our results, the GEF-stimulated exchange of Ha-Ras·GTP was also inhibited by another effector of Ras, the RBD (amino acid residues 133–314) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110α.

The interference between Ras effectors and GEF could be a regulatory mechanism to promote the activity of Ha-Ras in the cell. The Ha-Ras p21 protein is a central element for the transmission of extracellular signals within the cell, interacting with a growing number of regulators and effectors (1Macara I.G. Lounsbury K.M.

The regulators enhance the two basic intrinsic activities of Ras: 1) the hydrolysis of GTP, and 2) the GDP/GTP exchange, two reactions stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; p120-GAP, human rasGAP; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; C-Sdc25p, catalytic domain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae of 550 amino acid residues; CDC25Mm, mouse rasGEF (p140-GRF); C-CDC25Mm-285, catalytic domain of CDC25Mm comprising 285 amino acid residues; RBD, Ras-binding domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thio-triphosphate); SPA, scintillation proximity assay; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol. and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), respectively (6Boguski M.S.

The effectors transmit the downstream signal to pathways controlling growth, differentiation, and other fundamental processes of the cell. Despite a multitude of in vitro andin vivo studies, the coordination mechanisms by which the activity of Ha-Ras is regulated are only now beginning to be defined. It is important to mention here that the interaction of protein ligands with Ha-Ras bears a specific difference in that GAPs and effectors show a much higher affinity for Ha-Ras·GTP than for Ha-Ras·GDP, whereas GEFs act on Ras·GTP and Ras·GDP with nearly the same efficiency (3Marshall C.

The common property of GAPs and Ras effectors to show a pronounced specificity for activated Ras is in line with the proposed role of p120-GAP not only as GTPase-activating protein but also as an effector of Ras (12Pronk G.I. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this, the best investigated effector of Ha-Ras, c-Raf-1, competes with p120-GAP and neurofibromin for binding to Ras·GTP (2Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Another effector of Ha-Ras is RalGDS, a GDP/GTP exchange factor of RalA p24 and RalB p24. RalGDS interacts with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and inhibits the binding of both Raf-1 and GAP to Ha-Ras (16Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this context, we have recently described that in vitrop120-GAP protects the active state of p21 from unproductive exchanges of bound GTPγS after the accomplishment of the GEF-stimulated GDP/GTP exchange on Ras (17Giglione C. Parrini M.C. Baouz S. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25128-25134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is possible that other protein ligands of Ras, such as Raf, may act similar to GAP to compete with GEF for binding to Ha-Ras·GTP and consequently to be involved not only downstream of p21 but also upstream on the activation mechanism leading to the GDP/GTP exchange on Ha-Ras p21. In agreement with this is the finding that in fibroblast cell lines, a mutant of a platelet-derived growth factor receptor lacking the ability to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), another putative effector of Ras p21, is unable to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange on Ras p21. Moreover, when expressed inXenopus oocytes, a constitutively active form of PI3K increased the amount of GTP bound to Ras p21 (18Satoh T. Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Kaziro Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3706-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Because no in vitro experiment demonstrating an interference between effectors such as Raf or PI3K and GEFs has yet been reported, in this work, we have analyzed the influence of Raf on the action of GEF to shed more light on the mechanism controlling the activation of Ha-Ras. We have found that the binding of Raf and GEF to Ha-Ras·GTP is mutually exclusive. Furthermore, we have provided evidence supporting the ability of PI3K to inhibit the GEF-stimulated exchange on the active state of Ha-Ras. The competition between GEF and Raf or PI3K is proposed to represent a mechanism to selectively promote the productive GDP/GTP exchange. This would confer a dual role to the effector as a transmitter of the downstream signal of Ras and as an upstream regulator of Ras activation. pGEX-KG encoding Raf residues 1–149 was provided by Dr. M. S. Marshall (Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) and grown in DH5α cells. BL21 cells containing pGEX 2T encoding Raf residues 51–131 were provided by Dr. P. N. Lowe (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, UK). The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 400 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of both GST-Raf proteins was induced overnight at 24 °C by adding 0.01 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a cell density of 0.4A 600 units. The cell culture, which was chilled to 4 °C at 2.0A 600 units, was centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 35 ml of Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, and 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication and the addition of 1% Triton X-100, the suspension was centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant, which was mixed batchwise with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), was gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with Buffer A, and the protein eluted with glutathione (3 mg/ml) was concentrated to 3 ml with Aquacide II (Calbiochem) and dialyzed against 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 14 mm ME, and 50% glycerol. The protein solutions were stable for more than 1 year when stored at −20 °C. TheEscherichia coli strain SCS-1 was transformed with a pGEX vector containing the 3′-terminal region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDC25 gene encoding the last 550 C-terminal residues and was grown at 24 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The procedure for the induction and purification of C-Sdc25p, as described by Poullet et al. (11Poullet P. Créchet J.B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was used with the following modifications. The induction of C-Sdc25p was started at a cell density of 0.3 A 600 unit using 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 24 °C. The cells, which were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, were washed with 150 mm NaCl. The pellet was then resuspended in 60 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 7 mm ME, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Pefabloc (Boehringer), 4 mg/ml lysozyme, and 100 μg/ml DNase 1. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged twice at 17,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was mixed batchwise for 20 min at 4 °C with 10 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma), equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 7 mm ME, 10% glycerol, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). The glutathione-agarose suspension was washed four times with Buffer B. The GST-C-Sdc25p fusion protein bound to the resin was then cleaved with 5 units/ml human thrombin (Sigma) in 5 ml of Buffer B for 30 min at 30 °C. The supernatant was recovered, and the procedure was repeated once more. The solutions of GST-cleaved C-Sdc25p were concentrated with Aquacide II, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm ME, and 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Bacteria expressing the RBD (amino acid residues 133–314) of PI3K p110α were provided by Dr. J. Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). The cells were grown at 37 °C in 400 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of GST-PI3K RBD protein was induced overnight at 24 °C by adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a cell density of 0.5 A 600 units. The cell culture, which was chilled to 4 °C at 2.0A 600 units, was centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 35 ml of Buffer A containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication and the addition of 1% Triton X-100, the suspension was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant, which was mixed batchwise with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), was gently shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed six times with Buffer A, and the protein eluted with glutathione (3 mg/ml) was concentrated to 1 ml with Aquacide II (Calbiochem), dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 14 mm ME, and 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Dissociation of the p21·nucleotide complexes was determined at 30 °C by the nitrocellulose binding assay. The p21·[3H]GDP, p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS, and p21·[3H]GTP complexes were obtained by incubating Ha-Ras p21·GDP with a 10-fold excess of [3H]GDP (340 Bq·pmol−1), [γ-35S]GTPγS (4140 Bq·pmol−1), and [3H]GTP (270 Bq·pmol−1), respectively, for 10 min at 30 °C in Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). 3 mm MgCl2 was then added to stabilize the p21·nucleotide complex. The dissociation was started by the addition of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled nucleotide with or without GEF, Raf, and PI3K. For details, see the figure legends. At various time intervals, aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn and passed on nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm of Sartorius SM 11 306), and the retained radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (model Wallac 1410; Pharmacia). The rate constants were calculated as described previously (10Jacquet E. Baouz S. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12347-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Créchet J.B.

The p21·[3H]GTP complexes were obtained by incubating Ha-Ras p21 with a 5-fold excess of [3H]GTP (360 Bq·pmol−1) for 10 min at 30 °C in Buffer C. MgCl2 (3 mm) was then added to stabilize the p21·nucleotide complex. The standard assay was performed in Eppendorf test tubes as follows: a solution (25 μl) containing different concentrations of C-Sdc25p, full-length CDC25Mm, or C-CDC25Mm-285 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was prepared; 2 mm dithiothreitol was added to each sample, followed by 175 μl of a mixture of p21·[3H]GTP (0.03 μm), anti-GST IgG (Molecular Probes; 0.02 mg/ml), GST-Raf (51–131) (0.05 μm), and protein A SPA beads (4.2 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm MgCl2. Control assays in which either GST-Raf (51–131) or GEF was omitted were also done. Bovine serum albumin was routinely included in the assays to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The Eppendorf test tubes were sealed, shaken for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 760 × g for 2 min, and after equilibration at room temperature for 5 min, the radioactivity was counted in a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter. After subtraction of the blanks, the SPA signal was expressed as a percentage of the Ras/GST-Raf binding relative to the control value obtained in the absence of GEF proteins. Full-length CDC25Mm (p140-GRF), its catalytic domain C-CDC25Mm-285, and Ha-Ras were produced and purified as described previously (23Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using a 12% acrylamide gel (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 225: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and, in the case of p21, it was also checked by [3H]GDP binding as determined by the nitrocellulose filter assay. Because both GEF and Raf act on the active state of Ha-Ras, we have searched for competition phenomena between the activities of these two proteins. For a proper analysis of the effect of Raf on the GEF activity on Ras, we first examined the influence of Raf on the intrinsic exchange activity of Ha-Ras, a parameter that has already been investigated by Herrmann et al. (15Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using a fluorescence anisotropy assay and mantGpp(NH)p. The two Raf RBDs used, Raf (51–131) and Raf (1–149), were purified as GST-fusions, and their effects on the [γ-35S]GTPγS dissociation from the Ha-Ras·[γ-35S]GTPγS complex were determined. Both fragments behaved as nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, because the dissociation of GTPγS from Ha-Ras decreased after the addition of Raf proteins. Fig. 1 A illustrates the apparent dissociation rate constant (k′ −1) of the Ha-Ras·[γ-35S]GTPγS complex as a function of increasing concentrations of GST-Raf (51–131). GST-Raf (51–131) almost completely inhibited the dissociation of [γ-35S]GTPγS from Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B), in agreement with the findings of Herrmann et al. (15Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), who reported a dissociation constant of 18 nm for the affinity between GST-Raf (51–131) and Ras. From the experiments shown in theinset of Fig. 1 A, a comparableK′ d value (12 nm) was obtained. Under the same experimental conditions used for GST-Raf (51–131), an inhibitory effect was also observed in the presence of GST-Raf (1–149). In this case (Fig.2 A), the apparent dissociation rate constant was decreased from 4.9·10−3min−1 to 3·10−3 min−1, which corresponds to a 40% inhibition of the intrinsic GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras p21 (Fig. 2 B). The estimatedK′ d between Ha-Ras·[γ-35S]GTPγS and GST-Raf (1–149) was ∼150 nm, i.e. higher than that calculated for GST-Raf (51–131) and in agreement with the lower affinity of GST-Raf (1–149) for Ras p21 (25Ghosh S.

In A, the intrinsic dissociation rate constants of p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS complexes (30 nm) were calculated from 120-min kinetic experiments in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-Raf (1–149) (▪). In B, the percentages of inhibition of intrinsic GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras were determined versus the intrinsic GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras in the absence of GST-Raf (1–149) (■) that was taken as 100% activity. The values represent the mean of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras can be stimulated by different guanine nucleotide exchange factors, including the catalytic domain of S. cerevisiae Sdc25p (C-Sdc25p), a model GEF that acts equally well on Ha-Ras p21 and Ras2p (8Créchet J.B.

Rensland H. Gideon P. Schlichting L. Wittinghofer A. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, A and B, C-Sdc25p enhances the GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras, but this effect can be relieved by the addition of increasing concentrations of GST-Raf (51–131) (Fig. 3 A) or GST-Raf (1–149) (Fig.3 B). By repeating these experiments using different concentrations of GST-Raf (51–131) and 20 nm C-Sdc25p, thek′ −1 of the Ha-Ras·[γ-35S]GTPγS complex decreased from 3·10−2 min−1 to 0.08·10−2min−1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). From these results, one can see that GST-Raf (51–131) has the ability to inhibit the GEF-stimulated GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras up to approximately 100% (Fig. 3 D). In the case of GST-Raf (1–149), the k′ −1 of the Ha-Ras·[γ-35S]GTPγS complex decreased in a concentration-dependent manner from 3·10−2min−1 to 0.7·10−2 min−1, which corresponds to an 80% inhibition of the GEF-induced GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras (Fig. 3 D). By comparing the inhibition due to Raf RBD fragments on GTPγS/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras in the presence and absence of GEF, our results show that Raf RBDs inhibit not only the intrinsic exchange on the active form of Ras but also the capacity of GEF to stimulate this exchange. Substitution of GTPγS with GTP gave the same results (data not shown). We also checked whether the Raf effect was dependent on the active state of Ha-Ras, the target of Raf. As expected, because Raf does not interact with the inactive GDP-bound state of Ha-Ras, no effect of Raf RBDs on the GEF-dependent GDP/GDP exchange on p21 could be detected (data not shown). The ability of Raf to interfere with GEF prompted us to carry out a similar experiment with PI3K to clarify whether the dual effect of Raf to act upstream and downstream on Ras could also be extended to other ligands of Ras, as suggested in the case of PI3K by in vivo results (18Satoh T. Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Kaziro Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3706-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To this purpose, we have used the RBD (amino acid residues 133–314) of PI3K p110α (29Viciana P.R. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and determined its effect on the activity of the exchange factor. Fig. 4 A illustrates the action of increasing concentrations of GST-PI3K RBD on thek′ −1 of the Ha-Ras·[3H]GTP complex in the presence and absence of C-Sdc25p. At a concentration of 20 nm C-Sdc25p, the k′ −1 of Ha-Ras·[3H]GTP decreased from 3·10−2min−1 to 1.3·10−2 min−1 in a dose-dependent manner. Substitution of GTP with GTPγS (Fig. 4 B) gave the same results, showing a complete inhibition of the C-Sdc25p-dependent exchange on Ha-Ras at 3.6 μm GST-PI3K RBD. We could estimate that the IC50 of GST-PI3K RBD on C-Sdc25p activity was about 500 nm. In contrast to Raf-1 RBDs, the GST-PI3K RBD does not seem to influence the intrinsic exchange activity of Ha-Ras (Fig. 4,A and B). The inhibition of GEF activity was very likely the result of a reversible competition between Raf proteins and the exchange factor for binding to the active form of Ha-Ras, because increasing the C-Sdc25p concentration reversed the inhibitory effect of Raf (data not shown). To determine whether the interaction of Raf RBD with the active form of Ras directly affected the binding of GEF to Ras, we performed experiments in which Ras was displaced from the Ras·Raf complex, and the amount of the remaining complex was determined by SPA. This technology can be used to detect the binding or inhibition of binding without requiring a separation step, i.e. under equilibrium conditions of binding. A SPA procedure using protein A fluoromicrospheres coated with anti-GST was used to measure the binding of GST-Raf (51–131) to Ras complexed with [3H]GTP (21Skinner R.H. Picardo M. Gane N.M. Cook N.D. Morgan L. Rowedder J. Lowe P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6713-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This procedure has allowed us to monitor the effect of GEF on the interaction between GST-Raf and Ha-Ras·[3H]GTP. As shown in Fig.5 A, increasing concentrations of C-Sdc25p result in a decrease in the signal generated by the GST-Raf binding to Ha-Ras·[3H]GTP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a competition between C-Sdc25p and GST-Raf (51–131) for binding to Ha-Ras·[3H]GTP. The concentration of C-Sdc25p inhibiting 50% of Raf/Ras binding was about 1.2 μm. A useful control to check the validity of our results was the omission of GST-Raf (51–131) from the assay. In this condition, we have not observed any increase in counts. Because recent studies (30Jones M.K. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1782-1787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicate that CDC25Mm selectively activates Ha-Ras in vivo, we have monitored the interactions between Raf and Ras in a homologous mammalian system by assessing the ability of full-length CDC25Mm to compete with GST-Raf (51–131) for binding to Ha-Ras·[3H]GTP. Also, in this system, increasing concentrations of full-length CDC25Mm reduced the signal given by the Raf binding to Ras (Fig. 5 B). However, because the isolation of purified CDC25Mm in concentrations higher than the micromolar range is still problematic due to aggregation phenomena leading to the inactivation of the protein (23Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we could only use a final concentration of mammalian GEF (430 nm) that induced a 20% inhibition of Ras/Raf binding in the assay. This inhibition corresponds to that obtained with the same concentration of C-Sdc25p. By using higher concentrations (up to micromolar concentrations) of its catalytic domain C-CDC25Mm-285 (10Jacquet E. Baouz S. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12347-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we could inhibit more than 50% of the Ras/Raf binding (Fig. 5 C). This is the first demonstration that an effector can block the physical interaction between the active form of Ras and GEF, showing that these two proteins cannot be bound simultaneously to the active form of Ras. To evaluate the implication of the inhibitory effect of Raf RBDs on GEF in the regeneration of the active form of Ha-Ras and, consequently, to examine the possibility of correlating these observations in vitro with the physiological conditions in the cell, we tested the influence of Raf RBD in a system in which all the molecules of p21 were initially in the inactive GDP-bound form, and the molar ratio of the free nucleotides GDP and GTP or GTPγS corresponded to the value estimated to occur in the cell. Fig.6 A illustrates the action of full-length CDC25Mm on Ha-Ras p21·[3H]GDP in the presence and absence of 600 nm GST-Raf (51–131) and at a [3H]GDP and GTPγS molar ratio of 1:10. At a concentration of 200 nm CDC25Mm, the presence of GST-Raf (51–131) enhances the CDC25Mm-dependent stimulation of the GDP/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras, as determined by following the dissociation of [3H]GDP from the Ha-Ras p21·[3H]GDP complex. Because the enhancement induced under these experimental conditions by GST-Raf (51–131) on the GEF-dependent stimulation on Ha-Ras, although significant, was not so drastic, we have verified this phenomenon using a complementary system in which Ha-Ras p21 was prebound with unlabeled GDP, and the free GTPγS was substituted with [3H]GTP or [γ-35S]GTPγS. In this system, we monitored the exchange reaction as association of labeled free [3H]GTP (Fig. 6 B) or [γ-35S]GTPγS (Fig.6 C) stimulated by CDC25Mm in the presence and absence of GST-Raf (51–131). In both cases, the regeneration of the active form of Ras by GEF proteins was increased by the presence of Raf, confirming the results presented in Fig. 6 A. These data show that the Raf inhibition of the GEF activity by sequestration of the active form of Ha-Ras favors the interaction between the exchange factor and Ha-Ras·GDP, its physiological substrate. In the GDP/GTP cycle of Ras proteins, the reversibility of all partial steps of the nucleotide·p21 inte"

A peak of elevated PTP activity was detected in whole cell lysates after 15–20 min of treatment of the cells with high KCl, glucose, or TPA, which did not appear upon treatment with control compounds. Neither was it detected in cells that do not undergo regulated secretion. The PTP activation was transient, SDS-resistant, and localized to the cytoskeleton fraction of cells. The cytoskeletal localization of IAR, a receptor-like PTP associated with secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells, suggested the possibility that IAR is the secretagogue-activated PTP. The transient expression of human IAR in βTC3 and HIT-T15 β cells, followed by treatment with secretagogues or control compounds and immunoprecipitation of human IAR, showed that immunoprecipitates from the secretagogue-treated cells contained an elevated PTP activity. The secretagogue-induced activation of IAR had identical kinetics to that of the endogenous PTP. Although ectopic IAR was present in membrane and cytoskeletal fractions from the cells, only the cytoskeleton-associated IAR could be activated. Thus IAR represents the endogenous secretagogue-responsive PTP, or at least a component of it, and is one of the few receptor-like PTPs for which enzymatic activation has been demonstrated. Insulin secretion is detected prior to IAR activation, suggesting that IAR is not required for immediate secretion but likely plays a role in events downstream of insulin secretion or in another pathway related to the specialized function of secretory cells.

In addition to the constitutive secretory pathway, endocrine, neuronal, and exocrine cells also possess a regulated secretory pathway in which particular stimuli induce the release of secretory granule contents. Although reversible phosphorylation is the predominant mechanism of regulation of cellular processes, little is known of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, especially those involving the modification of tyrosine residues, in regulated exocytosis. In the pancreatic β cell, insulin secretion can be effected by a variety of stimulants, with high plasma glucose being the major physiological stimulus (reviewed in Refs. 1Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B.

These PTPs have highly homologous intracellular regions (74% amino acid identity) and less closely related extracellular regions (24% amino acid identity). Within neurons and β-islet cells, IA-2 is an intrinsic membrane protein of secretory granules that undergo regulated exocytosis (36Solimena M. Dirkx Jr., R. Hermel J.-M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of IA-2 is extended into the granule lumen and is thus more appropriately termed the luminal region, with the intracellular region facing into the cytosol. Stimulation of exocytosis in RIN cells results in exposure of IA-2 at the cell surface, from which it is internalized and resorted in the Golgi complex to nascent secretory granules. Likewise IAR is localized to the membrane of insulinoma cell secretory granules with the same N-terminal and cytosolic C-terminal orientation as IA-2 (31Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Both IA-2 and IAR have a conserved PTP catalytic domain in the intracellular region, and the recombinant intracellular region of IAR has been demonstrated to have PTP activity in vitro toward two artificial substrates, pNPP and phosphotyrosyl-casein (32Cui L. Yu W.-P. DeAizpurua H.J. Schmidli R.S. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24817-24823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This activity is extremely low compared with that of similar forms of other PTPs and may indicate that IAR has high substrate selectivity or other cellular requirements for activity. Nevertheless, the catalytic capability of IAR, in conjunction with its subcellular localization as a membrane protein of secretory granules, suggests a potential enzymatic role for this PTP in regulated secretion. To investigate the role of PTPs in regulated secretion, we have examined secretagogue-induced alterations in PTP activity in the pancreatic β cell lines βTC-3, HIT-T15, and RIN. We provide evidence that cytoskeleton-associated PTP activity, a component of which is IAR, is stimulated by insulin secretagogues. The kinetics of PTP activation suggest that this phosphatase is unlikely to be required for secretion but is involved in later, secretion-stimulated processes. The cDNA encoding the full-length human IAR protein (GenBankTM accession number AF007555) and with the 5′-untranslated region replaced with the Kozak consensus sequence CCACC (32Cui L. Yu W.-P.

Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) to create pXJ41-hIAR-neo. A fragment containing the IAR active site sequence was released from pXJ41-hIAR-neo using EcoRV and NheI and replaced with the corresponding fragment from pGEX-3C-hIAR(C945S) (32Cui L. Yu W.-P.

The RIN 5AH and βTC3 cells were gifts from H. DeAizpurua. The RIN 5AH cells were subcloned by limiting dilution to reduce the observed cell-to-cell variation in insulin secretion, and the subclone RIN 5AH-12 was chosen for experimental work. The HIT-T15 cells were purchased from the ATCC (passages 66–72), as were COS-1 and NIH 3T3 cells. The RIN 5AH-12 cells were cultured in RPMI (10 mm Hepes) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The HIT-T15 cells were grown in F12K medium containing 10% dialyzed horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. The βTC-3 and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin, and COS-1 cells were maintained in the same medium but with 1 g/liter glucose. Transient transfections of the above cells were carried out with plasmid DNA (10 μg/10-cm dish or 30 μg/15-cm dish) and LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the amount of total DNA equalized between transfections by the addition of the empty plasmid pXJ41-neo. The cells were maintained in medium with serum for 24 h prior to harvesting. Cells at 50–60% confluency were rinsed twice with modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (109 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.15 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.001% phenol red) before preincubation in the same buffer at 37 °C for 20–30 min. The buffer was then changed to high KCl buffer (55 mmKCl, 76 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.7 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.001% phenol red) or to low KCl buffer (1 mm KCl, 131 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.7 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.001% phenol red) or to Krebs-Ringer buffer plus 15–20 mm or 1 mm glucose or to Krebs-Ringer buffer plus 1 μm TPA or the same volume of Me2SO. Buffer was removed from the cells at different time points and centrifuged to remove cells and cell debris. The supernatant was stored at −20 °C until assayed for insulin content using insulin RIA kits from Linco (RI-13K) or Amersham (RPA547). At different times following the above treatments, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (4 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.54 mm EDTA) and scraped into harvesting buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The detergent SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the cells were sonicated and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was termed the whole cell lysate and was assayed for PTP activity and/or used for immunoprecipitation. Phosphatase assays contained 50 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μm phosphotyrosyl-RR-src peptide phosphorylated and prepared as described previously (38Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and whole cell lysate protein or immunoprecipitate as specified under “Results.” Reactions proceeded for 20 min at 30 °C and were stopped and processed to quantitate free 32P released from RR-src as described (39Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared (as described under “Analysis of Total Cellular PTP Activity”) from cells transiently expressing hIAR and diluted with harvesting buffer lacking SDS to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. A mouse antiserum raised to the luminal region of hIAR (amino acids 30–589) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (Pierce) for another 2 h. Protein A cell suspension (Sigma) was then added, and the incubation was continued for a further 1 h. After centrifugation the immunoprecipitate was washed three times with harvesting buffer, and a portion was used for duplicate assays of associated PTP activity, whereas another portion was probed for hIAR amount. For Western blotting of hIAR, cell lysates, fractions, or anti-hIAR immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-mouse hIAR antiserum (1:10000), followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) (1:5000). Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham). For MAP kinase analysis by Western blotting, whole cell lysates were prepared in harvesting buffer containing 0.1 mm Na3VO4 and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to membranes, sequential immunoblotting was carried out with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) and anti-pan-ERK antibody (both from Transduction Laboratories). Cells were scraped into harvesting buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as cytosol, whereas the pellet was resuspended in harvesting buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Centrifugation was repeated, and the supernatant was collected as the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction. The pellet was resuspended in harvesting buffer with either 0.6 m KCl/1% Chaps or 0.5% SDS and centrifuged again. The supernatant was termed the cytoskeleton fraction. In accord with the known activity of high extracellular KCl as an insulin secretagogue on pancreatic islets and β cell lines, insulin secretion was observed after the addition of high (55 mm) but not low (1 mm) KCl to βTC3 cells (Fig. 1 A). The phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase have been reported to occur in response to insulin secretagogues (21Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with high KCl followed by probing of cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated the rapid appearance of a phosphotyrosine-containing band of about 42 kDa that was not detected after treatment with low KCl (Fig. 1 B, top panel). Reprobing of the membrane with anti-MAP kinase antibody demonstrated that the novel phosphotyrosine-containing band comigrated with MAP kinase, which was present in all lanes (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Thus, although these particular βTC3 cells do not secrete insulin in response to glucose (data not shown), they do respond as expected to high KCl, another insulin secretagogue. We examined whether high or low KCl induced any alterations in cellular PTP activity by assaying the ability of whole cell lysates to dephosphorylate the peptide substrate phosphotyrosyl-RR-src. Over a period of 60 min of treatment with low KCl, a small and insignificant increase was initially observed (0–15 min) in cellular PTP activity, which subsequently decreased to basal level (Fig. 1 C). High KCl treatment elicited a more pronounced increase in PTP activity, with a peak of elevated PTP activity apparent after 20 min (Fig. 1 C). This peak represented a 2.8-fold increase in PTP activity compared with that measured at 20 min of low KCl treatment and rapidly disappeared; it was undetectable by 25 min after high KCl treatment. The effects of insulin secretagogues on another β cell line, HIT-T15, were examined. The secretagogues 15 mm glucose, 55 mm KCl, or TPA (in Me2SO) all induced insulin secretion, with a 30-min treatment resulting in at least a 2-fold higher amount of insulin released than treatment with the respective control compounds (1 mm glucose, 1 mm KCl, and Me2SO) (Fig. 2, A,C, and E). Cellular PTP activity increased during the first 5–10 min of treatment both with the secretagogues and with the respective control compounds. After this initial increase, PTP activity continued to increase to a peak at 15 min in the secretagogue-treated cells, whereas PTP activity plateaued at a lower level in the control compound-treated cells (Fig. 2, B,D, and F). At the 15-min time point, the peak PTP activity in the insulin-secreting cells was about 1.2–1.3-fold higher than the PTP activity in the control cells. Thus secretagogues induce a general profile and peak of PTP activation similar to that of βTC3, although there is a cell type-specific difference in PTP content. The HIT-T15 cell lysates contain much higher PTP activity than the βTC3 cell lysates; for example, the HIT-T15 PTP specific activity in basal buffer prior to stimulation (at zero time) was about 40 pmol/min/mgversus about 0.2 pmol/min/mg in βTC3 cells (Figs.1 B and 2, B, D, and F). We also examined the effect of high KCl treatment on PTP activity in whole cell lysates of RIN 5AH-12 and COS-1 or NIH 3T3 cells. The RIN 5AH-12 cells are a subclone of a rat insulinoma cell line (RIN 5AH) that can undergo regulated secretion. The COS-1 and NIH 3T3 cells have a constitutive but not a regulated secretory pathway. The RIN 5AH-12 cells secrete insulin in response to high KCl treatment (not shown) and exhibit a KCl-stimulated and time-dependent increase in cellular PTP activity. High KCl elicits a peak of PTP activity at 15 min, which is about 2-fold elevated compared with PTP activity measured upon low KCl treatment at that time (Fig.3 A). Activation is transient and disappears by 20 min of high KCl treatment. In contrast, no differences in PTP activity were observed in lysates of low or high KCl-treated COS-1 or NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, B andC), suggesting that the effect of high KCl on PTP activity is related to its ability to stimulate regulated secretion in certain cell types and not a nonspecific effect on all cells in culture. AtT-20 pituitary cells, which utilize the regulated secretory pathway to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone, also exhibit increased PTP activity in response to high but not low KCl (1.6-fold increase at 20 min in high versus low KCl) (data not shown). Thus the effect of high KCl on PTP activity is not limited to or related to insulin secretion in particular. To determine the subcellular localization of the high KCl-activated PTP, βTC3 cells were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer (basal) buffer followed by high or low KCl buffers for 20 min. Cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared, as well as a fraction made by solubilization of the Triton X-100 insoluble material with either KCl/Chaps or SDS, and termed the cytoskeleton fraction (40Roome J. O'Hare T. Pilch P.F. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41Mohlig M. Wolter S. Mayer P. Lang J. Osterhoff M. Horn P.A. Schatz H. Pfeiffer A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The PTP activities of these fractions were then assayed. In terms of PTP specific activity measured in the fractions of cells treated with low KCl, the cytosol had much higher activity than the membrane and cytoskeletal fractions. To allow ready comparison and visualization of the data, the PTP activity measured in each type of fraction treated with low KCl was taken as 100%, and the percentage of activity in the respective fraction after high KCl treatment was calculated accordingly. A 20-min treatment with high KCl resulted in elevated PTP activity in the cytoskeletal fraction, whether this was prepared by solubilization with KCl/Chaps or with SDS (Fig.4 A). Because in other experiments the whole cell lysates were prepared in buffers with SDS, we used SDS in all later experiments. No significant differences in PTP activity were found in the membrane or cytosol fractions with low or high KCl treatment (Fig. 4 A). It is possible that a secretagogue-responsive PTP activity in the cytosol or membrane fractions is masked by the activity of other PTPs. To check this, and for comparison with the activity of the total cell lysate independently prepared in SDS-containing buffer, the fractions were also assayed after the addition of 0.5% SDS, as the cytoskeletal secretagogue-responsive PTP is active in this concentration of detergent. The presence of SDS virtually abolished PTP activity in the membrane and cytosol fractions, and there was no difference in the remaining PTP activity measured in these fractions prepared from low or high KCl treated cells (data not shown). Thus the secretagogue-activated PTP appeared to be present only in the cytoskeleton-associated cellular component. The cytoskeleton fraction from high KCl-treated cells contained 41% of the total protein and 69% of the total PTP activity recovered in all fractions with a specific activity of ∼0.85 pmol/min/mg. This localization was of interest because many secretory granule proteins associate with the cytoskeleton and because two related PTPs, IA-2 (ICA512) and IAR (phogrin, etc.), were recently identified as secretory granule transmembrane proteins (31Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 36Solimena M. Dirkx Jr., R. Hermel J.-M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IA-2 is reported to associate with the neuroendocrine cell cytoskeleton (36Solimena M. Dirkx Jr., R. Hermel J.-M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We have examined the localization of the related secretory granule PTP IAR using an antibody that specifically recognizes the luminal domain of human but not rat or mouse IAR. Fractionation of βTC3 cells transiently expressing hIAR into cytosol, membrane, and cytoskeleton fractions, followed by probing with the anti-hIAR antibody, showed the presence of hIAR mainly in the cytoskeleton fraction, with some also detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with observed proteolytic processing of the endogenous rat protein (31Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), two forms of hIAR were detected: a 125-kDa protein likely corresponding to the full-length protein after signal peptide cleavage and a 80-kDa protein likely corresponding to the mature protein following endoproteolytic cleavage at a candidate RKK site (amino acids 425–427) in the luminal region of the protein. The cytoskeleton association of IAR and IA-2 suggests that one or both of these PTPs might be responsible for the observed secretagogue-stimulated PTP activity. We examined whether IAR could be activated by high KCl treatment, and because we lack an antibody that recognizes the endogenous IAR of murine βTC-3 cells, we used an approach involving ectopic expression of hIAR for which we have immunological reagents. The βTC3 cells were transfected with empty plasmid or plasmid containing wild-type hIAR or a catalytically inactive hIAR mutant (hIAR-C945S) in which the essential cysteine residue in the active site had been mutated to ser"
