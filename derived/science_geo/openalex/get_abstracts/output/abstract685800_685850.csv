https://openalex.org/W4200626931,"Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy with clinically meaningful outcomes demonstrated in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell lymphoma. In a previous pilot study of tisagenlecleucel in r/r follicular lymphoma (FL), 71% of patients achieved a complete response (CR). Here we report the primary, prespecified interim analysis of the ELARA phase 2 multinational trial of tisagenlecleucel in adults with r/r FL after two or more treatment lines or who relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant (no. NCT03568461). The primary endpoint was CR rate (CRR). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, pharmacokinetics and safety. As of 29 March 2021, 97/98 enrolled patients received tisagenlecleucel (median follow-up, 16.59 months; interquartile range, 13.8-20.21). The primary endpoint was met. In the efficacy set (n = 94), CRR was 69.1% (95% confidence interval, 58.8-78.3) and ORR 86.2% (95% confidence interval, 77.5-92.4). Within 8 weeks of infusion, rates of cytokine release syndrome were 48.5% (grade ≥3, 0%), neurological events 37.1% (grade ≥3, 3%) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) 4.1% (grade ≥3, 1%) in the safety set (n = 97), with no treatment-related deaths. Tisagenlecleucel is safe and effective in extensively pretreated r/r FL, including in high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W4200194366,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that can present as an uncontrolled, hyperactive immune response, causing severe immunological injury. Existing rodent models do not recapitulate the sustained immunopathology of patients with severe disease. Here we describe a humanized mouse model of COVID-19 that uses adeno-associated virus to deliver human ACE2 to the lungs of humanized MISTRG6 mice. This model recapitulates innate and adaptive human immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection up to 28 days after infection, with key features of chronic COVID-19, including weight loss, persistent viral RNA, lung pathology with fibrosis, a human inflammatory macrophage response, a persistent interferon-stimulated gene signature and T cell lymphopenia. We used this model to study two therapeutics on immunopathology, patient-derived antibodies and steroids and found that the same inflammatory macrophages crucial to containing early infection later drove immunopathology. This model will enable evaluation of COVID-19 disease mechanisms and treatments."

Here, we immunized rhesus macaques and assessed immune responses over 1 year in blood and upper and lower airways. Serum neutralizing titers to Delta were 280 and 34 reciprocal ID50 at weeks 6 (peak) and 48 (challenge), respectively. Antibody-binding titers also decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Four days after Delta challenge, the virus was unculturable in BAL, and subgenomic RNA declined by ∼3-log10 compared with control animals. In nasal swabs, sgRNA was reduced by 1-log10, and the virus remained culturable. Anamnestic antibodies (590-fold increased titer) but not T cell responses were detected in BAL by day 4 post-challenge. mRNA-1273-mediated protection in the lungs is durable but delayed and potentially dependent on anamnestic antibody responses. Rapid and sustained protection in upper and lower airways may eventually require a boost."
https://openalex.org/W4226162806,"The current paradigm is that inflammatory pain passively resolves following the cessation of inflammation. Yet, in a substantial proportion of patients with inflammatory diseases, resolution of inflammation is not sufficient to resolve pain, resulting in chronic pain. Mechanistic insight into how inflammatory pain is resolved is lacking. Here, we show that macrophages actively control resolution of inflammatory pain remotely from the site of inflammation by transferring mitochondria to sensory neurons. During resolution of inflammatory pain in mice, M2-like macrophages infiltrate the dorsal root ganglia that contain the somata of sensory neurons, concurrent with the recovery of oxidative phosphorylation in sensory neurons. The resolution of pain and the transfer of mitochondria requires expression of CD200 receptor (CD200R) on macrophages and the non-canonical CD200R-ligand iSec1 on sensory neurons. Our data reveal a novel mechanism for active resolution of inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W4200260337,"COVID-19 poses significant health and economic threat prompting international firms to rapidly develop vaccines and secure quick regulatory approval. Although COVID-19 vaccination priority is given for high-risk individuals including healthcare workers (HCWs), the success of the immunization efforts hinges on peoples' willingness to embrace these vaccines.This study aimed to assess HCWs intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and the reasons underlying vaccine hesitancy.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCWs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from March to July 2021. Data were collected from eligible participants from 18 health facilities using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression was performed to explore factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 614 HCWs participated in the study, with a mean age of 30.57±6.87 years. Nearly two-thirds (60.3%) of HCWs were hesitant to use the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants under the age of 30 years were approximately five times more likely to be hesitant to be vaccinated compared to those over the age of 40 years. HCWs other than medical doctors and/or nurses (AOR = 2.1; 95%CI; 1.1, 3.8) were more likely to be hesitant for COVID-19 vaccine. Lack of believe in COVID-19 vaccine benefits (AOR = 2.5; 95%CI; 1.3, 4.6), lack of trust in the government (AOR = 1.9; 95%CI; 1.3, 3.1), lack of trust science to produce safe and effective vaccines (AOR = 2.6; 95%CI; 1.6, 4.2); and concern about vaccine safety (AOR = 3.2; 95%CI; 1.9, 5.4) were also found to be predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy showed to be high among HCWs. All concerned bodies including the ministry, regional health authorities, health institutions, and HCWs themselves should work together to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake and overcome the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200151371,"Breathing can be heavily influenced by pain or internal emotional states, but the neural circuitry underlying this tight coordination is unknown. Here we report that Oprm1 (μ-opioid receptor)-expressing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBL) are crucial for coordinating breathing with affective pain in mice. Individual PBLOprm1 neuronal activity synchronizes with breathing rhythm and responds to noxious stimuli. Manipulating PBLOprm1 activity directly changes breathing rate, affective pain perception, and anxiety. Furthermore, PBLOprm1 neurons constitute two distinct subpopulations in a ""core-shell"" configuration that divergently projects to the forebrain and hindbrain. Through non-overlapping projections to the central amygdala and pre-Bötzinger complex, these two subpopulations differentially regulate breathing, affective pain, and negative emotions. Moreover, these subsets form recurrent excitatory networks through reciprocal glutamatergic projections. Together, our data define the divergent parabrachial opioidergic circuits as a common neural substrate that coordinates breathing with various sensations and behaviors such as pain and emotional processing."
https://openalex.org/W4200264516,"Background There has been a shift in focus of international dementia policies from improving diagnostic rates to enhancing the post-diagnostic support provided to people with dementia and their carers. There is, however, little agreement over what constitutes good post-diagnostic support. This study aimed to identify the components of post-diagnostic dementia support. Methods We adopted a qualitative design using interviews, focus groups and observation to explore the perspectives of key stakeholders on the content of post-diagnostic dementia support. Purposive sampling was used to identify sites in England and Wales recognised as delivering good practice. Participants included 17 people with dementia, 31 carers, 68 service managers or funders, and 78 frontline staff. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Forty-eight sessions of observation were completed and recorded in fieldnotes. Components were identified through an inductive, thematic approach and cross-checked against national guidelines and existing frameworks; they were subsequently critically reviewed by a range of experts and our mixed stakeholder panel. Results Twenty distinct components of post-diagnostic support were identified, related to five themes: timely identification and management of needs; understanding and managing dementia; emotional and psychological wellbeing; practical support; and integrating support. The first and last of these were cross-cutting themes facilitating the delivery of a unique constellation of components of post-diagnostic support to each individual living with dementia or dyad at a particular time. Conclusions Our work offers an empirically based framework to inform the development and delivery of holistic, integrated and continuous dementia care from diagnosis to end of life. It highlights the relevance of many components to both people living with dementia and their carers. Since the framework was developed in England and Wales, further research is needed to explore the relevance of our components to other sectors, countries and care systems."
https://openalex.org/W4220970521,"Two HIV fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides (LP-97 and LP-98) were designed with highly potent, long-acting antiviral activity. Monotherapy using a low dose of LP-98 sharply reduced viral loads and maintained long-term viral suppression in 21 SHIVSF162P3-infected rhesus macaques. We found that five treated monkeys achieved potential posttreatment control (PTC) efficacy and had lower viral DNA in deep lymph nodes, whereas monkeys with a stable viral rebound had higher viral DNA in superficial lymph nodes. The tissues of PTC monkeys exhibited significantly decreased quantitative viral outgrowth and fewer PD-1+ central memory CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells contributed to virologic control efficacy. Moreover, LP-98 administrated as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provided complete protection against SHIVSF162P3 and SIVmac239 infections in 51 monkeys via intrarectal, intravaginal, or intravenous challenge. In conclusion, our lipopeptides exhibit high potential as an efficient HIV treatment or prevention strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4200549635,"Hyperinsulinemia is commonly viewed as a compensatory response to insulin resistance, yet studies have demonstrated that chronically elevated insulin may also drive insulin resistance. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this potentially cyclic process remain poorly defined, especially on a transcriptome-wide level. Transcriptomic meta-analysis in >450 human samples demonstrated that fasting insulin reliably and negatively correlated with INSR mRNA in skeletal muscle. To establish causality and study the direct effects of prolonged exposure to excess insulin in muscle cells, we incubated C2C12 myotubes with elevated insulin for 16 h, followed by 6 h of serum starvation, and established that acute AKT and ERK signaling were attenuated in this model of in vitro hyperinsulinemia. Global RNA-sequencing of cells both before and after nutrient withdrawal highlighted genes in the insulin receptor (INSR) signaling, FOXO signaling, and glucose metabolism pathways indicative of ‘hyperinsulinemia’ and ‘starvation’ programs. Consistently, we observed that hyperinsulinemia led to a substantial reduction in Insr gene expression, and subsequently a reduced surface INSR and total INSR protein, both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic modeling combined with RNAi identified SIN3A as a negative regulator of Insr mRNA (and JUND, MAX, and MXI as positive regulators of Irs2 mRNA). Together, our analysis identifies mechanisms which may explain the cyclic processes underlying hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in muscle, a process directly relevant to the etiology and disease progression of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4200352577,"Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a well-known, but resource intensive, method for comparing the costs and health outcomes of health interventions. To build on available evidence, researchers are developing methods to transfer CEA across settings; previous methods do not use all available results nor quantify differences across settings. We conducted a meta-regression analysis of published CEAs of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to quantify the effects of factors at the country, intervention, and method-level, and predict incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for HPV vaccination in 195 countries. We used 613 ICERs reported in 75 studies from the Tufts University's Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry and the Global Health CEA Registry, and extracted an additional 1,215 one-way sensitivity analyses. A five-stage, mixed-effects meta-regression framework was used to predict country-specific ICERs. The probability that HPV vaccination is cost-saving in each country was predicted using a logistic regression model. Covariates for both models included methods and intervention characteristics, and each country's cervical cancer burden and gross domestic product per capita. ICERs are positively related to vaccine cost, and negatively related to cervical cancer burden. The mean predicted ICER for HPV vaccination is 2017 US$4,217 per DALY averted (95% uncertainty interval (UI): US$773-13,448) globally, and below US$800 per DALY averted in 64 countries. Predicted ICERs are lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with a population-weighted mean ICER across 46 countries of US$706 per DALY averted (95% UI: $130-2,245), and across five countries of US$489 per DALY averted (95% UI: $90-1,557), respectively. Meta-regression analyses can be conducted on CEA, where one-way sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the effects of factors at the intervention and method-level. Building on all published results, our predictions support introducing and expanding HPV vaccination, especially in countries that are eligible for subsidized vaccines from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and Pan American Health Organization."
https://openalex.org/W4200457235,"Changing physiological conditions can increase the need for protein degradative capacity in eukaryotic cells. Both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy contribute to protein degradation. However, these processes can be differently regulated depending on the physiological conditions. Strikingly, proteasomes themselves can be a substrate for autophagy. The signals and molecular mechanisms that govern proteasome autophagy (proteaphagy) are only partly understood. Here, we used immunoblots, native gel analyses, and fluorescent microscopy to understand the regulation of proteaphagy in response to genetic and small molecule-induced perturbations. Our data indicate that chemical inhibition of the master nutrient sensor TORC1 (inhibition of which induces general autophagy) with rapamycin induces a bi-phasic response where proteasome levels are upregulated after an autophagy-dependent reduction. Surprisingly, several conditions that result in inhibited TORC1, such as caffeinine treatment or nitrogen starvation, only induced proteaphagy (i.e., without any proteasome upregulation), suggesting a convergence of signals upstream of proteaphagy under different physiological conditions. Indeed, we found that several conditions that activated general autophagy did not induce proteaphagy, further distinguishing proteaphagy from general autophagy. Consistent with this, we show that Atg11, a selective autophagy receptor, as well as the MAP kinases Mpk1, Mkk1, and Mkk2 all play a role in autophagy of proteasomes, although they are dispensable for general autophagy. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the molecular regulation of proteaphagy by demonstrating that degradation of proteasome complexes is specifically regulated under different autophagy-inducing conditions.

Taken together, our data provide new insights into the molecular regulation of proteaphagy by demonstrating that degradation of proteasome complexes is specifically regulated under different autophagy-inducing conditions. Two major pathways for eukaryotic cells to recycle proteins are lysosomal targeting and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Within the UPS, E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize substrates destined for degradation. The E3 ligases act in concert with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to modify lysine residues of the substrate with ubiquitin or a chain of ubiquitins. Ubiquitinated substrates are often targeted for degradation with the ubiquitin chain being recognized by the proteasome. In a complex process, the proteasome unfolds substrates, removes the ubiquitin moiety, and hydrolyzes the substrate, producing short peptides. The short peptides are further processed by peptidases into amino acids that become intermediates for various metabolic processes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2Tomko R.J. Hochstrasser M. Molecular architecture and assembly of the eukaryotic proteasome.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 415-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Lysosomes receive substrates either from endocytosis (extracellular and plasma membrane components) or through autophagy (intracellular components). Autophagy, in this article referring to macroautophagy, uses a process where the substrates are engulfed into a double membrane compartment known as the autophagosome (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Two distinct pathways for targeting proteins from the cytoplasm to the vacuole/lysosome.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 4Kraft C. Reggiori F. Peter M. Selective types of autophagy in yeast.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol.

Endocytosis and autophagy: Shared machinery for degradation.Bioessays. 2013; 35: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The targeting of substrates to autophagosomes, like the UPS, is often initiated by ubiquitination of target proteins. The ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by autophagy adapters, such as p62/SQSTM1 in humans and Cue5 in yeast, that bind LC3 (humans) or Atg8 (yeast) found on expanding preautophagosomes (6Zaffagnini G. Savova A. Danieli A. Romanov J. Tremel S. Ebner M. Peterbauer T. Sztacho M. Trapannone R. Tarafder A.K. Sachse C.

Autophagic clearance of PolyQ proteins mediated by ubiquitin-Atg8 adaptors of the conserved CUET protein family.Cell. 2014; 158: 549-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The binding is mediated by LC3-interacting regions or Atg8-interacting motifs in the autophagy adapters. Closure of the preautophagosome captures the substrates. The formed autophagosome then fuses with lysosomes (or vacuoles in yeast and plants) and the content is degraded, producing amino acids. Specific transporters in the lysosomal membrane export the amino acids to the cytosol (10Feng Y. He D. Yao Z. Klionsky D.J. The machinery of macroautophagy.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 24-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The ability of both the UPS and lysosomal degradation to contribute to the amino acid pool in cells becomes particularly important during physiological conditions that reduce amino acid levels. For example, under the conditions of nitrogen starvation, autophagy becomes essential and is the major route for amino acid recycling (11Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice.J.

Autophagy is required for maintenance of amino acid levels and protein synthesis under nitrogen starvation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31582-31586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Autophagy and the UPS both replenish the amino acid pool as well as use ubiquitination as a signal for degradation. Therefore, it makes sense that these degradative pathways are coordinated and have some level of redundancy. Indeed, the upregulation of one pathway can, to some extent, compensate for the impairment of the other (13Nam T. Han J.H. Devkota S. Lee H.-W. Emerging paradigm of crosstalk between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Mol. Cells. 2017; 40: 897-905PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ji C.H. Kwon Y.T.

Biochem. 2017; 86: 193-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). For example, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce an autophagic response, and mTOR inhibition by rapamycin, which induces autophagy, was shown to relieve proteotoxic stress caused by proteasome inhibition (16Cha-Molstad H.

Further, an increase in proteasome activity was reported in yeast and mammalian cells deleted for ATG5, a gene essential for autophagy, as well as upon chemical inhibition of autophagy (18Athané A. Buisson A. Challier M. Beaumatin F. Manon S. Bhatia-Kiššová I. Camougrand N. Insights into the relationship between the proteasome and autophagy in human and yeast cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 64: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similarly, atg32Δ cells upregulate proteasome activity to compensate for an inability to induce nonselective autophagy upon antimycin A treatment (18Athané A. Buisson A. Challier M. Beaumatin F. Manon S. Bhatia-Kiššová I. Camougrand N. Insights into the relationship between the proteasome and autophagy in human and yeast cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 64: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Some functions are however clearly unique to each pathway. Proteasomes are, in large, responsible for the degradation of short-lived proteins like IκB (during NFκB signaling) and cyclins (during cell cycle progression) (19Nemeth Z.H. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Deitch E.A. Szabó C. Vizi E.S. Haskó G. Proteasome inhibitors induce inhibitory B (I B) kinase activation, I B degradation, and nuclear factor B activation in HT-29 cells.Mol.

Cyclin is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway.Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Autophagy, on the other hand, can dispose off aggregated proteins or defective (parts of) organelles directly through the extension of autophagic membranes. Autophagy is induced by a number of cellular stresses such as nutrient starvation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and various infections (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y.

This process can capture cytosolic material nonspecifically and be selective for specific cargo. Examples of the latter are mitophagy, pexophagy, and ER-phagy, where unique receptors (Atg32, Pex14, and Atg39/40 respectively) ensure specific and efficient targeting to autophagosomes (4Kraft C.

How proteaphagy is regulated, however, remains poorly understood. The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a master regulator-controlling cell growth and metabolic activity based on the cell's physiological state. Under nutrient-rich conditions, TORC1 is active, and general autophagy is inhibited through the phosphorylation and inactivation of Atg13 and Atg1/Ulk1 (34Crespo J.L. Hall M.N.

Interestingly, treatment of cells with the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has been shown to increase proteasome levels in yeast and mammalian cells (34Crespo J.L. Hall M.N.

Further, an increase in K48-linked ubiquitinated substrates has been observed, along with an increase in proteasomal degradation of substrates in mammalian cells treated with mTOR inhibitors. Apparently, the capacity of protein degradation by proteasomes becomes important under conditions where TORC1 is not active. Surprisingly, proteasomes undergo autophagic degradation in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells upon starvation conditions well-known to cause TORC1 inhibition (28Waite K.A. De La Mota-Peynado A.

Cell. 2015; 58: 1053-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To better understand the response of proteasomes to autophagic stimuli, we sought to determine how proteaphagy was regulated in yeast. We used various chemical treatments and physiological conditions known to induce general autophagy. Our data show a biphasic response upon inhibition of TORC1 with rapamycin. During the first 4 h of treatment, proteasome levels and activity increased. After this, proteasomes were targeted for vacuolar degradation. However, nitrogen starvation, which results in TORC1 inhibition, did not induce a similar response. Indeed, our data show that various stimuli that cause TORC1 inhibition and induce general autophagy, showed little to no proteaphagy. Thus, proteaphagy is regulated distinctly from general autophagy. Consistent with this, we identified several proteins required for proteaphagy, namely the regulatory kinases Mpk1, Mkk1, and Mkk2 as well as the selective autophagy receptor Atg11. Upon nitrogen starvation, proteasomes are targeted for vacuolar degradation via an autophagy dependent pathway. The extent of this degradation appears to vary (28Waite K.A. De La Mota-Peynado A. Vontz G. Roelofs J. Starvation induces proteasome autophagy with different pathways for core and regulatory particle.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 3239-3253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Marshall R.S. Li F. Gemperline D.C. Book A.J. Vierstra Correspondence R.D. Vierstra R.D.

To elucidate the signaling pathways involved, we sought to determine the role of TORC1 inhibition in this process as TORC1 inhibition occurs upon nitrogen starvation and induces autophagy. However, the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has been reported to increase proteasome levels and activity (38Rousseau A. Bertolotti A. An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis.Nature. 2016; 536: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Zhang Y. Nicholatos J. Dreier J.R. Ricoult S.J.H.

Coordinated regulation of protein synthesis and degradation by mTORC1.Nature. 2014; 513: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To study this contradiction, we monitored the response of proteasomes to rapamycin treatment over an extended time by native gel analyses of yeast lysates. We introduced the sequence of eGFP before the stop codon of the core particle (CP) subunit α1 or regulatory particle (RP) subunit Rpn1. This was performed at the endogenous locus to ensure that transcription is regulated as in WT, and no untagged subunits are produced (40Waite K.A. Burris A. Roelofs J. Tagging the proteasome active site β5 causes tag specific phenotypes in yeast.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Native gel analyses comparing proteasome activity in the presence of 0.02% SDS in untagged versus GFP-tagged strains showed similar activity and rapamycin response. Because SDS opens the CP gate, thus eliminating the effect of other regulators of proteasome activity, this result indicates that GFP tagging alone is unlikely to cause a change in proteasome abundance (Fig. S1). Upon treating cells with rapamycin, a statistically significant upregulation of 26S proteasome (RP2-CP) was observed as determined by α1-GFP signal detected on native gel (Fig. 1A, top panel; at 30 min there was a 2 fold increase; p = 0.006). This is consistent with Rousseau et. al., although in our hands, we did not observe the strong upregulation of proteasome subunits by Western blot as they observed (38Rousseau A. Bertolotti A. An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis.Nature. 2016; 536: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Coinciding with the increased levels of assembled proteasomes observed on native gel, there was increased hydrolysis of the suc-LLVY-AMC fluorogenic substrate after rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1A, lower panel; at 30 min there was a 2 fold increase; p = 0.03). This increase in GFP signal and activity was transient, as levels peaked at 30 to 60 min. Although cellular protein amount and composition change dramatically upon induction of general autophagy, this trend was similar irrespective of loading equal amount of proteins or equal volume of cell lysates on native gel (Fig. S2). The rapid increase in proteasome abundance was dependent on protein synthesis as the translation inhibitor cycloheximide largely prevented proteasome upregulation (Fig. S3). Although this upregulation might appear fast considering a reported maturation half-time of more than 30 min (41Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Ump1p is required for proper maturation of the 20S proteasome and becomes its substrate upon completion of the assembly.Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), other studies have shown faster CP maturation (42Fehlker M. Wendler P. Lehmann A. Enenkel C. Blm3 is part of nascent proteasomes and is involved in a late stage of nuclear proteasome assembly.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The reduction in proteasome levels at later time points was accompanied by an increase in a faster-migrating GFP species on the fluorescent scan of the native gel. The accumulation of this species showed kinetics similar to the accumulation of a 25 kDa band observed on GFP immunoblots (Fig. 1B). This species migrated to where we anticipate free GFP would be on native gel (43Burris A. Waite K.A. Reuter Z. Ockerhousen S. Roelofs J. Proteasome activator Blm10 levels and autophagic degradation directly impact the proteasome landscape.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 1-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This “free GFP” is generally indicative of vacuolar targeting of GFP-tagged proteins (28Waite K.A. De La Mota-Peynado A. Vontz G. Roelofs J.

Chapter 1 monitoring autophagy in mammalian cultured cells through the dynamics of LC3.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 451: 1-12Google Scholar). We observed the same dynamics when the RP subunit Rpn1 was tagged with GFP (Fig. S4). Growth for 24 h in yeast-peptone dextrose (YPD) media, which does not induce general autophagy, did not yield such an increase in this GFP species and resulted in little to no free GFP on immunoblots compared with nitrogen starvation which induces proteasome autophagy (Fig. S5). In sum, rapamycin treatment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in an initial upregulation of proteasomes followed by vacuolar degradation. To test if the vacuolar targeting upon rapamycin treatment was autophagy dependent, we introduced Rpn1-GFP or α1-GFP in the autophagy-deficient atg7Δ strain. No accumulation of free GFP was detected in the atg7Δ cells, indicating that both the proteasome RP and CP are autophagy substrates upon inhibition of TORC1 (Fig. 1C). Fluorescent microscopy analyses showed that proteasomes are enriched in the nucleus during logarithmic growth (45Wilkinson C.R.M. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.-P.

ALKBH1 is a demethylase of 6mA and plays critical roles in osteogenesis, tumorigenesis, and adaptation to stress. However, the integrated biological functions of ALKBH1 still require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of ALKBH1 inhibits adipogenic differentiation in both human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, while overexpression of ALKBH1 leads to increased adipogenesis. Using a combination of RNA-seq and N6-mA-DNA-IP-seq analyses, we identify hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling as a crucial downstream target of ALKBH1 activity. Depletion of ALKBH1 leads to hypermethylation of both HIF-1α and its downstream target GYS1. Simultaneous overexpression of HIF-1α and GYS1 restores the adipogenic commitment of ALKBH1-deficient cells. Taken together, our data indicate that ALKBH1 is indispensable for adipogenic differentiation, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism that regulates adipogenesis."

Here, we show that the neuronal sheddome is detectable in human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) and is enriched in neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk factors. Among shed synaptic proteins is the ectodomain of CNTNAP2 (CNTNAP2-ecto), a prominent NDD risk factor. CNTNAP2 undergoes activity-dependent ES via MMP9 (matrix metalloprotease 9), and CNTNAP2-ecto levels are reduced in the hCSF of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Using mass spectrometry, we identified the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) extrusion pumps as novel CNTNAP2-ecto binding partners. CNTNAP2-ecto enhances the activity of PMCA2 and regulates neuronal network dynamics in a PMCA2-dependent manner. Our data underscore the promise of sheddome analysis in discovering neurobiological mechanisms, provide insight into the biology of ES and its relationship with the CSF, and reveal a mechanism of regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal network synchrony by a shed ectodomain."

Although the various AAV serotypes display broad tropism, frequently infecting multiple tissues and cell types, vectors for specific and efficient targeting of human CD4+ T lymphocytes are largely missing. In fact, a substantial translational bottleneck exists in the field of therapeutic gene transfer that would require in vivo delivery into peripheral disease-related lymphocytes for subsequent genome editing. To solve this issue, capsid modification for retargeting AAV tropism, and in turn improving vector potency, is considered a promising strategy. Here, we genetically modified the minor AAV2 capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2, with a set of novel nanobodies with high-affinity for the human CD4 receptor. These novel vector variants demonstrated improved targeting of human CD4+ cells, including primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and purified human CD4+ T lymphocytes. Thus, the technical approach presented here provides a promising strategy for developing specific gene therapy vectors, particularly targeting disease-related peripheral blood CD4+ leukocytes."

Here, we developed deep behavior mapping (DBM) to identify behavioral microstates in video recordings. We combined DBM with longitudinal calcium imaging to quantify behavioral tuning in PrL neurons as mice learned an operant task. We found that a subset of PrL neurons were strongly tuned to highly specific behavioral microstates, both task and non-task related. Overlapping neural ensembles were tiled across consecutive microstates in the response-reinforcer sequence, forming a continuous map. As mice learned the operant task, weakly tuned neurons were recruited into new ensembles, with a bias toward behaviors similar to their initial tuning. In summary, our data suggest that the PrL contains neural ensembles that jointly encode a map of behavioral states that is fine grained, is continuous, and grows during operant learning."

It seeks to strengthen the processing of personal information, including health information. While POPIA is to be welcomed, there are concerns about the impact it will have on the processing of health information. To ensure that the National Health Laboratory Service [NHLS] is compliant with these new strict processing requirements and that compliance does not negatively impact upon its current screening, treatment, surveillance and research mandate, it was decided to consider the development of a NHLS POPIA Code of Conduct for Personal Health. As part of the process of developing such a Code and better understand the challenges faced in the processing of personal health information in South Africa, 19 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders were conducted between June and September 2020. Overall, respondents welcomed the introduction of POPIA. However, they felt that there are tensions between the strengthening of data protection and the use of personal information for individual patient care, treatment programmes, and research. Respondents reported a need to rethink the management of personal health information in South Africa and identified 5 issues needing to be addressed at a national and an institutional level: an understanding of the importance of personal information; an understanding of POPIA and data protection; improve data quality; improve transparency in data use; and improve accountability in data use. The application of POPIA to the processing of personal health information is challenging, complex, and likely costly. However, personal health information must be appropriately managed to ensure the privacy of the data subject is protected, but equally that it is used as a resource in the individual’s and wider public interest."

To study intestinal mucus function and structure in vitro , the mucus-producing intestinal cell line HT29-MTX-E12 has been commonly used. However, this cell line produces only low amounts of the intestine-specific MUC2. It has been shown previously that HT29-MTX-E12 cells cultured under Semi-Wet interface with Mechanical Stimulation (SWMS) produced higher amounts of MUC2, concomitant with a thicker mucus layer, compared to cells cultured conventionally. However, it remains unknown which underlying pathways are involved. Therefore, we aimed to further explore the cellular processes underlying the increased MUC2 production by HT29-MTX-E12 cells grown under SWMS conditions. Cells grown on Transwell membranes for 14 days under static and SWMS conditions (after cell seeding and attachment) were subjected to transcriptome analysis to investigate underlying molecular pathways at gene expression level. Caco-2 and LS174T cell lines were included as references. We characterized how SWMS conditions affected HT29-MTX-E12 cells in terms of epithelial barrier integrity, by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance, and cell metabolism, by monitoring pH and lactate production per molecule glucose of the conditioned medium. We confirmed higher MUC2 production under SWMS conditions at gene and protein level and demonstrated that this culturing method primarily stimulated cell growth. In addition, we also found evidence for a more aerobic cell metabolism under SWMS, as shown previously for similar models. In summary, we suggest different mechanisms by which MUC2 production is enhanced under SWMS and propose potential applications of this model in future studies."

https://openalex.org/W4200017049,"Metabolic reprogramming has been shown to occur in uveal melanoma (UM), the most common intraocular tumor in adults. Mechanisms driving metabolic reprogramming in UM are poorly understood. Elucidation of these mechanisms could inform development of new therapeutic strategies for metastatic UM, which has poor prognosis because existing therapies are ineffective. Here, we determined whether metabolic reprogramming is driven by constitutively active mutant α-subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq or G11 (Gq/11), the oncogenic drivers in ∼90% of UM patients. Using PET-computed tomography imaging, microphysiometry, and GC/MS, we found that inhibition of oncogenic Gq/11 with the small molecule FR900359 (FR) attenuated glucose uptake by UM cells in vivo and in vitro, blunted glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in UM cell lines and tumor cells isolated from patients, and reduced levels of several glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. FR acutely inhibited glycolysis and respiration and chronically attenuated expression of genes in both metabolic processes. UM therefore differs from other melanomas that exhibit a classic Warburg effect. Metabolic reprogramming in UM cell lines and patient samples involved protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 signaling downstream of oncogenic Gq/11. Chronic administration of FR upregulated expression of genes involved in metabolite scavenging and redox homeostasis, potentially as an adaptive mechanism explaining why FR does not efficiently kill UM tumor cells or regress UM tumor xenografts. These results establish that oncogenic Gq/11 signaling is a crucial driver of metabolic reprogramming in UM and lay a foundation for studies aimed at targeting metabolic reprogramming for therapeutic development."

Chemical fertilizers and phytohormones are major sources which can enhance the canola production under stressful conditions. Physio-biochemical responses of canola altered remarkably with the use of nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium (N/P/K) fertilizers and plant growth regulators (PGRs) under drought stress. The major aim of current study was to evaluate nutritional quality and physio-biochemical modulation in canola ( Brassica napus L.) from early growth to seed stage with NPK and PGRs in different water regimes. To monitor biochemical and physiological processes in canola, two season field experiment was conducted as spilt plot under randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments (Control, Chemical fertilizers [N (90 kg/ha), P and K (45 kg ha -1 )], PGRs; indole acetic acid (IAA) 15g ha -1 , gibberellic acid (GA 3 ) 15g ha -1 and the combination of NPK and PGRs] under different irrigations regimes (60, 100, 120, 150 mm evaporations). Water stress enhanced peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), soluble sugar, malondialdehyde (MDA), proline contents as well as leaf temperature while substantially reduced leaf water contents (21%), stomatal conductance (50%), chlorophyll contents (10–67%), membrane stability index (24%) and grain yield (30%) of canola. However, the combined application of NPK and PGR further increased the enzymatic antioxidant pool, soluble sugars, along with recovery of leaf water contents, chlorophyll contents, stomatal conductance and membrane stability index but decreased the proline contents and leaf temperature at different rate of evaporation. There is positive interaction of applied elicitors to the water stress in canola except leaf area. The outcomes depicted that the combination of NPK with PGRs improved the various morpho-physiological as well as biochemical parameters and reduced the pressure of chemical fertilizers cost about 60%. It had also reduced the deleterious effect of water limitation on the physiology and grain yield and oil contents of canola in field experiments."

Using data from semi-structured interviews with eight people who identified as Takatāpui/LGBTIQ+ and had experienced homelessness, this paper explores their experiences prior to becoming homeless. These experiences are placed into the categories of: the pervasiveness of instability (especially in regards to family relationships, finances, and housing), having to grow up fast due to social and material conditions, experiences of looking for housing in stressed markets, and systems failures that resulted in a lack of autonomy. These results show that instability and systems failures are key contributors to Takatāpui/LGBTIQ+ people becoming homeless in Aotearoa New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W4200184414,"Overhunting typically increases during and after armed conflicts, and may lead to regional-scale defaunation. The mitigation of hunting impacts is complex because, among other reasons, several intrinsic and extrinsic motivations underpin the elevated deployment of hunting practices. Here we present the first study focusing on these motivations in a post-war zone. Following persistently heavy hunting pressure during the 27-year Angolan civil war, the offtake of small to medium-bodied species has increased recently as a result of large mammal depletion. However, prey choice associated with different motivations varied in terms of species trophic level and body size. While most residents hunted large-bodied species to maximize revenues from wildlife trade, many low-trophic level smaller species were harvested to meet local subsistence demands because they were more palatable and could be captured using artisanal traps near hunters’ households. Mainly low-trophic level species were killed in retaliation for crop-raiding or livestock depredation. Considering all game species sampled in this study, 96% were captured to attend two or more motivations. In addition, hunting associated with different motivations was partitioned in terms of age and gender, with prey acquisition for the wildlife trade primarily carried out by adult men, while hunting to meet local subsistence needs and inhibit human-wildlife conflicts were carried out by adult men and women, children and even the elderly. In natural savannah areas lacking fish as a source of protein, a higher number of species was selected to supply both the meat trade and subsistence, while more species in forest areas were targeted for trade in animal body parts and conflict retaliation. Finally, local commerce in bushmeat and other body parts accrued higher domestic revenues compared to any alternative sources of direct and indirect income. However, these financial benefits were at best modest, largely unsustainable in terms of prey population collapses, and generated high long-term costs for the local to regional scale economy and native biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4200254787,"The human RecQ DNA helicase, RECQL4, plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway, and is, thus, involved in the regulation of aging and cancer onset. However, the regulatory mechanisms of RECQL4, especially its post-translational modifications, have not been fully illustrated. Here, we report that the E2/E3 hybrid ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBE2O, physically interacts with RECQL4, and mediates the multi-monoubiquitinylation of RECQL4, subsequently leading to its proteasomal degradation. Functionally, we showed that UBE2O inhibits homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSBs repair, and this inhibition depends on its E2 catalytic activity and RECQL4 expression. Mechanistically, we showed that UBE2O attenuates the interaction of RECQL4 and DNA damage repair proteins, the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex and CtIP. Furthermore, we show that deubiquitinylase USP7 interacts with both UBE2O and RECQL4, and in that it antagonizes UBE2O-mediated regulation of RECQL4 stability and function. Collectively, we found a novel regulatory mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated regulation of RECQL4 in HR-mediated DSBs repair process."
https://openalex.org/W4200261925,"ATP11C is a member of the P4-ATPase flippase family that mediates translocation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) across the lipid bilayer. In order to characterize the structure and function of ATP11C in a model natural lipid environment, we revisited and optimized a quick procedure for reconstituting ATP11C into Nanodiscs using methyl-β-cyclodextrin as a reagent for the detergent removal. ATP11C was efficiently reconstituted with the endogenous lipid, or the mixture of endogenous lipid and synthetic dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)/dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS), all of which retained the ATPase activity. We obtained 3.4 Å and 3.9 Å structures using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of AlF- and BeF-stabilized ATP11C transport intermediates, respectively, in a bilayer containing DOPS. We show that the latter exhibited a distended inner membrane around ATP11C transmembrane helix 2, possibly reflecting the perturbation needed for phospholipid release to the lipid bilayer. Our structures of ATP11C in the lipid membrane indicate that the membrane boundary varies upon conformational changes of the enzyme and is no longer flat around the protein, a change that likely contributes to phospholipid translocation across the membrane leaflets."
https://openalex.org/W4200469521,"Protecting patients' privacy is one of the most important tasks when developing medical artificial intelligence models since medical data is the most sensitive personal data. To overcome this privacy protection issue, diverse privacy-preserving methods have been proposed. We proposed a novel method for privacy-preserving Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) inference model using privacy enhancing technologies including homomorphic encryption and secure two party computation. The proposed privacy-preserving GRU inference model validated on breast cancer recurrence prediction with 13,117 patients' medical data. Our method gives reliable prediction result (0.893 accuracy) compared to the normal GRU model (0.895 accuracy). Unlike other previous works, the experiment on real breast cancer data yields almost identical results for privacy-preserving and conventional cases. We also implement our algorithm to shows the realistic end-to-end encrypted breast cancer recurrence prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4200276906,"Coffee berry borer (CBB, Hypothenemus hampei Ferrari) is the most serious insect pest of coffee worldwide, yet little is known about the effect that weather variables have on CBB flight activity. We sampled flying female CBB adults bi-weekly over a three-year period using red funnel traps baited with an alcohol lure at 14 commercial coffee farms on Hawaii Island to characterize seasonal phenology and the relationship between flight activity and five weather variables. We captured almost 5 million scolytid beetles during the sampling period, with 81-93% of the trap catch comprised of CBB. Of the captured non-target beetles, the majority were tropical nut borer, black twig borer and a species of Cryphalus. Two major flight events were consistent across all three years: an initial emergence from January-April that coincided with early fruit development and a second flight during the harvest season from September-December. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) revealed that mean daily air temperature had a highly significant positive correlation with CBB flight; most flight events occurred between 20-26°C. Mean daily solar radiation also had a significant positive relationship with flight. Flight was positively correlated with maximum daily relative humidity at values below ~94%, and cumulative rainfall up to 100 mm; flight was also positively correlated with maximum daily wind speeds up to ~2.5 m/s, after which activity declined. Our findings provide important insight into CBB flight patterns across a highly variable landscape and can serve as a starting point for the development of flight prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W4200416248,"There has been significant interest in researching the pharmaceutical applications of Industrial hemp since its legalization three years ago. The crop is mostly dioecious and known for its production of phytocannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes. Although many scientific reports have showed gene expression analysis of hemp through OMICs approaches, unreliable reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR data make it difficult to validate the OMICs data. Four software packages: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder were used to evaluate the differential gene expression patterns of 13 candidate reference genes under osmotic, heavy metal, hormonal, and UV stresses. EF-1α ranked as the most stable reference gene across all stresses, TUB was the most stable under osmotic stress, and TATA was the most stable under both heavy metal stress and hormonal stimuli. The expression patterns of two cannabinoid pathway genes, AAE1 and CBDAS, were used to validate the reliability of the selected reference genes. This work provides useful information for gene expression characterization in hemp and future research in the synthesis, transport, and accumulation of secondary metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W4200585933,"Curtailing physical contact between individuals reduces transmission and spread of the disease. Social distancing is an accepted and effective strategy to delay the disease spread and reduce the magnitude of outbreaks of pandemic COVID-19. However, no study quantified social distancing practice and associated factors in the current study area. Therefore, the study aimed to assess social distancing practice and associated factors in response to COVID-19 pandemic in West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2020.A Community based cross-sectional study design was conducted among randomly selected 410 household members of Bule Hora Town, West Guji Zone. Data were collected by pre-tested interviewer administered structured questionnaire adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. The data were coded and entered in to Epi data version 3.5 and analyzed by SPSS version 23. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions analysis was done to identify factors associated with social distancing practice. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and p value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.Out of 447 planned samples, 410 participants were successfully interviewed and included into final analysis; making the response rate of 91.7%. The median (±IQR) age of study participants was 28(±9) years. In this study, 38.3% [95% CI: 33.5%, 43.1%)] of the study participants have good social distancing practices for the prevention of COVID-19. Age group 26-30 years [AOR = 2.56(95% CI: 1.18-5.54)] and 31-35 years [AOR = 3.57(95%CI: 1.56-8.18)], employed [AOR = 6.10(95%CI: 3.46-10.74)],poor knowledge [AOR = 0.59 (95% CI:0.36-0.95)], negative attitude [AOR = 0.55 (95% CI:0.31-0.95)] and low perceived susceptibility [AOR = 0.33(95%CI: 0.20-0.54)] were significantly associated with good social distancing practice.Social distancing practice is relatively poor in the study area. The knowledge and attitude level of participants were identified to be the major factors for the observed poor social distancing practice. Sustained efforts to improve awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention might improve adherence to social distancing practices."
https://openalex.org/W4200036005,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have gained increasing attention as their diverse roles in virulence and environmental stress in Listeria monocytogenes have become clearer. The ncRNA rliB is an atypical member of the CRISPR family, conserved at the same genomic locus in all analyzed L. monocytogenes genomes and also in other Listeria species. In this study, rliB defective mutants (Lm3-22-ΔrliB) were constructed by homologous recombination. The growth cycle of Lm3-22-ΔrliB mutants was slower than that of wild-type Lm3-22. The sensitivity of Lm3-22-ΔrliB to the Listeria phage vB-LmoM-SH3-3 was significantly increased, and the efficiency of plaque formation was enhanced by 128 fold. Compared with wild type, the adhesion and invasion of Lm3-22-ΔrliB decreased significantly (9.3% and 1.33%, respectively). After 4 hours of infection, the proliferation of Lm3-22-ΔrliB in RAW264.7 cells also decreased significantly. Transcription level of invasion-related surface proteins showed that the internalin genes lmo0610 and lm0514, and the peptidoglycan binding protein gene lmo1799 in Lm3-22-ΔrliB were significantly increased. In addition, after interaction with phage, the transcription levels of inlA, lmo0610, lmo1799, lmo2085, and lmo0514 in Lm3-22-ΔrliB cells were significantly upregulated, while inlB was downregulated, compared with Lm3-22 control group with phage treatment. Therefore, rliB deletion effectively regulated the interaction between Listeria and phage, weaken its invasion ability, and provided a new theoretical basis for biocontrol of phage."
https://openalex.org/W4200044803,"The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is a major maize pest in the United States causing significant economic loss. The emergence of field-evolved resistant WCR to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) traits has prompted the need to discover and deploy new insecticidal proteins in transgenic maize. In the current study we determined the crystal structure and mode of action (MOA) of the Vpb4Da2 protein (formerly known as Vip4Da2) from Bt, the first identified insecticidal Vpb4 protein with commercial level control against WCR. The Vpb4Da2 structure exhibits a six-domain architecture mainly comprised of antiparallel β-sheets organized into β-sandwich layers. The amino-terminal domains 1-3 of the protein share structural homology with the protective antigen (PA) PA14 domain and encompass a long β-pore forming loop as in the clostridial binary-toxB module. Domains 5 and 6 at the carboxyl-terminal half of Vpb4Da2 are unique as this extension is not observed in PA or any other structurally-related protein other than Vpb4 homologs. These unique Vpb4 domains adopt the topologies of carbohydrate-binding modules known to participate in receptor-recognition. Functional assessment of Vpb4Da2 suggests that domains 4-6 comprise the WCR receptor binding region and are key in conferring the observed insecticidal activity against WCR. The current structural analysis was complemented by in vitro and in vivo characterizations, including immuno-histochemistry, demonstrating that Vpb4Da2 follows a MOA that is consistent with well-characterized 3-domain Bt insecticidal proteins despite significant structural differences."
https://openalex.org/W4200111127,"Prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is higher in patients born between 1955-1975. The aim was to perform an economic evaluation of an age-based electronic health record (EHR) alert in primary care to detect patients with undiagnosed CHC and its treatment in comparison with non-use of the alert system, in Valencian Community, Spain.Decision trees and Markov model were used to evaluate the diagnosis and progression of the disease, respectively. CHC was diagnosed by serology and viral load in seropositive subjects. Epidemiological data and diagnostic costs were extracted from public sources of the Valencian Community. Probabilities, utilities and costs of model states were obtained from the literature. The impact on mortality and hepatic complications avoided by the implementation of the alert were estimated, and efficiency was measured as an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the costs of both alternatives.The EHR alert detected 269,548 patients, of whom 1,331 had CHC (vs. 23 patients with non-alert). Over the patients' lifetime, the alert would prevent 93% of decompensated cirrhosis cases, 87% of hepatocellular carcinomas, 90% of liver transplants, and 89% of liver related deaths compared to non-use of the alert system. In addition, it would obtain an additional 3.3 QALY per patient, with an incremental cost of €10,880 and an ICUR of €3,321.The implementation of an age-based EHR alert in primary care to detect patients with CHC reduces hepatic complications and mortality and is an efficient strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4200200299,"Mitochondria are sites of cellular respiration, which is accompanied by the generation of dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cells have multiple mechanisms to mitigate the dangers of ROS. Here we investigate the involvement of the COX complex assembly chaperone COX11 (cytochrome c oxidase 11) in cellular redox homeostasis, using homologs from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCOX11) and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScCOX11). We found that AtCOX11 is upregulated in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to various oxidative stresses, suggesting a defensive role. In line with this, the overexpression of either AtCOX11 or ScCOX11 reduced ROS levels in yeast cells exposed to the oxidative stressor paraquat. Under normal growth conditions, both Arabidopsis and yeast COX11 overexpressing cells had the same ROS levels as the corresponding WT. In contrast, the COX11 knock-down and knock-out in Arabidopsis and yeast, respectively, significantly reduced ROS levels. In yeast cells, the ScCOX11 appears to be functionally redundant with superoxide dismutase 1 (ScSOD1), a superoxide detoxifying enzyme. The ΔSccox11ΔScsod1 mutants had dramatically reduced growth on paraquat, compared with the WT or single mutants. This growth retardation does not seem to be linked to the status of the COX complex and cellular respiration. Overexpression of putatively soluble COX11 variants substantially improved the resistance of yeast cells to the ROS inducer menadione. This shows that COX11 proteins can provide antioxidative protection likely independently from their COX assembly function. The conserved Cys219 (in AtCOX11) and Cys208 (in ScCOX11) are important for this function. Altogether, these results suggest that COX11 homologs, in addition to participating in COX complex assembly, have a distinct and evolutionary conserved role in protecting cells during heightened oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W4200389773,"Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 (DBC1) is an important metabolic sensor. Previous studies have implicated DBC1 in various cellular functions, notably cell proliferation, apoptosis, histone modification, and adipogenesis. However, current reports about the role of DBC1 in tumorigenesis are controversial and designate DBC1 alternatively as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. In the present study, we report that polyoma small T antigen (PyST) associates with DBC1 in mammalian cells, and this interaction leads to the posttranslational downregulation of DBC1 protein levels. When coexpressed, DBC1 overcomes PyST-induced mitotic arrest and promotes the exit of cells from mitosis. Using both transient and stable modes of PyST expression, we also show that cellular DBC1 is subjected to degradation by LKB1, a tumor suppressor and cellular energy sensor kinase, in an AMP kinase-independent manner. Moreover, LKB1 negatively regulates the phosphorylation as well as activity of the prosurvival kinase AKT1 through DBC1 and its downstream pseudokinase substrate, Tribbles 3 (TRB3). Using both transient transfection and stable cell line approaches as well as soft agar assay, we demonstrate that DBC1 has oncogenic potential. In conclusion, our study provides insight into a novel signaling axis that connects LKB1, DBC1, TRB3, and AKT1. We propose that the LKB1-DBC1-AKT1 signaling paradigm may have an important role in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis and consequently tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4225793592,"POLDIP2 is a multifunctional protein whose roles are only partially understood. Our laboratory previously reported physiological studies performed using a mouse gene trap model, which suffered from three limitations: perinatal lethality in homozygotes, constitutive Poldip2 inactivation and inadvertent downregulation of the adjacent Tmem199 gene. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new conditional floxed Poldip2 model. The first part of the present study shows that our initial floxed mice were affected by an unexpected mutation, which was not readily detected by Southern blotting and traditional PCR. It consisted of a 305 kb duplication around Poldip2 with retention of the wild type allele and could be traced back to the original targeted ES cell clone. We offer simple suggestions to rapidly detect similar accidents, which may affect genome editing using both traditional and CRISPR-based methods. In the second part of the present study, correctly targeted floxed Poldip2 mice were generated and used to produce a new constitutive knockout line by crossing with a Cre deleter. In contrast to the gene trap model, many homozygous knockout mice were viable, in spite of having no POLDIP2 expression. To further characterize the effects of Poldip2 ablation in the vasculature, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR experiments were performed in constitutive knockout arteries. Results show that POLDIP2 inactivation affects multiple cellular processes and provide new opportunities for future in-depth study of its functions."
https://openalex.org/W4200003477,"The Kv1.3 channel has been widely demonstrated to play crucial roles in the activation and proliferation of T cells, which suggests that selective blockers could serve as potential therapeutics for autoimmune diseases mediated by T cells. We previously described that the toxin mimic FS48 from salivary gland of Xenopsylla cheopis downregulates the secretion of proinflammatory factors by Raw 264.7 cells by blocking the Kv1.3 channel and the subsequent inactivation of the proinflammatory MAPK/NF-κB pathways. However, the effects of FS48 on human T cells and autoimmune diseases are unclear. Here, we described its immunomodulatory effects on human T cells derived from suppression of Kv1.3 channel. Kv1.3 currents in Jurkat T cells were recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp, and Ca2+ influx, cell proliferation, and TNF-α and IL-2 secretion were measured using Fluo-4, CCK-8, and ELISA assays, respectively. The in vivo immunosuppressive activity of FS48 was evaluated with a rat DTH model. We found that FS48 reduced Kv1.3 currents in Jurkat T cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of about 1.42 μM. FS48 also significantly suppressed Kv1.3 protein expression, Ca2+ influx, MAPK/NF-κB/NFATc1 pathway activation, and TNF-α and IL-2 production in activated Jurkat T cells. Finally, we show that FS48 relieved the DTH response in rats. We therefore conclude that FS48 can block the Kv1.3 channel and inhibit human T cell activation, which most likely contributes to its immunomodulatory actions and highlights the great potential of this evolutionary-guided peptide as a drug template in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4200056898,"Ubiquitination has been shown to provide an essential regulatory role in modulating the duration and amplitude of the signaling activity in angiogenesis. While successive enzymatic reactions mediated by three distinct types of enzymes commonly known as E1, E2, and E3 are required for ubiquitination, the role of E3s which govern the final step of ubiquitination has been extensively analyzed in angiogenesis. In contrast, the role of E2s, which determine the context and functional consequences of ubiquitination, remains largely unknown with respect to angiogenesis. To better elucidate the role of E2s in modulating endothelial behaviors during angiogenesis, we first systematically analyze the expression pattern of E2s in endothelial cells (ECs) using previously published scRNA-seq data and identify ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant 1 (UBE2V1), an unconventional E2 without innate catalytic activity, as one of the most abundantly expressed E2s in ECs. While ubiquitously expressed in diverse cell types, abrogation of UBE2V1 significantly impairs proliferation and viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) without affecting other cell types, suggesting that UBE2V1 is likely to possess nonredundant functions in ECs. Consistent with this idea, UBE2V1 appears to be critical for morphogenesis and migration of ECs during angiogenesis. Interestingly, we find that UBE2V1 is essential for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-induced angiogenesis, but appears to have minor effects on vascular endothelial growth factor-A-induced angiogenesis in vitro as well as in vivo. Therefore, it seems that UBE2V1 could enable ECs to distinguish two related yet distinct angiogenic cues. Mechanistically, we show that UBE2V1 promotes ubiquitination of MEK kinase 1, a key mediator of FGF2 signaling, to enhance phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in HUVECs. Taken together, our results illustrate the unique role of UBE2V1 as a key modulator for angiogenic behaviors in ECs."

To assess the proportion of users outside the therapeutic range of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).Cohort study (CoLaus|PsyCoLaus) with recruitment from 2003 to 2006. Follow-ups occurred 5 and 10 years after baseline.A random sample of Lausanne (Switzerland) inhabitants aged 35-75 years.We evaluated the prevalence of chronic levothyroxine use and we then ranked it among the other most used chronic drugs. The ranking was compared to data from health insurance across the country. We assessed the association between each factor and chronic levothyroxine use in multivariable logistic regression models. The proportion of chronic levothyroxine users outside the usual TSH therapeutic range was assessed.4,334 participants were included in the analysis (mean±SD age 62.8±10.4 years, 54.9% women). 166 (3.8%) participants were chronic levothyroxine users. Levothyroxine was the second most prescribed chronic drug after aspirin in the cohort (8.2%) and the third most prescribed when using Swiss-wide insurance data. In multivariable analysis, chronic levothyroxine use was associated with increasing age [odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.05 per 1-year increase]; female sex [11.87 (5.24-26.89)]; BMI [1.06 (1.02-1.09) per 1-kg/m2 increase]; number of concomitant drugs [1.22 (1.16-1.29) per 1-drug increase]; and family history of thyroid pathologies [2.18 (1.37-3.48)]. Among chronic levothyroxine users with thyroid hormones assessment (n = 157), 42 (27%) were outside the TSH therapeutic range (17% overtreated and 10% undertreated).In this population-based study, levothyroxine ranked second among chronic drugs.

The participants were selected from among those who participated in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The incidence and severity of tinnitus was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire, while depressive symptoms were evaluated using self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine the association between tinnitus and depressive symptoms. Overall, 10 979 (4821 men and 6158 women) participants were enrolled in the study. Regardless of sex, individuals who reported having tinnitus were more likely to have depressive symptoms than those without tinnitus (men: odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.32; women: odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.35-2.35). In severe cases of tinnitus, women were more likely to have depressive symptoms (odds ratio 7.18, 95% confidence interval 3.71-13.87) compared to men.

https://openalex.org/W4200555665,"Determining the drivers of plant rarity is a major challenge in ecology. Analysing spatial associations between different plant species can provide an exploratory avenue for understanding the ecological drivers of plant rarity. Here, we examined the different types of spatial associations between rare and common plants to determine if they influence the occurrence patterns of rare species. We completed vegetation surveys at 86 sites in woodland, forest, and heath communities in south-east Australia. We also examined two different rarity measures to quantify how categorisation criteria affected our results. Rare species were more likely to have positive associations with both rare and common species across all three vegetation communities. However, common species had positive or negative associations with rare and other common species, depending on the vegetation community in which they occurred. Rare species were positively associated with species diversity in forest communities. In woodland communities, rare species were associated negatively with species diversity but positively associated with species evenness. Rare species with high habitat specificity were more clustered spatially than expected by chance. Efforts to understand the drivers of plant rarity should use rarity definitions that consider habitat specificity. Our findings suggest that examining spatial associations between plants can help understand the drivers of plant rarity."
https://openalex.org/W4200626647,"Objectives To exploit the features of digital PCR for implementing SARS-CoV-2 observational studies by reliably including the viral load factor expressed as copies/μL. Methods A small cohort of 51 Covid-19 positive samples was assessed by both RT-qPCR and digital PCR assays. A linear regression model was built using a training subset, and its accuracy was assessed in the remaining evaluation subset. The model was then used to convert the stored cycle threshold values of a large dataset of 6208 diagnostic samples into copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2. The calculated viral load was used for a single cohort retrospective study. Finally, the cohort was randomly divided into a training set (n = 3095) and an evaluation set (n = 3113) to establish a logistic regression model for predicting case-fatality and to assess its accuracy. Results The model for converting the Ct values into copies/μL was suitably accurate. The calculated viral load over time in the cohort of Covid-19 positive samples showed very low viral loads during the summer inter-epidemic waves in Italy. The calculated viral load along with gender and age allowed building a predictive model of case-fatality probability which showed high specificity (99.0%) and low sensitivity (21.7%) at the optimal threshold which varied by modifying the threshold (i.e. 75% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity). Alternative models including categorised cVL or raw cycle thresholds obtained by the same diagnostic method also gave the same performance. Conclusion The modelling of the cycle threshold values using digital PCR had the potential of fostering studies addressing issues regarding Sars-CoV-2; furthermore, it may allow setting up predictive tools capable of early identifying those patients at high risk of case-fatality already at diagnosis, irrespective of the diagnostic RT-qPCR platform in use. Depending upon the epidemiological situation, public health authority policies/aims, the resources available and the thresholds used, adequate sensitivity could be achieved with acceptable low specificity."
https://openalex.org/W4200106482,"The impact of surgical correction of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) on 3D kinematics has not been thoroughly evaluated in dogs. The success of current techniques remains limited, as illustrated by suboptimal weightbearing and progression of osteoarthritis. The inability to restore the stifle’s 3D kinematics might be a key element in understanding these suboptimal outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of lateral suture stabilization (LSS) on the 3D kinematics of the canine stifle joint. We hypothesized that LSS would not restore 3D kinematics in our model. Ten cadaveric pelvic limbs collected from large dogs (25–40 kg) were tested using a previously validated apparatus that simulates gait. Three experimental conditions were compared: (a) intact stifle; (b) unstable stifle following cranial cruciate ligament transection (CCLt) and (c) CCLt stabilized by LSS. Three-dimensional kinematics were collected through 5 loading cycles simulating the stance phase of gait and curves were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. LSS restored baseline kinematics for the entire stance phase for cranial and lateromedial translation, flexion, and abduction. It restored distraction over 90% of the stance phase. Internal rotation was limited, but not restored. This in vitro study had limitations, as it used a simplified model of stifle motion and weight-bearing. The results of this study report that LSS can restore physiologic 3D kinematics largely comparable to those of healthy stifles. Suboptimal outcome in patients following CCLR stabilization by LSS may therefore result from causes other than immediate postoperative abnormal 3D kinematics."
https://openalex.org/W4200187914,"Streptococcus gordonii is an etiological bacterial agent of infective endocarditis. Although the pathogenesis mechanisms are not well understood, the interaction between streptococci and phagocytes is considered important for the development of infective endocarditis. Previous studies show that some S. gordonii strains, including DL1, survive in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), whereas other strains such as SK12 are sensitive to PMN-dependent killing. In this study, we assessed the differences between the sensitivity of S. gordonii DL1 and S. gordonii SK12 to PMN-dependent killing. S. gordonii DL1 showed a higher survival when treated with PMNs than SK12. Both S. gordonii DL1 and S. gordonii SK12 showed high resistance to low pH condition. Compared to S. gordonii SK12, S. gordonii DL1 was sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. However, the resistance of S. gordonii DL1 to the tested bactericidal agents, especially lysozyme, was higher than that of SK12. Furthermore, we performed a bactericidal assay by treating a mixture of S. gordonii DL1 and SK12 with PMNs. S. gordonii DL1 did not enhance the survival of S. gordonii SK12 exposed to PMNs. These results indicated that S. gordonii DL1 is resistant to bactericidal agents that degrade bacteria in phagolysosomes. In addition, there was no secretory factor involved in the resistance to bactericidal agents. The findings of this study may help develop treatments for infective endocarditis caused by S. gordonii."

The average daily propofol dose per body weight was significantly lower in the EA group than in the LA and NA groups (β -5.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) -8.93 to -1.33] and β -4.51 [95% CI -8.59 to -0.43], respectively). Regarding safety, enteral SPM administration did not increase adverse events, including self-extubation. The total cost of neuroactive drugs tended to be lower in the EA group than in the LA and NA groups.Early enteral SPM administration reduced the average daily propofol dose per body weight without increasing adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W4200538615,"Hepatoencephalopathy due to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency type 1 (COXPD1) is a recessive mitochondrial translation disorder caused by mutations in GFM1, a nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EFG1). Patients with COXPD1 typically present hepatoencephalopathy early after birth with rapid disease progression, and usually die within the first few weeks or years of life. We have generated two different mouse models: a Gfm1 knock-in (KI) harboring the p.R671C missense mutation, found in at least 10 patients who survived more than 1 year, and a Gfm1 knock-out (KO) model. Homozygous KO mice (Gfm1-/- ) were embryonically lethal, whereas homozygous KI (Gfm1R671C/R671C ) mice were viable and showed normal growth. R671C mutation in Gfm1 caused drastic reductions in the mitochondrial EFG1 protein content in different organs. Six- to eight-week-old Gfm1R671C/R671C mice showed partial reductions of in organello mitochondrial translation and respiratory complex IV enzyme activity in the liver. Compound heterozygous Gfm1R671C/- showed a more pronounced decrease of EFG1 protein in liver and brain mitochondria, as compared with Gfm1R671C/R671C mice. At 8 weeks of age, their mitochondrial translation rates were significantly reduced in both tissues. Additionally, Gfm1R671C/- mice showed combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (reduced complex I and IV enzyme activities in liver and brain), and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed lower amounts of both affected complexes. We conclude that the compound heterozygous Gfm1R671C/- mouse presents a clear dysfunctional molecular phenotype, showing impaired mitochondrial translation and combined respiratory chain dysfunction, making it a suitable animal model for the study of COXPD1."
https://openalex.org/W4200010835,"Objective This study aims to determine whether redeploying junior doctors to assist at triage represents good value for money and a good use of finite staffing resources. Methods We undertook a cost-minimisation analysis to produce new evidence, from an economic perspective, about the costs associated with reallocating junior doctors in the emergency department. We built a decision-analytic model, using a mix of prospectively collected data, routinely collected administrative databases and hospital costings to furnish the model. To measure the impact of uncertainty on the model’s inputs and outputs, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken, using Monte Carlo simulation. Results The mean costs for usual care were $27,035 (95% CI $27,016 to $27,054), while the mean costs for the new model of care were $25,474, (95% CI $25,453 to $25,494). As a result, the mean difference was -$1,561 (95% CI -$1,533 to -$1,588), with the new model of care being a less costly approach to managing staffing allocations, in comparison to the usual approach. Conclusion Our study shows that redeploying a junior doctor from the fast-track area of the department to assist at triage provides a modest reduction in cost. Our findings give decision-makers who seek to maximise benefit from their finite budget, support to reallocate personnel within the ED."

In contrast to a conventional anomaloscope, the ""red/white dissociation ratio"" (RWR) allows to describe protanopia numerically. For the majority of subjects with protanopia a restriction for faint red stimuli was found.Comparing the horizontal visual field extensions for red and white stimuli in subjects with protanopia and those with normal trichromacy and assessing the related intra-subject intra-session repeatability.The subjects were divided into groups with protanopia and with normal trichromacy, based on color vision testing (HMC anomaloscope, Oculus, Wetzlar/FRG). Two stimulus characteristics, III4e and III1e, according to the Goldmann-classification, were presented with semi-automated kinetic perimetry (Octopus 900 perimeter, Haag-Streit, Köniz/CH). They moved along the horizontal meridian, with an angular velocity of 3°/s towards the visual field center, starting from either the temporal or nasal periphery. If necessary, a 20° nasal fixation point offset was chosen to capture the temporal periphery of the visual field. For each condition the red/white dissociation ratio (RWR); Pat Appl. DPMA DRN 43200082D) between the extent of the isopter for red (RG610, Schott, Mainz/ FRG) and white stimuli along the horizontal meridian was determined.All data are listed as median/interquartile range: Five males with protanopia (age 22.1/4.5 years) and six males with normal trichromacy (control group, age 30.5/15.2 years) were enrolled. The RWR is listed for the right eye, as no clinically relevant difference between right and left eye occurred. Protanopes' RWR for mark III4e (in brackets: control group) was 0.941/0.013 (0.977/0.019) and for mark III1e 0.496/0.062 (0.805/0.051), respectively.In this exploratory ""proof-of-concept study"" red/white dissociation ratio perimetry is introduced as a novel technique aiming at assessing and quantifying the severity of protanopia. Further effort is needed to understand the magnitude of the observed red-/white dissociation and to extend this methodology to a wider age range of the sample and to anomalous trichromacies (protanomalia) with varying magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W4200021261,"Live anthrax vaccine containing spores from attenuated strains STI-1 of Bacillus anthracis is used in Russia and former CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) to prevent anthrax. In this paper we studied the duration of circulation of antibodies specific to spore antigens, the protective antigen (PA), the lethal factor (LF) and their domains (D) in donors' blood at different times after their immunization with live anthrax vaccine. The relationship between the toxin neutralization activity level and the level of antibodies to PA, LF and their domains was tested. The effect of age, gender and number of vaccinations on the level of adaptive post-vaccination immune response has been studied. It was shown that antibodies against PA-D1 circulate in the blood of donors for 1 year or more after immunization with live anthrax vaccine. Antibodies against all domains of LF and PA-D4 were detected in 11 months after vaccination. Antibodies against the spores were detected in 8 months after vaccination. A moderate positive correlation was found between the titers of antibodies to PA, LF, or their domains, and the TNA of the samples of blood serum from the donors."
https://openalex.org/W4200588186,"Detection and accurate delineation of tumor is important for the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) but is challenging with current imaging techniques. In this study, we evaluated whether molecular immuno-imaging targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an oxidative enzyme secreted by many myeloid innate immune cells, would be superior in detecting tumor extent compared to conventional contrast agent (DTPA-Gd) in a carcinogen-induced immunocompetent HNSCC murine model and corroborated in human surgical specimens. In C57BL/6 mice given 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), there was increased MPO activity in the head and neck region as detected by luminol bioluminescence compared to that of the control group. On magnetic resonance imaging, the mean enhancing volume detected by the MPO-targeting agent (MPO-Gd) was higher than that by the conventional agent DTPA-Gd. The tumor volume detected by MPO-Gd strongly correlated with tumor size on histology, and higher MPO-Gd signal corresponded to larger tumor size found by imaging and histology. On the contrary, the tumor volume detected by DTPA-Gd did not correlate as well with tumor size on histology. Importantly, MPO-Gd imaging detected areas not visualized with DTPA-Gd imaging that were confirmed histopathologically to represent early tumor. In human specimens, MPO was similarly associated with tumors, especially at the tumor margins. Thus, molecular immuno-imaging targeting MPO not only detects oxidative immune response in HNSCC, but can better detect and delineate tumor extent than nonselective imaging agents. Thus, our findings revealed that MPO imaging could improve tumor resection as well as be a useful imaging biomarker for tumor progression, and potentially improve clinical management of HNSCC once translated."
https://openalex.org/W4200622657,"Defining reference intervals in experimental animal models plays a crucial role in pre-clinical studies. The hepatic parameters in healthy animals provide useful information about type and extension of hepatic damage. However, in the majority of the cases, to obtain them require an invasive techniques. Our study combines these determinations with dynamic functional test and imaging techniques to implement a non-invasive protocol for liver evaluation. The aim of the study was to determine reference intervals for hepatic function, perfusion and parenchyma attenuation with analytical and biochemical blood parameters, indocyanine green, ultrasound and computed tomography in six healthy SD rats.Six males healthy SD rats were followed for 4 weeks. To determine hepatic function, perfusion and parenchyma attenuation analytical and biochemical blood parameters, indocyanine green, ultrasound and computed tomography were studied. Results were expressed as Means ± standard error of mean (SEM). The significance of differences was calculated by using student t-test, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Indocyanine green clearance 5 and 10 minutes after its injection was 80.12% and 96.59%, respectively. Approximate rate of decay during the first 5 minutes after injection was 38% per minute. Hepatic perfusion evaluation with the high-frequency ultrasound was related to cardiovascular hemodynamic and renal perfusion. Portal area, hepatic artery resistance index, hepatic artery and portal peak systolic velocity and average between hepatic artery and porta was 3.41 ± 0.62 mm2, 0.57 ± 0.04 mm2/s, 693.24±102.53 mm2/s, 150.72 ± 17.80 mm2/s and 4.82 ± 0.96 mm2/s, respectively. Heart rate, cardiac output, left renal artery diammetre and renal blood flow were 331.01 ± 22.22 bpm, 75.58 ± 8.72 mL/min, 0.88 ± 0.04 mm2 and 13.65 ± 1.95 mm2/s. CT-scan hepatic average volume for each rat were 21.08±3.32, 17.57±2.76, 14.87±2.83 and 13.67±2.45 cm3 with an average attenuation coefficient of 113.51±18.08, 129,19±7.18, 141,47±1.95 y 151,67±1.2 HU.Indocyanine green and high-frequency ultrasound could be used in rats as a suitable marker of liver function. Computed tomography, through the study of raw data, help to characterize liver parenchyma, and could be a potential tool for early detection of liver parenchymal alterations and linear follow-up of patients. Further studies in rats with liver disease are necessary to verify the usefulness of these parameters."
