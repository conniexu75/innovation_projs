https://openalex.org/W2087427954,"Phosphorus-32 applied to leaves of Plantago erecta in a serpentine annual grassland reached the shoots of about 20 percent of the close neighbors. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae connect the root systems of neighbors of different species and probably mediate nutrient transfers among them. Spatial patterns of transfer show that taxonomic affinity, distance from donor, and size of recipient do not serve as predictors of transfer and that models of transfer by simple diffusion are not appropriate. No alternative predictor was discovered. The results underscore the importance of belowground interactions in explaining neighbor effects, but the factors controlling nutrient transfer and its consequences for community structure appear complex."

The O.H. 7 hand, jaw, and skull and the O.H. 8 foot come from one subadult individual, and the O.H. 35 leg are also those of Homo habilis. The skeleton represents a mosaic of primitive and derived features, indicating an early hominid which walked bipedally and could fabricate stone tools but also retained the generalized hominoid capacity to climb trees."

The initial division can be induced in the absence of cytokinin by the calcium ionophore A23187 in medium containing calcium. These findings suggest that increases in the concentration of intracellular calcium are essential to bud initiation. Therefore mitotic regulation by cytokinin may be due, at least in part, to the modulation of intracellular calcium ion concentration."

Given geological maps of readily available predrilling exploration data for Mount Tolman in Washington State and using rules obtained from a porphyry molybdenum exploration specialist, the program (called PROSPECTOR) identified the location of previously unknown ore-grade mineralization. This appears to be the first reported determination of the location of mineralization by such a computer-based approach."

https://openalex.org/W2073701241,"The calcium carbonate content was determined for core tops from two transects on the upper slope to lower rise on the mid-Atlantic continental margin. Carbonate content in the sediment increases from âˆ¼ 5 percent (by weight) on the upper slope to more than 30 percent on the upper rise. A zone of low-carbonate content extends from 3000 to 4400 meters. Below 4400 meters, the percent carbonate increases. An examination of dissolution indices in these core tops indicates that the low-carbonate zone is associated with intense dissolution. Below 4400 meters, dissolution decreases and carbonate is well preserved. The decrease in dissolution occurs where the high-velocity core of the Western Boundary Undercurrent is first encountered ."

https://openalex.org/W2005060852,"This article describes one model for organizing and mobilizing scientific resources to address the highly complex and costly problem of soil erosion in the Pacific Northwest. With a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to the agricultural experiment stations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as supplementary state and federal funds, STEEP awards intermediate-term (15 year) grants for research in five areas: tillage and plant management, plant design, erosion and runoff predictions, pest management, and socioeconomics of erosion control. Most of the research projects require collaboration across disciplines and, in some instances, across state boundaries. After 6 years of effort the results obtained with STEEP indicate that the model might be applicable to other regions and problems."

https://openalex.org/W2085749448,"There has been speculation that China's communes are undergoing drastic changes and that work patterns are being redefined so as to make individuals or households the basic production units in agriculture. A brief but intensive anthropological study in 17 communes suggests that, although collectivization is still considered to be the ideal form in more advanced areas, responsibility for some tasks is being assigned to households in some poorer communes in an effort to increase production and farm incomes and enhance development. Significant permanent improvements seem hinged to the rise of rural industry, which increasingly rewards individual efforts within the context of a basically collective social organization. The system is complex and is more flexible than it has been in the recent past."
