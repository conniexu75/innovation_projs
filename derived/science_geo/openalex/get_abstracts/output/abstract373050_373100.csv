Here we show that hormonal vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, robustly stimulates expression of pattern recognition receptor NOD2/CARD15/IBD1 gene and protein in primary human monocytic and epithelial cells. The vitamin D receptor signals through distal enhancers in the NOD2 gene, whose function was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromatin conformation capture assays. A key downstream signaling consequence of NOD2 activation by agonist muramyl dipeptide is stimulation of NF-κB transcription factor function, which induces expression of the gene encoding antimicrobial peptide defensin β2 (DEFB2/HBD2). Pretreatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 synergistically induced NF-κB function and expression of genes encoding DEFB2/HBD2 and antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin in the presence of muramyl dipeptide. Importantly, this synergistic response was also seen in macrophages from a donor wild type for NOD2 but was absent in macrophages from patients with Crohn disease homozygous for non-functional NOD2 variants. These studies provide strong molecular links between vitamin D deficiency and the genetics of Crohn disease, a chronic incurable inflammatory bowel condition, as Crohn’s pathogenesis is associated with attenuated NOD2 or DEFB2/HBD2 function.

Vitamin D has a range of physiological activities (1Lin R. White J.H.

Neither VDRE is conserved in mice, and the element in the CAMP gene is imbedded in a human/primate-specific Alu repeat (8Gombart A.F. Borregaard N. Koeffler H.P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Notably, human macrophages stimulated through toll-like receptors (TLRs) strongly induced CYP27B1 and VDR expression, rendering cells responsive to circulating levels of 25D (11Liu P.T. Stenger S. Li H. Wenzel L. Tan B.H. Krutzik S.R. Ochoa M.T. Schauber J. Wu K. Meinken C. Kamen D.L. Wagner M. Bals R. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Gallo R.L. Eisenberg D. Hewison M. Hollis B.W. Adams J.S. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 2006; 311: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar). This study showed that the magnitude of the downstream induction of CAMP by 25D in TLR-stimulated macrophages was strongly dependent on variations in 25D levels within the physiological range (11Liu P.T. Stenger S. Li H. Wenzel L. Tan B.H. Krutzik S.R. Ochoa M.T. Schauber J. Wu K. Meinken C. Kamen D.L. Wagner M. Bals R. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Gallo R.L. Eisenberg D. Hewison M. Hollis B.W. Adams J.S.

At higher latitudes, solar ultraviolet B is insufficient for cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis for periods of several months around winter. This, coupled with vitamin D-poor diets, leads to seasonal variations in circulating 25D levels and widespread vitamin D deficiency (3White J.H. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 5Holick M.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (10830) Google Scholar), which has been linked to certain cancers and to infectious and autoimmune diseases. Clinical and preclinical studies (e.g. Refs. 12Lim W.C. Hanauer S.B. Li Y.C. Nat. Clin. Pract. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2005; 2: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 13Liu N.

Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 4799-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have suggested that 1,25D deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD), a chronic incurable inflammatory condition, which is believed to arise from defective innate immune regulation of intestinal bacterial load (12Lim W.C. Hanauer S.B. Li Y.C. Nat. Clin. Pract. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2005; 2: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14Cho J.H. Nat. Rev.

In addition, VDR gene polymorphisms correlate with susceptibility to CD and to ulcerative colitis (20Simmons J.D. Mullighan C. Welsh K.I. Jewell D.P. Gut. 2000; 47: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Martin K. Radlmayr M. Borchers R. Heinzlmann M. Folwaczny C. Digestion. 2002; 66: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Associations between VDR signaling and IBD are also supported by animal models, where vitamin D sufficiency is associated with reduced frequency of onset and improved IBD symptoms in animals with established disease (22Cantorna M.T. Munsick C. Bemiss C. Mahon B.D. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 23Froicu M. Weaver V. Wynn T.A. McDowell M.A. Welsh J.E. Cantorna M.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2386-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Here we provide further evidence for the key role of vitamin D signaling in regulating innate immunity in humans and its links to inflammatory bowel disease. We find that 1,25D is a direct and robust inducer of expression of the gene encoding pattern recognition receptor NOD2/CARD15/IBD1 in cells of monocytic and epithelial origin. NOD2/CARD15 detects muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a lysosomal breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan common to Gram-minus and Gram-positive bacteria (24Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5509-5512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). We also find that pretreatment of cells with 1,25D leads to a synergistic induction of genes encoding HBD2 and CAMP upon introduction of MDP in cells expressing functional NOD2 but not in cells from patients with Crohn disease homozygous for an inactivating mutation of the NOD2 gene. These studies provide a key link between vitamin D signaling and the genetics of Crohn disease as attenuated NOD2 or HBD2 function has been linked to the CD pathogenesis (12Lim W.C. Hanauer S.B.

Initially, NOD2 was identified as a potential 1,25D target gene during Affymetrix Hu133A oligonucleotide microarray analyses of 1,25D-treated poorly differentiated human SCC4 head and neck squamous carcinoma head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, where its expression was induced 5.4- and 8.5-fold after 8 and 24 h of treatment, respectively. Regulation of NOD2 was further investigated in primary cultures and lines of human epithelial and monocytic cells. 1,25D robustly induced NOD2 mRNAs in primary human keratinocytes and in immortalized human crypt intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC (29Levy E. Beaulieu J.F. Delvin E. Seidman E. Yotov W. Basque J.R. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 12-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1A), as well as in well differentiated human SCC25 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells and in HT29 colon carcinoma cells (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). 1,25D also strongly stimulated NOD2 expression in differentiated human THP-1 macrophage-like cells (Fig. 1A) and primary human monocytes (Fig. 1B), where fold induction was similar to that of 1,25D target gene CYP24, used as a positive control for 1,25D signaling. Western blotting confirmed that 1,25D treatment induced a corresponding increase in NOD2 protein in THP-1 cells and keratinocytes (Fig. 1C). Similar to signaling through TLR2/1 (11Liu P.T. Stenger S. Li H. Wenzel L. Tan B.H. Krutzik S.R. Ochoa M.T. Schauber J. Wu K. Meinken C. Kamen D.L. Wagner M. Bals R. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Gallo R.L. Eisenberg D. Hewison M. Hollis B.W. Adams J.S. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 2006; 311: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar), exposure of differentiated THP-1 cells to TLR4 ligand LPS strongly induced expression of CYP27B1 (supplemental Fig. 2), thus rendering cells responsive to prohormonal 25D. Incubation with 100 nm 25D, a concentration that corresponds to a vitamin D-replete state (3White J.H. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 5Holick M.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (10830) Google Scholar), strongly stimulated NOD2 expression (Fig. 1D) in LPS-primed THP-1 cells, along with 1,25D target genes CAMP (Fig. 1D) and CYP24 (supplemental Fig. 3), whereas 10 nm 25D, which corresponds to vitamin D deficiency, was substantially less effective (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 3). Note that the fold induction of NOD2 expression seen in the presence of 100 ng/ml LPS and 100 nm 25D (Fig. 1D) was essentially identical to that seen in THP-1 cells treated with 1,25D alone (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it is due essentially entirely to the production of 1,25D. In other experiments, we saw no evidence for a combined effect of 1,25D and LPS on the expression of NOD2 or other 1,25D target genes (data not shown). To address the mechanism of 1,25D-regulated NOD2 expression, we scanned the human gene for putative VDREs and found three distal sequences: a consensus element at −12.5kb relative to the transcription start site (TSS) and two near consensus sequences at approximately +15 kb in exon 4 and at +24 kb downstream of the gene (Fig. 1E). ChIP assays revealed strong 1,25D-dependent VDR binding to VDREs 1 and 3 and weaker binding to VDRE2, along with strongly 1,25D-dependent association of pol II with the TSS (Fig. 1F), consistent with transcriptional regulation. Function of putative VDREs was further tested by 3C assay (30Dostie J. Dekker J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 4), which detects loops between distal chromatin sites via formation of diagnostic, ligation-dependent PCR products. 3C assays detected strongly 1,25D-dependent PCR product formation consistent with loops between VDREs 1 or 3 and the TSS (Fig. 1G; 3C), whereas no evidence for looping between VDRE2 and the TSS was found, consistent with its weaker binding of the VDR observed in ChIP assays. In control experiments, all primer sets generated expected PCR products after digestion and religation of BAC clones containing the NOD2 gene (Fig. 1G; BAC). Collectively, these studies reveal that the ligand-bound VDR strongly and directly induces NOD2 gene transcription through VDREs lying at −12.5 and +24 kb. A key downstream consequence of NOD2 activation by MDP is stimulation of NF-κB and induction of HBD2 transcription through promoter-proximal NF-κB-binding sites (33Voss E. Wehkamp J. Wehkamp K. Stange E.F. Schröder J.M. Harder J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2005-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway was defective in cells expressing the major variant of NOD2 present in a subset of patients with CD (33Voss E. Wehkamp J. Wehkamp K. Stange E.F. Schröder J.M. Harder J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2005-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We tested the individual and combined effects of 1,25D and MDP on NF-κB function via analysis of NF-κB-sensitive expression of a reporter gene and regulation of endogenous target gene NFKBIA, which encodes NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Initial experiments were performed in epithelial cells as a number of studies have shown, remarkably, that epithelial-specific NF-κB activity is important for prevention of chronic inflammatory conditions (34Pasparakis M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). MDP was introduced by transfection, as described previously (33Voss E. Wehkamp J. Wehkamp K. Stange E.F. Schröder J.M. Harder J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2005-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), into primary cultures of human keratinocytes. Although 1,25D and MDP alone had no or modest effects on NF-κB-driven reporter activity or NFKBIA transcripts, pretreatment with 1,25D followed by MDP markedly enhanced expression of luciferase and NFKBIA (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, MDP alone had little effect on HBD2 (Fig. 2C), whereas, as expected (7Wang T.T. Nestel F.P. Bourdeau V. Nagai Y. Wang Q. Liao J. Tavera-Mendoza L. Lin R. Hanrahan J.W. Mader S. White J.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2909-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar), 1,25D alone modestly augmented HBD2 mRNA levels. In contrast, 1,25D pretreatment followed by exposure to MDP synergistically induced HBD2 mRNAs (Fig. 2C). We also observed that induction of CAMP by 1,25D was markedly augmented in the presence of MDP (Fig. 2D). In contrast, although HBD3 is part of the same locus as HBD2 (32Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M. Johnson G.K. Tack B.F. Mitros J.P. Rosenthal A. Ganz T. McCray Jr., P.B. Gene. 2001; 263: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), its expression was not regulated by 1,25D alone or in combination with MDP (Fig. 2E), consistent with a lack of apparent NF-κB-binding sites within 2.9 kb of the 5′end of the HBD3 gene (32Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M. Johnson G.K. Tack B.F. Mitros J.P. Rosenthal A. Ganz T. McCray Jr., P.B. Gene. 2001; 263: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of NOD2 function in the combined effects of 1,25D and MDP, we compared the regulation of NFKBIA and HBD2 in wild-type human macrophages and those derived from two patients with Crohn disease homozygous for a variant (R702W/R702W) adjacent to the leucine-rich repeats in NOD2 that disrupts MDP signaling (35van Heel D.A. Ghosh S. Butler M. Hunt K.A. Lundberg A.M. Ahmad T. McGovern D.P. Onnie C. Negoro K. Goldthorpe S. Foxwell B.M. Mathew C.G. Forbes A. Jewell D.P. Playford R.J. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1794-1796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Comparable levels of induction by 1,25D of the CYP24 and NOD2 genes were seen in wild-type and R702W/R702W monocytes (Fig. 2F), indicating that vitamin D signaling was functioning similarly in all preparations of cells. Although expression of NOD2 was induced by 1,25D as expected (Fig. 2F), basal expression of the gene was higher in all preparations of cells than in previous isolates of monocytes (e.g. Fig. 1B). Incubation of wild-type monocytes with MDP led to an induction of NFKBIA expression that was augmented by co-treatment with 1,25D, consistent with basal expression of NOD2 (Fig. 2G, top). The combined effects of 1,25D and MDP were enhanced by a 24-h pretreatment with 1,25D followed by further incubation with the two compounds for 24 h, consistent with the induction by 1,25D of NOD2 expression. Similar results were obtained when regulation of HBD2 was analyzed in wild-type macrophages, where incubation with 1,25D and MDP produced a dramatic increase in expression after a 24-h pretreatment (Fig. 2G, bottom). These data are in agreement with the regulation of the NFKBIA and HBD2 genes in keratinocytes seen above. In contrast, combined effects of 1,25D and MDP on HBD2 and NFKB1A were completely absent in R702W/R702W macrophages (Fig. 2G), demonstrating that MDP signaling requires expression of functional NOD2. Although our present results and those of others (11Liu P.T. Stenger S. Li H. Wenzel L. Tan B.H. Krutzik S.R. Ochoa M.T. Schauber J. Wu K. Meinken C. Kamen D.L. Wagner M. Bals R. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Gallo R.L. Eisenberg D. Hewison M. Hollis B.W. Adams J.S. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 2006; 311: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) show that induction of HBD2 by 1,25D alone is weak or absent in myelomonocytic cells, the strong combined actions of 1,25D and MDP on HBD2 expression suggest that the VDR and NF-κB may cooperate to induce transcription of the gene. In addition, we cannot rule other effects of prolonged 1,25D treatment on signaling through NF-κB that may contribute to the observed synergism. The above results (see supplemental Fig. 5 for summary) substantially extend the scope of known effects of vitamin D signaling on innate immunity in humans. They reveal that 1,25D signaling through the VDR is a primary regulator of NOD2 expression and that induction of NOD2 by 1,25D markedly affects the amplitude of downstream AMP gene regulation induced by NOD2 agonist MDP. The results also suggest that vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency would doubly affect HBD2 and CAMP expression by reducing direct induction by 1,25D and by attenuating any synergism with MDP-NOD2 signaling because of reduced NOD2 expression. There has been some debate as to whether vitamin D deficiency plays a causative role in CD or is merely a consequence of intestinal malabsorption (12Lim W.C. Hanauer S.B. Li Y.C. Nat. Clin. Pract. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2005; 2: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 35van Heel D.A. Ghosh S. Butler M. Hunt K.A. Lundberg A.M. Ahmad T. McGovern D.P. Onnie C. Negoro K. Goldthorpe S.

Our observation that 1,25D signaling is a direct inducer of NOD2 expression argues strongly that vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency does play a causative role in the prevalence of CD. The genetics of CD demonstrate that NOD2 insufficiency contributes to development of the disease (26Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cézard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O’Morain C.A. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M. Thomas G.

Importantly, our findings also imply that heterozygotes with inactivating NOD2 mutations might be particularly susceptible to development of CD if concurrently vitamin D-deficient. The data suggest that homozygotes carrying such mutations would be refractory to vitamin D treatment. However, NOD2 is only one of several loci implicated in susceptibility to CD, and NOD2 mutations are absent in some ethnic groups with CD (14Cho J.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial to most patients at risk of disease development. Variations in the HBD2 locus, which is highly polymorphic in the human population, also contribute to CD susceptibility (28Fellermann K. Stange D.E. Schaeffeler E. Schmalzl H. Wehkamp J. Bevins C.L.

HBD2 copy numbers range from 2 to 10, and the gene is preferentially expressed in colonic epithelia. Notably, a median copy number of four was found in normal individuals or patients with ileal CD, whereas the median copy number in patients with colonic CD was three, and individuals with three or fewer copies had a significantly higher risk of developing colonic CD (28Fellermann K. Stange D.E. Schaeffeler E. Schmalzl H. Wehkamp J. Bevins C.L. Reinisch W. Teml A. Schwab M. Lichter P. Radlwimmer B. Stange E.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 79: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The physiological and clinical implications of 1,25D regulation of NOD2 extend beyond CD. Disruption of NOD2 expression in mice led to reduced levels of expression in intestinal Paneth cells of the AMP α-defensin (cryptdin) during infection with Listeria monocytogenes (36Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nuñez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). These observations, coupled with our findings of synergistic induction of AMP expression by 1,25D/MDP, suggest that 1,25D-stimulated NOD2 function may contribute to host resistance to a variety of infectious challenges through the generation of AMPs. CAMP protein is expressed in 1,25D-stimulated macrophages and co-localizes with phagosomal mycobacteria (11Liu P.T. Stenger S. Li H. Wenzel L. Tan B.H. Krutzik S.R. Ochoa M.T. Schauber J. Wu K.

Science. 2006; 311: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar). Moreover, knockdown of CAMP diminished suppression of phagosomal Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication by 1,25D (37Liu P.T. Stenger S. Tang D.H. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our findings suggest that regulation of NOD2 expression by 1,25D and its marked effects on the amplitude of downstream AMP production contribute substantially to 1,25D-mediated innate antibacterial responses, as well as providing a strong molecular basis for the contribution of vitamin D deficiency to the pathogenesis of CD.

https://openalex.org/W2111888363,"Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is dependent on an intrinsic gene regulatory network centered on Oct4. Propagation of the pluripotent state is stimulated by the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) acting through the transcriptional regulator Stat3. Here, we show that this extrinsic stimulus converges with the intrinsic circuitry in Krüppel-factor activation. Oct4 primarily induces Klf2 while LIF/Stat3 selectively enhances Klf4 expression. Overexpression of either factor reduces LIF dependence, but with quantitative and qualitative differences. Unlike Klf4, Klf2 increases ESC clonogenicity, maintains undifferentiated ESCs in the genetic absence of Stat3, and confers resistance to BMP-induced differentiation. ESCs expanded with Klf2 remain capable of contributing to adult chimeras. Postimplantation-embryo-derived EpiSCs lack both Klf2 and Klf4 and expression of either can reinstate naive pluripotency. These findings indicate that Oct4 and Stat3 intersect in directing expression of Klf transcriptional regulators with overlapping properties that additively reinforce ground-state ESC pluripotency, identity, and self-renewal."

Thus, SKPs derive from Sox2+ follicle-associated dermal precursors and display functional properties predicted of a dermal stem cell, contributing to dermal maintenance, wound-healing, and hair follicle morphogenesis. The skin is a unique organ that undergoes continuous cell turnover and harbors significant regenerative capacity in order to repair environmentally mediated insults. At least some of this regenerative capacity is due to somatic tissue stem cells, including basal layer and hair follicle epidermal stem cells (Fuchs, 2009Fuchs E. Finding one's niche in the skin.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and melanocyte stem cells (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). However, a dermal stem cell, responsible for maintaining and repairing the dermis, has not yet been described. The dermis is a complex tissue comprised of many cell types, including dermal fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, adipocytes, blood vessels, nerves, and sensory receptors such as Merkel cells. The dermis also contributes the inductive mesenchymal cells necessary for regulating hair follicle morphogenesis, a cyclic process that occurs continuously throughout the life of many mammals. During embryogenesis, the dermis develops from mesenchymal precursors that generate dermal fibroblasts and adipocytes and produce the inductive hair follicle cells. Thus, by analogy to other somatic tissue stem cells, one possibility is that a multipotent embryonic mesenchymal precursor persists into adulthood, thereby providing the dermal stem cell activity necessary for homeostatic maintenance and regeneration of this tissue. Support for the presence of such a multipotent dermal precursor comes from work showing that, in some animals, dermal cells play a key role in limb regeneration (Muneoka et al., 1986Muneoka K. Fox W.F. Bryant S.V. Cellular contribution from dermis and cartilage to the regenerating limb blastema in axolotls.Dev.

Cells keep a memory of their tissue origin during axolotl limb regeneration.Nature. 2009; 460: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and can directly differentiate into the skeletal cells necessary to form an exoskeleton (Vickaryous and Hall, 2008Vickaryous M.K. Hall B.K. Development of the dermal skeleton in Alligator mississippiensis (Archosauria, Crocodylia) with comments on the homology of osteoderms.J. Morphol. 2008; 269: 398-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this regard, we previously isolated a multipotent precursor cell from rodent and human dermis that differentiated into mesodermal and peripheral neural progeny including adipocytes, skeletogenic cell types, and Schwann cells (McKenzie et al., 2006McKenzie I.A. Biernaskie J. Toma J.G. Midha R. Miller F.D. Skin-derived precursors generate myelinating Schwann cells for the injured and dysmyelinated nervous system.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6651-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These cells, termed SKPs for skin-derived precursors, displayed properties similar to embryonic neural crest precursors, and within facial dermis were derived from the neural crest (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J.L. McKenzie I.A. Mill P. Smith K.M. Akhavan M. Barnabe-Heider F. Biernaskie J. Junek A. Kobayashi N.R. Toma J.G. et al.A dermal niche for mutipotent adult skin-derived precursor cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the dermal papillae (DP) of hair follicles appear to comprise one niche for SKPs, based upon coincident patterns of gene expression and upon the finding that cells with properties of SKPs can be cultured from adult whisker follicle papillae (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J.L.

Because DP mesenchymal cells are essential for hair follicle induction (Jahoda et al., 1984Jahoda C.A. Horne K.A. Oliver R.F. Induction of hair growth by implantation of cultured dermal papilla cells.Nature. 1984; 311: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, Oliver, 1967Oliver R.F. The experimental induction of whisker growth in the hooded rat by implantation of dermal papillae.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1967; 18: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar) and because it has been suggested that DP cells might be dermal precursors (Gharzi et al., 2003Gharzi A. Reynolds A.J. Jahoda C.A. Plasticity of hair follicle dermal cells in wound healing and induction.Exp. Dermatol. 2003; 12: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we asked whether SKPs might represent a previously unrecognized dermal stem cell. Here, we provide evidence in support of this idea, showing that SKPs derive from Sox2+ follicle-associated precursors and that they can contribute dermal cells for tissue maintenance, wound-healing, and hair follicle morphogenesis. To investigate whether SKPs originate from endogenous hair follicle dermal cells, we took advantage of our finding that Sox2 is expressed by SKPs, as detected by RT-PCR and immunostaining of neonatal murine SKP spheres (Figures 1A and 1B). Immunostaining for Sox2 in neonatal murine back skin showed its expression in follicle DP and lower dermal sheath (DS) cells (Figure 1C). We confirmed this localization in a mouse with EGFP knocked in to the Sox2 locus (Ellis et al., 2004Ellis P. Fagan B.M. Magness S.T. Hutton S. Taranova O. Hayashi S. McMahon A. Rao M. Pevny L. SOX2, a persistent marker for multipotential neural stem cells derived from embryonic stem cells, the embryo or the adult.Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 148-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Within skin, Sox2:EGFP-expressing cells first appeared in the embryonic dermal condensates that precede hair and whisker follicle formation (Figure 1D; Figures S1A and S1B available online), as recently published (Driskell et al., 2009Driskell R.R. Giangreco A. Jensen K.B. Mulder K.W. Watt F.M. Sox2-positive dermal papilla cells specify hair follicle type in mammalian epidermis.Development. 2009; 136: 2815-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). At birth, when hair follicles were in the anagen growth phase, Sox2:EGFP was expressed in all awl, auchene, and guard hair follicle DS and DP (Figures 1E and 1F). In adulthood, Sox2:EGFP was expressed in DP and DS cells of anagen, but not catagen/telogen follicles (Figures 1G–1I), suggesting that expression was dynamically regulated. Sox2:EGFP was also expressed in dermal cells of adult whisker follicles (Figure S1C) and in a small number of cells in close proximity to the hair follicle bulge (Figure S1D). These latter cells did not express K17, K15, nestin, PDGFRα, the melanocyte marker DCT, or the Schwann cell marker P0 (data not shown). However, a few expressed the epidermal precursor marker K5 (Figure S1D). To determine whether Sox2+ follicle cells gave rise to SKPs, we prospectively isolated them by using flow cytometry. Approximately 1%–3% and 0.1%–1% of neonatal and adult back skin cells, respectively, were Sox2:EGFP positive (Figures S2A and S2B). Similar results were obtained with facial skin (Figures S2C and S2D). Most Sox2:EGFP+ cells expressed PDGFRα, but not CD34, a marker for bulge epidermal cells and dermal fibroblasts (Figure 1J). Sorted Sox2:EGFP+ cells from neonatal and adult back and facial skin gave rise to EGFP+ SKP spheres when cultured in SKPs conditions, and they were enriched in this ability relative to Sox2:EGFP− cells (Figures 1K and 1N). Quantification showed that adult Sox2:EGFP+ back skin cells were enriched 4-fold and 10-fold relative to unsorted and EGFP− cells (Figures 1L and 1M). SKP spheres generated from Sox2:EGFP+ cells expressed the SKPs markers fibronectin, nestin, versican, and α-sma (Figure 1O), and when differentiated for 14 days, generated βIII-tubulin+ neurons and α-sma+ myofibroblasts (Figures 1P and 1Q) that had lost their EGFP expression. Thus, anagen hair follicles are a primary niche for SKP-forming dermal precursors. Because SKPs generate peripheral neural cells, we differentiated sorted Sox2:EGFP+ cells versus Sox2:EGFP− cells under neural conditions. Only Sox2:EGFP+ cells generated nestin+ precursors (data not shown) or βIII-tubulin+ neurons (Figure 2A). We then asked whether the sorted cells could induce hair follicle morphogenesis, as predicted by their anatomical localization, by using an ex vivo hair reconstitution “patch assay” (Zheng et al., 2005Zheng Y. Du X. Wang W. Boucher M. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Organogenesis from dissociated cells: Generation of mature cycling hair follicles from skin-derived cells.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that Sox2:EGFP+, CD34− cells induced hair morphogenesis when mixed with neonatal C57/Bl6 epidermal cells and transplanted beneath the dermis of adult nude mice for 12 days (Figure 2B). In addition, Sox2:EGFP− cells were depleted in this inductive ability relative to total dermal cells (Figure 2C). To ask whether Sox2:EGFP+ cells could also generate differentiated dermal progeny, we transduced sorted Sox2:EGFP+, PDGFRα+, CD34− back skin cells with an RFP-expressing retrovirus (to allow tracing if Sox2:EGFP expression was lost) and transplanted them into NOD/SCID mouse back skin for 3 weeks. For comparison, we used Sox2:EGFP− cells. Remarkably, the Sox2:EGFP-positive, but not -negative, cells homed back to their DP and DS follicle niche, where they appropriately expressed the DP markers NCAM, CD133, and Sox2:EGFP itself (Figures 2D–2G; Figures S2E–S2G). Quantification confirmed this selective homing (Figures 2H and 2I). In contrast, Sox2:EGFP+ cells that integrated into the interfollicular dermis expressed the dermal fibroblast markers PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, fibronectin, and CD34 (Figures 2J and 2K; Figure S2I) but no longer expressed EGFP or CD133 (Figure S2H). Thus, Sox2:EGFP+ follicle dermal cells home to a hair follicle niche, induce hair follicles, generate interfollicular dermal cell types, and differentiate into neural cells that are never normally found within skin. To ask whether SKPs maintain properties of their Sox2+ dermal precursor parents, we performed global gene expression analysis, comparing four primary passage neonatal back skin SKP preparations with five sorted neonatal Sox2:EGFP+CD34− back skin cell isolates. RNA samples were analyzed on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Spearman rank correlation analysis demonstrated that the two groups were very similar, with intersample correlations ranging from 0.86 to 0.94 (Figure 3B). For comparison, intrasample analysis demonstrated correlations of 0.91–0.99 and 0.96–0.99 for Sox2:EGFP+ and SKP samples, respectively (Figure 3B). We also analyzed a subset of 36 genes previously associated with follicle dermal cells including versican, BMP4, CD133, alkaline phosphatase, and corin. Sox2:EGFP+ cells and SKPs expressed these genes at similar levels (Figure 3A). Some genes were, however, expressed at significantly different levels based on the F-statistic with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction implemented in the LIMMA Bioconductor package (Smyth, 2004Smyth G.K. Linear models and empirical bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3: Article 3Google Scholar). Of 22,102 nonredundant protein-coding genes assayed by the array, 281 and 310 were significantly upregulated at least 2-fold (Figure 3C). Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated that most of these were associated with metabolic pathways or growth factor signaling (Figure S3A). SKPs were relatively enriched in genes associated with O-glycan, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and the citrate cycle, and Sox2:EGFP+ cells were in genes associated with ERK and PI3-kinase-Akt signaling, and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. These differences were probably due to differences in environment rather than cell identity, because of those transcription factors differentially expressed 2-fold or more (the range was 2- to 4.3-fold), none were cell type specific or associated with dermal or stem cell identity (Figure S3B). Thus, SKPs and Sox2:EGFP+ cells are highly similar at the transcriptional level, arguing that culturing does not fundamentally change the identity of the endogenous dermal precursors. To ask whether SKPs were also functionally similar to Sox2:EGFP+ dermal precursors, we transplanted neonatal YFP-expressing murine or adult GFP-expressing rat SKPs into adult NOD/SCID mouse back skin. At 2–3 weeks posttransplant, both populations of genetically tagged cells were located throughout the dermis (Figure 4A). These cells were morphologically similar to the endogenous fibroblasts and expressed the dermal fibroblast markers PDGFRα, collagen type I, vimentin, fibronectin (Figures 4B–4D), and fibroblast-specific antigen (data not shown) (>90% expressed fibroblast-specific antigen or collagen type I, ∼73% PDGFRα). Some also coexpressed the hyaluronic acid receptor, CD44 or the myofibroblast protein α-sma (Figure 4E) (∼80% and 7% expressed α-sma in the upper and lower dermis, respectively). Some transplanted cells were present in the adipocyte-rich hypodermis, where they expressed fatty acid binding protein and displayed adipocyte morphology (Figure 4F). Genetically tagged transplanted cells were never observed within the epidermis. Thus, SKPs, like Sox2+ dermal precursors, differentiate into dermal cell types. Intriguingly, some transplanted SKPs homed back to the follicle DP and DS (Figures 4A and 4G), where they appropriately expressed the DP markers versican (Figure 4H; Figure S4A), p75NTR, and NCAM (data not shown), or the DS marker α-sma (Figure 4I). Some transplanted cells in the DS also expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 (Figure 4J), consistent with the fact that DS but not DP cells proliferate. Transplanted cells did not differentiate into Pax3+ or tyrosinase+ melanocytes (Figure 4H; Figure S4B). The specificity of this integration was shown by transplanting neonatal murine YFP+ forebrain neurospheres (NSCs), adult rat GFP+ bone marrow MSCs, and dermal fibroblasts from nonhairy plantar skin. The NSCs survived poorly and never associated with follicles, whereas MSCs and plantar skin dermal fibroblasts survived but were never found within the DP (Figures 4K and 4L; Figures S4C–S4E). To determine whether follicle cycling alters this homing behavior, we depilated or shaved back skin of NOD/SCID mice (depilation induces follicles to enter anagen) prior to transplantation. Depilation caused adult rat SKPs to integrate into 2- to 3-fold more hair follicles than did shaving (28.5 ± 4.9 versus 8.0 ± 1.6 follicles), with the DP of each positive follicle containing 6-fold more transplanted cells (10.16 ± 1.0 versus 1.52 ± 0.14) (Figures 4N and 4O). Similar results were obtained with neonatal murine SKPs (Figure 4M). Finally, we asked whether SKPs hair follicle integration was modified by skin wounding. Neonatal murine YFP+ SKPs were transplanted adjacent to punch wounds on NOD/SCID mouse back skin. 3–4 weeks later, many transplanted cells were present within the scar, where they expressed fibroblast-specific antigen, collagen type 1, fibronectin, and the myofibroblast protein α-sma (Figures 4P–4R; Figures S4F and S4G) (16% expressed high α-sma). Interestingly, transplanted cells were also present in DP and DS of immature-appearing hair follicles (Figures 4S and 4T), with the DP cells appropriately expressing versican (Figure 4T) and p75NTR (data not shown), suggesting that SKPs contribute to new follicle formation in wounded skin. To ask whether SKPs induce hair follicle morphogenesis, as do Sox2:EGFP+ cells, we performed patch assays. As positive controls, we used neonatal dermal cells, which generated many hair follicles (Figures 5A and 5B), and as negative controls MSCs or NSCs, which generated no or very few follicles (Figures S5A and S5B). Interestingly, adult rat GFP+ SKPs were highly enriched for hair follicle-inductive ability (Figures 5E and 5F), generating follicles where the entire DS and DP was comprised of genetically tagged cells (Figures 5C and 5D). Neonatal YFP-expressing murine SKPs also induced follicle formation (data not shown). We next performed in vivo experiments, taking advantage of the finding that the size of the DP determines follicle size (Ibrahim and Wright, 1982Ibrahim L. Wright E.A. A quantitative study of hair growth using mouse and rat vibrissal follicles. I. Dermal papilla volume determines hair volume.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 72: 209-224PubMed Google Scholar). GFP+ adult rat SKPs were injected into depilated adult NOD/SCID mouse back skin and analyzed after 8 weeks. Many transplanted cells differentiated into interfollicular dermal fibroblasts (Figure 5G), and many comprised the entire DP and DS of correctly oriented follicles (Figures 5G and 5H). Remarkably, relative to endogenous murine hairs, hairs induced by rat SKPs were longer (10.41 ± 0.23 mm versus 7.96 ± 0.11 mm; p < 0.0001) and had increased follicle bulb diameter (107.24 ± 4.99 μm versus 82.27 ± 2.51 μm; p < 0.01) and hair fiber width (49.26 ± 0.87 μm versus 44.60 ± 0.83 μm; p < 0.001) (n = 8, with 3 animals quantified) (Figures 5I and 5J). Although many of these follicles were in anagen (Figure 5H), some were in catagen/telogen phase (Figure 5K), indicating that follicle-associated SKPs cycle with their newly induced hairs. To confirm that rat SKPs induced larger follicles, we performed patch assays. Adult rat SKPs instructed mouse epidermal cells to generate larger follicles than did mouse dermal cells, with an almost 2-fold increase in bulb diameter (Figures 5L–5N). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the increased rat SKP follicle size correlated with almost four times more NCAM+ DP cells (Figures 5O–5Q) (88% of these cells were GFP+). To ask whether single SKPs could both induce follicle morphogenesis and differentiate into dermal cell types, as expected for a dermal stem cell, we generated clones of adult rat SKPs. Patch assays showed that, of seven clonally derived rat SKP lines passaged at least six times (approximately 8–12 weeks in culture), five induced hair follicle formation (Figures 6A and 6B). Indeed, when 50 spheres from one clone were mixed with 5 × 105 total neonatal murine skin cells, 30 ± 2 hair follicles had DP entirely comprised of GFP+ SKPs. This activity was persistent; one clone induced follicle formation after 11 months in culture, albeit inefficiently (Figure 6C). Consistent with these results, three of three clones transplanted into adult NOD/SCID mouse skin reconstituted hair follicle DP and DS in vivo (Figure 6D). Transplanted clone cells also differentiated into fibronectin− and vimentin+ interfollicular dermal fibroblasts and α-sma+ myofibroblasts (Figures 6D and 6E). Thus, single SKPs were multipotent with regard to these dermal activities. One of the most striking assays of in vivo stem cell functionality is serial repopulation by hematopoietic stem cells. We therefore asked whether follicle-derived DS and DP cells could self-renew as SKPs and sequentially induce and repopulate hair follicles (Figure 6F). Hair follicles were generated in patch assays with adult rat GFP+ SKPs, and cells from these follicles (Figure 6G) were cultured in SKPs conditions; 10–14 days later, genetically tagged spheres were observed (Figure 6H). When these spheres were passaged and put back into patch assays, they again induced follicle formation (Figure 6I). With this approach, we serially generated SKP spheres and reinduced hair follicles up to three times (Figure 6J). To ask whether these follicle-derived SKPs also maintained their multipotentiality, we took four different approaches. First, we transplanted them into adult NOD/SCID mouse back skin for 4 weeks. Many transplanted cells differentiated into PDGFRα and collagen type I+ interfollicular dermal fibroblasts (Figures 6K–6M), and some integrated into the DS and DP of endogenous follicles (Figure 6K), where they expressed versican and NCAM in the DP and fibronectin in the DS (data not shown). Second, we differentiated cells in culture conditions that support neural and mesodermal differentiation of neonatal SKPs (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J.L. McKenzie I.A. Mill P. Smith K.M. Akhavan M. Barnabe-Heider F. Biernaskie J. Junek A. Kobayashi N.R. Toma J.G. et al.A dermal niche for mutipotent adult skin-derived precursor cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Follicle-derived SKPs generated adipocytes, α-sma+ myofibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, nestin+ precursors, and βIII-tubulin+ neurons (Figures 6N–6Q). Third, we transplanted follicle-derived SKPs distal to a sciatic nerve crush in NOD/SCID mice, an environment that instructs naive SKPs to differentiate into Schwann cells (McKenzie et al., 2006McKenzie I.A. Biernaskie J. Toma J.G. Midha R. Miller F.D. Skin-derived precursors generate myelinating Schwann cells for the injured and dysmyelinated nervous system.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6651-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry of the distal nerve 6 weeks posttransplant identified GFP+ cells closely aligned with axons expressing the Schwann cell markers P0 and p75NTR (Figures 6R and 6S). Finally, we transplanted follicle-derived SKPs into the embryonic chick neural crest migratory stream at HH stage 18, as we have done for total neonatal SKPs (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J.L. McKenzie I.A. Mill P. Smith K.M. Akhavan M. Barnabe-Heider F. Biernaskie J. Junek A. Kobayashi N.R. Toma J.G. et al.A dermal niche for mutipotent adult skin-derived precursor cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Analysis 3 days later showed that follicle-derived SKPs migrated out of the neural tube into neural crest targets such as the spinal nerve and DRGs, similar to murine SKPs and adult rat clonal SKPs (Figure 6T). Intriguingly, some total and follicle-derived SKPs migrated to the presumptive dermis, and at late time points, some of these expressed the DP marker versican (Figure 6U). Thus, follicle-associated SKPs display properties of dermal stem cells. To ask whether the endogenous Sox2+ dermal precursors are recruited out of their niche to contribute differentiated dermal cells, we performed punch wounds on Sox2:EGFP mice. At 36 hr, Sox2:EGFP+ cells were limited to hair follicles. However, by 72 hr, EGFP+ cells were seen exiting hair follicles and streaming into the interfollicular dermis toward the wound site (Figures 7A–7H). Some of these emigrating cells coexpressed the DP/DS marker NCAM, but many were negative (Figures 7C and 7E), indicating that they were losing their follicle-associated phenotype. To further define this phenomenon, we used a transplantation-based lineage tracing approach. Genetically tagged hair follicles were made in patch assays with either rat GFP+ SKPs or neonatal dermal cells (Figure 7I) and transplanted under adult nude mouse back skin. Over the ensuing 4 weeks, tagged follicles integrated and grew to generate small patches of hair (Figure 7J). Analysis at this time point showed that many GFP-tagged cells were retained within engrafted hair follicles, but that many had also migrated into the adjacent interfollicular dermis where they expressed fibroblast-specific antigen, CD34, and collagen type I (Figures 7K–7N; Figure S6). Similar results were obtained with both follicle populations. In some animals, we also injured the skin adjacent to transplanted SKP-derived hairs with a punch wound (Figure 7O). Analysis 4 weeks later showed that GFP+ cells had migrated into the regenerated, newly healed dermis where they expressed CD44 and collagen type I (Figures 7P–7R). Thus, DP/DS cells can contribute differentiated cells to the dermis. These studies support a number of major conclusions. First, our studies identify a Sox2+ endogenous dermal precursor within the follicle DP and DS that, when prospectively isolated, homes back to a hair follicle niche, induces hair follicle morphogenesis, and displays neural and dermal potential. Second, we show that these endogenous precursors generate SKPs when cultured, and that these two cell populations are very similar with regard to their transcriptome and their functional properties when transplanted into the dermis. Third, we demonstrate that SKPs can clonally reconstitute the dermis and induce hair follicle morphogenesis, properties predicted of a dermal stem cell. Fourth, the serial reconstitution experiments show that SKPs maintain their multipotentiality and their ability to self-renew within their hair follicle niche and that they can serially induce hair follicle formation. Finally, our follicle graft/lineage tracing studies argue that Sox2+ dermal precursors can be recruited out of their niche to contribute differentiated dermal cells. Together, these experiments provide evidence for a hair follicle-associated dermal precursor that functions to regulate hair morphogenesis and to maintain the intact or injured dermis and that, when cultured, generate SKPs that display all the predicted properties of multipotent dermal stem cells. On the basis of these findings, we propose that these adult dermal precursors derive from a subset of embryonic mesenchymal precursors within the presumptive dermis that interact with epidermal precursors and undergo a transition to a Sox2+ precursor state, as recently suggested (Driskell et al., 2009Driskell R.R. Giangreco A. Jensen K.B. Mulder K.W. Watt F.M. Sox2-positive dermal papilla cells specify hair follicle type in mammalian epidermis.Development. 2009; 136: 2815-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We also propose that hair follicles provide a niche for maintenance of the mesenchymal precursor phenotype, and that in adult life, these Sox2+ follicle cells both regulate follicle morphogenesis and serve as a reservoir of dermal precursor activity, contributing dermal cells for the normal and injured dermis. The broader mesenchymal potential displayed by SKPs (Lavoie et al., 2009Lavoie J.F. Biernaskie J.A. Chen Y. Bagli D. Alman B. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D.

https://openalex.org/W2047173060,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a polymorphic protein with three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), is essential for lipid homeostasis. Carriers of apoE4 are at higher risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. We have investigated adult neurogenesis in mice with knockout (KO) for apoE or with knockin (KI) alleles for human apoE3 or apoE4, and we report that neurogenesis is reduced in both apoE-KO and apoE4-KI mice. In apoE-KO mice, increased BMP signaling promoted glial differentiation at the expense of neurogenesis. In contrast, in apoE4-KI mice, presynaptic GABAergic input-mediated maturation of newborn neurons was diminished. Tau phosphorylation, an Alzheimer's disease characteristic, and levels of neurotoxic apoE fragments were both elevated in apoE4-KI hippocampal neurons concomitant with decreased GABAergic interneuron survival. Potentiating GABAergic signaling restored neuronal maturation and neurogenesis in apoE4-KI mice to normal levels. These findings suggest that GABAergic signaling can be targeted to mitigate the deleterious effects of apoE4 on neurogenesis."

To further enhance the application of these mutants, and to obtain insights into the effects of altering one specific glycosyltransferase or glycosylation activity on the overall expression of cellular glycans, an analysis of the N-glycans and major O-glycans of a panel of CHO mutants was performed using glycomic analyses anchored by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry. We report here the complement of the major N-glycans and O-glycans present in nine distinct CHO glycosylation mutants.

The N- and O-glycans that decorate glycoproteins at the cell surface serve many key biological functions, and thus it is essential to understand their structures and the factors that influence their synthesis. Mutants of mammalian cells affected in glycosylation pathways are a valuable resource for experiments aimed at structure/function analysis of mammalian glycans. A panel of glycosylation mutants that has been widely used for such purposes is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 4The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidHexNAcN-acetylhexosamineLacNAcGalβ1–4GlcNAcLexLewisxMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationmCHOCHO cells grown in monolayerNeuGcN-glycolylneuraminic acidMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem mass spectrometrysCHOCHO cells grown in suspensionsLexsialyl LewisxTOFtime of flightVIM-2Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase-2. mutant lines isolated following selection for various plant lectins (1.Patnaik S.K.

These CHO mutants have been previously characterized biochemically and genetically, but their glycans have only been partially characterized structurally. In this study, we present glycomics profiles of the N-linked and O-GalNAc glycans of nine of the commonly used CHO glycosylation mutants, providing an important base line for future applications using these mutants in functional and biochemical studies and for glycosylation engineering. For example, it is very important to know the range of N-glycans that may be generated in the presence of GlcNAcT-III, the glycosyltransferase that in vitro adds the bisecting GlcNAc only to simple biantennary N-glycans (3.Narasimhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar considerations apply for CHO mutants expressing an α-1,3-fucosyltransferase that in vitro generates the Lewisx (Lex) and/or sialyl-Lewisx (sLex) determinants on comparatively simple acceptors (4.Howard D.R. Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16830-16837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In hypomorphic mutants or mutants that are defective in the synthesis of a nucleotide sugar or the activity of a nucleotide sugar transporter, it is important to know the stringency of the phenotype and thus the extent of the block in glycosylation.

Here we present the N-glycan and O-GalNAc glycan glycomics profiles of CHO parent cells and of the glycosylation mutants Lec1, Lec2, Lec3.2.8.1, Lec4, LEC10, LEC11, LEC12, Lec13, and LEC30. The Lec8 cell line, which carries an inactive UDP-Gal transporter and is also in common use, was previously characterized by MALDI-MS (6.Kawar Z.S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Cummings R.D. J.

Stanley P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12349-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The lectin-resistant clones used were as follows: Lec1.3C, Lec2.6A, Lec3.2.8.1.3B, Lec4.7B, LEC10.3C, LEC11.E7, LEC12.1B, Lec13.6A, and LEC30.H2. For simplicity, each clone is referred to by their Lec name in the text. CHO parent cells were grown in suspension or monolayer in α-minimal essential medium containing nucleotides and ribonucleosides (Invitrogen) and containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, West Sacramento, CA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Mutant cells were grown in suspension at 37 °C in the same medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. No clones had been growing more than 2 months in continuous culture when prepared for glycomic analyses. Cells growing in monolayer culture were grown to confluency. Medium was removed; 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2 (PBS) was added; and the cells were scraped into PBS, centrifuged, and washed three times with PBS. An aliquot of the third resuspension was counted to determine the total number of cells in the final pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, transferred to a Microfuge tube, and pelleted at 800 × g. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C and shipped on dry ice. Suspension cultures were grown to 8–10 × 105 cells/ml, washed with PBS three times, and processed as for monolayer cells. Approximately 1.2 × 108 cells from each CHO cell line (3 × 108 in the case of the LEC12 mutant) were sonicated in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and 1% CHAPS, pH 7.4) and then dialyzed against 4× 4.5 liters of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at 4 °C for 48 h as described previously (8.Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego2006: 415-424Google Scholar). After dialysis, the sample was lyophilized and then reduced in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 2 mg/ml dithiothreitol. Reduction was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 37 °C for 1 h. Carboxymethylation was carried out by the addition of iodoacetic acid (5-fold molar excess over dithiothreitol), and the reaction was allowed to proceed under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. Carboxymethylation was terminated by dialysis against 4× 4.5 liters of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at 4 °C for 48 h. After dialysis, the sample was lyophilized. The reduced carboxymethylated proteins were digested with N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-pretreated bovine pancreas trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4; Sigma) for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.4. The products were purified by C18 Sep-Pak® (Waters) as described previously (9.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The reverse-phase C18 Sep-Pak® cartridge was primed sequentially with 5 ml of methanol, 5 ml of 5% acetic acid (v/v), and 5 ml of propan-1-ol before being re-equilibrated with 10 ml of 5% acetic acid (v/v). The sample was then dissolved in a minimum volume of 5% acetic acid (v/v) and loaded directly onto the Sep-Pak. Elution was achieved using 3 ml of 5% acetic acid (v/v), followed by 2 ml each of 20, 40, 60, and 100% propan-1-ol in 5% acetic acid (v/v). Each elution step was collected, reduced in volume on a SpeedVac, and lyophilized (9.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Peptide N-glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52; Roche Applied Science) digestion was carried out in 200 μl of ammonium bicarbonate (50 mm, pH 8.5) for 16 h at 37 °C using 3 units of enzyme. The reaction was terminated by lyophilization, and the released N-glycans were separated from peptides and O-glycopeptides by C18 Sep-Pak® (Waters) as described previously (9.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The reverse-phase C18 Sep-Pak® cartridge was primed sequentially with 5 ml of methanol, 5 ml of water, and 5 ml of acetonitrile before being re-equilibrated with 10 ml of water. The lyophilized permethylated oligosaccharide sample was then dissolved in a minimum volume of methanol and loaded directly onto the Sep-Pak. Elution was achieved using 3 ml of water followed by 2 ml each of 15, 30, 50, 75, and 100% acetonitrile in water (v/v). Each elution step was collected, reduced in volume on a SpeedVac, and lyophilized (9.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). O-Glycans were released by reductive elimination in 400 μl of 0.1 m potassium borohydride solution (54 mg/ml of potassium hydroxide in water) at 45 °C for 16 h. The reaction was terminated by dropwise addition of glacial acetic acid, followed by Dowex 50W-X8 (H) 50–100 mesh (Sigma) chromatography and borate removal. A portion of the underivatized N-glycan pool was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, and incubated at 37 °C with 50 milliunits of Escherichiafreundii endo-β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.103). After 48 h, the sample was lyophilized and then permethylated before MALDI-TOF analysis. Permethylation was performed using the sodium hydroxide procedure, as described previously (9.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). 1 g of sodium hydroxide pellets were crushed in a glass mortar with 3 ml of distilled anhydrous DMSO. From the resulting slurry, 1 ml and 200 μl of methyl iodide were added to the lyophilized sample. The mixture was then shaken for 10 min before the reaction was quenched by dropwise addition of water. The permethylated sample was then extracted into 1 ml of chloroform and washed four times with 1 ml of water. The chloroform was then removed under a stream of nitrogen. Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples for GC-MS linkage analysis as described previously (10.Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). The permethylated glycans were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 121 °C, reduced with 10 mg/ml sodium borodeuteride in 2 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, and then acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 1 h. MALDI-TOF data were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. Permethylated samples were dissolved in 10 μl of 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol, and 1 μl of dissolved sample was premixed with 1 μl of matrix (20 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol), spotted onto a target plate, and dried under vacuum. Further MS/MS analyses of peaks observed in the MS spectra were carried out using a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer. The potential difference between the source acceleration voltage and the collision cell was set to 1 kV, and argon was used as collision gas. The 4700 calibration standard kit, calmix (Applied Biosystems), was used as the external calibrant for the MS mode, and [Glu1] fibrinopeptide B human (Sigma) was used as an external calibrant for the MS/MS mode. The exceptionally high mass signals were observed during additional MS experiments carried out on the 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF. The MALDI was tuned to specifically allow the transmission of higher mass ions at the expense of those at lower mass by manipulation of the lens voltages within Source 1. GC-MS linkage analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates was carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Clarus 500 instrument fitted with an RTX-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter, Restek Corp.). The sample was dissolved in hexane and injected onto the column at 60 °C. The column was maintained at this temperature for 1 min and then heated to 300 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. Annotation of the MS and MS/MS data was achieved with assistance from the Cartoonist algorithm (11.Goldberg D. Sutton-Smith M. Paulson J. Dell A. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the GlycoWorkbench software suite (12.Ceroni A. Maass K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Dell A. Haslam S.M. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To prepare samples for mass spectrometry, washed cell pellets from wild type CHO cells grown in monolayer or suspension, as well as nine lectin-resistant mutants (Lec1, Lec2, Lec3.2.8.1, Lec4, LEC10, LEC11, LEC12, Lec13, and LEC30) grown in suspension, were sonicated, reduced and carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Preparation of tryptic glycopeptides facilitates the release of N- and O-glycans by means of peptide N-glycosidase F digestion and reductive elimination, respectively. Permethylation of the purified glycan populations was employed to enhance the sensitivity of the mass spectrometric analysis and to direct the fragmentation within tandem MS analyses. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MS was employed to produce an initial profile of singly charged, sodiated molecular ions ([M + Na]+), the results of which were used to select target ions for further analysis by tandem MS/MS techniques and supplementary experiments such as enzymatic digestion and linkage analysis. Although not fully quantitative, recent studies have succeeded in demonstrating that MALDI-MS analyses of permethylated glycans provides reliable relative quantitation information based on signal intensities, particularly when comparisons are made over a small mass range of single ion peaks in the same spectrum (13.Wada Y. Azadi P. Costello C.E. Dell A. Dwek R.A. Geyer H. Geyer R. Kakehi K. Karlsson N.G. Kato K. Kawasaki N. Khoo K.H. Kim S. Kondo A. Lattova E. Mechref Y. Miyoshi E. Nakamura K. Narimatsu H. Novotny M.V.

Molecular ions observed in the MS analysis were subjected to MS/MS analysis, affording sequence informative fragment ions, providing information concerning structural features such as antennal structures, branching patterns, and some linkage positions. Linkage analysis by GC-MS, in concert with the mass spectrometric profiling information, facilitates the assignment of primary structural aspects, such as glycosidic bond positions and monosaccharide constituents. Enzymatic digests utilizing endo-β-galactosidase were also employed to confirm the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures (Galβ1– 4GlcNAc)n (14.Fukuda M.N. Matsumura G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6218-6225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assignments of N-glycan spectra were carried out with the assistance of Cartoonist (11.Goldberg D. Sutton-Smith M. Paulson J. Dell A. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15.Goldberg D. Bern M. North S.J. Haslam S.M. Dell A. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a bespoke algorithm designed to mimic the human approach to the analysis and assignment of N-glycan MALDI spectra. Cartoonist searches the raw MS data for peak envelopes and uses knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways to present the user with the most likely permethylated carbohydrate structures for each signal. MS/MS spectra were assigned with the support of the GlycoWorkbench suite (12.Ceroni A. Maass K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Dell A. Haslam S.M. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) of software tools, designed to assist the experts during the annotation of glycan fragment spectra. The graphical interface of GlycoWorkbench provides an environment in which structure models can be rapidly assembled, automatically matched with MSn data, and compared to assess the best candidate. Due to the finding that CHO cells make not only multiantennary structures but also highly extended LacNAc repeats, the annotations are simplified throughout by using biantennary structures with the extensions listed in parentheses. Unless specifically noted, such structures are present as a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans with varying numbers of LacNAc extensions and terminal NeuAc, NeuGc, or Fuc. Based on GC-MS data, core Fuc and bisecting GlcNAc residues are annotated within the biantennary structure. When discussed in the text, the total number of LacNAc units added to the pentasaccharide chitobiose core is given. CHO cells grown in monolayer (mCHO) or in suspension (sCHO) were subjected to glycomic profiling by MALDI-MS analysis. A mass spectrum obtained from the peptide N-glycosidase F-released and -permethylated N-glycans from a typical monolayer preparation of cells is shown in Fig. 2, with the corresponding O-glycan spectrum in Fig. 3B. A selected mass range comparison of the mCHO sample with the sCHO sample is illustrated in Fig. 4. Complete compositional assignments can be found in supplemental Tables S1 and S2.FIGURE 3Comparison between the MALDI-TOF MS profiles of the permethylated O-glycans derived from wild type CHO cells grown in suspension (A) and wild type CHO cells grown in monolayer (B).

A full complement of high mannose N-glycans was observed (m/z 1579.8, 1783.9, 1988.2, 2192.1, and 2396.1), as well as a series of complex N-glycans comprising a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures, fucosylated on the core and bearing multiple LacNAc extensions, capped with sialic acid residues (n = 1–3). Very little evidence was observed for the presence of hybrid N-glycans in wild type CHO samples. Although some monosaccharide compositions could potentially be attributed to putative hybrid N-glycans, MS/MS analysis of these minor peaks yielded no definitive indication of hybrid structures, leading us to conclude that if they are present it is at very low abundance. Sialic acid was predominantly in the form of NeuAc, although NeuGc was present in a small proportion of sialylated N-glycans. This may be partly due to fetal bovine serum glycoprotein contamination (16.Bardor M. Nguyen D.H. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4228-4237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), but it is known that CHO cells synthesize small amounts of CMP-NeuGc (17.Chen W. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is advantageous that most CHO sialic acid is NeuAc because NeuGc is not desirable in recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins due to the high levels of circulating anti-NeuGc antibodies in human serum (18.Varki A. Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 351-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for trace amounts of N-glycans with an unsubstituted GlcNAc was also obtained from both mCHO and sCHO spectra. Consistent with the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc in complex N-glycans, GC-MS linkage data showed very low relative abundance of 3,4,6-linked mannose (supplemental Table S3). This result was unexpected because no Mgat3 gene transcripts (19.Stanley P. Sundaram S. Tang J. Shi S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or GlcNAcT-III activity (19.Stanley P. Sundaram S. Tang J. Shi S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20.Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Sallustio S. Stanley P. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has been detected in wild type CHO cells. The GC-MS and MALDI-TOF data, however, suggest that the Mgat3 gene is not completely silent in the Pro−5 line of CHO cells. By contrast, there was no evidence of N-glycans with more than one fucose residue. This suggests that the Fut genes known to be encoded in the CHO genome and activated in the LEC11, LEC12, and LEC30 glycosylation mutants (1.Patnaik S.K. Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 416: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) are turned off in Pro−5 CHO cells. Although it is possible (although very unlikely, based upon exhaustive MS/MS experiments) that in some fucosylated N-glycans of CHO cells the single fucose is actually on an antenna instead of in the core, the abundance would have to be very low because CHO cells do not bind antibodies that recognize fucose in the oncofetal antigens Lex, sLex, or VIM-2 (4.Howard D.R. Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16830-16837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Overall, the most abundant structures in both the mCHO and sCHO preparations were a series of core-fucosylated asialoglycans bearing between 2 and 26 LacNAc units (Fuc1Hex5–29HexNAc4–28). The main difference between the monolayer and a suspension of CHO preparations was a variation in the level of sialylation, with the sCHO preparation showing a slight decrease in relative abundance of sialylated N-glycans compared with the mCHO sample. Direct comparison of two related species in each spectrum, a putative tri-antennary, core-fucosylated N-glycan with a single NeuAc (m/z 3054.5) and an asialo form of otherwise identical composition (m/z 2693.3), yielded a ratio of ∼1:3 (sialylated:nonsialylated) in the sCHO sample versus 1:1.5 in the mCHO sample. These peaks are highlighted in green in Fig. 4. The O-glycan spectra from wild type CHO show a simple set of core 1 structures, mono- or di-sialylated by NeuAc (Fig. 3), and the core 1 disaccharide (supplemental Table S2). As was the case for the N-glycans, both the mCHO and sCHO O-glycan spectra were very similar, although the cells grown in monolayer again have a slightly higher degree of relative sialylation. An important consideration in interpreting the MS spectra was the likelihood that N-glycans of the same m/z would include different isobaric structures. This was examined by multiple MS/MS fragmentation experiments of selected ions within the spectra of each CHO glycosylation mutant, and exemplar data are presented. Fig. 5 shows the species at m/z 4040.9 in the sCHO sample (Fig. 4A, FucHex9HexNAc8, highlighted in yellow) subjected to MS/MS analysis. The y ion at m/z 474.0 together with its complementary b ion at m/z 3591.0 confirm that the fucose is preferentially carried on the proximal GlcNAc residue of the N-glycan core, as opposed to being on either antenna. This was further supported by the presence of 4,6-linked GlcNAc within the GC-MS linkage analysis (see supplemental Table S3). The diagnostic b ions at m/z 935.1 and 1383.9 together with their corresponding y ions at m/z 3128.9 and 2680.6 are consistent with the glycosidic cleavage of LacNAc repeats. Additional y ion fragments (m/z 1781.4 and 2230.5) serve to further confirm the presence of long polyLacNAc extensions. These signals are also among the most prominent within the spectrum, suggesting that the most abundant isoform for the molecular ion at m/z 4040.9 is an extended bi-antennary N-glycan with five LacNAc units on one arm and one on the other. Overall, however, the mass at 4040.9 consists of a heterogeneous mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans with varying lengths of polyLacNAc extension, as indicated by the presence of signals consistent with multiple glycosidic cleavages that reveal the extent of the branching on the core. Peaks at m/z 1767.3, 2217.3, 2665.7, and 3114.3 establish that there are two branching points in the molecule (thus a tri-antennary N-glycan"

Adult-born granule cells (GCs) in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, an AD model, showed greater dendritic length, spine density, and functional responses than did controls early in development, but were impaired morphologically and functionally during later maturation. Early inhibition of GABA(A) receptors to suppress GABAergic signaling or late inhibition of calcineurin to enhance glutamatergic signaling normalized the development of adult-born GCs in hAPP mice with high Abeta levels.

During early brain development, mDA neurons originate from the ventral midline of the mesencephalon. The initial event of mDA neuron development was shown to depend on Sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), and Wnt1, setting up the initial field for mDA progenitors (McMahon and Bradley, 1990McMahon A.P.

Among these, Wnt1 and FGF8 are expressed from Isthmus and they cross-regulate each other (Chi et al., 2003Chi C.L. Martinez S. Wurst W. Martin G.R.

Recent studies showing that FGF8 failed to induce ectopic DA neurons in Wnt1 mutant embryos (Prakash et al., 2006Prakash N. Brodski C. Naserke T. Puelles E. Gogoi R. Hall A. Panhuysen M. Echevarria D. Sussel L.

Furthermore, a recent study established that compound FGFR mutant mice show that FGF8 regulates mDA neuronal precursors (NP) proliferation rather than mDA identity, the latter being more critically mediated by SHH and Wnt1 (Saarimaki-Vire et al., 2007Saarimaki-Vire J. Peltopuro P. Lahti L. Naserke T. Blak A.A. Vogt Weisenhorn D.M. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Wurst W. Partanen J. Fibroblast growth factor receptors cooperate to regulate neural progenitor properties in the developing midbrain and hindbrain.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8581-8592Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SHH expressed from the notochord has been shown to directly induce FoxA2 expression in ventral mesencephalon (VM) through Gli binding sites in the FoxA2 gene (Sasaki et al., 1997Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. A binding site for Gli proteins is essential for HNF-3beta floor plate enhancer activity in transgenics and can respond to Shh in vitro.Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FoxA2, in turn, directly induces VM SHH expression through well-conserved FoxA2 binding sites in the SHH gene (Jeong and Epstein, 2003Jeong Y. Epstein D.J. Distinct regulators of Shh transcription in the floor plate and notochord indicate separate origins for these tissues in the mouse node.Development. 2003; 130: 3891-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FoxA2 regulates mDA development by inhibiting an alternate fate (Nkx2.2+ cells), inducing neurogenesis through Ngn2, and regulating Nurr1 and DA phenotype genes (Ferri et al., 2007Ferri A.L. Lin W. Mavromatakis Y.E. Wang J.C. Sasaki H. Whitsett J.A. Ang S.L. Foxa1 and Foxa2 regulate multiple phases of midbrain dopaminergic neuron development in a dosage-dependent manner.Development. 2007; 134: 2761-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) as well as regulating survival/maintenance of mDA neurons (Arenas, 2008Arenas E. Foxa2: The rise and fall of dopamine neurons.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 110-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Kittappa et al., 2007Kittappa R. Chang W.W. Awatramani R.B. McKay R.D. The foxa2 gene controls the birth and spontaneous degeneration of dopamine neurons in old age.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e325Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that FoxA2 is the main mediator of SHH signaling in mDA development. Taken together, SHH and Wnt1 are two major extrinsic signals that play critical roles in mDA development. However, for Wnt1, it is less clear what are its direct downstream target genes. These extrinsic signals are thought to initiate the regulatory cascades leading to mDA development by inducing key transcription factors. Indeed, downstream from these initial signaling molecules, numerous transcription factors have been implicated, including FoxA2, Otx2, Lmx1a, Lmx1b, Nurr1, and Pitx3 (Ang, 2006Ang S.L. Transcriptional control of midbrain dopaminergic neuron development.Development. 2006; 133: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Smidt and Burbach, 2007Smidt M.P. Burbach J.P. How to make a mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neuron.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). How these extrinsic signals and intrinsic transcription factors interact with each other is of utmost importance not only for our understanding of the regulatory network of mDA development but also for optimal stem cell engineering for cell replacement therapy of PD. Recently, an important transcriptional pathway involving the homeodomain protein Lmx1a has been identified; Lmx1a is expressed in early DA progenitors and induces another homeodomain factor, Msx1, which then suppresses alternative cell fates by suppressing the Nkx6.1 gene and induces neurogenesis by activating the proneural gene, Ngn2 (Andersson et al., 2006bAndersson E. Tryggvason U. Deng Q. Friling S. Alekseenko Z. Robert B. Perlmann T. Ericson J. Identification of intrinsic determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons.Cell. 2006; 124: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This study showed that Lmx1a is important for mDA development by gain- and loss-of-function analyses in chick embryos. Interestingly, dreher mutant mice carrying a mutation in the Lmx1a locus (Millonig et al., 2000Millonig J.H. Millen K.J. Hatten M.E. The mouse Dreher gene Lmx1a controls formation of the roof plate in the vertebrate CNS.Nature. 2000; 403: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) showed only modest developmental defect of mDA neurons (Ono et al., 2007Ono Y. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Kumai M. Hamaguchi A. Nishimura M. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. et al.Differences in neurogenic potential in floor plate cells along an anteroposterior location: midbrain dopaminergic neurons originate from mesencephalic floor plate cells.Development. 2007; 134: 3213-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be differences in mDA developmental mechanisms between the chick and mammalian systems. Although these elegant studies shed important insights into mDA development, how Lmx1a interacts with critical extrinsic signals and how it regulates key mDA factors remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified a Wnt1-Lmx1a autoregulatory loop during mDA differentiation of ESCs and confirmed that such a regulatory loop is also functional in vivo during mouse embryonic development. We found that this Wnt1-Lmx1a autoregulatory loop directly regulates Otx2 gene expression (through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway) and Nurr1 and Pitx3 gene expression (through Lmx1a). We also found that Lmx1a has overlapping function with Lmx1b in regulating downstream target genes and that they cross-regulate each other during mDA differentiation. Furthermore, forced expression of key targets of the Wnt1 pathway (Otx2 and Lmx1a) and a key target of the SHH pathway (FoxA2) synergistically induced mDA differentiation of ESCs, showing the importance of understanding mDA developmental mechanisms in optimal differentiation of ESCs into mDA neurons. FoxA2 is a direct downstream target of the SHH signaling pathway (Sasaki et al., 1997Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. A binding site for Gli proteins is essential for HNF-3beta floor plate enhancer activity in transgenics and can respond to Shh in vitro.Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the direct downstream targets of the Wnt1 signaling pathway during mDA development are still unclear (Figure 1A). To address this question, J1 ESCs were differentiated in vitro and infected with empty or Wnt1-expressing retrovirus at the NP stage (Figure S1 available online). To clearly see the effect of transgene expression without masking their effect by culture conditions, we used suboptimal condition without any DA-inducing factors. Cells were further differentiated and analyzed at day 3 of the neuronal differentiation (ND) stage (termed ND3 in the text). This is the time point of active mDA neurogenesis and differentiation in this stem cell culture bioassay, thus optimal to analyze the expression of potential mDA regulators/targets. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that forced Wnt1 expression significantly increased mRNA levels of Otx2, Pitx3, and to a greater extent Lmx1a (Figure 1B), but not those of FoxA2, Nurr1, or Msx1. The lack of an effect on the expression of these genes at this early time point suggests that they are not the direct targets of Wnt1 signaling, though they may be regulated by genes further downstream. Consistent with this mRNA analysis, immunocytochemisty analysis revealed an increased number of Lmx1a+ cells after Wnt1 overexpression (Figures 1C and 1D) from 7.05 ± 0.78 to 16.20 ± 1.11 (%Lmx1a+ cells/Hoechst+ cells; p < 0.05). In addition, Otx2+ or Pitx3+ cell numbers, but not Nurr1+ cell numbers, were significantly increased after Wnt1 overexpression (Figure S2). It was previously shown that SHH treatment could ventralize chick intermediate midbrain explants, accompanied by induction of Lmx1a and other ventral midbrain phenotype (Andersson et al., 2006bAndersson E. Tryggvason U. Deng Q. Friling S. Alekseenko Z. Robert B. Perlmann T. Ericson J. Identification of intrinsic determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons.Cell. 2006; 124: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Wnt1 can still induce Lmx1a in the presence of the SHH signaling inhibitor cyclopamine (Kittappa et al., 2007Kittappa R. Chang W.W. Awatramani R.B. McKay R.D. The foxa2 gene controls the birth and spontaneous degeneration of dopamine neurons in old age.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e325Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and found that Wnt1 induced Lmx1a independent of SHH signaling (Figure S3A). We next tested whether acute treatment with SHH or cyclopamine had an immediate effect on Lmx1a expression. ESC-derived NP cells were treated with 500 ng/ml SHH or 1 μM cyclopamine for 6 hr and analyzed by qPCR. Although these treatments led to corresponding changes in Gli1 mRNA levels, there were no significant changes in Lmx1a mRNA levels (Figure 1E) as well as TH or Nurr1 mRNA levels (Figure S3B), suggesting that these genes are not direct targets of the SHH signaling. However, it is still possible that SHH can indirectly regulate these genes through further downstream targets. To address whether Wnt1 directly regulates any of these potential targets via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis. At day 1 of the NP stage, in vitro differentiated ESCs were transduced with retroviral Wnt1, treated with 15 mM LiCl at day 3 to stabilize β-catenin, and then fixed for ChIP at day 4. ChIP was performed either with a control antibody or with β-catenin antibody. qPCR analysis showed significant binding of β-catenin complex to the well-conserved TCF/LEF binding site in the Lmx1a promoter, but not to another potential TCF/LEF site in the third intron of Lmx1a, showing the specificity of β-catenin binding in our assay system (Figure 1F). For the Otx2 promoter, ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that there is direct association of the β-catenin complex to its well-conserved TCF/LEF sites during mDA differentiation (Figure 1F). We used the c-myc promoter's TCF/LEF binding sites as positive control (Yochum et al., 2007Yochum G.S. McWeeney S. Rajaraman V. Cleland R. Peters S. Goodman R.H. Serial analysis of chromatin occupancy identifies beta-catenin target genes in colorectal carcinoma cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and observed comparable binding with the Lmx1a promoter and the Otx2 promoter (Figure 1F). In the absence of LiCl treatment, the ChIP experiment yielded comparable results (Figure S4), suggesting that Wnt1 expression alone is sufficient for stabilizing the β-catenin complex in this system. Furthermore, this binding of β-catenin complex was Wnt1 dependent (Figure S4). For the Pitx3 promoter, the regulation by Wnt1 appears to be indirect, because we could not find well-conserved TCF/LEF binding sites on the Pitx3 promoter, even though there is a possibility of regulation by a long-range enhancer. To further test whether these direct downstream targets are bound by the β-catenin complex in vivo during embryonic development, we performed the ChIP analysis by using dissected VM of E11.5 embryo. This analysis confirmed that the Lmx1a and Otx2 promoters are physically associated with the β-catenin complex (Figure 1G), supporting our in vitro data that Lmx1a and Otx2 are direct targets of the Wnt1 signaling pathway during mDA development. Because Lmx1a showed the most robust effect by Wnt1 overexpression, we attempted to identify Lmx1a's downstream targets. J1 ESCs were differentiated in vitro, infected with empty or Lmx1a-expressing retrovirus at the NP stage, and analyzed at ND3 after further differentiation. Interestingly, qPCR analysis showed that Lmx1a dramatically increased expression of Wnt1, but not that of SHH or Wnt5a (Figure 2A). We also overexpressed Lmx1a by using episomal vector and observed similar results (data not shown). In addition, immunocytochemical analysis showed that exogenous Lmx1a expression robustly increased the numbers of Wnt1+ cells (Figures 2B and 2C). We next tested the possibility that Lmx1a directly regulates the expression of Wnt1 by ChIP-qPCR analysis. In vitro differentiated J1 cells at the NP stage were transduced with retrovirus expressing HA-tagged Lmx1a and harvested for ChIP at ND3. Crosslinked chromatin complex was immunoprecipitated with HA antibody or control IgG and analyzed by qPCR. There was significant Lmx1a binding to the well-conserved homeodomain binding site in the Wnt1 promoter, but not to six well-conserved sites contained in four PCR fragments on the Wnt5a promoter, demonstrating the specificity of in vivo Lmx1a binding (Figure 2D). Importantly, these ChIP data are consistent with the overexpression data that Lmx1a regulates Wnt1, but not Wnt5a (Figures 2A–2C), further supporting the validity of our ChIP analysis. We confirmed the binding of Lmx1a to the Wnt1 promoter by an independent method (electrophoretic mobility shift assay [EMSA]) and observed specific DNA-protein complex formation that was supershifted by Lmx1a antibody (Figure S5A). Taken together, our results reveal the presence of a tight autoregulatory loop between Wnt1 and Lmx1a during mDA differentiation of ESCs. Next, we tested whether Lmx1a regulates the expression of Wnt1 during mouse embryonic midbrain development in vivo, by using the wild-type (wt) and dreher (dr/dr) mice (Millonig et al., 2000Millonig J.H. Millen K.J. Hatten M.E. The mouse Dreher gene Lmx1a controls formation of the roof plate in the vertebrate CNS.Nature. 2000; 403: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis of littermate wt versus dr/dr embryos showed that Wnt1 expression is compromised by Lmx1a mutation in developing midbrain (Figures 3A–3D). At E11.5, this defect was more evident, although Wnt1 expression was partially spared in the ventral-most part (Figures 3C and 3D). One possible explanation of this residual Wnt1 expression is the functional compensation by Lmx1b, which is expressed in the entire mDA domain at E10.5 (Figures 3E and 3G) and in the ventral-most part at E11.5 (Figures 3F and 3H), which will be further discussed later. The specificity of the antibodies against Lmx1a and Lmx1b is shown in Figure S6. To further test whether there is a direct interaction between Lmx1a and the Wnt1 promoter during embryonic development, we performed ChIP analysis by using dissected VM of E11.5 embryo and found that the Wnt1 promoter is physically associated with Lmx1a in developing VM (Figure 3I), confirming the presence of the Wnt1-Lmx1a autoregulatory loop in the embryo as well as during ESC differentiation. To quantitatively analyze the effect of Lmx1a mutation on gene expression in vivo, we purified E11.5 mesencephalic floor plate (mFP) cells, which generate mDA neurons (Kittappa et al., 2007Kittappa R.

To purify mFP cells, we did fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS; Figure 3L) by using antibody against corin, a cell surface marker specifically expressed in developing FP cells (Figures 3J and 3K; Ono et al., 2007Ono Y.

We observed mild decrease in Lmx1a, Lmx1b, and Ngn2 mRNA levels in the dr/dr embryos, consistent with the previous study (Ono et al., 2007Ono Y. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Kumai M. Hamaguchi A. Nishimura M. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. et al.Differences in neurogenic potential in floor plate cells along an anteroposterior location: midbrain dopaminergic neurons originate from mesencephalic floor plate cells.Development. 2007; 134: 3213-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition to Wnt1 gene regulation by Lmx1a mutation, there was significant reduction in the expression of Nurr1 and Pitx3 (Figure 3M). In the dr/dr embryo, this downregulation of Nurr1 and Pitx3 could be an indirect effect of defective DA neuron differentiation. Alternatively, it may be caused by direct regulation of Lmx1a. To address these possibilities, we tested whether Lmx1a directly regulates the expression of Pitx3 and Nurr1 during ESC in vitro differentiation. Retroviral Lmx1a expression increased the expression of Pitx3, Nurr1, and Lmx1b, whereas it failed to significantly affect the expression of Otx2, FoxA2, or En1 at ND3 (Figure 4A). We also observed significant increase in Msx1 and Ngn2 mRNA levels, consistent with a previous study (Andersson et al., 2006bAndersson E. Tryggvason U. Deng Q. Friling S. Alekseenko Z. Robert B. Perlmann T. Ericson J. Identification of intrinsic determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons.Cell. 2006; 124: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We also repeated this experiment by using an episomal Lmx1a expression system and obtained similar results (data not shown). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that exogenous Lmx1a expression increased the number of Nurr1+ cells (Figures 4B and 4C; from 2.07% ± 0.38% to 3.88% ± 0.46% Nurr1+ cells/Hoechst+ cells) and Pitx3+ cells (Figures 4E and 4F; from 0.58% ± 0.40% to 3.50% ± 0.33% Pitx3+ cells/Hoechst+ cells) as well as Lmx1b+ cells (Figures S7A and S7B). Interestingly, many Pitx3+ cells and Nurr1+ cells were not yet positive for TH at ND3 (Figures 4C and 4F), suggesting that the increase in Pitx3 and Nurr1 gene expression is a direct effect, but not the byproduct of increased mDA neurons. At a later time point (ND7), the majority of Pitx3+ cells became TH+, suggesting that Lmx1a precociously induced Pitx3 expression in immature DA neurons (Figures S7C–S7F). In addition, Lmx1a expression significantly increased the percent of TH+ cells/β-tubulin+ cells from 0.87% ± 0.21% to 2.98% ± 0.84% without supplementing the culture with SHH, unlike the previous report where the effect of Lmx1a on DA induction was strictly dependent upon addition of SHH to the culture (Andersson et al., 2006bAndersson E. Tryggvason U. Deng Q. Friling S. Alekseenko Z. Robert B. Perlmann T. Ericson J. Identification of intrinsic determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons.Cell. 2006; 124: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Endogenous SHH expression at the NP stage may explain such difference. To further address whether Lmx1a directly regulates gene expression of the mDA regulators Nurr1 and Pitx3, we performed ChIP analysis. We found Lmx1a significantly bound to Nurr1A and Nurr1C PCR fragments, but not the Nurr1B fragment (Figure 4D), and confirmed the specific binding of Lmx1a by supershift EMSA (Figure S5B). For the Pitx3 promoter, we observed significant Lmx1a binding to Pitx3A, but not Pitx3B PCR fragment (Figure 4G), and also confirmed it by supershift EMSA (Figure S5C). We also performed ChIP to test whether Ngn2 is directly regulated by Lmx1a, but observed no significant binding (Figure S8B). To further confirm the regulation of Nurr1 and Pitx3 by Lmx1a during embryonic midbrain development, we performed immunohistochemistry and stereological analysis on littermate wt and dr/dr embryos. We counted the number of Nurr1+ and Pitx3+ cells in the entire mDA domain in every 6th coronal VM section, by using the StreoInvestigator image capture equipment and software. We found significant decreases in Nurr1+ and Pitx3+ cell numbers in dr/dr embryos compared to littermate wt embryos (Figures 4H–4M), whereas there was no significant difference in the FoxA2+ or Otx2+ cell numbers between wt and dr/dr embryos (Figures S9A and S9B). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Lmx1a directly regulates Nurr1 and Pitx3, but not FoxA2 or Otx2, both in mDA differentiation of ESCs and in embryonic midbrain development. Compared to the robust induction of mDA differentiation in ESCs by Lmx1a, dreher mice displayed only mild dysregulation of mDA development. This could be explained either by lack of functional significance of Lmx1a during embryonic mDA development or by the presence of another gene with redundant function. For the latter possibility, Lmx1b is one such candidate, because (1) it is expressed in the same domain as Lmx1a during mDA development and (2) it is highly related to Lmx1a with 61% overall amino acid identity (Hobert and Westphal, 2000Hobert O. Westphal H. Functions of LIM-homeobox genes.Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, to explore whether Lmx1b and Lmx1a share some redundant functions in mDA differentiation, we compared the effect of Lmx1a and Lmx1b's overexpression during in vitro differentiation of ESCs. J1 ESCs were differentiated in vitro, infected with Lmx1a- or Lmx1b-expressing retrovirus at the NP stage, and analyzed at ND3. In line with Wnt1's residual expression pattern in dr/dr embryos (Figures 3A–3H), both Lmx1a and Lmx1b upregulated Wnt1 expression (Figure 5A). SHH expression was unaffected by either gene, whereas both Pitx3 and Nurr1 expression were upregulated by Lmx1a or Lmx1b (Figure 5A), showing the redundant function of Lmx1a and Lmx1b in target gene regulation. Interestingly, Lmx1b expression mildly but significantly upregulated Lmx1a expression (Figure 5A). ChIP analysis showed that Lmx1b binds to the Lmx1a promoter and also Lmx1a binds to the Lmx1b promoter, indicating cross-regulation between these two genes (Figure S8B). In addition, we also examined whether there is any self-regulation of Lmx1a or Lmx1b. qPCR analysis with endogenous message-specific primers revealed that Lmx1a regulates itself, but Lmx1b does not (Figure S8A). Consistent with this, we observed that Lmx1a but not Lmx1b specifically binds to the well conserved binding site within its own promoter (Figure S8B). Observed cross-regulation between Lmx1a and Lmx1b raised the possibility that Lmx1b regulates target genes indirectly through Lmx1a. Thus, to test whether Lmx1b can directly regulate target genes, we did ChIP-qPCR analysis after transduction with retrovirus expressing HA-tagged Lmx1b. We found that Lmx1b significantly bound to the promoters of Wnt1, Nurr1, and Pitx3 (Figure 5B), though milder than Lmx1a. We also tested the binding of Lmx1a or Lmx1b to the Msx1 promoter and found that they both bind to the well conserved homeodomain binding sites residing at −3.5 kb upstream of the Msx1 gene (Figure S10). To further study the redundant function between Lmx1a and Lmx1b, we attempted to knock down these genes by using gene-specific siRNA approach. ESC-derived NP cells were treated with SHH and FGF8 for 4 days to induce/proliferate mDA NPs, and then transfected with control siRNA, Lmx1a siRNA, Lmx1b siRNA, or both Lmx1a/1b siRNAs via Nucleofector (Amaxa) and analyzed after 30 hr. Transfection of each siRNA treatment significantly reduced the mRNA level of Lmx1a or Lmx1b (Figures 5C and 5E–5H). Transfection of single siRNA did not have significant effect on Wnt1 or Nurr1 gene expression. This insignificant effect is in contrast with the robust induction effect observed in overexpression experiment (Figure 5A). This can be explained by incomplete knockdown by siRNA and/or nonphysiological overexpression effect caused by retroviral transduction. However, when both genes were knocked down, there was significant decrease in the target gene expression (Figures 5C and 5I–5L; Figure S11), suggesting that Lmx1a and Lmx1b compensate each other's function in regulating mDA regulator genes. Because Pitx3+ cells were not yet detectable at this NP stage, we repeated the gene knockdown experiment at ND-stage cells. ESC-derived cells were treated with SHH and FGF8 for 4 days, differentiated in N3 media for 2 days, transfected with siRNA, and analyzed by qPCR analysis 30 hr after transfection. siRNA treatment to each gene significantly reduced the mRNA level of Lmx1a"
https://openalex.org/W2036539500,"Plants induce immune responses against fungal pathogens by recognition of chitin, which is a component of the fungal cell wall. Recent studies have revealed that LysM receptor-like kinase 1/chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (LysM RLK1/CERK1) is a critical component for the immune responses to chitin in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the molecular mechanism of the chitin recognition by LysM RLK1 still remains unknown. Here, we present the first evidence for direct binding of LysM RLK1 to chitin. We expressed LysM RLK1 fused with yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (LysM RLK1-yEGFP) in yeast cells. Binding studies using the solubilized LysM RLK1-yEGFP and several insoluble polysaccharides having similar structures showed that LysM RLK1-yEGFP specifically binds to chitin. Subsequently, the fluorescence microscopic observation of the solubilized LysM RLK1-yEGFP binding to chitin beads revealed that the binding was saturable and had a high affinity, with a Kd of ∼82 nm. This binding was competed by the addition of soluble glycol chitin or high concentration of chitin oligosaccharides having 4–8 residues of N-acetyl glucosamine. However, the competition of these chitin oligosaccharides is weaker than that of glycol chitin. These data suggest that LysM RLK1 has a higher affinity for chitin having a longer residue of N-acetyl glucosamine. We also found that LysM RLK1-yEGFP was autophosphorylated in vitro and that chitin does not affect the phosphorylation of LysM RLK1-yEGFP. Our results provide a new dimension to chitin elicitor perception in plants.

Our results provide a new dimension to chitin elicitor perception in plants. When a plant is attacked by pathogens, it rapidly induces immune responses to stop the infection. A key step of the rapid induction of immune responses is a prompt and efficient detection of microbial invaders. In plants, this is achieved by pattern recognition receptors that recognize the conserved structures of the microbial pathogens. These conserved microbial structures are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognized by plants include lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycan (PGN), 3The abbreviations used are: PGNpeptidoglycanRLKreceptor-like kinaseLDAOlauryl dimethylamine N-oxider(GlcNAc)9reduced (GlcNAc)9CBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. flagellin, and bacterial elongation factor-Tu, which are derived from the bacteria (1Zipfel C.

Plants also recognize fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as chitin and ergosterol, which are components of the fungal cell wall and plasma membrane, respectively (1Zipfel C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Granado J. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent studies have discovered the plant pattern recognition receptors participating in the perception of chitin elicitor (4Kaku H. Nishizawa Y. Ishii-Minami N. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Dohmae N. Takio K.

A LysM motif-containing plasma membrane protein, CEBiP (chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-binding protein), participates in the perception of chitin oligosaccharides in rice (4Kaku H. Nishizawa Y. Ishii-Minami N. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Dohmae N. Takio K. Minami E. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The CEBiP has two LysM motifs in the extracellular domain and lacks the intracellular kinase domain that is required for signal transduction. It has been demonstrated that CEBiP directly binds to chitin oligosaccharides and plays an essential role in the perception of chitin and the induction of immunity in rice (4Kaku H. Nishizawa Y. Ishii-Minami N. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Dohmae N. Takio K. Minami E. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). On the other hand, more recently, two groups have independently reported that a LysM receptor-like kinase (RLK) plays a key role in chitin perception in Arabidopsis thaliana (5Miya A. Albert P. Shinya T. Desaki Y. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Narusaka Y. Kawakami N. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19613-19618Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 6Wan J. Zhang X.C. Neece D. Ramonell K.M. Clough S. Kim S.Y. Stacey M.G. Stacey G. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This receptor, LysM receptor-like kinase 1/chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (LysM RLK1/CERK1), is localized in the plasma membrane and has three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain as well as the intracellular kinase domain. Although these studies demonstrated that LysM RLK1 plays a crucial role in the immune response against fungal pathogens, the molecular mechanism of interactions of LysM RLK1 and chitin is still unknown. The LysM motifs are known as GlcNAc-binding motifs, which occur frequently in bacterial lysins and bind to PGN (7Buist G. Steen A. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In plants, this motif is also present in a chitinase and directly binds to chitin or chitin oligosaccharides (8Onaga S. Taira T. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Ohnuma T. Onaga S. Murata K. Taira T. Katoh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5178-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although LysM RLK1 has three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain, it remains unclear whether LysM RLK1 directly binds to chitin or acts via cooperation with another protein. An affinity-labeling experiment was unable to detect any specific binding protein to chitin in a membrane preparation from A. thaliana, although the same technique could detect CEBiP in plasma membrane of rice (5Miya A. Albert P. Shinya T. Desaki Y. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Narusaka Y. Kawakami N. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19613-19618Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether LysM RLK1 directly binds to chitin. To exclude the potential effects of other plant components, we used the recombinant LysM RLK1 protein expressed in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast is superior to Escherichia coli for the expression of recombinant membrane proteins because it has a highly regulated protein quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated the specific and direct binding of LysM RLK1 to chitin in vitro by binding assays using recombinant LysM RLK1 fused with yeast-enhanced green fluorescence protein (LysM RLK1-yEGFP). We also found that the full length of LysM RLK1-yEGFP was autophosphorylated without chitin and that chitin did not affect the phosphorylation of LysM RLK1-yEGFP in vitro. chitin beads were purchased from New England Biolabs. Chitin oligosaccharides (degrees of polymerization = 2–6) and a chitosan oligosacchride (GlcN)6 were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo. Colloidal chitin and colloidal chitosan were prepared as reported previously (11Jeuniaux C. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. 1958; 66: 408-427PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yabuki M. Hirano M. Ando A. Fujii T. Amemiya Y. Tech. Bull. Fac. Hort. Chiba Univ. 1987; 39: 23-27Google Scholar). Glycol chitin was prepared from chitin according to the method of Yamada and Imoto (13Yamada H. Imoto T. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 92: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Reduced (GlcNAc)9, r(GlcNAc)9, was prepared from mono-N-acetylated chitononaose (GlcN)8-GlcNAc obtained by the method of Mitsutomi et al. (14Mitsutomi M. Takahara S. Kobayashi S. Ueda M. Arai M. Miyatake K. Chitin Chitosan. Res. 2002; 8: 228-229Google Scholar). (GlcN)8-GlcNAc was reduced with sodium borohydride, and then the reduced (GlcN)8-GlcNAc was N-acetylated by a modification of the procedure of Barker et al. (15Barker S.A. Foster A.B. Stacey M. Webber J.M. J. Chem. Soc. 1958; 1958: 2218-2227Crossref Google Scholar), as described previously (16Mitsutomi M. Ohtakara A. Fukamizo T. Goto S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 871-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycol chitosan was acetylated with [1-14C]acetic anhydride (America Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) as follows. Three hundred μl of 0.04 m Na2CO3, 250 μl of methanol, and 3 μl of [1-14C]acetic anhydride (5 mCi/mmol) were added to 2 mg of glycol chitosan. After a 24-h incubation at 25 °C, the sample was passed through the Dowex 50 column. The elution evaporated three times with methanol to remove the unreacted [1-14C]acetic acid. After the evaporation, the [14C]glycol chitin was dissolved in water. yEGFP was expressed in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen). First, yEGFP was cloned into pET43a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). To fuse yEGFP with an octahistidine tag at the C terminus and to remove an N-terminal Nus tag, the yeast recombinational cloning was carried out as reported previously (17Iizasa E. Nagano Y. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except that, instead of pSU0, pYES2/CT (Invitrogen) was used as a helper plasmid for the conversion of pET43a(+) into the yeast shuttle vector. The pET43a(+)-yEGFP were transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) by the standard method. The transformants were grown in the LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 = 0.6 at 37 °C. Subsequently, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown at 15 °C for a further 20 h. The cells were broken by a French press, and yEGFP was purified by a nickel column as described previously (18Kohara J. Tsuneyoshi N. Gauchat J.F. Kimoto M. Fukudome K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 49: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For the removal of imidazole, the eluted proteins were dialyzed against 200 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 4 h at 4 °C with five buffer changes. The concentration of the proteins was determined by the Bradford method. LysM RLK1 was cloned into the expression vector, pDDGFP2 (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), to be fused with yEGFP and an octahistidine tag at the C terminus. First, the cDNA corresponding to LysM RLK1 was created by reverse transcription-PCR with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using a gene-specific primer (5′-ATATAAATTTTCCCCCCGGCCGGACATAAGACTGA-3′) from 0.5 μg of the total RNA of A. thaliana (19Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of LysM RLK1 was obtained after two rounds of PCR using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (TAKARA BIO, Ohtsu, Shiga, Japan). The first round of PCR amplified the open reading frame with the gene-specific primers 5′-ACTAGTGGATCCCCCATGAAGCTAAAGATTTCTCT-3′ and 5′-ATATAAATTTTCCCCCCGGCCGGACATAAGACTGA-3′, whereas the second round of PCR amplified it with the primers 5′-TCGACGGATTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCC-3′ and 5′-AAATTGACCTTGAAAATATAAATTTTCCCC-3′ for providing this fragment with the ends homologous to pDDGFP2. Subsequently, the LysM RLK1 gene was subcloned into pDDGFP2 by the yeast recombinational cloning (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The plasmid obtained from the yeast cells was cloned and propagated in E. coli DH5α (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) as we described previously (17Iizasa E. Nagano Y. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The sequence of insert was confirmed by a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The pDDGFP2 harboring LysM RLK1 (pDDGFP2-LysM RLK1) was retransformed into the S. cerevisiae strain BY2777 (MATa prb1-1122 prc1-407 pep4-3 ura3-52 leu2 trp1). Subsequently, for the expression of LysM RLK1-yEGFP, the transformants were grown in SC-Ura liquid medium containing 2% glucose, and the protein expression was induced as reported previously (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and were suspended in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture, complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). After the addition of the same volume of chilled acid-washed glass beads, the cells were broken by three rounds of a Fast Prep cell disruptor (BIO 101, Vista, CA) at 5.5 ms−1 for 20 s with 2-min intervals on ice. After lysis, the lysate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 21,040 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the membranes. The crude membranes were solubilized, and LysM RLK1 proteins were purified as reported previously (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), except that a detergent, lauryl dimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO), was used in solubilization and purification instead of N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. To remove imidazole, the eluted protein was dialyzed against 300 volumes of the binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.05% LDAO, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 4 h at 4 °C with five buffer changes. The concentration of LysM RLK1-yEGFP protein was determined by comparing it with a yEGFP standard curve. The standard curve was generated by using known amounts of recombinant yEGFP purified from E. coli. 100 μl of the samples were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the yEGFP fluorescence in each well was read using a multimode plate reader (model DTX880, Beckman (Krefeld, Germany)), and the following settings were used: fluorescence intensity bottom method, 0.1-s integration time, 485-nm excitation filter, and 535-nm emission filter. Protein samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer and then incubated at 45 °C for 3 min. After incubation, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The GFP fluorescence was measured using a Typhoon 9200 fluorescence imager (GE Healthcare). The SDS-polyacrylamide gel was scanned using the green laser (532 nm) excitation source, and the resulting fluorescence emitted (526 nm, short pass filter) was recorded using a PMT (a value for sensitivity) of 800 V at a resolution of 100 μm. The in-gel fluorescence analysis was followed by CBB staining, using CBB G-250. The binding specificity of LysM RLK1 protein for various ligands was examined by a polysaccharide binding assay, which was performed as reported previously (20Tjoelker L.W. Gosting L. Frey S.

Thirty pmol of purified LysM RLK1-yEGFP or yEGFP (negative control) was mixed with 200 μg of insoluble polysaccharides, chitin beads, colloidal chitin, colloidal chitosan, or PGN derived from Staphylococcus aureus (Sigma) in a total volume of 200 μl of binding buffer incubated for 30 min by rotating end over end. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times with the ice-cold binding buffer and mixed with SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were electrophoresed, and the binding proteins were analyzed by in-gel fluorescence as described earlier. The proteins bound to the polysaccharides were quantified by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Aliquots (1 μl) of chitin beads (50% slurry) were suspended in 50 μl of the binding buffer containing various concentrations (3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31, 63, 125, 250, and 500 nm) of LysM RLK1-yEGFP or yEGFP. Subsequently, the suspensions were incubated for 20 min. In the case of the competition assay, glycol chitin, glycol chitosan, a chitosan oligosaccharide (GlcN)6 and various lengths of chitin oligosaccharides were incubated with 250 nm proteins before the addition of the chitin beads. The LysM RLK1 or yEGFP bound to the chitin were directly visualized using a fluorescence microscope (model BX-51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a fluorescence mirror unit, U-MWIB3 (Olympus). The images were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), whose shutter speed and aperture were fixed at ⅛ and F3.1, respectively. The fluorescence intensities of the edges of the beads were analyzed by ImageJ software. The dissociation constant, Kd was determined by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Purified 40 pmol of LysM RLK1-yEGFP was bound to nickel-chelating Sepharose and suspended in 100 μl of the binding buffer. It was then incubated with 0.25, 0.5, 2.5, 5, 12.5, and 25 μg/ml [14C]glycol chitin with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled glycol chitin for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer on GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). After the nickel-chelating Sepharoses on the filters were dried, the samples were quantified by scintillation counting. In the case of the competition assay, glycol chitin, glycol chitosan, and various lengths of chitin oligosaccharides were incubated with LysM RLK1-yEGFP on nickel-chelating Sepharose before the addition of the glycol chitin. The phosphorylation of LysM RLK1 was analyzed as previously described (22Nam K.H. Li J. Cell. 2002; 110: 203-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of LysM RLK-yEGFP or yEGFP were incubated with or without 500 μm r(GlcNAc)9 or 25 μg/ml glycol chitin at 25 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% LDAO, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 370 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography after the gels were dried under the vacuum. LysM RLK1 was expressed fused with yEGFP and octahistidine tag at the C terminus in S. cerevisiae. The use of yEGFP allows easy and specific detection of the target protein without antibodies and makes optimization of the protein expression and purification easy. We expressed the LysM RLK1-yEGFP fusion protein in S. cerevisiae strain, BY2777, following the procedure described previously (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). After the induction, we could detect the yEGFP fluorescence on the plasma membrane of the cells by a fluorescence microscope (data not shown). The membrane proteins were then analyzed by the in-gel fluorescence after SDS-PAGE, and an ∼94 kDa protein band corresponding to the LysM RLK1-yEGFP was detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1, left, lane 1). Subsequently, to select an adequate detergent for solubilization of LysM RLK1-yEGFP, several kinds of detergents were examined including LDAO, cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, CHAPS, and Triton X-100 at 1% (w/v). The amounts of solubilized LysM RLK1 were determined by measuring the florescence of the solubilized proteins with a plate reader as described previously (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We found that the LDAO was the most effective detergent for solubilizing LysM RLK1-yEGFP from the membranes (data not shown). The membrane proteins were then solubilized by incubating with 1% LDAO, and LysM RLK1-yEGFP protein was purified by the nickel column chromatography. The samples were analyzed by in-gel fluorescence and CBB-stained after the electrophoresis (Fig. 1). We had observed a slight shift in band size of LysM RLK1-yEGFP in the crude membrane fraction on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, left, lane 1). Not only the LysM RLK1-yEGFP protein but also other proteins in the crude membrane fraction migrated faster than that in the LDAO-solubilized fraction (Fig. 1, right, lane 1). Membrane contaminant might affect the band patterns because we could detect the non-shifted band of LysM RLK1-yEGFP after the removal of the LDAO-insoluble fraction by ultracentrifuge (Fig. 1, lane 2). The amount of LysM RLK1-yEGFP protein was determined by comparison with the yEGFP standard curve, because the CBB staining is poor and inconsistent for many membrane protein samples (10Newstead S. Kim H. von Heijne G. Iwata S. Drew D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We obtained about 0.3–0.4 mg of LysM RLK1-yEGFP protein per liter of culture after the purification. To study the biochemical interactions between LysM RLK1 and chitin, we first examined the binding of LysM RLK1-yEGFP to insoluble chitin, such as chitin beads and colloidal chitin, and other insoluble polysaccharides, colloidal chitosan, and PGN, containing a common GlcNAc backbone. These insoluble polysaccharides were incubated with the same amount of LysM RLK1-yEGFP protein (Fig. 2A, Apply lane). Subsequently, the proteins bound to the polysaccharides were analyzed by in-gel fluorescence after SDS-PAGE. The LysM RLK1-yEGFP was largely specific for chitin. It strongly bound the chitin beads and colloidal chitin (Fig. 2, A (top) and B). However, we could detect no or little binding of the LysM RLK1-yEGFP to colloidal chitosan and PGN (Fig. 2, A (top) and B). As a negative control, these polysaccharides were also incubated with the yEGFP protein. However, we could detect little binding of yEGFP to any polysaccharides (Fig. 2, A (bottom) and B). Thus, these data indicate that LysM RLK1 specifically and directly binds to chitin. To investigate the binding property of LysM RLK1 to chitin, we subsequently directly visualized the binding of LysM RLK1 to chitin beads. Chitin beads are fine chitin particles (50–250 μm), and recent studies have used them in the bioassay or binding assay instead of chitin (21Hardt M. Laine R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Reese T.A. Liang H.E. Tager A.M. Luster A.D. Van Rooijen N. Voehringer D. Locksley R.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). We incubated LysM RLK1-yEGFP with the chitin beads and directly observed their interaction using a fluorescence microscope. When 500 nm LysM RLK1-yEGFP was incubated with the chitin beads, strong green florescence was detected on the chitin beads (Fig. 3A). However, no fluorescence was detected on the beads when they were incubated with yEGFP (Fig. 3A). The protein binding was completed within 20 min of the start of incubation (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, all of the subsequent binding studies were performed at 20 min after the addition of chitin beads. To determine whether the binding was saturable, as would be expected for a receptor-ligand interaction, the chitin beads were incubated with various concentrations of LysM RLK1-yEGFP (Fig. 3C). We found that the binding was saturable, and the dissociation constant (Kd) of the proteins was ∼82 nm (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, fluorescence of chitin beads was completely diminished by the addition of an excess of glycol chitin but not glycol chitosan (400 μg/ml), which are known as water-soluble chitin and chitosan derivatives (13Yamada H. Imoto T. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 92: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). The competition by glycol chitin and glycol chitosan was assessed in experiments in which increasing amounts of them competed with LysM RLK1-yEGFP for binding to chitin beads. Glycol chitin competed for the binding to chitin beads with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4 μg/ml (Fig. 4C). These data show that LysM RLK1 specifically and directly binds to chitin. It is known that the biological activity of the soluble chitin oligosaccharides depends on their degree of polymerization. Therefore, we tested the chitin oligosaccharides of different lengths for their efficiency to compete for the binding of LysM RLK1 to chitin beads. After 250 μm concentrations of the various lengths of chitin oligosaccharides were incubated with 250 nm LysM RLK1-yEGFP, the chitin beads were added to this solution, and the binding of LysM RLK1-yEGFP to chitin beads was analyzed by the fluorescence microscopy. We found that the competition of chitin oligosaccharides occurred in a size-dependent manner. r(GlcNAc)9 (an analog of (GlcNAc)8), (GlcNAc)6, and (GlcNAc)5 strongly competed with LysM RLK1-yEGFP for >75% of the binding to the chitin beads (Fig. 5, A and B). Although (GlcNAc)6 strongly competed the binding, (GlcN)6 did not compete for the binding. This finding also indicates that the LysM RLK1 specifically binds chitin oligosaccharides. (GlcNAc)4 also competed with it for about 60% of the binding (Fig. 5, A and B). However, (GlcNAc)3 and (GlcNAc)2 did not show noticeable competition with regard to the binding of LysM RLK1-yEGFP to the chitin beads (Fig. 5, A and B). We also assessed the competition by the serial diluted chitin oligosaccharides. Even larger chitin oligosaccharides could weakly compete for the binding of LysM RLK1-yEGFP to chitin beads with an IC50 of about 100 μm (Fig. 5C). 14C-Labeled glycol chitin was used to confirm the binding of chitin to LysM RLK1. The purified LysM RLK1-yEGFP was bound to nickel-chelating Sepharose and suspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing the various concentrations of [14C]glycol chitin with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled glycol chitin. The binding of [14C]glycol chitin to LysM RLK1-yGFP was saturable, and a Kd value was 3.5 μg/ml (Fig. 6A). We also performed the competition assay with the serial diluted glycol chitin, glycol chitosan, and oligosaccharides of various lengths. Glycol chitin but glycol chitosan competed for the binding of [14C]glycol chitin to LysM RLK1-yEGFP with an IC50 of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 6B). However, even larger chitin oligosaccharides could weakly compete for the binding of it at a higher concentration, such as 500 μm (Fig. 6C). Many animal receptor kinases exhibit ligand-dependent autophosphorylation (24Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar). To determine whether the early events in chitin perception of plants share this mechanism, we carried out an in vitro kinase assay. Various concentrations of LysM RLK1-yEGFP and yEGFP were assayed for autophosphorylation. The samples were electrophoresed and analyzed by autoradiography. The bands corresponding to LysM RLK1-yEGFP were detected in a dose-dependent manner wit"

Cytoplasmic CH2-THF can be reduced to 5-methyl-THF (see Fig. 1, reaction 6) for entry into the methyl cycle, oxidized to 10-formyl-THF (10-CHO-THF) (Fig. 1, reactions 3 and 2) for purine synthesis, or it can be used for nuclear thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis (Fig. 1, reaction 10) (2Woeller C.F.

In mitochondria, the other product of the SHMT reaction, glycine, can also serve as a source of one-carbon units (4Fu T.F. Rife J.P. Schirch V. Arch. Biochem.

It is metabolized by the mitochondrially localized glycine cleavage system (Fig. 1, reaction 5), producing CH2-THF from its 2-carbon. CH2-THF, from either serine or glycine, can be oxidized to 10-CHO-THF by mitochondrial versions of reactions 3 and 2 in Fig. 1. 10-CHO-THF can either be converted to formate and THF by 10-formyl-THF synthetase (Fig. 1, reaction 1m) or oxidized to form CO2 and THF by 10-formyl-THF dehydrogenase (Fig. 1, reaction 11) (6Barlowe C.K.

The CH2-THF dehydrogenase activity of C1-THF synthase is NADP-dependent, and this redox cofactor specificity may explain the preference of the cytoplasmic pathway to operate in the reductive direction in vivo (i.e. from 10-CHO-THF to CH2-THF) (23West M.G. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic NADP/NADPH redox couple is maintained in a reduced state (24Sies H. Sies H.

Shane B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43178-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Prasannan P. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 481: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, a 10-CHO-THF synthetase activity has been detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (28Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the authors suggested MTHFD1L as the most likely candidate enzyme in embryos to explain this activity. However, in normal embryonic tissues, neither the 10-CHO-THF synthetase activity nor an associated protein has been demonstrated. Previous metabolic studies with MEFs support the above model of mitochondrial formate production and release, suggesting a role for 10-CHO-THF synthetase activity in this process (14Patel H. Pietro E.D. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E.

Although embryonically derived cells provide a useful experimental system to study the compartmentation of 1-C metabolism, there are limitations of these cultured cells as models for embryogenesis. We thus sought evidence for the participation of MTHFD1L in providing 1-C units to the cytoplasm during normal embryogenesis. Here we show that embryonic mitochondria contain the MTHFD1L protein and are capable of producing formate from the 1-C donor glycine. We investigate the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the MTHFD1L gene in mouse embryos and compare them to those of MTHFD2 and MTHFD1. Finally, metabolic tracer studies in MEFs show that disruption of mitochondrial 1-C flux creates significant disturbances in the cytoplasmic methyl cycle. These results thus verify and extend the current model of mammalian 1-C cycle metabolism to embryos. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA). The nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Midwest Scientific (Valley Park, MO). T7, T3, and SP6 polymerases were purchased from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison, WI). Restriction enzymes were purchased from either Invitrogen or Fisher/Promega (Madison, WI). Geneticin (G-418 sulfate) was obtained from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Kits for plasmid preparation were from Qiagen. All of the study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas at Austin and conform to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Wild type CF-1® mice (Charles River Laboratories) were housed at the UT-Austin Animal Resource Center. Vaginal plugs observed at noon in female mice were considered as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). The embryos were also staged based on somite number. Mouse embryos between E13.0 and E17.5 were dissected from pregnant females along with the adult livers. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously for adult liver (6Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 7García-Martínez L.F. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4671-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except that in some cases, the pellet from the initial centrifugation was resuspended, Dounce homogenized, and recentrifuged, and the supernatant was pooled with the first supernatant. Mitochondrial formate production was measured essentially as described previously (6Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 7García-Martínez L.F. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4671-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), except that [2-14C]glycine (Morevek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) was used as 1-C donor. Incubations contained 0.4 ml of intact mitochondria, 5.0 mm [2-14C]glycine (1000 dpm/nmol), 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, 25 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 240 mm sucrose in a total volume of 1 ml. [14C]Formate produced was determined by enzymatic assay using formate dehydrogenase (from Candida boidinii; Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (6Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar). Formate production was normalized to the mitochondrial protein concentration of each sample as determined by the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The p values were calculated utilizing the Student's t test. Extracts of cultured cells and mitochondria isolated from embryos were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (38Prasannan P. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 481: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with a polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for MTHFD1L (38Prasannan P. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 481: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or a rabbit anti-Hsp60 antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). A Mouse Conceptus full stage Northern blot was obtained from Seegene, Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). Each lane contained 20 μg of total RNA from embryos aged E4.5–18.5. The probes were synthesized with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by asymmetric PCR using Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and reagents supplied in the Strip E-Z PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. A cDNA containing the full-length mouse MTHFD1L coding sequence was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Image Clone identification number 6311761, GenBankTM access number BQ91728). The SP6 promoter/primer lay at the 5′ end of the insert, whereas the T7 promoter/primer site was at the 3′ end. Mouse MTHFD2 (clone 24FL) and MTHFD1 (clone 14EB) cDNAs, each containing partial sequences, were generously provided by Dr. R. E. MacKenzie (McGill University). For 24FL, the T7 promoter flanked the 5′ end of the insert; the T3 promoter/primer was on the 3′ side. The orientation of the 14EB insert was opposite that of 24FL. The 432-bp MTHFD1L probe was synthesized using forward and reverse primers STP5′ (5′-AAGAACTTGCAGCCGCATCTC-3′) and Mmomito (5′-CCAGACCAGCCTCCTTGGCCAAA-3′), respectively. The 431-bp MTHFD2 probe was synthesized using forward and reverse primers M2F5′ (5′-ACAATCCCGCCAGTCACTCCTAT-3′) and M2F3′ (5′-TTCGTGAGCTCCATCTGTGTGCA-3′), respectively. The 450-bp MTHFD1 probe was synthesized using forward and reverse primers MC5′ (5′-TGAAGGCTGCTGAGGAGATTG-3′) and MC3′ (5′-TTACTTCGACCAACCACCACCG-3′), respectively. Hybridization and visualization were as described previously (36Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K. Shane B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43178-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Densitometric quantification of Northern blot bands was performed using Image J (National Institutes of Health). The bands were normalized to a digitized photographic negative of ribosomal RNA on the gel from which the blot was prepared. The densities of 18 and 28 S bands for each lane were summed and divided by the intensity in the lane of highest density. The relative band densities were determined similarly for the MTHFD1L, MTHFD2, and MTHFD1 blots. The normalized values for each lane were obtained by dividing the individual lane standardized intensities for each blot by the standardized intensities of the ribosomal RNA values in the respective lane. Approximate transcript sizes were estimated by comparison with the mobilities of RNA standards. Antisense and sense probes to MTHFD1L and MTHFD2 transcripts were constructed for in situ hybridizations in whole embryos (E9.5–13.5). For both the 5′- and 3′ end probes to MTHFD1L, the full-length mouse cDNA was shortened to ensure optimal probe length. Shortening for the 5′ end probe used two HindIII restriction sites: one within the insert and the other in the vector. The 3′ end probe was constructed using SmaI sites. Religation of each MTHFD1L plasmid yielded 873 bp of 5′ sequence and 1008 bp of 3′ sequence, respectively. Following linearization, antisense and sense probes were synthesized using T7 and SP6 polymerases, respectively. For MTHFD2 antisense and sense probes, the complete 1045-bp insert was utilized. Following linearization, T7 and T3 polymerases were utilized for synthesis of the sense and antisense probes, respectively. Polymerization reactions included 10 mm dithiothreitol (from the polymerase kits), 4 units of RNase Inhibitor (Ambion), 1× digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.65 mm UTP, 0.35 mm digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science)) and diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water (Ambion). Purification of the digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes was carried out by ammonium acetate precipitation. Probe concentration was determined using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (41Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Development. 1992; 116: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using BM Purple (Roche Applied Science) as the alkaline phosphatase substrate. Light microscopy was carried out using an Olympus SZH10 (Olympus Optical, Hamburg, Germany), and the images were captured via CCD camera (Optronics, Goleta CA). The images were collated using Adobe Photoshop® (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Wild type (IF22) and nullizygous MTHFD2 (IF74) MEFs were donated by Dr. R. E. MacKenzie (McGill University). Both cell lines were grown on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/High medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1× nonessential amino acids (Hyclone), and 200 μm l-glutamine. In addition, for IF22 cells, 3.0 μm thymidine and 30 μm hypoxanthine were added; for IF74 cells, 167 μm sodium formate and 154 μm deoxyuridine monophosphate were added (14Patel H. Pietro E.D. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Patel H. Di Pietro E. Mejia N. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 442: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 on 150-mm plates (Nunc) and divided or harvested at 80–95% confluency. The protocol for labeling is a modification of that described previously (13Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The labeling medium (a gift from Dr. Patrick Stover, Cornell University) was α-minimum essential medium (Hyclone) lacking sodium bicarbonate, folic acid, nucleotides, nucleosides, histidine, serine, glycine, and methionine. Folic acid (4 mg/liter), methionine (10 μm), sodium bicarbonate (2.6 g/liter), [5,5,5-2H3]leucine (100 μm), and [2,3,3-2H3]serine (500 μm) were added to the medium. Dialyzed fetal bovine serum (15%, 1:10 v/v in water) was also added. The cells were trypsinized, resuspended in labeling medium, and plated. The cells were harvested after two or three cell divisions and either used immediately or frozen at −70 °C. Crude protein extracts were prepared by suspending cells in 5% trichloroacetic acid and incubating on ice. Precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation, the supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were suspended in constant boiling 6 n HCl (Pierce) and placed under vacuum in borosilicate tubes. Hydrolysis of proteins was at 110 °C for 20 h. The amino acids were derivatized using ethylchloroformate and trifluoroethanol (42Vatankhah M. Moini M. Biol. Mass Spectrometry. 1994; 23: 277-282Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 43Helgadóttir S. Rosas-Sandoval G. Söll D. Graham D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lyophilized hydrolysate pellet was suspended in 20 μl of water and the pH adjusted to ∼7.0 with ammonium bicarbonate. To this hydrolysate suspension, 100 μl of water (60 parts), trifluoroethanol (32 parts), and pyridine (8 parts) and 5 μl of ethylchloroformate were mixed and incubated for 2–3 min at room temperature. 100 μl of 1% ethylchloroformate in chloroform was added to each sample and mixed, and the phases were allowed to separate. The chloroform phase was removed for mass spectrometric analysis. Derivatized amino acids were subjected to gas chromatography (Agilent 6890N with a SGE BP5 25 meter long column, 0.22 mm I.D. and 0.25 μm film thickness) coupled to a Waters Autospec magnetic sector mass spectrometer. Gas chromatography parameters were as previously published (43Helgadóttir S. Rosas-Sandoval G. Söll D. Graham D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Methionine eluted from the column at ∼7.5 min. The natural abundance for fully derivatized ethylchloroformate/trifluoroethanol-methionine (m/z = 302–308) was determined in non-deuterium-enriched IF22 MEFs by dividing the maximum height of each mass spectra peak by the sum of the heights of all seven peaks. Deuterium enrichment for IF22 and IF74 cell lines were calculated as described elsewhere (44Storch K.J. Wagner D.A. Burke J.F. Young V.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E322-E331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), based on the natural abundances and the heights of peaks in the deuterium-enriched sample peaks. The native cellular natural abundances for MEFs were 1.76% for m/z = 302, 4.22% for m/z = 303, 78.73% for m/z = 304, 9.79% for m/z = 305, 4.91% for m/z = 306, 0.52% for m/z = 307, and 0.07% for m/z = 308. For deuterium-enriched samples, the heights of the methionine mass spectra peaks m/z = 304, 305, 306, and 307 were measured. Resolution of the resulting matrix of equations for singly and doubly deuterated and nondeuterated methionine was achieved using the LINEST function in Microsoft Excel (12Gregory 3rd, J.F. Cuskelly G.J. Shane B. Toth J.P. Baumgartner T.G. Stacpoole P.W. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 72: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mass spectra data were only considered reliable if the relative intensity of the base peak was above 15,000 and below 65,500. Below 15,000, background levels became problematic. Above 65,500, the mass spectrometer detector was saturated. To eliminate outliers caused by instrument error, multiple individual scans within each mass spectra peak were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the JMP® statistical analysis software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All of the p values comparing wild type MEFs (IF22) and MTHFD2-null MEFs (IF74) were calculated using the Student's t test. Intact adult rat liver mitochondria are able to oxidize various 1-C donors to formate without the addition of any other cofactors or substrates (6Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 7García-Martínez L.F. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4671-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial production of formate requires reactions 3m, 2m, and 1m of the folate-dependent pathway (Fig. 1). To determine whether normal embryonic mitochondria possess this pathway, 1-C oxidation assays were performed on mitochondria isolated from mouse embryos at E13.0 and E15.5. In this assay, a radiolabeled 1-C donor is taken up by intact mitochondria and metabolized to formate and CO2 if the complete folate-dependent pathway is functioning. [2-14C]glycine was used because it can only donate 1-C units in mitochondria via the glycine cleavage system (Fig. 1, reaction 5). Formate production was assayed in mitochondria isolated from whole mouse em"
https://openalex.org/W2164992413,"The purpose of the present study was to test the therapeutic efficiency and safety of compacted-DNA nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery into the subretinal space of a juvenile mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. Nanoparticles containing the mouse opsin promoter and wild-type mouse Rds gene were injected subretinally into mice carrying a haploinsufficiency mutation in the retinal degeneration slow (rds+/−) gene at postnatal day (P)5 and 22. Control mice were either injected with saline, injected with uncompacted naked plasmid DNA carrying the Rds gene, or remained untreated. Rds mRNA levels peaked at postinjection day 2 to 7 (PI-2 to PI-7) for P5 injections, stabilized at levels 2-fold higher than in uninjected controls for both P5 and P22 injections, and remained elevated at the latest time point examined (PI-120). Rod function (measured by electroretinography) showed modest but statistically significant improvement compared with controls after both P5 and P22 injections. Cone function in nanoparticle-injected eyes reached wild-type levels for both ages of injections, indicating full prevention of cone degeneration. Ultrastructural examination at PI-120 revealed significant improvement in outer segment structures in P5 nanoparticle-injected eyes, while P22 injection had a modest structural improvement. There was no evidence of macrophage activation or induction of IL-6 or TNF-α mRNA in P5 or P22 nanoparticle-dosed eyes at either PI-2 or PI-30. Thus, compacted-DNA nanoparticles can efficiently and safely drive gene expression in both mitotic and postmitotic photoreceptors and retard degeneration in this model. These findings, using a clinically relevant treatment paradigm, illustrate the potential for application of nanoparticle-based gene replacement therapy for treatment of human retinal degenerations.—Cai, X., Conley, S.

https://openalex.org/W2072910535,"The transcription factor FoxN1 is essential for differentiation of thymic epithelial cell (TEC) progenitors during thymic organogenesis. However, limited information is available on the postnatal contribution of FoxN1 to thymic maintenance. To address this question, we generated a loxP-floxed FoxN1 (fx) mouse with three different promoter-driven inducible CreER(T) transgenes. Postnatal ubiquitous deletion of FoxN1 caused dramatic thymic atrophy in 5 days and more severe deterioration in medullary TECs (mTECs) than in cortical TECs (cTECs). Induction of FoxN1 deletion selectively in K5 promoter-driven somatic epithelial cells (mostly mTECs and possibly some adult epithelial stem cells) was sufficient to cause significant thymic atrophy, whereas FoxN1 deletion in K18 promoter-driven somatic epithelial cells (mostly cTECs) was not. Thymic atrophy resulted from increased apoptosis and was associated with activation of the p53 gene in mature mTECs. Although FoxN1 is required for the development of both mTECs and cTECs in thymic organogenesis, it is most important for the maintenance of mTECs in the postnatal thymus, which are in turn necessary to prevent thymic atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2140470378,"The regulatory pathways necessary for the maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain poorly defined. By using loss-of-function approaches, we report a selective and cell-autonomous requirement for the p300/CBP-binding transcriptional coactivator Cited2 in adult HSC maintenance. Conditional deletion of Cited2 in the adult mouse results in loss of HSCs causing multilineage bone marrow failure and increased lethality. In contrast, conditional ablation of Cited2 after lineage specification in lymphoid and myeloid lineages has no impact on the maintenance of these lineages. Additional deletion of Ink4a/Arf (encoding p16Ink4a and p19Arf) or Trp53 (encoding p53, a downstream target of p19Arf) in a Cited2-deficient background restores HSC functionality and rescues mice from bone marrow failure. Furthermore, we show that the critical role of Cited2 in primitive hematopoietic cells is conserved in humans.

HSCs may remain quiescent, self-renew, undergo apoptosis, or differentiate into multiple blood lineages. Tight regulation of these fates is essential to maintain the adult HSC pool, and studies in mice have revealed some of the key regulators of HSC maintenance.

In this study, we use a conditional knockout strategy to establish a requirement for Cited2 in adult HSCs. Further, we demonstrate a role for CITED2 in human hematopoiesis by RNA interference in CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells. Cited2 expression analysis indicated that it is highly expressed in long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs; Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+(LSK)CD34−Flt3− cells), less abundantly in short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs; LSKCD34+Flt3− cells), and profoundly downregulated in lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs; LSKCD34+Flt3+ cells) (Figure 1A). To investigate a functional requirement for Cited2 in adult hematopoiesis, we generated Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre conditional knockout mice (MacDonald et al., 2008MacDonald S.T. Bamforth S.D. Chen C.M. Farthing C.R. Franklyn A. Broadbent C. Schneider J.E. Saga Y. Lewandoski M. Bhattacharya S. Epiblastic Cited2 deficiency results in cardiac phenotypic heterogeneity and provides a mechanism for haploinsufficiency.Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 79: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in which treatment with poly(I)-poly(C) (pIpC) induces efficient gene deletion in hematopoietic cells (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). We treated Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre and Cited2fl/fl mice with pIpC (Figure 1B) and refer to these as Cited2Δ/Δ and Cited2fl/fl mice, respectively. After Cre-mediated recombination, a lacZ expression cassette comes under the control of the endogenous Cited2 promoter (MacDonald et al., 2008MacDonald S.T. Bamforth S.D. Chen C.M. Farthing C.R. Franklyn A. Broadbent C. Schneider J.E. Saga Y. Lewandoski M. Bhattacharya S. Epiblastic Cited2 deficiency results in cardiac phenotypic heterogeneity and provides a mechanism for haploinsufficiency.Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 79: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and efficient gene deletion was demonstrated by abundant lacZ expression in Cited2Δ/Δ BM cells (Figure S1A available online). Furthermore, Cited2 mRNA was undetectable in Cited2Δ/Δ BM cells (Figure 1C). Within 6 to 15 days after initiation of pIpC treatment, most Cited2Δ/Δ mice became moribund and were sacrificed, in contrast to control mice, which survived normally (Figure S1B). BM analysis revealed severely reduced cellularity in Cited2Δ/Δ mice (Figure 1D) and strikingly reduced frequencies of mature myeloid (Mac-1+Gr-1+) and B-lymphoid (CD19+B220+) cells in Cited2Δ/Δ BM, as compared to control mice (Figure 1E). Conditional loss of Cited2 also reduced T cell frequencies (Figure 1E). These data support an essential role for Cited2 in sustaining adult multilineage hematopoiesis. Mx1-Cre mediates gene deletion in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tissues (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), so we assessed the contribution of Cited2 deletion in nonhematopoietic tissues to morbidity. We transplanted wild-type (WT) BM cells into Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre and Cited2fl/fl mice, and 12 weeks after transplantation, recipients received pIpC. We observed no lethality in either cohort of mice (Figure S1C), indicating that BM failure in Cited2Δ/Δ mice is the primary cause of mortality. The multilineage defects observed in Cited2Δ/Δ mice could reflect a requirement for Cited2 in the maintenance of committed hematopoietic lineages. To test this hypothesis, we used Cd19-Cre, LysM-Cre, and Cd4-Cre strains to delete Cited2 in B cell, myeloid, and T cell lineages, respectively. Cd19-Cre efficiently excised Cited2 in CD19+B220+ cells but did not affect their frequency in the BM (Figure 2A). Likewise, efficient deletion of Cited2 in the myeloid compartment led to lacZ expression in the majority of Mac-1+Gr-1+ cells, but did not alter the frequency of these cells in the BM (Figure 2B). Cd4-Cre efficiently excised Cited2 in T cells but did not change their frequency in the thymus (Figure 2C). Therefore, Cited2 is expendable for the maintenance of these committed lineages. Next, we addressed the impact of Cited2 deletion on HSC and progenitor cell activity. In colony-forming cell (CFC) assays, Cited2Δ/Δ BM cells failed to generate colonies in methylcellulose (Figure 3A). To evaluate HSC activity in vitro, we performed limiting dilution cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assays and found that Cited2Δ/Δ BM completely lacked CAFCs (Figure 3B). To assess HSC activity in vivo, we transplanted CD45.2+ BM cells from Cited2Δ/Δ and Cited2fl/fl control mice (with or without WT CD45.1+ BM competitors) into irradiated congenic CD45.1+ recipients. Without CD45.1+ BM competitors, Cited2Δ/Δ BM cells did not rescue recipient mice from lethal irradiation (data not shown). Furthermore, CD45.2+Cited2Δ/Δ BM cells transplanted with CD45.1+ BM competitor cells did not contribute to multilineage hematopoiesis (Figure 3C). Immunophenotypic analysis of Cited2Δ/Δ BM revealed a near complete loss of cells in the LSK compartment (Figure 3D) that contains LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and LMPPs. The frequency of Lin−Sca-1−c-Kit+ (LK) myeloid progenitor cells was also profoundly decreased in Cited2Δ/Δ mice. To exclude the effects of pIpC-induced Cre-mediated toxicity on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we compared the immunophenotypic and functional properties of HSPCs from Cited2+/+Mx1-Cre and Cited2fl/fl mice and found no apparent differences (Figures S2A–S2D). These data indicate that pIpC-induced Cre activity does not phenocopy Cited2 deletion in HSPCs. The rapid kinetics of HSC loss upon acute deletion of Cited2 suggest a survival defect. To test this, we deleted Cited2 in cultured LSK cells and demonstrated that the rate of apoptosis was markedly increased in Cited2Δ/Δ cells, as compared to WT cells (Figure S2E). Thus, decreased survival of LSK cells underpins the multilineage BM failure observed in Cited2Δ/Δ mice. To independently examine whether loss of Cited2Δ/Δ HSCs is caused by Cited2 deletion specifically in the hematopoietic system, we mixed CD45.2+ BM cells from untreated Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre or Cited2fl/fl mice with CD45.1+ WT BM competitor cells and transplanted them into irradiated recipients. Eight weeks after transplantation, the mice received pIpC and five days after the last dose the percentage of the donor-derived CD45.2+ cells was analyzed in the BM. The percentage of CD45.2+Cited2Δ/Δ cells in LSK and LK compartments was significantly reduced compared to CD45.2+Cited2fl/fl cells (Figure 3E). These data indicate a cell-autonomous requirement for Cited2 in HSC maintenance. The high evolutionary conservation of Cited2 in mammals (Bhattacharya et al., 1999Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Functional role of p35srj, a novel p300/CBP binding protein, during transactivation by HIF-1.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) suggests a conserved role for Cited2 in HSC function. We generated a lentivirus expressing short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting human CITED2 (Figures S3A–S3D) and performed assays to enumerate LTC-ICs, the most primitive human progenitors assessable in vitro. CB CD34+ cells transduced with shRNA and control lentiviruses were cocultured on stromal cells. CITED2 knockdown in CD34+ cells led to a severe reduction in cellularity over time, compared to CD34+ cells transduced with a control lentivirus (Figure S3E). Furthermore, CITED2 knockdown in CD34+ cells strikingly impaired primitive hematopoietic cell activity, as judged by LTC-IC assays (Figure 3F). Thus, our data indicate that CITED2 is a conserved regulator of primitive hematopoietic cell function in mammals. Furthermore, with this Mx1-Cre-independent model system, we corroborate the data obtained in our conditional mouse model. We previously showed that Cited2 null MEFs senesce prematurely and have increased levels of p16Ink4a and p19Arf (Kranc et al., 2003Kranc K.R. Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Norbury C. van Lohuizen M. Bhattacharya S. Transcriptional coactivator Cited2 induces Bmi1 and Mel18 and controls fibroblast proliferation via Ink4a/ARF.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7658-7666Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas ectopic expression of Cited2 represses p16Ink4a and p19Arf, enhancing MEF proliferation. Deletion of Ink4a/Arf or Trp53 (encoding p53, a downstream target of p19Arf), rescued defective proliferation in Cited2−/− MEFs (Figure S4A; Kranc et al., 2003Kranc K.R. Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Norbury C. van Lohuizen M. Bhattacharya S. Transcriptional coactivator Cited2 induces Bmi1 and Mel18 and controls fibroblast proliferation via Ink4a/ARF.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7658-7666Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ink4a/Arf and Trp53 are essential in maintaining HSC function (Akala et al., 2008Akala O.O. Park I.K. Qian D. Pihalja M. Becker M.W. Clarke M.F. Long-term haematopoietic reconstitution by Trp53−/−p16Ink4a−/−p19Arf−/− multipotent progenitors.Nature. 2008; 453: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), so we hypothesized their involvement in the loss of Cited2Δ/Δ HSCs. Consistent with this, Cited2 deletion in LSK cells resulted in an increased expression of p19Arf and p53 proteins and a p53 target gene Cdkn1a (Figures S4B–S4D). Next, we generated Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre Trp53+/−, Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre Trp53−/−, Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre Ink4a/Arf+/−, and control mice and treated them with pIpC. Q-PCR confirmed that Cited2 was not expressed in Cited2Δ/Δ BM cells, regardless of Ink4a/Arf and Trp53 status (Figure S4E). Deletion of one Ink4a/Arf allele or one or two alleles of Trp53 restored total BM cellularity in Cited2Δ/Δ mice to the levels observed in Cited2fl/fl control mice (Figures 4A and 1D). Ablation of one allele of Trp53 also rescued B cell and myeloid development in Cited2Δ/Δ BM (Figure 4B). Furthermore, deletion of one allele of Ink4a/Arf or one or two alleles of Trp53 restored BM Cited2Δ/Δ LSK cells (Figure 4C). BM cells from Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53+/−, Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53−/−, and Cited2Δ/ΔInk4a/Arf+/−, but not Cited2Δ/Δ, mice efficiently generated multilineage colonies in methylcellulose (Figure 4D). After confirming that Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53+/−, Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53−/−, and Cited2Δ/ΔInk4a/Arf+/− cells from primary colonies lacked Cited2 expression, we demonstrated efficient generation of secondary colonies (data not shown). To examine whether HSCs lacking both Cited2 and Trp53 have long-term repopulating capacity, we transplanted Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53+/+, Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53−/−, and Cited2fl/+Trp53−/− total BM cells (mixed with WT support BM cells) into irradiated recipients and analyzed peripheral blood (PB) 16 weeks after transplantation. Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53+/+ BM cells failed to repopulate recipients (Figure 4E), whereas BM cells lacking both Cited2 and Trp53 repopulated recipients to a similar extent as those lacking Trp53 with intact Cited2. To corroborate this, we transplanted BM cells from untreated Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre Trp53+/+ and Cited2fl/flMx1-Cre Trp53+/− mice into irradiated recipients (Figure 4F). After reconstitution, the recipients were treated with pIpC and analyzed 8 weeks after administration of the last dose. We measured the percentage of donor cell chimerism in PB nucleated cells or myeloid cells of recipients by using lacZ as a marker of Cited2-deficient cells. Whereas Cited2Δ/ΔTrp53+/+ cells failed to sustain hematopoiesis, those lacking Cited2 and one allele of Trp53 showed significant donor-derived contribution (Figure 4G). Together, these data provide genetic evidence that the loss of HSCs in Cited2Δ/Δ mice is, at least in part, mediated by Ink4a/Arf and Trp53. In this report, we investigate the requirement for Cited2 in adult HSCs maintenance and committed hematopoietic lineages. By using an inducible conditional knockout approach in adult mice, we demonstrate that Cited2 deletion results in an acute loss of HSCs, at least in part via apoptosis, subsequently causing multilineage BM failure. Specific deletion of Cited2 within the hematopoietic system demonstrates a cell-autonomous requirement for Cited2 in maintaining adult HSC integrity, whereas deleting Cited2 in committed lymphoid and myeloid lineages has no impact. Furthermore, CITED2 knockdown in human CD34+CB reveals a conserved requirement for Cited2 in HSC maintenance. Together, our data provide evidence that Cited2 functions in a cell-autonomous manner to maintain HSCs. Genetic evidence indicates that the tumor suppressors Ink4a/Arf and Trp53 regulate multiple HSC fate decisions (Akala et al., 2008Akala O.O. Park I.K. Qian D. Pihalja M. Becker M.W. Clarke M.F.

Med. 2006; 203: 2247-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). One function of p19Arf is to stabilize p53 (Pomerantz et al., 1998Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. et al.The Ink4a tumor suppressor gene product, p19Arf, interacts with MDM2 and neutralizes MDM2's inhibition of p53.Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar), and the activation of the p19Arf-p53 pathway results in loss of HSCs (Park et al., 2003Park I.K. Qian D. Kiel M. Becker M.W. Pihalja M. Weissman I.L. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Bmi-1 is required for maintenance of adult self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2003; 423: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). We showed that loss of Cited2 increased p19Arf and p53 expression in the LSK compartment. Based on this observation, we used a genetic rescue approach to test whether Ink4a/Arf and Trp53 are required for loss of HSCs lacking Cited2. Our results demonstrated that deletion of Ink4a/Arf or Trp53 restored functionality of HSCs lacking Cited2, implying that Cited2 maintains HSCs, at least in part, via Ink4a/Arf and Trp53. These data support the postulate that deletion of Cited2 in HSCs results in activation of the p19ARF-p53 pathway and thereby leads to their loss. It is of interest to relate Cited2 to other critical regulators of HSC maintenance. Cited2 is required for Bmi-1 expression in MEFs (Kranc et al., 2003Kranc K.R. Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Norbury C. van Lohuizen M. Bhattacharya S. Transcriptional coactivator Cited2 induces Bmi1 and Mel18 and controls fibroblast proliferation via Ink4a/ARF.Mol. Cell.

Cited2 is required for normal hematopoiesis in the murine fetal liver.Blood. 2007; 110: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bmi-1 maintains HSCs (Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003Lessard J. Sauvageau G.

Bmi-1 is required for maintenance of adult self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2003; 423: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) and directly represses Ink4a/Arf (Bracken et al., 2007Bracken A.P.

Iwama A. Morita Y. Kamijo T. van Lohuizen M. Nakauchi H. Differential impact of Ink4a and Arf on hematopoietic stem cells and their bone marrow microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2247-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or Trp53 (Akala et al., 2008Akala O.O. Park I.K. Qian D. Pihalja M. Becker M.W. Clarke M.F. Long-term haematopoietic reconstitution by Trp53−/−p16Ink4a−/−p19Arf−/− multipotent progenitors.Nature. 2008; 453: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) restores Bmi-1−/− HSC function. Genetic evidence indicates distinct roles for Bmi-1 and Cited2 in HSC fate decisions. Whereas Bmi-1 mediates HSC self-renewal, our results are compatible with a requirement for Cited2 in HSC survival. In agreement with this, acute Cited2 deletion in HSCs does not affect the expression of Bmi-1 (data not shown), suggesting that downregulation of Bmi-1 expression is not responsible for the loss of Cited2Δ/Δ HSCs. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Cited2 controls Bmi-1 in other contexts in HSCs. Conditional deletion of Cited2 generates a stem cell phenotype reminiscent of conditional inactivation of Tel/Etv6 and Mcl-1 (Hock et al., 2004Hock H. Meade E. Medeiros S. Schindler J.W. Valk P.J. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H.

Obligate role of anti-apoptotic MCL-1 in the survival of hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 2005; 307: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Like Tel/Etv6 (Hock et al., 2004Hock H. Meade E. Medeiros S. Schindler J.W. Valk P.J. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Tel/Etv6 is an essential and selective regulator of adult hematopoietic stem cell survival.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), Cited2 appears to be selectively required for HSC maintenance, but dispensable for mature lineages. Mcl-1, however, also plays critical roles in mature T and B cell survival (Opferman et al., 2003Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Development and maintenance of B and T lymphocytes requires antiapoptotic MCL-1.Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), revealing a broader spectrum of hematopoietic function than Cited2. Conditional deletion of Apc and combined deficiency of c-Myc and N-Myc (but not ablation of N-Myc alone) results in loss of HSCs (Laurenti et al., 2008Laurenti E. Varnum-Finney B. Wilson A. Ferrero I. Blanco-Bose W.E. Ehninger A. Knoepfler P.S. Cheng P.F. MacDonald H.R. Eisenman R.N. et al.Hematopoietic stem cell function and survival depend on c-Myc and N-Myc activity.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 611-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, Qian et al., 2008Qian Z. Chen L. Fernald A.A. Williams B.O. Le Beau M.M. A critical role for Apc in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell survival.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2163-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the expression of Apc and c-Myc is unaltered in Cited2-deficient HSCs, the expression of N-myc is decreased (data not shown). Although this observation alone does not explain the loss of Cited2-deficient HSCs, N-Myc may mediate some functions of Cited2 in HSCs. Finally, Cited2 binds p300 and its paralog CBP (Bhattacharya et al., 1999Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Functional role of p35srj, a novel p300/CBP binding protein, during transactivation by HIF-1.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although Cbp is essential for adult HSC maintenance, p300 appears dispensable for HSC maintenance but required for multilineage hematopoietic differentiation (Kung et al., 2000Kung A.L. Rebel V.I. Bronson R.T. Ch'ng L.E. Sieff C.A. Livingston D.M. Yao T.P. Gene dose-dependent control of hematopoiesis and hematologic tumor suppression by CBP.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 272-277PubMed Google Scholar, Rebel et al., 2002Rebel V.I. Kung A.L. Tanner E.A. Yang H.

USA. 2002; 99: 14789-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to clarify the roles of Cbp-Cited2 and p300-Cited2 interactions in adult HSC maintenance and hematopoiesis, and the relationship between Cited2 and other critical stem cell regulators remains an open question meriting future investigation. In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence that Cited2 is an essential and cell-autonomous regulator of adult mammalian HSC maintenance. Our data, together with the sufficiency of Cited2 to maintain undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (Pritsker et al., 2006Pritsker M. Ford N.R. Jenq H.T. Lemischka I.R. Genomewide gain-of-function genetic screen identifies functionally active genes in mouse embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6946-6951Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggest that it is a critical master regulator of stem cell fate. Understanding Cited2 functions at the molecular level will offer insights into the similarities and differences in the transcriptional circuitry of embryonic and somatic stem cells. We backcrossed Cited2fl/fl and Cited2+/− mice (Bamforth et al., 2001Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S.

Mx1-Cre, Cd19-Cre, and LysM-Cre mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Cd4-Cre mice were purchased from Taconic. Ink4a/Arf+/− and Trp53+/− mice were obtained from B. Hassan and M. van Lohuizen, respectively. All experiments on animals were performed under UK Home Office authorization. 8- to 12-week-old mice received five to six intraperitoneal injections of pIpC (GE Healthcare; 0.2–0.3 mg per dose) every alternate day. Deletion efficiency was determined by Q-PCR or lacZ expression analysis (via a FluoReporter lacZ Flow Cytometry Kit, Invitrogen). Stromal layers were prepared from the BM of C57BL/6J mice, irradiated at 15 Gy, and subcultured in 96-well flat-bottom plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. After 1 to 7 days, cultures were seeded at 2-fold dilutions (2.9 × 105−18,125 per well) of nucleated BM cells from each genotype. CAFCs were scored at week 5. H4434 and M3434 media (StemCell Technologies) were used to enumerate human and mouse colony-forming cells, respectively. Two replicates were used per group in each experiment. Colonies were tallied at day 10–14. RNA extraction and Q-PCR reactions were performed as previously described (Mansson et al., 2007Mansson R. Hultquist A. Luc S. Yang L. Anderson K. Kharazi S. Al-Hashmi S. Liuba K. Thoren L.

For specific TaqMan Assays-on-Demand probes used, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System in normal mode for 50 cycles. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Differences in input cDNA were normalized with a combination of Hprt, Gapdh, Actb, Ubc, and B2m expression with qBase 1.3.5 software (http://medgen.ugent.be/qbase/). CITED2 shRNA was subcloned from the pLKO.1 puro vector (Open Biosystems) into the pLKO.1 GFP vector (gift from J. Larsson). Lentivirus production and transduction of human CD34+ CB cells are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. CB CD34+ cells (StemCell Technologies) were isolated by MiniMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) selection. After transduction, 3 × 104 cells were cultured on MS5 stromal cells in Long-Term Culture medium (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Cultures were demidepopulated weekly for analysis. LTC-IC numbers were enumerated by overlaying MS5 stromal cocultures at week 5 with H4434 medium, followed by counting colonies 2 weeks later. All samples were analyzed on a CyAn ADP flow cytometer (Dako). Sorts were performed on FACSAriaIIu (BD) or MoFlow (Dako) cell sorters.

https://openalex.org/W2036730547,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, particularly with relation to cancer cell invasion and metastasis. NO can reversibly couple to cysteine thiols to form an S-nitrosothiol, which regulates the enzymatic activities of target proteins. c-Src is a tyrosine kinase that promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, c-Src can be activated by NO stimulation. However, mechanisms by which NO stimulates Src kinase activity have not been elucidated. We report here that NO causes S-nitrosylation of c-Src at cysteine 498 (Cys(498)) to stimulate its kinase activity. Cys(498) is conserved among Src family kinases, and Cys(506) of c-Yes, which corresponds to Cys(498) of c-Src, was also important for the NO-mediated activation of c-Yes. Estrogens may work synergistically with NO to induce the proliferation and migration of many kinds of breast cancer cells. For example, beta-estradiol induces the expression of endothelial nitric synthase and production of NO in MCF7 cells. We found that activation of c-Src in MCF7 cells by beta-estradiol stimulation was mediated by the S-nitrosylation of Cys(498). In addition, we report that disruption of E-cadherin junctions and enhancement of cell invasion by beta-estradiol stimulation was mediated by NO-dependent activation of c-Src. These results identify a novel signaling pathway that links NO and Src family kinases to cancer cell invasion and metastasis."

They are found in all cell compartments of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, being implicated in the major proteolytic events of cell survival, defense, growth, and development. We present a new approach for the fast and reliable evaluation of the substrate specificity of individual aminopeptidases. Using solid phase chemistry with the 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin fluorophore, we have synthesized a library of 61 individual natural and unnatural amino acids substrates, chosen to cover a broad spectrum of the possible interactions in the S1 pocket of this type of protease. As proof of concept, we determined the substrate specificity of human, pig, and rat orthologs of aminopeptidase N (CD13), a highly conserved cell surface protease that inactivates enkephalins and other bioactive peptides. Our data reveal a large and hydrophobic character for the S1 pocket of aminopeptidase N that is conserved with aminopeptidase Ns. Our approach, which can be applied in principle to all aminopeptidases, yields useful information for the design of specific inhibitors, and more importantly, reveals a relationship between the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the kinetics of enzyme inhibition."

The recent finding of a TCA binding site in the extracellular vestibule of the bacterial leucine transporter 11 Å above the central site has prompted debate about whether this vestibular site in the bacterial transporter is applicable to binding of antidepressants to their relevant physiological target, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT). We present an experimentally validated structural model of imipramine and analogous TCAs in the central substrate binding site of hSERT. Two possible binding modes were observed from induced fit docking calculations. We experimentally validated a single binding mode by combining mutagenesis of hSERT with uptake inhibition studies of different TCA analogs according to the paired mutation ligand analog complementation paradigm. Using this experimental method, we identify a salt bridge between the tertiary aliphatic amine and Asp98. Furthermore, the 7-position of the imipramine ring is found vicinal to Phe335, and the pocket lined by Ala173 and Thr439 is utilized by 3-substituents. These protein-ligand contact points unambiguously orient the TCA within the central binding site and reveal differences between substrate binding and inhibitor binding, giving important clues to the inhibition mechanism. Consonant with the well established competitive inhibition of uptake by TCAs, the resulting binding site for TCAs in hSERT is fully overlapping with the serotonin binding site in hSERT and dissimilar to the low affinity noncompetitive TCA site reported in the leucine transporter (LeuT).

Glutathione, the most abundant low molecular weight thiol, is considered the major cellular redox buffer in most cells. To better understand how cells maintain glutathione redox homeostasis, cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were treated with extracellular oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the effect on intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and GSSG were monitored over time. Intriguingly cells lacking GLR1 encoding the GSSG reductase in S. cerevisiae accumulated increased levels of GSH via a mechanism independent of the GSH biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, residual NADPH-dependent GSSG reductase activity was found in lysate derived from glr1 cell. The cytosolic thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system and not the glutaredoxins (Grx1p, Grx2p, Grx6p, and Grx7p) contributes to the reduction of GSSG. Overexpression of the thioredoxins TRX1 or TRX2 in glr1 cells reduced GSSG accumulation, increased GSH levels, and reduced cellular glutathione Eh′. Conversely, deletion of TRX1 or TRX2 in the glr1 strain led to increased accumulation of GSSG, reduced GSH levels, and increased cellular Eh′. Furthermore, it was found that purified thioredoxins can reduce GSSG to GSH in the presence of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH in a reconstituted in vitro system. Collectively, these data indicate that the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system can function as an alternative system to reduce GSSG in S. cerevisiae in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1975319165,"Venom-derived peptide modulators of ion channel gating are regarded as essential tools for understanding the molecular motions that occur during the opening and closing of ion channels. In this study, we present the characterization of five spider toxins on 12 human voltage-gated ion channels, following observations about the target promiscuity of some spider toxins and the ongoing revision of their ""canonical"" gating-modifying mode of action. The peptides were purified de novo from the venom of Grammostola rosea tarantulas, and their sequences were confirmed by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry analysis. Their effects on seven tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) channels, the three human ether-à-go-go (hERG)-related K(+) channels, and two human Shaker-related K(+) channels were extensively characterized by electrophysiological techniques. All the peptides inhibited ion conduction through all the Na(+) channels tested, although with distinctive patterns. The peptides also affected the three pharmaceutically relevant hERG isoforms differently. At higher concentrations, all peptides also modified the gating of the Na(+) channels by shifting the activation to more positive potentials, whereas more complex effects were recorded on hERG channels. No effects were evident on the two Shaker-related K(+) channels at concentrations well above the IC(50) value for the affected channels. Given the sequence diversity of the tested peptides, we propose that tarantula toxins should be considered both as multimode and target-promiscuous ion channel modulators; both features should not be ignored when extracting mechanistic interpretations about ion channel gating. Our observations could also aid in future structure-function studies and might help the development of novel ion channel-specific drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2072966398,"The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), activated by either TSH or the newly discovered glycoprotein hormone thyrostimulin, plays a central role in the control of body metabolism. Interestingly, in addition to its thyroid expression, we discovered that the mRNA level of TSHR is periodically regulated in rat ovary by gonadotropins. Ovarian microdissection followed by real-time PCR analysis indicated that granulosa cells show the highest level of TSHR expression. Cultures of follicles and primary granulosa cells demonstrated that the level of TSHR is up-regulated and decreased by the gonadotropin-driven cAMP cascade and estradiol production, respectively. Furthermore, in contrast to the negligible expression of TSH in the ovary, we also found by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis that thyrostimulin is expressed mainly in oocytes. Evolving before the appearance of gonadotropins, thyrostimulin is considered the most ancestral glycoprotein hormone. Therefore, the presence of thyrostimulin in the ovary suggests that it may have a primitive function in reproduction when it activates ovarian TSHR. Next, we generated recombinant thyrostimulin protein and characterized its non-covalent heterodimeric nature. Using purified recombinant thyrostimulin, we show that the human ovarian cell line NIH:OVCAR-3 also expresses endogenous and functional TSHR. Using cultured rat granulosa cells isolated from different ovarian stages, we found that treatments with thyrostimulin significantly increase cAMP production and the c-fos gene response in the presence of gonadotropins. Thus, this study demonstrates that oocyte-derived thyrostimulin and granulosa cell-expressed TSHR compose a novel paracrine system in the ovary, where the activity is tightly controlled by gonadotropins."
https://openalex.org/W2075736183,"A new HPLC method was developed to separate linear from β(1–6)-branched β(1–3)-glucooligosaccharides. This methodology has permitted the isolation of the first fungal β(1–6)/β(1–3)-glucan branching transglycosidase using a cell wall autolysate of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). The encoding gene, AfBGT2 is an ortholog of AfBGT1, another transglycosidase of A. fumigatus previously analyzed (Mouyna, I., Hartland, R.

Both enzymes release laminaribiose from the reducing end of a β(1–3)-linked oligosaccharide and transfer the remaining chain to another molecule of the original substrate. The AfBgt1p transfer occurs at C-6 of the non-reducing end group of the acceptor, creating a kinked β(1–3;1–6) linear molecule.

The fungal cell wall is a highly dynamic essential organelle that protects the organism from external stress and accounts for 20 to 40% of the cellular dry weight (1Latgé J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). It is a rigid but permeable structure mainly composed of fibrillar (β-glucans, chitin) or amorphous (α-glucans, mannans) polysaccharides. The central core of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall is composed of β(1–3)/β(1–6)-branched glucan chains on which other polysaccharides (chitin and galactomannan, β(1–3)/(1–4)-glucan) are cross-linked (2Fontaine T. Simenel C. Dubreucq G. Adam O. Delepierre M. Lemoine J. Vorgias C.E. Diaquin M. Latgé J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27594-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The chitin-β(1–6)-branched β(1–3)-glucan complex is found in almost all yeast and filamentous fungi and is thought to be responsible for cell wall stability. β(1–3)-Glucans are synthesized by a plasma membrane-bound glucan synthase complex, which uses UDP-glucose as a substrate and extrudes linear chains through the membrane (3Beauvais A. Drake R. Ng K. Diaquin M. Latgé J.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Once these glucans reach the cell wall space, they have to become β(1–6) branched before they can serve as an anchor for other polysaccharides. The first known β(1–3)-glucanosyltransferase family of A. fumigatus (Gelp) splits a β(1–3)-glucan chain internally and transfers the newly generated reducing end to the non-reducing end of another β(1–3)-glucan molecule through a β(1–3) linkage, resulting in elongation of the glucan chain (4Hartland R.P.

The second family of β(1–3)-glucanosyltransferases contains AfBgt1p of A. fumigatus and Bgl2p of S. cerevisiae. These glucanosyltransferases catalyze the release of a laminaribiose unit from the reducing end of a substrate and transfer the newly generated reducing end to the non-reducing end of another β(1–3)-glucan molecule, generating a new β(1–6) linkage (10Goldman R.C.

Methylation analysis was done on the borodeuteride-reduced G3 using the NaOH procedure (20Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Permethylated sample was analyzed by GC-MS after trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis, reduction, and peracetylation. β(1–3)-Glucanase activity was measured by reducing sugar assay using the p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide reagent with borohydride-reduced laminarin as previously described (4Hartland R.P.

The presence of branching activity was assayed by incubating enzyme fractions in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, at 37 °C with soluble non-reduced linear β(1–3)-glucans (4 mg/ml final concentration) in a final volume of 40 μl for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 80 μl of a solution of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v). After drying under vacuum, the material was solubilized in 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.2, and 10 μl of a Lam-A (specific activity: 10 μmol of equivalent glucose/ml/min) (14Zverlov V.V. Volkov I.Y. Velikodvorskaya T.V. Schwarz W.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1701-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation at 45 °C, digested products were analyzed by HPAEC as described below. To characterize transfer products, reduced laminarioligosaccharides (rG5, rG6, rG7, rG8, rG10, and rG12) were incubated at 3 mm final concentration with 0.05 μg of recombinant enzyme in 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 37 °C. Enzymatic products were analyzed by HPAEC. For a complete characterization of products, 6 mg of reduced laminarihexaose (rG6) was incubated in the same conditions for 2 h. Transfer products were purified by gel filtration on a TSK-HW40S column (TosoHaas, 90 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated in 0.25% acetic acid at the flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Oligosaccharides were detected by a refractometric detector. Separated fractions were freeze-dried and analyzed by MALDI-TOF, methylation, and NMR. Methylation was performed with the NaOH procedure (20Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). The Lam-A digests were analyzed on a CarboPAC-PA1 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using NaOH (50 mm) and sodium acetate (500 mm) in 50 mm NaOH as eluent A and B, respectively. The column was pre-equilibrated for 20 min in 98%A + 2%B. Following sample injection, a gradient run (flow rate 1 ml/min) was performed as follows: 0–2 min, isocratic step (95% A + 2% B), 2–15 min 98% A + 2% B − 80% A + 20% B; 15–22 min 80% A + 20% B − 57% A + 43% B; 22–23 min 57% A + 43% B − 100% B; and 23–25 min 100% B. Samples were detected on a pulsed electrochemical detector. Transfer products obtained after enzymatic reaction were analyzed by HPAEC on a CarboPAC-PA200 column (3.2 × 250 mm). The same eluents were used in the following condition, a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min and a gradient run: 0–2 min, isocratic step (95% A + 2% B), 2–15 min, 98% A + 2% B − 65% A + 35% B; 15–35 min, 65% A + 35% B − 40% A + 60% B; 35–37 min, 40% A + 60% B − 100% B; and 37–40 min, 100% B. Reduced laminarioligosaccharides were purified on a semipreparative CarboPAC-PA1 column (9 × 250 mm). The same eluents are used in the following conditions: flow rate of 4 ml/min and a gradient run: 0–2 min, isocratic step (90% A + 10% B); 2–20 min, 90% A + 10% B − 60% A + 40% B; 20–45 min, 60% A + 40% B − 40% A + 60% B; 45–50 min, 40% A + 60% B − 100% B; and 50–51 min, 100% B. GC and GC-MS was performed on a Perichrom PR2100 instrument and on an Automass II apparatus (Finigan) coupled to a CarloErba gas chromatograph (model 8000top) as previously described (21Fontaine T. Lamarre C. Simenel C. Lambou K. Coddeville B. Delepierre M. Latgé J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344: 1960-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager Elite DE-STR mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a gridless delayed extraction ion source. The spectrometer was operated in positive reflectron mode as previously described (22Aimanianda V. Clavaud C. Simenel C. Fontaine T. Delepierre M. Latgé J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13401-13412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were acquired at 288 K on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenically cooled triple resonance 1H{13C/15N} pulsed field gradient probe. Samples were dissolved in 420 μl of D2O (99.97% 2H atoms, Euriso-top, CEA, Saclay, France) and transferred in a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi Inc., Allison Park, PA). 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to external 2.2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (23Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Intraglycosidic residue nuclei were first assigned as previously described (2Fontaine T. Simenel C. Dubreucq G. Adam O. Delepierre M. Lemoine J. Vorgias C.E. Diaquin M. Latgé J.P. J. Biol.

Then, 1H,1H coupling constants were extracted from one- and/or two-dimensional spectra (1H resolution of 0.1 and 0.6 Hz, respectively). The anomeric configuration was established from knowledge of the 3J1,2 value. Finally, interglycosidic linkages were established via through-space dipolar interactions using a 1H-1H ROESY experiment (mixing time of 250 ms) (24Kessler H. Griesinger C. Kerssebaum R. Wagner K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 607-609Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and/or via multiple bond 1H-13C correlations using a 1H-13C gradient-selected heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment (long range delay of 60 ms) (25Willker W. Leibfritz D. Kerssebaum R. Bermel W. Magn. Reson. 1993; 31: 287-292Google Scholar). The amount of transfer product was measured by the integration of the branched glucan area analyzed by HPAEC after Lam-A digestion of the Bgt2p reaction products. The pH optimum was studied by incubation of 0.2 μg of recombinant protein with 20 mg/ml of laminarioligosaccharides in 40 μl of 125 mm sodium citrate buffer in pH range 3 to 9 at 37 °C for 30 min. Temperature optimum was estimated by incubation of 0.2 μg of recombinant protein with 20 mg/ml of laminarioligosaccharides in 40 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, in the temperature range of 4 to 65 °C for 15 min. Specific activities and Km were estimated by incubation of 0.075 μg of recombinant protein in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37 °C for 30 min with a substrate range concentration of 1 to 12 mg/ml. The cassettes for deleting AfBGT2 and AfBGT1 genes were constructed by PCR fusion with the method described by Lamarre et al. (26Lamarre C. Ibrahim-Granet O. Du C. Calderone R. Latgé J.P. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2007; 44: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The resistance marker used to replace AfBGT2 was the HPH gene of E. coli coding for hygromycin B phosphotransferase obtained from the pAN7-1 plasmid (27Punt P.J. Oliver R.P. Dingemanse M.A. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. Gene. 1987; 56: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Site-specific recombination was ensured by association of ∼1.4-kb upstream and 1.3-kb downstream AfBGT2 flanking fragments. In a first PCR round (supplemental Fig. S1) flanking region 1 (amplicon 1, primers Bgt2A-Bgt2B), flanking region 2 (amplicon 2, primers Bgt2E-Bgt2F), and the HPH gene (amplicon 3, primers Bgt2C-Bgt2D) were amplified, respectively, from wild type DNA template and pAN7.1 with the primers cited in supplemental Table S1. Thirty cycles consisting of a 30-s 95 °C melting step and a 3-min 68 °C annealing/extension step were performed (Advantage 2 polymerase, Clontech). Primers B, C, D, and E were 60-bp chimeric oligonucleotides, containing at the 5′-end a reverse complement sequence (B with C and D with E) for fusion PCR. The obtained PCR products were gel-purified and used for a second PCR step that allowed fusion of these three separate fragments by using Bgt2A and Bgt2F primers. The PCR conditions were the same as described above except at a 6-min elongation step. The resulting PCR was purified and used to transform A. fumigatus conidia. The BLE gene, coding for phleomycin resistance, was used as a resistance marker and amplified from the pAN8-1 to delete the AfBGT1 gene (28Mattern I.E. Punt P.J. Van den Hondel C.A.M.J.J. Fungal Genet. Newslett. 1988; 35: 25Google Scholar). Site-specific recombination was ensured by association of an ∼1-kb upstream and 1.1-kb downstream BGT1 flanking fragment. Primers Bgt1A and Bgt1B were used to amplify the first flanking region, primers Bgt1E and Bgt1F to amplify the second flanking region, and primers Bgt1C and Bgt1D to amplify thd BLE gene. To perform the PCR fusion step primers Bgt1A and Bgt1F were used. The fusion PCR product (1 to 2 μg) was used to transform A. fumigatus CEA17ku80Δ conidia by the electroporation method described by Sanchez and Aguirre (29Sanchez O. Aguirre J. Fungal Genet. Newslett. 1996; 43: 48-51Google Scholar) with subsequent modifications. Conidia from the CEA17ku80Δ strain were washed five times with water and 109 conidia were inoculated in 125 ml of YG medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% glucose) and incubated at 37 °C at 300 rpm for 4 h. Conidia were recovered by centrifugation, washed with water, inoculated in 12.5 ml of YG medium (1% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C at 100 rpm. Conidia were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of cold 1 m sorbitol. One to 2 μg of DNA was added to 50 μl of conidial suspension, incubated for 15 min on ice, and transferred to 0.1-cm electroporation cuvettes. Electroporation was performed using the Bio-Rad gene pulser (Gene Pulser Xcell) with the following parameters: voltage, 1 kV; capacitance, 25 microfarads; and resistance, 400 Ω. After transformation, 1 ml of cold YG medium was added to the cuvette, conidia were transferred to a 10-ml sterile tube and incubated on ice for 15 min. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C at 100 rpm for 1 h and 30 min. Conidia were plated on minimal medium (500 μl/9-cm diameter Petri dish) and incubated at 20 °C overnight. Hygromycin (150 μg/ml) or phleomycin (20 μg/ml) were added in a 10-ml overlay of minimal medium + 0.7% agarose, to allow transformants selection, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Genomic DNAs from hygromycin- or phleomycin-resistant transformants and the parental strain were isolated as described by Girardin et al. (30Girardin H. Latgé J.P. Srikantha T. Morrow B. Soll D.R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To check integration of the HPH cassette at the AfBGT2 locus, DNA of the CEA17ku80Δ and Afbgt2 mutant strains were digested with XbaI and HindIII restriction enzymes (Roche Applied Science) and verified by Southern blot analysis with probes corresponding to the second flanking region. To analyze integration of the BLE cassette at the AfBGT1 locus in the Afbgt2 mutant, DNA of CEA17ku80Δ and the transformants were digested by XbaI and HindIII to check the AfBGT2 interruption and HindIII/EcoRI to check AfBGT1 interruption and verified by Southern blot analysis with a PCR product corresponding to the second flanking region as probe. Conidial germination and mycelial growth were analyzed on medium of a different composition (1% yeast extract + 3% glucose medium, Sabouraud, minimal medium, and RPMI medium) in 2% agar or liquid medium, at 20, 30, 37, or 50 °C, in the absence or presence of sorbitol (0.5 to 2 m), at different pH values (5, 7, and 9). The effect of the drugs tested was as described previously (9Mouyna I. Morelle W. Vai M. Monod M. Léchenne B. Fontaine T. Beauvais A. Sarfati J. Prévost M.C. Henry C. Latgé J.P. Mol.

After 24 h growth at 37 °C in Sabouraud medium, mycelium of wild type and the Afbgt2 mutant strain were filtered on a Buchner funnel and extensively washed with water. Mycelium was broken during 2 min with 1-mm diameter glass beads and 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, in a 50-ml Falcon vial with a Fast-prep apparatus (MP). After protein extraction (2% SDS, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 100 °C for 10 min), alkali-soluble and insoluble fractions of the cell wall were prepared as previously described (11Mouyna I.

Neutral hexoses and hexosamines from the cell wall were estimated by phenol/sulfuric acid and dimethylaminobenzaldehyde colorimetric assays, respectively (31Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K.

Monosaccharides were identified by GC as alditol acetates obtained after hydrolysis (4 n trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 4 h, or 8 n HCl, 3 h, 100 °C) (33Sawaredker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 37: 1602-1604Google Scholar). Branching of cell wall β(1–3)-glucan was estimated by HPAEC after laminarinase A digestion of the alkali-insoluble fraction. 50 μg of alkali-insoluble fraction were digested by Lam-A (10 μl at 10 μmol/min/ml) in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.2, and incubated for 24 h at 45 °C. The β(1–3)-glucan amount was estimated by Lam-A digestion and the p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide reagent for detection (4Hartland R.P. Fontaine T. Debeaupuis J.P. Simenel C. Delepierre M. Latgé J.P.

A detailed understanding of this process and the atheroprotective role of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) requires knowledge of the structure and dynamics of these various particles. This study, combining computation with experimentation, illuminates structural features of apoA-I allowing it to incorporate varying amounts of PL. Molecular dynamics simulated annealing of PL-rich HDL models containing unesterified cholesterol results in double belt structures with the same general saddle-shaped conformation of both our previous molecular dynamics simulations at 310 K and the x-ray structure of lipid-free apoA-I. Conversion from a discoidal to a saddle-shaped particle involves loss of helicity and formation of loops in opposing antiparallel parts of the double belt. During surface expansion caused by the temperature-jump step, the curved palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer surfaces approach planarity. Relaxation back into saddle-shaped structures after cool down and equilibration further supports the saddle-shaped particle model.

https://openalex.org/W2081625118,"ApoER2 and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor transmit the Reelin signal into target cells of the central nervous system. To a certain extent, both receptors can compensate for each other, and only the loss of both receptors results in the reeler phenotype, which is characterized by a gross defect in the architecture of laminated brain structures. Nevertheless, both receptors also have specific distinct functions, as corroborated by analyses of the subtle phenotypes displayed in mice lacking either ApoER2 or VLDL receptor. The differences in their function(s), however, have not been defined at the cellular level. Here, using a panel of chimeric receptors, we demonstrate that endocytosis of Reelin and the fate of the individual receptors upon stimulation are linked to their specific sorting to raft versus non-raft domains of the plasma membrane. VLDL receptor residing in the non-raft domain endocytoses and destines Reelin for degradation via the clathrin-coated pit/clathrin-coated vesicle/endosome pathway without being degraded to a significant extent. Binding of Reelin to ApoER2, a resident of rafts, leads to the production of specific receptor fragments with specific functions of their own and to degradation of ApoER2 via lysosomes. These features contribute to a receptor-specific fine tuning of the Reelin signal, leading to a novel model that emphasizes negative feedback loops specifically mediated by ApoER2 and VLDL receptor, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2091697765,"In mammals, NRF-2 (nuclear respiratory factor 2), also named GA-binding protein, is an Ets family transcription factor that controls many genes involved in cell cycle progression and protein synthesis as well as in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this paper, we analyzed the role of NRF-2 in the regulation of human genes involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. By a combination of bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we found that the factor binds in vitro and in vivo to the proximal promoter region of the genes coding for the transcription termination factor mTERF, the RNA polymerase POLRMT, the B subunit of the DNA polymerase-gamma, the DNA helicase TWINKLE, and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein mtSSB. The role of NRF-2 in modulating the expression of those genes was further established by RNA interference and overexpression strategies. On the contrary, we found that NRF-2 does not control the genes for the subunit A of DNA polymerase-gamma and for the transcription repressor MTERF3; we suggest that these genes are under regulatory mechanisms that do not involve NRF proteins. Since NRFs are known to positively control the expression of transcription-activating proteins, the novelty emerging from our data is that proteins playing antithetical roles in mitochondrial DNA transcription, namely activators and repressors, are under different regulatory pathways. Finally, we developed a more stringent consensus with respect to the general consensus of NRF-2/GA-binding protein when searching for NRF-2 binding sites in the promoter of mitochondrial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2111728725,"Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) kinase is an indispensable signaling intermediate in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and its closely related protein, TAB3, are binding partners of TAK1 and have previously been identified as adaptors of TAK1 that recruit TAK1 to a TNF receptor signaling complex. TAB2 and TAB3 redundantly mediate activation of TAK1. In this study, we investigated the role of TAB2 by analyzing fibroblasts having targeted deletion of the tab2 gene. In TAB2-deficient fibroblasts, TAK1 was associated with TAB3 and was activated following TNF stimulation. However, TAB2-deficient fibroblasts displayed a significantly prolonged activation of TAK1 compared with wild type control cells. This suggests that TAB2 mediates deactivation of TAK1. We found that a TAK1-negative regulator, protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), was recruited to the TAK1 complex in wild type but not in TAB2-deficient fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both PP6 and TAB2 interacted with the polyubiquitin chains and this interaction mediated the assembly with TAK1. Our results indicate that TAB2 not only activates TAK1 but also plays an essential role in the deactivation of TAK1 by recruiting PP6 through a polyubiquitin chain-dependent mechanism."

PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and is an important control point in glucose and pyruvate metabolism. PDK4 gene expression is stimulated by thyroid hormone (T3), glucocorticoids, and long chain fatty acids. The effects of T3 on gene expression in the liver are mediated via the thyroid hormone receptor. Here, we have identified two binding sites for thyroid hormone receptor β in the promoter of the rat PDK4 (rPDK4) gene. In addition, we have investigated the role of transcriptional coactivators and found that the PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator) enhances the T3 induction of rPDK4. Following T3 administration, there is an increase in the association of PGC-1α with the rPDK4 promoter. Interestingly, this increased association is with the proximal rPDK4 promoter rather than the distal region of the gene that contains the T3 response elements. Administration of T3 to hypothyroid rats elevated the abundance of PGC-1α mRNA and protein in the liver. In addition, we observed greater association of PGC-1α not only with the rPDK4 gene but also with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and CPT-1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) genes. Knockdown of PGC-1α in rat hepatocytes reduced the T3 induction of PDK4, PEPCK, and CPT-1a genes.

https://openalex.org/W2072025455,"UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is an alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) hexamer that mediates the first step in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal acid hydrolases. Using a multifaceted approach, including analysis of acid hydrolase phosphorylation in mice and fibroblasts lacking the gamma subunit along with kinetic studies of recombinant alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(2)beta(2) forms of the transferase, we have explored the function of the alpha/beta and gamma subunits. The findings demonstrate that the alpha/beta subunits recognize the protein determinant of acid hydrolases in addition to mediating the catalytic function of the transferase. In mouse brain, the alpha/beta subunits phosphorylate about one-third of the acid hydrolases at close to wild-type levels but require the gamma subunit for optimal phosphorylation of the rest of the acid hydrolases. In addition to enhancing the activity of the alpha/beta subunits toward a subset of the acid hydrolases, the gamma subunit facilitates the addition of the second GlcNAc-P to high mannose oligosaccharides of these substrates. We postulate that the mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain of the gamma subunit binds and presents the high mannose glycans of the acceptor to the alpha/beta catalytic site in a favorable manner."

There are four possible ligand types on apoptotic cells that could recruit fH: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and DNA. We found that CCPs 6-8 of fH bind to annexin-II, a trypsin-insensitive protein that becomes exposed on surfaces of apoptotic cells. The second ligand of fH, which interacts with CCPs 6-8 and 19-20, is DNA. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of fH with antibodies specific for DNA. fH also binds to histones devoid of DNA, and CCPs 1-4, 6-8, and 8-15 mediate this interaction. Treatment of apoptotic cells with neuraminidase, chondroitinase, heparitinase, and heparinase did not change fH binding. Treatment of apoptotic cells with phospholipase A(2) dramatically increased both binding of fH and cell-surface DNA. We also excluded the possibility that fH interacts with lysophospholipids using surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometry with lipid-coated beads. Identification of annexin-II as one of the fH ligands on apoptotic cells together with the fact that autoantibodies against annexin-II are found in systemic lupus erythematosus provides further insight into understanding the pathogenesis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2040248068,"DNA methylation and H3K9 trimethylation are involved in gene silencing and heterochromatin assembly in mammals and fungi. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, it has been demonstrated that H3K9 trimethylation catalyzed by histone methyltransferase DIM-5 is essential for DNA methylation. Trimethylated H3K9 is recognized by HP1, which then recruits the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 to methylate the DNA. Here, we show that in Neurospora, ubiquitin ligase components Cullin4 and DDB1 are essential for DNA methylation. These proteins regulate DNA methylation through their effects on the trimethylation of histone H3K9. In addition, we showed that the E3 ligase activity of the Cul4-based ubiquitin ligase is required for its function in histone H3K9 trimethylation in Neurospora. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cul4 and DDB1 are associated with the histone methyltransferase DIM-5 protein in vivo. Together, these results suggest a mechanism for DNA methylation control that may be applicable in other eukaryotic organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2117541362,"Trypanosomatids are protozoan organisms that cause serious diseases, including African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and leishmaniasis, affecting about 30 million people in the world. These parasites contain the unusual dithiol trypanothione [T(SH)(2)] instead of glutathione (GSH) as the main intracellular reductant, and they have replaced the otherwise ubiquitous GSH/glutathione reductase redox couple with a T(SH)(2)/trypanothione reductase (TR) system. The reason for the existence of T(SH)(2) in parasitic organisms has remained an enigma. Here, we show that T(SH)(2) is able to intercept nitric oxide and labile iron and form a dinitrosyl-iron complex with at least 600 times higher affinity than GSH. Accumulation of the paramagnetic dinitrosyl-trypanothionyl iron complex in vivo was observed in Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania infantum exposed to nitric oxide. While the analogous dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl iron complex formed in mammalian cells is a potent irreversible inhibitor of glutathione reductase (IC(50)=4 microM), the T(SH)(2) complex does not inactivate TR even at millimolar levels. The peculiar capacity of T(SH)(2) to sequester NO and iron in a harmless stable complex could explain the predominance of this thiol in parasites regularly exposed to NO.-Bocedi, A., Dawood, K.

However, at later stages of cancer development, cells become resistant to the growth inhibitory properties of TGF-β and begin to exploit it as a growth-promoting cytokine (1Siegel P.M. Massagué J.

TGF-β operates by activating TGF-β receptor complexes on the cell surface. TGF-β brings type 1 receptor (TGF-βRI, i.e. ALK5) to close proximity of the type 2 receptor that activates the type 1 receptor, subsequently leading to the activation of R-Smads (Smad2 and -3) by phosphorylation of serine residues at the C-terminal ends (5Moustakas A.

I-Smads operate by preventing R-Smad binding to the activated receptor, by competing with R-Smad binding to Smad4, and by inducing internalization and proteosomal degradation of TGF-βRI resulting in the attenuation of TGF-β signaling (7ten Dijke P.

Smad7 has also been shown to mediate PP1C (protein phosphatase 1C) binding to the activated TGF-βRI and subsequent inactivation of the receptor by dephosphorylation (10Shi W. Sun C. He B. Xiong W. Shi X. Yao D. Cao X. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Independently from I-Smads, PP2A can inhibit the TGF-β superfamily receptors and BMP R-Smad (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, Smad2 and -3 activity may be attenuated by a negative feedback mechanism independently from the TGF-βRI activity through dephosphorylation of the C-terminal serines by the PPM1A (PP2C) phosphatase (13Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H.

It may inhibit the activity of several Smad proteins either by dephosphorylation (Smad1–3) (13Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y.

Yoda T. Fukuda T. Katagiri T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Noticeably, in each case the attenuation of TGF-βRI signaling results in the attenuation of both Smad2 and -3 phosphorylation. PPM1A belongs to a different class of phosphatases than PP1C and PP2A. PPM1A is a monomer, and PP1C and PP2A multimers. PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) belongs to the same conserved gene family as PP1C, but it has distinct substrate specificity and expression pattern and is differentially inhibited by phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid (16Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 17Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Their requirement on divalent cations differs (17Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of PP2A multimer complex depends on regulatory β-subunits. PP2A may form ∼70 different forms and thereby may differentially target a number of substrates. Accordingly, PP2A has been reported to exert different activity toward the TGF-β superfamily receptors (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M. Development. 2008; 135: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The lack of sufficient tissue oxygenation, i.e. hypoxia, occurs during development and is a common feature of ischemic diseases and tumors. The best characterized mechanisms by which hypoxia signals are mediated are through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). HIF is stabilized upon hypoxia and activates the transcription of a wide range of genes required to counteract the reduced oxygen availability (18Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M.

Solid tumors contain hypoxic regions because of aberrant or limited amounts of vasculature. Hypoxia in tumors occurs at later stages of tumor growth, at the time when the tumors reach the size of ∼1 mm. Similarly to TGF-β, hypoxia acts as a progression factor in carcinomas, and the occurrence of hypoxia coincides with the conversion of the TGF-β response (1Siegel P.M. Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Cooperation between hypoxia and TGF-β signaling has been reported to occur at least by two mechanisms. Hypoxia activates the expression of TGF-β1 (21Li J.J. Lu J. Kaur C. Sivakumar V. Wu C.Y. Ling E.A. Neuroscience. 2008; 156: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β has been reported to cooperate with hypoxia, and hypoxic signaling is affected by Smad3, which binds the α-subunit of the HIF complex and thereby enhances the hypoxic gene expression (22Sánchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B. Langa C. Bernabéu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43799-43808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Sánchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B.

Batuman O.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, whether hypoxia may modulate TGF-β signaling remains under investigation. Here, we show that hypoxia leads to imbalance in TGF-β response as hypoxia selectively blocks the TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 without influencing Smad2 phosphorylation. This is due to dephosphorylation of Smad3 by protein phosphatase 2A selectively under hypoxia.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that hypoxia attenuates the TGF-β-induced Smad3 phosphorylation but leaves the Smad2 phosphorylation intact. Mechanistically, this is due to dephosphorylation of Smad3 by PP2A. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a Smad phosphatase that is selective to one R-Smad, leading to a shutdown of only one arm of the TGF-β signaling.The TGF-β activated canonical R-Smad pathway may be inhibited by various mechanisms, including the inhibition of R-Smad receptor interaction as well as receptor degradation by I-Smads. In normoxic conditions, this type of inhibition and subsequent attenuation in R-Smad phosphorylation is well established. Moreover, PP1C can dephosphorylate TGF-βRI (10Shi W. Sun C. He B. Xiong W. Shi X. Yao D. Cao X. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation events have been shown to occur on several other components in the TGF-β superfamily signaling cascade. BMP and TGF-β signaling are regulated by SCP1–3 phosphatases, which target the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1 and the linker phosphorylation of Smad2 and -3 (38Knockaert M. Sapkota G. Alarcón C. Massagué J. Brivanlou A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11940-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Wrighton K.H. Willis D. Long J. Liu F. Lin X. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38365-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). BMP receptor associates with one form of PP2A leading to dephosphorylation of BMP R-Smad, Smad1, in normoxia, and different PP2A forms can dephosphorylate different receptors of the TGF-β superfamily and Smad1 (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M. Development. 2008; 135: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Bengtsson L. Schwappacher R. Roth M. Boergermann J.H. Hassel S. Knaus P. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bengtson et al. (12Bengtsson L. Schwappacher R. Roth M. Boergermann J.H. Hassel S. Knaus P. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) show that PP2A dephosphorylates Smad1 linker region and only weakly the C terminus in normoxia. They also reported that the linker region dephosphorylation leads to enhanced nuclear localization of Smad1 in normoxia. Noticeably, in the study by Batut et al. (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M. Development. 2008; 135: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the entire TGF-β signaling is regarded to be attenuated as measured by Smad2 C-terminal phosphorylation. These studies clearly indicate that PP2A regulates TGF-β and BMP signaling both at the receptor and R-Smad levels under normoxic conditions. However, our results show that the block in Smad3 C-terminal phosphorylation under hypoxia is achieved independently from the receptor activity and importantly that it is specific for Smad3. The data demonstrate that TGF-βRI protein level is not affected by hypoxia and that forced receptor expression does not overcome the hypoxic attenuation in Smad3 phosphorylation. Importantly, Smad3 phosphorylation continued to be inhibited by hypoxia in the presence of a constitutively active phosphatase-resistant mutantof TGF-βRI. In line with this, after Smad3 phosphorylation was blocked by a chemical TGF-βRI inhibitor, hypoxia accelerated the dephosphorylation process.Besides the block in essential receptor interactions or the enhancement of receptor degradation, Smad2 and -3 may also be inactivated by dephosphorylation. However, regardless of the mechanism of inhibition, both Smad2 and -3 phosphorylations are affected (13Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Smad2 and -3 were recently reported to be dephosphorylated under sustained TGF-β treatment at longer time points (>2 h) by PPM1A (13Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), indicating together with our data that the protein phosphatases play a major role in regulating TGF-β responses independently of receptor level regulation. Although we do not want to exclude basal level dephosphorylation of Smad3 by PPM1A or any other phosphatase, it is clear that they do not have a major effect on the hypoxic Smad3 dephosphorylation after TGF-β stimulus at shorter time points (<2 h). PPM1A is insensitive to okadaic acid but has an absolute requirement for Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions. In contrast, PP2A is not dependent on divalent ions but is strongly inhibited by okadaic acid. Arguing against the involvement of PPM1A, our data show that the hypoxic Smad3 dephosphorylation is okadaic acid-inhibitable at low concentration. Moreover, in hypoxia Smad3 co-purifies phosphatase activity in the presence of EDTA, a strong Mg2+/Mn2+ chelator. Most importantly, depletion of PPM1A by siRNA could not restore the hypoxic Smad3 dephosphorylation. This was in striking contrast to the depletion of PP2A by siRNA, which did inhibit the Smad3 dephosphorylation. The inhibition occurred in hypoxia but did not have a marked effect on Smad3 phosphorylation in normoxia providing further support for the involvement of PP2A in hypoxia-specific Smad3 dephosphorylation. Moreover, the data demonstrated a physical interaction of PP2A and Smad3 and that the interaction occurs only under hypoxic conditions but not in normoxia. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that the hypoxia-activated PP2A did not interact with the Smad2 MH1 domain. In keeping with this, PP2A activity co-purified with Smad3 but not with Smad2, and PP2A dephosphorylated Smad3 in vitro. These were specifically seen under hypoxic conditions.Several lines of evidence demonstrate that Smad2 and -3 have separate functions. Knock-out studies show that Smad2 and -3 are not functionally interchangeable (40Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C.

Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

Our data on the hypoxic regulation of R-Smad activity imply a mechanism as to how differential regulation of Smad2 and -3 may occur. Furthermore, the data may shed light to previous findings, such as the phenotype of Smad3 knock-out mice with acceleration of wound healing (40Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) as well as the enhancement of tumor progression in Smad3 null mice (43Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar).To our knowledge, PP2A is the first phosphatase demonstrating specificity between Smad2 and -3. PP2A has been implicated in a number of cellular homeostasis maintaining processes, and in the setting of carcinogenesis it is mainly implicated as a tumor suppressor (16Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 44Mumby M. Cell. 2007; 130: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). At least 12 (>30, including the splice variants) different regulatory and two scaffold subunits for PP2A exist. Together, these may specify some 70 different the PP2A targets and allow precisely regulated phosphatase activity. In keeping with this, changes in the PP2A regulatory subunits have been reported to affect the ability of PP2A to induce cell transformation (45Chen W. Possemato R. Campbell K.T. Plattner C.A. Pallas D.C. Hahn W.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and different forms can inhibit different TGF-β superfamily receptors (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M. Development. 2008; 135: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is plausible that hypoxia induces changes to the PP2A composition by switching regulatory subunits and thereby PP2A target specificity. Furthermore, because hypoxia is known to induce the expression of nearly a hundred different proteins and also to activate post-transcriptional modifications, including hydroxylation, it is possible that the hypoxia-induced proteins and/or modifications may be involved in the recruitment of PP2A to Smad3. Interestingly, hypoxia has been reported to induce the expression of TGF-β (21Li J.J. Lu J. Kaur C. Sivakumar V. Wu C.Y. Ling E.A. Neuroscience. 2008; 156: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46Scheid A. Wenger R.H. Schäffer L. Camenisch I. Distler O. Ferenc A. Cristina H. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Wagner K.F. Stauffer U.G. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Meuli M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and HIF-1α has been shown to cooperate with Smad3 and to modify the Smad-activated transcriptional responses (24Zhang H. Akman H.O. Smith E.L. Zhao J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Batuman O.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The detailed composition of the Smad3-associating PP2A complex as well as whether HIF may also directly bind to the complex remain to be investigated.The in vivo consequences of hypoxic Smad3 dephosphorylation by PP2A will require extensive investigation. Based on our data, we speculate that hypoxia has a major effect on the TGF-β-regulated epithelial function through Smad3-selective dephosphorylation. Supporting this, hypoxia led to decreased expression of nuclear P-Smad3 that was restored by PP2A knockdown, although the nuclear accumulation of P-Smad2 was not affected by hypoxia. Consequently, at least a subset of TGF-β-affected genes that regulate epithelial integrity and proliferation such as p15 and ID1 were modulated by hypoxia that in turn was reversed by PP2A inhibition. Strikingly, however, under hypoxia the phosphorylated Smad2 may function and carry normal responses in hypoxia (47Oft M. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat.

Noticeably also, while in hypoxia PP2A dephosphorylates the C-terminal serines of Smad3 and the phosphorylation at the linker region may still retain functionality and convey some of Smad3 functions.

Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). However, at later stages of cancer development, cells become resistant to the growth inhibitory properties of TGF-β and begin to exploit it as a growth-promoting cytokine (1Siegel P.M. Massagué J.

TGF-β operates by activating TGF-β receptor complexes on the cell surface. TGF-β brings type 1 receptor (TGF-βRI, i.e. ALK5) to close proximity of the type 2 receptor that activates the type 1 receptor, subsequently leading to the activation of R-Smads (Smad2 and -3) by phosphorylation of serine residues at the C-terminal ends (5Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4737) Google Scholar). R-Smads bind to a common Smad4 mediator, are accumulated in the nucleus, and activate transcriptional responses (5Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar).The TGF-β signaling through Smad2/3 is antagonized by several mechanisms, such as the activation of inhibitory Smads (I-Smads, Smad6 and -7) and dephosphorylation of R-Smads and TGF-β receptor. I-Smads operate by preventing R-Smad binding to the activated receptor, by competing with R-Smad binding to Smad4, and by inducing internalization and proteosomal degradation of TGF-βRI resulting in the attenuation of TGF-β signaling (7ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 8Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D.

Smad7 has also been shown to mediate PP1C (protein phosphatase 1C) binding to the activated TGF-βRI and subsequent inactivation of the receptor by dephosphorylation (10Shi W. Sun C. He B. Xiong W. Shi X. Yao D. Cao X. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Independently from I-Smads, PP2A can inhibit the TGF-β superfamily receptors and BMP R-Smad (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M. Development. 2008; 135: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Bengtsson L. Schwappacher R. Roth M. Boergermann J.H. Hassel S. Knaus P. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, Smad2 and -3 activity may be attenuated by a negative feedback mechanism independently from the TGF-βRI activity through dephosphorylation of the C-terminal serines by the PPM1A (PP2C) phosphatase (13Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H.

It may inhibit the activity of several Smad proteins either by dephosphorylation (Smad1–3) (13Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y.

Yoda T. Fukuda T. Katagiri T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Noticeably, in each case the attenuation of TGF-βRI signaling results in the attenuation of both Smad2 and -3 phosphorylation. PPM1A belongs to a different class of phosphatases than PP1C and PP2A. PPM1A is a monomer, and PP1C and PP2A multimers. PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) belongs to the same conserved gene family as PP1C, but it has distinct substrate specificity and expression pattern and is differentially inhibited by phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid (16Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 17Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Their requirement on divalent cations differs (17Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of PP2A multimer complex depends on regulatory β-subunits. PP2A may form ∼70 different forms and thereby may differentially target a number of substrates. Accordingly, PP2A has been reported to exert different activity toward the TGF-β superfamily receptors (11Batut J. Schmierer B. Cao J. Raftery L.A. Hill C.S. Howell M. Development. 2008; 135: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The lack of sufficient tissue oxygenation, i.e. hypoxia, occurs during development and is a common feature of ischemic diseases and tumors. The best characterized mechanisms by which hypoxia signals are mediated are through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). HIF is stabilized upon hypoxia and activates the transcription of a wide range of genes required to counteract the reduced oxygen availability (18Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M.

Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar). Solid tumors contain hypoxic regions because of aberrant or limited amounts of vasculature. Hypoxia in tumors occurs at later stages of tumor growth, at the time when the tumors reach the size of ∼1 mm. Similarly to TGF-β, hypoxia acts as a progression factor in carcinomas, and the occurrence of hypoxia coincides with the conversion of the TGF-β response (1Siegel P.M. Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Cooperation between hypoxia and TGF-β signaling has been reported to occur at least by two mechanisms. Hypoxia activates the expression of TGF-β1 (21Li J.J. Lu J. Kaur C. Sivakumar V. Wu C.Y. Ling E.A. Neuroscience. 2008; 156: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β has been reported to cooperate with hypoxia, and hypoxic signaling is affected by Smad3, which binds the α-subunit of the HIF complex and thereby enhances the hypoxic gene expression (22Sánchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B. Langa C. Bernabéu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43799-43808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Sánchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B.

Batuman O.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, whether hypoxia may modulate TGF-β signaling remains under investigation. Here, we show that hypoxia leads to imbalance in TGF-β response as hypoxia selectively blocks the TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 without influencing Smad2 phosphorylation. This is due to dephosphorylation of Smad3 by protein phosphatase 2A selectively under hypoxia."

The extracellular part of Np65 contains three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like modules (Igl, Ig2, and Ig3), whereas Np55 lacks the Igl module. Of these two isoforms, only Np65 is involved in homophilic interactions resulting in cell adhesion, whereas the role of Np55 is poorlyunderstood. The present studyreports for the first time the crystal structure of the ectodomain of Np55 at 1.95-Å resolution and demonstrates that Np55 binds to and activates the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Furthermore, we identify a sequence motif in the Ig2 module of Np55 interacting with FGFR1 and show that a synthetic peptide encompassing this motif, termed narpin, binds to and activates FGFR1. We show that both Np55 and the narpin peptide induce neurite outgrowth through FGFR1 activation and that Np55 increases synaptic calcium concentration in an FGFR1-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that narpin has an antidepressive-like effect in rats subjected to the forced swim test, suggesting that Np55-induced signaling may be involved in synaptic plasticity in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2035473881,"Notch is a transmembrane receptor that shares homology with proteins containing epidermal growth factor-like repeats and mediates the cell-cell interactions necessary for many cell fate decisions. In Drosophila, O-fucosyltransferase 1 catalyzes the O-fucosylation of these epidermal growth factor-like repeats. This O-fucose elongates, resulting in an O-linked tetrasaccharide that regulates the signaling activities of Notch. Fucosyltransferases utilize GDP-fucose, which is synthesized in the cytosol, but fucosylation occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Therefore, GDP-fucose uptake into the ER and Golgi is essential for fucosylation. However, although GDP-fucose biosynthesis is well understood, the mechanisms and intracellular routes of GDP-fucose transportation remain unclear. Our previous study on the Drosophila Golgi GDP-fucose transporter (Gfr), which specifically localizes to the Golgi, suggested that another GDP-fucose transporter(s) exists in Drosophila. Here, we identified Efr (ER GDP-fucose transporter), a GDP-fucose transporter that localizes specifically to the ER. Efr is a multifunctional nucleotide sugar transporter involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate-glycosaminoglycan chains and the O-fucosylation of Notch. Comparison of the fucosylation defects in the N-glycans in Gfr and Efr mutants revealed that Gfr and Efr made distinct contributions to this modification; Gfr but not Efr was crucial for the fucosylation of N-glycans. We also found that Gfr and Efr function redundantly in the O-fucosylation of Notch, although they had different localizations and nucleotide sugar transportation specificities. These results indicate that two pathways for the nucleotide sugar supply, involving two nucleotide sugar transporters with distinct characteristics and distributions, contribute to the O-fucosylation of Notch."

These events could be stimulated either by the ligands (in a Janus kinase-dependent manner) or by unfolded protein response (UPR) inducers including viral infection (in a manner dependent on the activity of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase). Both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways converge on phosphorylation of Ser(535) within the IFNAR1 degron leading to recruitment of beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase and concomitant ubiquitination and degradation. Casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1 alpha) was shown to directly phosphorylate Ser(535) within the ligand-independent pathway. Yet given the constitutive activity of CK1 alpha, it remained unclear how this pathway is stimulated by UPR. Here we report that induction of UPR promotes the phosphorylation of a proximal residue, Ser(532), in a pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase-dependent manner. This serine serves as a priming site that promotes subsequent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 within its degron by CK1 alpha. These events play an important role in regulating ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1 as well as the extent of Type I interferon signaling."

LipL32, a major lipoprotein and a virulence factor, locates on the outer membrane of the pathogen Leptospira. It evades immune response by recognizing and adhering to extracellular matrix components of the host cell. The crystal structure of Ca(2+)-bound LipL32 was determined at 2.3 A resolution. LipL32 has a novel polyD sequence of seven aspartates that forms a continuous acidic surface patch for Ca(2+) binding. A significant conformational change was observed for the Ca(2+)-bound form of LipL32. Calcium binding to LipL32 was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding of fibronectin to LipL32 was observed by Stains-all CD and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments. The interaction between LipL32 and fibronectin might be associated with Ca(2+) binding. Based on the crystal structure of Ca(2+)-bound LipL32 and the Stains-all results, fibronectin probably binds near the polyD region on LipL32. Ca(2+) binding to LipL32 might be important for Leptospira to interact with the extracellular matrix of the host cell."

Phosphorylation has been shown to have important functional roles such as the release of p47phox from its autoinhibitory state (39Yuzawa S. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that phosphorylation of specific residues of another component, p22phox, by PKC is important for optimal NADPH oxidase function. p22phox mRNA is abundant in most cell lines and tissues of the body (40Cheng G.

In this study, we have characterized the NADPH oxidase response to PMA in this system. We determined that PMA-dependent p22phox phosphorylation occurs on threonine 147 and that blocking this phosphorylation reduces superoxide production as well as interferes with the p22phox-p47phox interaction in the membrane.

Mutants were made using the PfuUltra® high fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Following transformation into Escherichia coli, plasmid DNA was isolated from bacteria using standard techniques. Mutations were verified by sequencing at the Biomolecular Research Laboratory DNA Sequencing Core laboratory at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. CHO 91/47/67 cells were plated at 1.2–1.5 × 106/60-mm cell culture dish (Corning) in antibiotic-free F12K medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine growth serum and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate and incubated overnight (∼16 h). Following cell adhesion, 10 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in serum-free medium (F12K), incubated for 20 min, and added to medium containing 20% bovine growth serum for a final concentration of 10% bovine growth serum before addition to the cells. After 24 h, transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution/glucose (5 mm) at 1 × 107 cells/ml. NADPH oxidase activity in intact cells was monitored by chemiluminescence. Isolated CHO cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution/glucose were diluted to 2.5× the indicated final concentrations in Hanks’ balanced salt solution/glucose + 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) and then incubated with 100 μl of Diogenes (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) in a white 96-well plate (Greiner, Lake Mary, FL). PMA was added at the indicated concentrations for a final volume of 250 μl/reaction. Light emission was monitored continuously in duplicate or triplicate wells/condition at 25 °C for 1–2 h in a MicroLumat Plus LB 96 V luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). Data are expressed as relative light units per min (RLU/min) calculated from the slope between ∼20 and 40 min after stimulation unless otherwise specified. Whole cell lysates were prepared at 1 × 107 cell equivalents/ml in Laemmli sample buffer then boiled for 10 min. Cell membrane protein was obtained after disruption by sonication as described previously (49Caldwell S.E. McCall C.E. Hendricks C.L. Leone P.A. Bass D.A. McPhail L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1485-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 11% sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated 7 × 3 s (20% output power, model W-220; Heat Systems Ultrasonics), then centrifuged (1950 rpm (870 × g), 5 min, 4 °C) to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The low speed supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation (45,000 rpm (186,000 × g), 60 min, 4 °C). Membrane pellets were washed and resuspended in sonication buffer at 1–2 × 107 cell eq/ml, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protocol with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were separated on 10% or 14% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred overnight to nitrocellulose, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (51Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed three times with TBST, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with appropriate primary antibody (anti-p47phox 1:1000 (gt) or 1:3000 (ms), anti-p67phox 1:1000, anti-gp91phox (54.1) 1:5000, or anti-p22phox (44.1) 1:1000). Blots were washed in TBST and then incubated in 5% milk/TBST for 1 h with appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000). Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Membrane protein (40 μg) obtained from p22phox-transfected CHO 91/47/67 cells was mixed with solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Samples were precleared with 5 μg of mouse IgG and 30 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, and supernatants were removed and tumbled with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody 44.1 for 2 h. A 50% slurry of protein G-agarose (30 μl) was added and tumbled overnight at 4 °C. Agarose bound with p22phox was washed twice with solubilization buffer then once with PKC assay buffer (75 mm NaxPO4, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA) before being resuspended in PKC assay buffer at a final volume of 69 μl. Five μl (100 ng) of PKC-α or PKC-δ and 6 μl (∼12 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP were added to each tube just prior to the start of the reaction. PKC was activated by the addition of 30 μg/ml 10:0 1,2-didecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, 10 μg/ml 1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycerol, and 0.6 mm CaCl2 (−CaCl2 for PKC-δ) for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated p22phox was visualized by audioradiography. Western blot analysis with anti-p22phox antibody was then performed to confirm an equal p22phox protein amount/reaction. Transfected cells (1 × 107cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for stimulation with PMA or dimethyl sulfoxide. The membrane fraction, obtained from sonicated cells (sonication buffer: 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm AEBSF) was solubilized and precleared with rabbit IgG and protein G-agarose beads as described above. An anti-p47phox antibody (rabbit, ∼1 μg of IgG/10 μg of membrane protein; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) plus protein G-agarose beads was used to immunoprecipitate (4 h, 4 °C) the p22phox·p47phox complex. Washed beads were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins on blots were probed for both p22phox and p47phox content. Statistical significance was determined based on p values from two-tailed Student's t tests using GraphPad Prism 4 (Hearne Scientific Software, Chicago, IL). Previous reports (52Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L. Stull N. LeRoy B. Bennett S. Cross A. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30368-30374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using CHO cells stably expressing NADPH oxidase components gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox (CHOphox) have shown that PMA stimulation results in superoxide production, but the response was not fully characterized. We confirmed that PMA stimulates NADPH oxidase activity in CHOphox cells (Fig. 1). CHOphox cells were incubated with or without 100 nm PMA in the presence of a luminol-based reagent (Diogenes) specific for the detection of superoxide. Light emission for each reaction was measured continuously over the indicated periods of time and plotted as a RLU versus time curve (Fig. 1A) or rate (RLU/min) as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1B). PMA-dependent superoxide production increased as a function of cell concentration, and the characteristics of the response are similar to those published for human neutrophils (53Tauber A.I. Brettler D.B. Kennington E.A. Blumberg P.M. Blood. 1982; 60: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cell lysates (Fig. 1C) illustrates that all four of the NADPH oxidase components necessary for superoxide production were present. The gp65 protein is the precursor of gp91phox. These data indicate that CHOphox cells contain NADPH oxidase components and are stimulated by PMA to produce superoxide. We next determined whether CHO cells stably expressing only gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox (CHO 91/47/67) could produce superoxide in response to PMA when transiently transfected with p22phox. CHO 91/47/67 cells were transfected with mock or wild type p22phox DNA and evaluated for both for p22phox expression and PMA-stimulated respiratory burst activity using the chemiluminescence assay. In Fig. 2A, cells were stimulated with 100 nm PMA at varying cell concentrations. The cells expressing wild type p22phox (inset) demonstrated a cell concentration-dependent increase in superoxide production, which did not occur in mock transfected cells. Superoxide production was dependent on PMA concentration (Fig. 2B) and reached a maximum at ∼100 nm. Fig. 2C shows that diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a known NADPH oxidase inhibitor (54Cross A.R. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), inhibited PMA-stimulated superoxide production in a dose-dependent manner. Ten μm DPI completely inhibited the response. These data illustrate that CHO 91/47/67 cells transiently transfected to express wild type p22phox have the ability to produce superoxide as a result of PMA stimulation and that the superoxide produced is from reconstituted NADPH oxidase activity. Based on these results, the remainder of the experiments used 2 × 106 cells and 100 nm PMA. We utilized site-directed mutagenesis to explore the functional roles of potential phosphorylation sites in p22phox. We have shown previously that phosphorylation of p22phox in stimulated intact neutrophils occurs on one or more threonine residues (34Regier D.S. Waite K.A. Wallin R. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36601-36608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of p22phox (NetPhos, NCBI) indicated that Thr-132 and Thr-147 were potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinases such as PKC, p38 MAPK, and casein kinase II. We generated threonine to alanine point mutants at these residues as well as a proline 156 to glutamine mutant. The latter inhibits NADPH oxidase activity by blocking p47phox binding to p22phox (55Leusen J.H. Bolscher B.G. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Kaulfersch W. Seger R.A. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and this construct was used as a positive control for inhibition of NADPH oxidase function by mutagenesis of p22phox. CHO 91/47/67 cells expressing no p22phox (mock), wild type (wtp22), or any of the three other point mutations in p22phox were stimulated with buffer (Fig. 3, open bars) or 100 nm PMA (filled bars) for measurement of oxidase activity in the chemiluminescence assay. Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to monitor expression levels of both p22phox and p47phox. We observed a significant (p = 0.004) increase in stimulus-dependent NADPH oxidase activity from wild type p22phox-expressing cells compared with mock transfected cells. As expected, cells expressing the inactive p22phox mutant (P156Q) showed complete inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity compared with wild type, while still expressing equivalent levels of p22phox protein. In contrast, the PMA-stimulated response of cells expressing the p22phox T132A mutant was not significantly different from that of cells expressing wild type p22phox, suggesting that this threonine does not affect PMA-dependent NADPH oxidase activity. However, we saw a pronounced decrease of superoxide production from cells expressing the p22phox T147A mutant compared with that of wild type p22phox-expressing cells (p = 0.011). PMA-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity of the T147A mutant averaged less then 30% of the wild type response. The lower panels of Fig. 3 show the expression levels of the various p22phox constructs and of p47phox, which was used as a loading control. The wild type and T132A- and T147A-transfected cells showed similar levels of p22phox expression, and no detectable p22phox was present in mock transfected cells. Together, these results directly implicate the involvement of Thr-147 in the PMA-dependent stimulation of NADPH oxidase activity. To address the hypothesis that threonine 147 is a phosphorylated residue of p22phox, we utilized an in vitro phosphorylation assay. We reported previously that p22phox in neutrophils could be phosphorylated in vitro by PKC isoforms (34Regier D.S. Waite K.A. Wallin R. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36601-36608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated p22phox from mock, wild type, and P156Q-, T132A-, and T147A-transfected CHO 91/47/67 cells was incubated in the presence of classical PKC-α (Fig. 4A) or novel PKC-δ (Fig. 4B). Both PKC isoforms phosphorylated wild type (wtp22), P156Q, and T132A p22phox. In contrast, we saw no phosphorylation of the T147A p22phox mutant (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2073463269,"Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Recent cross-linking studies have suggested that PLB binding and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E2 conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, preventing formation of E1, the conformation that binds two Ca(2+) (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca(2+) binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca(2+) pump. Seven SERCA2a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca(2+)-binding site I (E770Q, T798A, and E907Q), site II (E309Q and N795A), or both sites (D799N and E309Q/E770Q) were made, and the effects of Ca(2+) on N30C-PLB cross-linking to Lys(328) of SERCA2a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase, none of the SERCA2a mutants (except E907Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca(2+); however, all were phosphorylatable by P(i) to form E2P. Ca(2+) inhibition of E2P formation was observed only in SERCA2a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N30C-PLB and each Ca(2+)-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca(2+). Importantly, however, micromolar Ca(2+) inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca(2+)-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca(2+) pumps and N30C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca(2+)-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA2a."
https://openalex.org/W2035409842,"Aging is a complex process accompanied by a decreased capacity of cells to cope with random damages induced by reactive oxygen species, the natural by-products of energy metabolism, leading to protein aggregation in various components of the cell. Chaperones are important players in the aging process as they prevent protein misfolding and aggregation. Small chaperones, such as small heat shock proteins, are involved in the refolding and/or disposal of protein aggregates, a feature of many age-associated diseases. In Drosophila melanogaster, mitochondrial Hsp22 (DmHsp22), is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is preferentially up-regulated during aging. Its overexpression results in an extension of life span (>30%) (Morrow, G., Samson, M., Michaud, S., and Tanguay, R. M.

Long lived flies expressing Hsp22 also have an increased resistance to oxidative stress and maintain locomotor activity longer. In the present study, the cross-species effects of Hsp22 expression were tested. DmHsp22 was found to be functionally active in human cells. It extended the life span of normal fibroblasts, slowing the aging process as evidenced by a lower level of the senescence associated β-galactosidase. DmHsp22 expression in human cancer cells increased their malignant properties including anchorage-independent growth, tumor formation in nude mice, and resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs. We report that the DmHsp22 interacts and inactivates wild type tumor suppressor protein p53, which may be one possible way of its functioning in human cells.

DmHsp22 expression in human cancer cells increased their malignant properties including anchorage-independent growth, tumor formation in nude mice, and resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs. We report that the DmHsp22 interacts and inactivates wild type tumor suppressor protein p53, which may be one possible way of its functioning in human cells. The small heat shock proteins (sHsps) 5The abbreviations used are: sHspsmall heat shock proteinDmHsp22Drosophila mitochondrial Hsp22PDpopulation doublingPBSphosphate-buffered saline. are members of a superfamily of proteins that share a highly conserved ∼80-amino acid α-crystallin domain in their C-terminal domain. Like other heat shock proteins, sHsps exhibit a highly dynamic structure forming both homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes, possess chaperone-like activity, and are involved in a plethora of functions ranging from protein folding to apoptosis and stress resistance. In human cells, there are 11 members in the family: Hsp27 (HspB1, Hsp25), myotonic dystrophy protein kinase-binding protein (HspB2), HspB3, αA-crystallin (HspB4), αB-crystallin (HspB5), Hsp20 (p20, HspB6), cardiovascular heat shock protein (HspB7), Hsp22 (Hsp22/HspB8/H11) and HspB9 (1Dierick I.

Although very similar in structure, the different sHsps show specificity in terms of response to stress, in tissue, and developmental expression, suggesting that they have different functions. sHsps have been reported to act at various steps of the apoptotic process, but the structure/functions of these small proteins remain poorly understood. The tissue and developmental stage-specific pattern of sHsp expression has suggested their role in specific tissue functions, maintenance, and modulation of tissue integrity, dynamics of structural elements, spatial organization, and apoptosis that play an important role in development, control of cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis (1Dierick I.

Specific point mutations in a number of small Hsps can destabilize the protein structure and have been reported to be associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as distal hereditary motor neuropathy and/or Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuromuscular diseases (2Hu Z.

In Drosophila melanogaster, in which the sHsps were first reported, there are four main members that show distinct intracellular localization (14Michaud S. Morrow G. Marchand J. Tanguay R.M. Prog.

Heikkila J.J. Tanguay R.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2006; 11: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DmHsp22 is up-regulated during Drosophila aging (17King V. Tower J. Dev.

We report that the DmHsp22 is functionally active in human cells. Indeed, the expression of DmHsp22 extends the life span of normal human fibroblasts and increased the malignant properties of human cancer cells. Moreover, DmHsp22-expressing cancer cells formed aggressive tumors and acquired a drug-resistant phenotype. We further report that DmHsp22 interacts with and inactivate wild type tumor suppressor p53 in human cancer cells, suggesting that this interaction may represent one of the mechanisms of its proproliferative function. Human normal fibroblasts (TIG-1) and cancerous cells, osteosarcoma (U2OS), breast carcinoma (MCF7), and lung carcinoma (A549), were propagated in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics-antimycotics (Sigma). DmHsp22-overexpressing cells were generated by retrovirus-driven expression. The cDNA encoding D. melanogaster Hsp22 protein was cloned into the HindIII site of the vector CX4neo (pCX4neo, provided by Dr. Akagi, Osaka, Japan). For production of retroviruses, Plat-E, an ecotropic murine leukemia virus-packaging cell line was transfected with the pVPack-GP (expressing gag and pol) and pVPack VSVG (expressing env) vectors (Stratagene) along with either pCXneo retroviral vector or pCX4neo/DmHsp22 using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, culture supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. The filtered supernatants (viral stock) were used for cell infection without freeze thawing. Cells (2 × 105/well in 6-well dishes) were treated with 8 μg/ml polybrene at 37 °C for 1 h, after which they were incubated with 200–300 μl of filtered viral stock for 1 h followed by addition of 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium and continued incubation at 37 °C for further 48 h. The infected cells were selected in medium containing G418 (100–200 μg/ml for normal and 500 μg/ml for cancer cells) until stable expressing cell lines were obtained. The stably infected cells lines were examined for expression of DmHsp22 by Western blotting and immunostaining with specific antibody (15Morrow G. Inaguma Y. Kato K. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31204-31210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and were maintained in 100 μg/ml G418-supplemented medium. Normal control and DmHsp22-expressing cells were serially passaged in parallel. The passage ratio was kept at 1:16 for young cultures and was decreased to 1:8 or 1:4 as they aged. Serial passaging was continued until cells stopped dividing and entered senescence. The nondividing senescent cells were maintained for >4 weeks before termination of the experiment. Control and DmHsp22-expressing cells were trypsinized and solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates containing 20–30 μg protein were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a semidry transfer apparatus (ATTO). After washing with Tris-buffered saline-Triton X-100, the membrane was incubated with the first and second (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) antibodies as indicated. The membrane was washed thrice in Tris-buffered saline-Triton X-100 and once in Tris-buffered saline, then subjected to an enhanced chemiluminescence-mediated visualization (Amersham Biosciences) using an Lumino Image Analyzer equipped with a CCD camera (LAS3000-mini, FujiFilm). Mitochondrial fractions were prepared using the Qproteome mitochondria isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Washed cells were suspended with lysis buffer for disrupting the plasma membrane. After incubation for 10 min, lysate were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was harvested as a cytosolic fraction. Pellet containing nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells was resuspended with ice-cold disruption buffer. Resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was harvested as a microsomal fraction. The resulting pellet was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C for mitochondrial fraction by density gradient purification. After centrifugation, the band toward the bottom of the tube was harvested as a mitochondrial fraction. For in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, cell lysates (300 μg protein) in 300 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer were incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h with anti-DmHsp22 antibody. Immunocomplexes were separated by incubation with Protein A/G-Sepharose, and Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies using the procedure described above. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in methanol:acetone (1:1), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were probed with primary antibody (as indicated) for 1–2 h. Staining was visualized by Alexa Fluor 594 (rabbit)-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were examined on a Carl Zeiss microscope attached with either a Photometrics Synsys monochrome CCD (charge-coupled device) or an AxioCam HRC color camera (Zeiss). Senescent cells were detected using the standard protocol for senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining assay. In brief, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and washed again with PBS, followed by an overnight incubation in staining solution (citric acid/phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mm K3Fe (CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) at 37 °C. Stained cells were observed under the microscope and photodocumented with a NIKON camera. Cell transformation assay was performed by using the Cell Transformation Detection kit (CHEMICON) following the manufacturer's instructions. Base agar solution (0.8% agar in culture media) and top agar solution (0.4% agar in culture media) were prepared and preincubated at 37 °C. Plates (24-well) were coated with base agar solution and stored at 4 °C until use. Prior to use, plates were warmed up for 5 min by placing at 37 °C incubator. An equal number of MCF7, U2OS, A549, and each Hsp22-expressing cells (1250 cells/well of 24-well plate) was mixed with top agar solution. The mixture of cells and top agar solution was then placed on the top of base agar layer. Cells were fed with cell culture media twice a week and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. On day 28, colonies were stained with cell stain solution. Colony-forming activity is expressed as the mean number of colonies in five fields from three independent experiments. Chemotaxis assays were performed on control and DmHsp22-transduced cells. Cells at 60–70% confluency were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at 2 × 105 cells/ml. 2 × 104 cells were plated in Transwell inserts (12 mm-pore, Costar), and the invasion assay was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Fibronectin from human plasma (Sigma) was used as chemoattractant. Cells that moved through the transwell were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with crystal violet (0.2% in PBS). Balb/c nude mice (4 weeks old, female) were bought from Nihon Clea. Control and DmHsp22-transduced cells (1 × 106 suspended in 0.3 ml of growth medium) were injected subcutaneously into the flank of nude mice (two sites per mouse). Tumor formation was monitored for the next month. The assay was regarded as positive if tumors appeared and grew progressively. Control and DmHsp22-expressing cells were grown in the monolayer. A wound was made in the monolayer of cells by completely scratching the cells in a line with a pipette tip. Cells were washed a few times with PBS to remove cell debris and fed with fresh medium. The time of scratching wound was designated as time 0. Cells were allowed to proliferate and migrate into the wound during the next 48 h. Migration of cells into the wound was recorded under a phase contrast microscope with a 10× phase objective. Equal number of control and DmHsp22-expressing MCF7 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate in a medium containing 5% FBS at 1 × 104 cells per well. When the cells reached subconfluence, cells were treated with campothecin, nocodazol, etoposide, or taxol at different doses. After a 48-h incubation, cultured media containing drug was removed, and 5% alamarBlue in culture media was added to culture wells. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, culture plates were read on a microplate reader at 595 nm. All assays were performed in triplicate. The number of living cells was calculated relative to the cells with nontreatment of drug, cultured, and treated with 5% alamarBlue in culture media under the same conditions, as were the experimental groups. The data obtained by three or more independent experiments were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test (nonparametric rank sum test) using StatView software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Drosophila mitochondrial Hsp22 was cloned into a retroviral expression vector as described in “Material and Methods” and was expressed in normal human fibroblasts (TIG-1). The cells were infected with vector (control) or DmHsp22-expressing retroviral vector at population doubling (PD) 24; the expression of DmHsp22 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining assays with an antibody that specifically detected DmHsp22 (Fig. 1, A and B; data not shown). Of note, no cross-reactivity of the antibody was observed with any of the other human proteins. Control and DmHsp22-expressing cells were serially passaged. Whereas control cells entered senescence at 45 PD, as marked by their morphology and slow growth, the DmHsp22-expressing cells showed younger morphology and continued dividing until ∼65 PD (Fig. 1C). Control cells underwent 58 PD, whereas DmHsp22-expressing cells divided for 84 PD. Upon examination of senescence-specific β-galactosidase staining in control and DmHsp22 cells at parallel PD (48–50 PD), we found significant lower level of β-galactosidase expression in DmHsp22-expressing cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that these cells have extended life span and slowed the rate of the aging process. Of note, the parallel experiments in which the mitochondrial chaperone mortalin/mtHsp70 was infected into TIG-1 cells gave a similar life span extension as reported earlier (23Kaul S.C. Yaguchi T. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Wadhwa R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Kaula S.C. Reddelb R.R. Sugiharac T. Mitsuia Y. Wadhwac R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of mortalin has been reported in a variety of tumors, and it was shown to contribute to human carcinogenesis (25Dundas S.R. Lawrie L.C. Rooney P.H. Murray G.I. J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Yi X. Luk J.M. Lee N.P. Peng J. Leng X. Guan X.Y. Lau G.K. Beretta L. Fan S.T. Mol.

Cancer. 2006; 118: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on our above findings that the small mitochondrial Hsp22 of D. melanogaster caused life span extension of human fibroblasts, we next investigated the effects of DmHsp22 expression on human cancer cells. Human breast cancer cells (MCF7) infected with DmHsp22 virus were examined for their malignant properties in comparison to the control cells (Fig. 2). Cell transformation, cell migration, and nude mice assays in control (vector-transfected) and DmHsp22-expressing cells (Fig. 2, A and B) revealed that the expression of DmHsp22 caused malignant transformation of breast cancer cells. Control cells neither showed migration in chemotaxis assay, nor anchorage-independent growth (colony formation in soft agar), and nor formed tumors in nude mice tumor. In contrast, DmHsp22-expressing cells showed migration in the chemotaxis assay, anchorage-independent growth, and formed tumors in nude mice (Fig. 2B). Similar to the MCF7 cells, human lung carcinoma (A549) and osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells showed enhanced malignant properties as a consequence to the expression of DmHsp22. Anchorage-independent growth was increased in both cell types as a consequence of DmHsp22 expression (Fig. 2C). In wound scratch/cell invasion assays, DmHsp22-expressing cells showed enhanced motility (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrated that the DmHsp22 is functional in human cells and has effects that match with the overexpression of mortalin. Drug resistance is a common feature of aggressive cancers. In particular, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers that are treated with endocrine therapy meet only a limited success rate because of the drug-resistant phenomenon. For example, a large number of originally tamoxifen-sensitive tumors develop resistance after several months of treatment while still expressing the estrogen receptor (28Robertson J.F. Cannon P.M. Nicholson R.I. Blamey R.W. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 1996; 11: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mechanism(s) of estrogen response plays a critical role in the etiology, progression, drug resistance, and treatment of breast cancers and are not clearly understood. Furthermore, cadmium (metalloestrogen and environmental pollutant) that has been implicated in breast cancer resulted in an induction of human HspB8, suggesting that this sHsp may mediate estrogenic response in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells that often develop drug resistance (29Sun X. Fontaine J.M. Bartl I. Behnam B. Welsh M.J. Benndorf R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007; 12: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Besada V. Diaz M. Becker M. Ramos Y.

Cancer. 2004; 40: 845-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In view of these reports and our findings described above, we next examined whether the mitochondrial DmHsp22, besides increasing the malignant properties of cancer cells, could make them resistant to drugs. The response to the four commonly used anti-cancer drugs was examined by cell viability assays. As shown in Fig. 3, the DmHsp22-expressing cells showed resistance to killing by each of the four drugs tested. Small Hsps have also been shown to form small molecular mass oligomers and interacts with biological membranes and proteins (3Shemetov A.A. Seit-Nebi A.S. Gusev N.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that such interactions of Hsp22 with membrane elements may regulate the drug intake and metabolism and hence modulate the signal transduction that induces growth arrest or killing. The tumor suppressor p53 pathway has a definitive role in cellular senescence and is inactivated in a large variety of cancers. Mortalin was shown to interact with p53 and inactivates its transcriptional activation function (32Wadhwa R. Takano S. Robert M. Yoshida A. Nomura H. Reddel R.R. Mitsui Y. Kaul S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29586-29591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 33Kaul S.C. Aida S. Yaguchi T. Kaur K. Wadhwa R. J. Biol.

To get insights to the mechanism(s) by which DmHsp22 induced proproliferative phenotypes in human cells, we examined its effect on the p53 pathway. We first examined the subcellular localization of DmHsp22 by cell fractionation and detection with anti-DmHsp22 antibody. As expected and shown in Fig. 4A, DmHsp22 was localized predominantly in the mitochondria, although there was some amount detected in the microsomal fraction as well. Immunoprecipitation of DmHsp22 and subsequent detection of p53 in the DmHsp22 immunocomplexes revealed interactions between the two proteins (Fig. 4B). An increasing number of recent studies has shown that p53 is localized in mitochondria and contributes to apoptosis independent to its transcriptional activation function in the nucleus (36Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 37Mihara M. Moll U.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar, 38Morselli E. Galluzzi L. Kepp O. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1647-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 39Vaseva A.V. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although MCF7 cells could not be used for this assay due to extremely low levels of wild type p53 in these cells, we detected mitochondrial localization of p53 in U2OS cells (Fig. 4C). We next hypothesized that, similar to mortalin, DmHsp22 may cause functional inactivation of p53 by its cytoplasmic sequestration (32Wadhwa R. Takano S. Robert M. Yoshida A. Nomura H. Reddel R.R. Mitsui Y. Kaul S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29586-29591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We tested this by undertaking double immunostaining assays for p53 (green) and DmHsp22 (red). We found that, whereas control U2OS cells had 67% of cells showing nuclear p53, DmHsp22-expressing cells showed only 22% cells with nuclear p53. Furthermore, the intensity of nuclear p53 staining in DmHsp22-expressing cells was lower as compared with the control cells (Fig. 5). Furthermore, in DmHsp22-expressing U2OS cells, we found that there was a significant decrease in DNA damage-induced activation of p53 pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, control cells showed strong nuclear p53 staining subsequent to the treatment with etoposide, whereas in DmHsp22-expressing cells, the nuclear p53 was significantly abrogated and was particularly noticeable in cells that expressed high levels of DmHsp22, suggesting that the DmHsp22 inactivated tumor suppressor p53 by interacting with and inhibiting its nuclear transport (Fig. 5, A and B). Quantitation of number of cells with very strong nuclear p53 staining subsequent to etoposide treatment in control and DmHsp22-expressing cells revealed that the inactivation of p53 by DmHsp22 in U2OS, A549, and MCF7 cells was statistically significant (Fig. 5B and data not shown). We further examined if the similar inactivation of p53 by DmHsp22 occurred in normal human cells and had resulted in their lifespan extension as shown in Fig. 1C. Immunostaining of p53 in control and DmHsp22-expressing TIG-1, A549, MCF7, and U2OS cells revealed that in each case DmHsp22 expression caused ∼40% decrease in number of cells showing nuclear staining for p53 (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data suggested that the inactivation of p53 by DmHsp22 is not cell line-specific, and it may be responsible for proproliferative effects of DmHsp22 (delayed aging of normal cells and increased malignant properties of cancer cells) seen in human normal and cancer cells. At the present time, there are no known mammalian homologs of DmHsp22. Whereas DmHsp22 is localized in the matrix of mitochondria in mammalian cells, the other mammalian sHsps are mainly localized in the cytosol and nucleus; some cytosolic sHsps, for example HspB2, have been reported to interact with the outer membrane of the mitochondria (40Nakagawa M. Tsujimoto N. Nakagawa H. Iwaki T. Fukumaki Y. Iwaki A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this regard, DmHsp22 appears to be similar to mammalian mtHsp70/mortalin and Hsp60 that are found predominantly in mitochondria (41Deocaris C.C. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2006; 11: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Besides the mitochondrial localization that is observed for mortalin, Hsp60, and DmHsp22, they have molecular chaperone function in vitro and in vivo (15Morrow G. Inaguma Y. Kato K. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31204-31210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Morrow G. Heikkila J.J. Tanguay R.M.

Adv. 2007; 25: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Of note, whereas mortalin and DmHsp22 caused life span extension of normal human cells, Hsp60 was not seen to have such function in parallel assays, suggesting that Dmhsp22 functions like mortalin. The mechanism by which it increases life span warrants further studies. The cross-species effects would be of particular interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DmHsp22 regulates life span and thus help to unveil the in vivo role of a mitochondrial small Hsp.

Here, we show that AIP1 disrupts formation of the TLR4- TIRAP-MyD88 complex without directly binding to any of the complex components. AIP1 via its pleckstrin homology and C2 domains binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid precursor of PIP2. Knock-out of AIP1 in cells increases and overexpression of AIP1 reduces cellular PIP2 levels. We further show that AIP1 is a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6, a small GTPase regulating cellular PIP2 production and formation of the TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 complex. Thus, deletion of the GAP domain on AIP1 results in a loss of its ability to mediate the inhibition of Arf6- and TLR4-induced signaling events. We conclude that AIP1 functions as a novel Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate PIP2-dependent TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 signaling.

Despite numerous investigations, the detailed molecular mechanism of NOS remains elusive and debatable. Much of the dispute in the various proposed mechanisms resides in the uncertainty concerning the number and sources of proton transfers. Although specific protonation events are key features in determining the specificity and efficiency of the two catalytic steps, little is known about the role and properties of protons from the substrate, cofactors, and H-bond network in the vicinity of the heme active site. In this study, we have investigated the role of the acidic proton from the l-Arg guanidinium moiety on the stability and reactivity of the ferrous heme-oxy complex intermediate by exploiting a series of l-Arg analogues exhibiting a wide range of guanidinium pKa values. Using electrochemical and vibrational spectroscopic techniques, we have analyzed the effects of the analogues on the heme, including characteristics of its proximal ligand, heme conformation, redox potential, and electrostatic properties of its distal environment. Our results indicate that the substrate guanidinium pKa value significantly affects the H-bond network near the heme distal pocket. Our results lead us to propose a new structural model where the properties of the guanidinium moiety finely control the proton transfer events in NOS and tune its oxidative chemistry.

Using an RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, we were able to detect large processed precursors that are generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of an even longer molecule. This cleavage produces the mature mRNA 3′-end and at the same time the 5′-end of the precursor. The tRNAs encoded by the petD and psbE minicircles appear to be processed in the same way.

Fresh media were prepared with MEM, 10% FBS, 1× GlutaMAX, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. Lysis buffer was prepared as 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.48% sodium deoxycholate in ddH2O.

The N2a cell line was purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection and stably transfected with pSPOX.neo vector expressing full-length mouse PrP under the control of the HCMV promoter with DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected lines were cloned by serial dilution, and 15 individual clones were assayed for PrP expression level by Western immunoblotting. The N2a-cl3 clone expressed the highest levels of PrP, 6× greater than that expressed in previous N2a lines. N2a-cl3 was infected with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) strain of mouse-adapted scrapie prions as previously described (20.Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A.

Noninfected N2a and N2a-cl3 as well as prion-infected ScN2a and ScN2a-cl3 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10 ml of MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% GlutaMAX. N2a-cl3 and ScN2a-cl3 lines were also maintained at 37 °C in 10 ml of MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 600 μg/ml Geneticin for selection of the transgene. GT1 and ScGT1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% GlutaMAX. Medium for non-dividing cell experiments was supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate. Treatment experiments with antiprion compounds lasting fewer than 14 days were performed in medium lacking both penicillin-streptomycin and Geneticin. The medium was refreshed every 2 days for dividing cells and daily for non-dividing cells. Typically, cells were propagated in 100-mm plates and allowed to grow to 95% confluence before dissociation with 1 ml of enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Cells were then replated at 10% confluence for further propagation. To collect cell lysates, cells were rinsed with PBS (3 × 10 ml) and lysed with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Lysates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris, and the total protein concentration was measured in the supernatant using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce). Aliquots containing 500 μg of total protein were titrated by adding lysis buffer to achieve a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and then stored at −20 °C until further use. Unless otherwise stated, 500 μg of lysate aliquots (at 1 mg/ml) were digested with 10 μl of 1 mg/ml PK for 1 h at 37 °C. The enzyme/protein ratio by weight was 1:50. PK activity was quenched by adding 10 μl of 100 mm PMSF to achieve a final concentration of 2 mm. Unless otherwise stated, 500 μg of lysate aliquots (at 1 mg/ml) were supplemented with 0.75% PTA (final concentration from 10% stock solution in water, pH 7), 1% Sarkosyl (SA, from a 30% stock solution), and a PI mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking at 350 rpm and centrifuged at room temperature for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The pellets were washed with 0.75% PTA and PI-supplemented lysis buffer, then centrifuged again. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer by vigorous vortexing and stored at −20 °C until further use. Unless otherwise stated, 500-μg lysate aliquots (at 1 mg/ml) were supplemented with 1% Sarkosyl (from a 30% stock solution) and a PI mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer by vigorous vortexing and stored at −20 °C until further use. Normalized aliquots of untreated, PK-digested, PTA-pelleted, and SA-pelleted extracts were prepared as described above. A volume of 30 μl of normalized lysate was added to 10 μl of 4× loading buffer and 1× dithiothreitol (50 mm). Samples were boiled for 5 min and run on an Invitrogen NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris gel for Western blot analysis using either D13 or EST123 antibodies. Capture ELISA plates (96-well, Greiner) were coated with Fab D18 as described previously (21.Ghaemmaghami S. Phuan P.W. Perkins B. Ullman J. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17971-17976Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Normalized aliquots of untreated, PK-digested, PTA-pelleted, or SA-pelleted extracts were prepared as described in the supporting online material. An aliquot of lysate was diluted with 8 m GdnHCl (Pierce) in 3:1 ratio and heated to 85 °C for 15 min. Upon cooling to room temperature, 60 μl of the denatured lysates were added to D18-coated ELISA plates containing 240 μl of 1% BSA in PBS per well. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, the plate was washed three times with TBST (10 mm TrisHCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 0.5% Tween-20). To each well of the plate, 100 μl of HRP-conjugated D13 (1:1000 dilution from 1 mg/ml stock) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was washed seven times with TBST and then 100 μl of ABTS was added per well and developed for 15–20 min before reading. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined by using a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader running SoftMaxPro. All readings were converted to PrP concentration by comparison to a standard concentration ladder composed of varying concentrations of purified, recombinant, full-length mouse PrP. Before plotting, all concentration measurements were normalized with respect to a negative reference sample. Superdex 200 beads (Sigma) were used in 1 × 30-cm columns at room temperature using an Akta FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were loaded with 200 μl of lysates at 3 mg/ml and run at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with PBS (pH 7) and 1% Sarkosyl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. For PK digestion, PTA centrifugation, SA centrifugation, and Western immunoblotting, 500 μl fractions were used. N2a-cl3 cells were grown to confluency in 10-cm tissue culture plates (Corning) in 10 ml of MEM (Invitrogen MEM, 10% FBS, 1× GlutaMAX, 1× penicillin-streptomycin, Geneticin), and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Total protein concentration was measured by BCA, and cell lysates were normalized to 1 μg/μl in lysis buffer. For insoluble PrPA, 150 μg of total protein was obtained from N2a-cl3 cells treated with 10 μg/ml PAMAM-G4 for 48 h. For rPrPSc, 150 μg of total protein from ScN2a-cl3 cells was digested with 3 μg of PK (1 μg/μl stock concentration) for 1 h at 37 °C; to stop the digestion, 3 μl of PMSF (100 mm in ethanol stock concentration) were added. Both N2a-cl3 and ScN2a-cl3 samples were precipitated with PTA; pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl in a final volume of 480 μl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 60 μl of each sample was loaded per well in triplicate for capture ELISA as described above. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Total RNA was quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Total RNA (1.5 μg) was used for cDNA synthesis using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit with oligo(dT) (23VN) primers for selection of messenger poly(A) tail RNA transcripts (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). cDNA product was diluted 1:20 in DNase/RNase-free water (Invitrogen), and 4.2 μl was used for Sybr Green qPCR reaction. To the cDNA, 5 μl of Sybr GreenER qPCR master mix (Invitrogen) was added and 0.4 μl each of 0.5 μm 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotides passed primer efficiency quality tests. The sequences for the ActB primers were: 5′-gatcattgctcctcctgagc and 3′-ctcatcgtactcctgcttgc. The Prnp primers were 5′-cgagaccgatgtgaagatga and 3′-atcccacgatcaggaagatg. Total volume for the qRT-PCR reaction was 10 μl in a 384-well plate. Amplifications and readings were done in a 7900 HT Applied Biosystems instrument. Preliminary data analysis was performed using the SDS software, and subsequent comparative CT analysis was done using the average cycle threshold data from the SDS data. N2a-cl3 cells were plated on a poly-lysine D-coated coverslip (Fisher), then treated with 10 ng/ml of PAMAM-G7 for 24 h. Cells were briefly rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with wash buffer (0.2% BSA/Ca-free and Mg-free PBS) for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and then rinsed with wash buffer for 15 min. Cells were treated with 3 m GdnSCN in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 8 min, then blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 20 min. Cells were then incubated with D18 antibody (5 μg/ml) in 10% NGS overnight at 4 °C. Samples were rinsed with wash buffer for 15 min and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then rinsed with wash buffer for 15 min, and with water briefly, air-dried, and then mounted on Superfrost plus microscope slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Slides were coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), sealed with nail polish, and visualized under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. To prepare whole cell homogenate samples for infectivity bioassays, 10-cm diameter plates of PAMAM-treated or untreated confluent cells were washed once with 5 ml of PBS, scraped into 1 ml of PBS, then homogenized by repeated extrusion through a 26-gauge needle. Cell homogenate (100 μl) was added to 900 μl of diluent, consisting of 5% BSA in PBS. A volume of 30 μl of this preparation was intracerebrally inoculated into Tg(MoPrP)4053 mice that express MoPrP-A at 8× levels compared to wild-type mice. To prepare PTA-precipitated pellets for infectivity bioassays, 250 μg of total protein from cell lysate was either left undigested or digested with PK as described, then precipitated with PTA as described. The PTA pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and added to 900 μl of diluent (5% BSA in PBS); 30 μl of this preparation was intracerebrally inoculated into Tg(MoPrP)4053 mice. We created and cloned a new transgenic N2a cell line, denoted N2a-cl3, that expresses PrP at 6-fold greater levels compared with wild-type (wt) N2a cells (supplemental Fig. S1). N2a-cl3 cells are highly susceptible to infection with RML prions. Importantly, prion-infected N2a-cl3 (ScN2a-cl3) cells form rPrPSc at levels that are within the same order of magnitude as those found in the brains of RML-infected, wild-type mice (supplemental Fig. S1). We characterized the PrPSc population in ScN2a-cl3 cells based on two biochemical properties: 1) resistance to proteolysis by PK, and 2) insolubility in PTA. These two properties have been previously attributed to prion preparations from infected cells and tissues, and both properties are absent in endogenous PrPC (8.Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D.

We found that in ScN2a-cl3, the amount of PrP that is PTA insoluble is greater than the amount that is resistant to PK digestion (Fig. 1A). The discrepancy between the amounts of PK-resistant and PTA-insoluble PrP is not an artifact of limited overdigestion of the protease-resistant population. Our data show that the PK digestion of the PrP pool is distinctly biphasic, with a protease-sensitive population that is rapidly digested and a protease-resistant population that is at steady-state within the time frames (60 min) and protease concentrations (1:50 PK/protein) used in our experiments (supplemental Fig. S2). These observations indicate that at least two distinct PrPSc populations in ScN2a-cl3 cells precipitate in the presence of PTA: one is protease-sensitive (sPrPSc, ∼30%) and another is protease-resistant (rPrPSc, ∼70%). sPrPSc may represent a metabolic precursor to rPrPSc, a transiently populated degradation product, or a distinct self-propagating strain that is off-pathway relative to the formation of rPrPSc. Having quantified relative levels of sPrPSc and rPrPSc conformers in ScN2a-cl3 cells, we investigated whether known antiprion compounds could alter their relative amounts. Numerous compounds have been identified that induce the clearance of rPrPSc in prion-infected cultured cells (for review, see Ref. 22.Trevitt C.R. Collinge J. Brain. 2006; 129: 2241-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The effect of such compounds on protease-sensitive, misfolded PrP conformers has not been previously investigated, but it has been assumed that these antiprion compounds lead to the complete clearance of all PrP aggregates. We asked if some of these compounds might act by shifting the equilibrium of misfolded PrP conformers from protease-resistant to protease-sensitive aggregates. We analyzed the effects of 7 different antiprion compounds (Fig. 1, A and B and supplemental Table S1) that were previously reported to reduce PrPSc levels in ScN2a cells (15.May B.C. Fafarman A.T.

However, their abilities to clear protease-sensitive, misfolded PrP conformers (measured by the difference between the levels of PTA-precipitated and PK-resistant PrP populations after treatment) were more limited. For many of these compounds, substantial levels of protease-sensitive, misfolded PrP conformers persisted after 5 days of treatment using concentrations that fully cleared rPrPSc. Notably, we observed that the addition of Generation 4 polyamidoamine (PAMAM-G4) caused a dramatic increase in the concentration of protease-sensitive, PTA-precipitable PrP conformations (Fig. 1, A and B). Western blots (Fig. 1B) indicate that the protease-sensitive, PTA-precipitable PrP population resulting from PAMAM-G4 treatment contains glycoforms of full-length PrP, with the diglycosylated band migrating at an apparent molecular mass of 33–35 kDa. In contrast, sPrPSc and rPrPSc in ScN2a-cl3 cells are composed primarily of N-terminally truncated PrP with a diglycosylated band of 27–30 kDa (Fig. 1B). To distinguish PAMAM-induced, PTA-precipitable PrP from sPrPSc, we refer to it as PrPA. Given the aforementioned difference in apparent molecular mass, we conclude that in ScN2a-cl3 cells, PAMAM-G4 treatment does not directly convert PrPSc to PrPA, but rather causes the de novo formation of PrPA from PrPC. We monitored the accumulation of misfolded PrP conformers over the course of 4 days after the addition of PAMAM-G4 (Fig. 1C). During log-phase growth, the process of cell division leads to a transient decrease in rPrPSc levels even in the absence of antiprion compounds (21.Ghaemmaghami S. Phuan P.W. Perkins B. Ullman J. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17971-17976Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To measure the kinetics of PrPA induction by PAMAM-G4 alone, cell growth was halted by the addition of sodium butyrate. Comparison of a confluent, stationary ScN2a-cl3 culture to division-arrested, sodium butyrate-treated culture indicated that sodium butyrate alone does not induce the clearance of rPrPSc (supplemental Fig. S3). We observed that after ∼20 h, PAMAM induced a marked increase in the total PrP populations in both infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 1C). The increase in PrP levels did not result from increased transcription of Prnp mRNA (supplemental Fig. S4) but coincided with the accumulation of PrPA that was insoluble in both PTA and the non-denaturing detergent sodium lauryl sarcosine (Sarkosyl). PrPA could be induced in both N2a-cl3 and ScN2a-cl3 cells and to a lesser extent in N2a and hypothalamic GT1 cells that do not overexpress PrP (supplemental Fig. S5). The PAMAM-G4 concentration required to induce PrPA in N2a-cl3 cells was similar to that needed to clear rPrPSc in infected ScN2a-cl3 cells (Fig. 1D). In contrast to rPrPSc, PrPA exhibited a broad size distribution as observed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, Fig. 2, A and B). Although most PrPA eluted within or near the void volume, we found PTA-insoluble PrP that eluted in later fractions, suggestive of low-order PrP oligomers. Similar to rPrPSc, PrPA has an altered conformation with a buried epitope for at least one of two anti-PrP antibodies: PrPA was undetectable by an ELISA that used D13 and D18 as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, prior to GdnHCl-induced unfolding (Fig. 2C). Upon treatment with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl, PrPA appeared to be almost as stable as rPrPSc (Fig. 2D). PAMAMs are branched, monodisperse polymers (also known as starburst dendrimers) consisting of a core ethylenediamine molecule and “spokes” of amidoamines radiating out in a quasi-spherical structure (Fig. 3A) (31.Lee I.S. Long J.R. Prusiner S.B. Safar J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 13802-13803Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Successive polymerization reactions create larger (higher generation) PAMAMs with increasing numbers of free amino or carboxylate groups on the surface. PAMAMs have been used as antiviral drugs, tissue repair scaffolds, targeted carriers of chemotherapeutics and optical oxygen sensors. They are used extensively as transfection reagents and carriers of nucleic acids. In fact, the antiprion properties of PAMAMs were discovered by the observation that PAMAM-based transfection of prion-infected cell lines led to prion clearance (23.Supattapone S. Nguyen H.O.

We investigated the ability of different generation PAMAMs to induce PrPA and clear rPrPSc (23.Supattapone S. Nguyen H.O. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14529-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24.Supattapone S. Wille H. Uyechi L. Safar J. Tremblay P. Szoka F.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. J.

We found that positively charged PAMAMs (G1, 2, 3, 4, 5) promote the formation of PrPA and induce the clearance of rPrPSc, whereas negatively charged PAMAMs (G1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5) have the inverse effect (Fig. 3). These two diametrical properties are more pronounced for larger (higher generation) PAMAMs. We utilized confocal microscopy to visualize the localization of PAMAM-induced PrPA in cells.

Previously, we reported that TRIM5αrh also blocks HIV-1 production in a B30.2(PRYSPRY)-independent manner. Efficient encapsidation of TRIM5αrh, but not human TRIM5α (TRIM5αhu), in HIV-1 virus-like particles suggests the interaction between Gag and TRIM5αrh during viral assembly. Here, we determined responsible regions for late restriction activity of TRIM5αrh. The RING disruption, but not the replacement with human TRIM21 RING, ablated the efficient encapsidation and the late restriction, suggesting that a RING structure was essential for the late restriction and efficient interaction with HIV-1 Gag. The prominent cytoplasmic body formation of TRIM5αrh, which depended on the coiled-coil domain and the ensuing linker 2 region, was not required for the encapsidation. Intriguingly, TRIM5αrh coiled-coil domain mutants (M133T and/or T146A) showed impaired late restriction activity, despite the efficient encapsidation and cytoplasmic body formation. Our results suggest that the TRIM5αrh-mediated late restriction involves at least two distinct activities as follows: (i) interaction with HIV-1 Gag polyprotein through the N-terminal, RING, and B-box 2 regions of a TRIM5αrh monomer, and (ii) an effector function(s) that depends upon the coiled-coil and linker 2 domains of TRIM5αrh. We speculate that the TRIM5αrh coiled-coil region recruits additional factor(s), such as other TRIM family proteins or a cellular protease, during the late restriction.

Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). When HIV-1 production surpasses the late restriction activity, HIV-1 virions or virus-like particles (VLPs) produced in the presence of TRIM5αrh protein incorporate high levels of intact and truncated forms of TRIM5αrh (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Efficient encapsidation of TRIM5αrh is also evident in HIV-1 Gag-only particles (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that TRIM5αrh interacts with HIV-1 Gag polyproteins before or during Gag assembly and that Gag maturation is not necessary for the Gag-TRIM5αrh interaction during the late restriction. HIV-1 protease appears to cleave TRIM5αrh to produce the truncated 20-kDa form of TRIM5αrh in the VLPs, because HIV-1 protease inhibitors block the formation of the 20-kDa form in the VLPs (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, this truncation of TRIM5αrh is not necessary for the late restriction, because TRIM5αrh RBCC-TRIM5αhu B30.2(PRYSPRY) chimeras exhibit efficient VLP incorporation and potent late restriction activities without showing remarkable truncation (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When compared with TRIM5αrh, human TRIM5α (TRIM5αhu) shows marginal antiviral activity on HIV-1 production (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat.

Med. 2008; 14: 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Little or no encapsidation of TRIM5αhu protein in HIV-1 virions or HIV-1 VLPs (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) implies weaker interaction of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins with TRIM5αhu than TRIM5αrh. A series of TRIM5αrh-TRIM5αhu chimeric constructs reveal that the RBCC (RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil) domain, but not the B30.2(PRYSPRY) domain, of TRIM5αrh determines both the late restriction activity as well as the encapsidation efficiency (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A series of C-terminally HA-tagged TRIM5αrh mutants with deletions in the N- or C-terminal regions indicate the following: (i) the B30.2(PRYSPRY) domain is dispensable for the late restriction activity and efficient encapsidation of TRIM5αrh; (ii) the coiled-coil domain is essential for the late restriction but not for the efficient encapsidation, and (iii) the N-terminal region is essential for efficient TRIM5α encapsidation (16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the domains responsible for the TRIM5α-mediated late restriction using TRIM5αrh-TRIM5αhu chimeras and deletion/point mutants. We found that a RING structure and the TRIM5αrh B-box 2, coiled-coil, and ensuing linker 2 domains are required for the late restriction activity, efficient VLP encapsidation, and prominent cytoplasmic body formation. Intriguingly, TRIM5αrh coiled-coil point mutants with M133T and/or T146A were efficiently incorporated into VLPs but did not strongly block HIV-1 production. Our data suggest that the TRIM5αrh-mediated block of HIV-1 production involves at least two distinct activities, including interaction with HIV-1 Gag through the N-terminal region, RING and B-box 2 regions of TRIM5αrh, and an effector function(s) that depends upon the coiled-coil and linker 2 region of TRIM5αrh. 293T and GHOST(3)R3/X4/R5 (21Mörner A. Björndal A. Albert J. Kewalramani V.N. Littman D.R. Inoue R. Thorstensson R. Fenyö E.M. Björling E. J.

The N-terminal deletion mutant D0 has the first 14 amino acids replaced with a single amino acid Met, whereas the C-terminal deletion mutants SP1 and CC1 have the deletions in the B30.2(PRYSPRY) region and the B30. 2(PRYSPRY) and coiled-coil region, respectively (16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All the RBCC chimeric constructs as well as point mutants were generated by extension PCR. pLPCX-based TRIM5αrh RING motif mutants, TRIM5 + 21R and C15A/C18A, as well as their parental pLPCX-TRIM5αrh were kindly provided by Dr. Sodroski (4Stremlau M.

Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce HIV-1. 293T cells (106 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were transfected with 1.0 μg of a TRIM5α expression plasmid together with 0.2 μg of pNL4-3 by 6 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total DNA concentrations were adjusted to 1.2 μg with pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Forty eight hours post-transfection, supernatants were harvested and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. Viral titers in the supernatants were determined in GHOST(3)R3/X4/R5 indicator cells. The concentrations of p24 in the supernatants were assayed with the p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ZeptoMetrix). For immunoblotting analysis of TRIM5α and HIV-1 Gag proteins, the transfected cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotting analysis. Following transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, TRIM5α protein was detected by rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 3F10 (Roche Applied Science), whereas mouse anti-p24 monoclonal antibodies, AG3.0 (24Simm M. Shahabuddin M. Chao W. Allan J.S. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4582-4586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 183-H12–5C (25Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Nishio J. Perryman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6547-6554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used to detect HIV-1 precursor Gag and p24 capsid proteins. For treatment with proteasome inhibitors, 293T cells, which were transfected with a TRIM5α expression plasmid and pNL4-3, were treated with various concentrations of proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Sigma) or MG115 (Sigma), for 16 h before cells were harvested for immunoblotting. 293T cells (106 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were transfected with 0.3 μg of pH-GP together with 0.9 μg of a TRIM5α-expressing plasmid with 6 μl of FuGENE 6. The amounts of plasmid DNA were adjusted to 1.2 μg with pcDNA3.1(+) for each transfection. Forty eight hours post-transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and passed through a 0.45-μm pore-sized filter. VLPs in 1 ml of supernatants were purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. The pellets of VLPs were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 10 μl of RIPA buffer. Proteins were separated by 4–15% gradient gel SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science) or anti-p24 monoclonal antibody mixtures (AG3.0 and 183-H12-5C). Use of gradient gels was critical to visualize both the intact and truncated forms of TRIM5αrh. 293T cells were transfected with a TRIM5α expression plasmid as described above. Sixteen hours post-transfection, cells were resuspended, seeded in 8-well Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International), and cultured for 20 h. Cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin at 4 °C for 30 min. HA-tagged TRIM5α mutants were detected with a rat anti-HA antibody 3F10 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody. Nuclei were counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Subcellular localization of TRIM5α proteins was determined under a confocal microscope. Previously, we have shown that the deletion in the first 14 amino acid residues prior to the RING consensus sequence abrogates the efficient VLP encapsidation as well as the strong late restriction activity of TRIM5αrh (16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Similarly, N-terminally FLAG-tagged TRIM5αrh did not show strong late restriction activity (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the N-terminal region of TRIM5αrh is required for interaction with HIV-1 Gag polyprotein or for proper TRIM5α conformation. To further understand the domains necessary for the late restriction, we first tested the influence of mutations in the TRIM5αrh RING domain on the late restriction activity. Two RING domain mutants, TRIM5-21R and C15A/C18A, were used to assess the importance of the RING motif in TRIM5αrh (Fig. 1). TRIM5-21R is a TRIM5αrh with the RING domain replaced with the human TRIM21 RING domain (13Diaz-Griffero F. Vandegraaff N. Li Y. McGee-Estrada K. Stremlau M. Welikala S. Si Z. Engelman A. Sodroski J. Virology. 2006; 351: 404-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Li X. Song B. Xiang S.H. Sodroski J. Virology. 2007; 366: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Li Y. Li X. Stremlau M. Lee M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas C15A/C18A is a TRIM5αrh with a disrupted RING structure (27Li Y. Li X. Stremlau M. Lee M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To examine the influence of these RING mutations on HIV-1 production, 293T cells were transfected with a TRIM5α expression plasmid and an HIV-1 infectious molecular clone pNL4-3. As a control, we used the parental construct, pLPCX-TRIM5αrh, which expresses an HA-tagged wild-type TRIM5αrh. The viral titers in the supernatants were then determined in GHOST indicator cells. The TRIM5-21R showed late restriction activity comparable with the wild-type TRIM5αrh, whereas C15A/C18A showed impaired late restriction (Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that a RING domain is required for the late restriction. Because TRIM5-21R exhibits a longer half-life than TRIM5αrh (27Li Y. Li X. Stremlau M. Lee M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that rapid degradation of TRIM5αrh is not required for the late restriction. Next, we examined whether these RING mutants can interact with the Gag protein by encapsidation into VLPs made with a codon-optimized HIV-1 Gag-Pol. 293T cells were co-transfected with TRIM5α- and codon-optimized Gag-Pol-expressing plasmids. VLPs purified through a 20% sucrose layer were analyzed for TRIM5α incorporation (Fig. 1C). A truncated form of TRIM5α (∼20 kDa) was readily detected in the VLPs made in the presence of wild-type TRIM5αrh and TRIM5-21R but not C15A/C18A. When TRIM5αrh was expressed without HIV-1 Gag-Pol proteins, no TRIM5αrh protein could be detected in the pellets (Fig. 1D). Although full-length and truncated (20 kDa) forms of TRIM5α protein were observed in cell lysates, the 20-kDa form was predominant in the VLPs, ruling out the possible precipitation of TRIM5αrh-containing cell debris without VLP encapsidation. These data indicate that a RING domain is required for the efficient interaction with HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. The block of HIV-1 entry appears to occur independently of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the TRIM5αrh-mediated post-entry restriction (9Javanbakht H. Diaz-Griffero F. Stremlau M. Si Z.

Sodroski J. Virology. 2006; 349: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), although more recent studies have demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors can partially relieve the TRIM5α-dependent inhibition of reverse transcription without affecting the restriction of HIV-1 nuclear entry (2Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 15Barr S.D. Smiley J.R. Bushman F.D. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000007Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We examined the influence of proteasome inhibitors on the late restriction. 293T cells were co-transfected with pRhT5α and pNL4-3. One day after transfection, the supernatants were replaced with fresh growth medium containing a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 or MG115. After an overnight treatment, culture supernatants and producer cells were harvested. Because of the potent toxicity of MG132 and MG115, we did not determine the viral titers. To assess the effects of proteasome inhibitors, the HIV-1 Gag proteins in the producer cells were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). Although we observed the toxicity associated with higher concentrations of proteasome inhibitor treatment, MG132 or MG115 treatment did not affect the TRIM5αrh-mediated block of HIV-1 Gag production. Our results therefore suggest that the late restriction occurs independently of the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Our previous studies using TRIM5αhu-TRIM5αrh chimeras have shown that the TRIM5αrh RBCC domain contains the determinant for the late restriction (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Sakuma R. Ohmine S. Mael A.A. Noser J.A. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (author reply): 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To further map the responsible element(s) in TRIM5αrh-mediated restriction on HIV-1 production, we generated five additional TRIM5α RBCC chimeras, RBCC1 to RBCC5, by extension PCR. After verification of the expression of these chimeras (Fig. 2B), we examined the antiviral activity of each chimeric TRIM5α protein as described above. RBCC1 to RBCC4 showed strong antiviral activity comparable with the wild type, whereas the chimera RBCC5, which has the RING and B-box 2 domains of TRIM5αrh and coiled-coil and B30.2(PRYSPRY) domains of TRIM5αhu, exhibited impaired antiviral activities (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the coiled-coil domain of TRIM5αrh is required for the late restriction. We then examined whether these chimeras could interact with HIV-1 Gag protein by encapsidation assay. We found all chimeras were incorporated into VLPs (Fig. 2D), although RBCC2 and RBCC3 showed reduced levels of incorporation. These results suggested that the five chimeric TRIM5αs can interact with the Gag protein, and the linker region between the RING and B-box 2 domains, or the conformation of this region, affects the interaction. RBCC5 showed reduced antiviral activity yet maintained the incorporation capacity of the protein, indicating that the interaction of TRIM5α with HIV-1 Gag alone is insufficient for the late restriction activity. In addition, TRIM5α RBCC5 was incorporated into VLPs as an intact, full-length form but not in a truncated form, which confirmed our previous observation that HIV-1 protease efficiently cleaves TRIM5αrh in the B30.2(PRYSPRY) domain but not TRIM5αhu (12Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There are seven amino acid differences between human and rhesus monkey TRIM5α in the BclI-HindIII region, which contains the B-box 2 and partial coiled-coil domains. To determine the amino acid residues responsible for the late restriction and encapsidation, we replaced each of these seven amino acids with a corresponding TRIM5αhu amino acid residue (Fig. 2A). After confirming the expression of these TRIM5αrh mutants (Fig. 2E), we examined their antiviral activities against HIV-1. Five TRIM5αrh mutants showed antiviral activities comparable with the wild type, although two TRIM5αrh coiled-coil domain mutants, M133T and T146A, showed impaired late restriction activity (Fig. 2F). We also generated a coiled-coil mutant, TRIM5αrh-MT/TA, with the two critical amino acid substitutions M133T and T146A. The antiviral activity of this mutant was comparable with the antiviral activities of M133T and T146A (Fig. 2F). We then examined the encapsidation efficiencies of these mutants. When HIV-1 VLPs were made in the presence of TRIM5αrh mutants, all point mutants, including the TRIM5αrh-MT/TA, were efficiently inc"
https://openalex.org/W2028126930,"Physiological studies of ion channel regulation have implicated the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) as an effector of Rac1 GTPase signaling, but direct biochemical evidence for PP5 regulation by Rac1 is lacking. In this study we used immunoprecipitation, in vitro binding, cellular fractionation, and immunofluorescence techniques to show that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of PP5 interacts specifically and directly with active Rac1. Consequently, activation of Rac1 promoted PP5 translocation to the plasma membrane in intact cells and stimulated PP5 phosphatase activity in vitro. In contrast, neither constitutively active RhoA-V14 nor dominant negative Rac1N17, which preferentially binds GDP and retains an inactive conformation, bound PP5 or stimulated its activity. In addition, Rac1N17 and Rac1(PBRM), a mutant lacking the C-terminal polybasic region required for Rac1 association with the membrane, both failed to cause membrane translocation of PP5. Mutation of predicted contact residues in the PP5 tetratricopeptide repeat domain or within Rac1 also disrupted co-immunoprecipitation of Rac1-PP5 complexes and membrane translocation of PP5. Specific binding of PP5 to activated Rac1 provides a direct mechanism by which PP5 can be stimulated and recruited to participate in Rac1-mediated signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2038881205,"Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) contains a unique autoinhibitory insert (AI) in its FMN subdomain that represses nNOS reductase activities and controls the calcium sensitivity of calmodulin (CaM) binding to nNOS. How the AI does this is unclear. A conserved charged residue (Lys(842)) lies within a putative CaM binding helix in the middle of the AI. We investigated its role by substituting residues that neutralize (Ala) or reverse (Glu) the charge at Lys(842). Compared with wild type nNOS, the mutant enzymes had greater cytochrome c reductase and NADPH oxidase activities in the CaM-free state, were able to bind CaM at lower calcium concentration, and had lower rates of heme reduction and NO synthesis in one case (K842A). Moreover, stopped-flow spectrophotometric experiments with the nNOS reductase domain indicate that the CaM-free mutants had faster flavin reduction kinetics and had less shielding of their FMN subdomains compared with wild type and no longer increased their level of FMN shielding in response to NADPH binding. Thus, Lys(842) is critical for the known functions of the AI and also enables two additional functions of the AI as newly identified here: suppression of electron transfer to FMN and control of the conformational equilibrium of the nNOS reductase domain. Its effect on the conformational equilibrium probably explains suppression of catalysis by the AI."

Heart failure remains the leading cause of death in the world. As one of the least regenerative organs in the body, the heart wall is primarily composed of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and fibroblasts that are tightly packed with supporting vasculature and collagen-rich extracellular matrix. Following myocardial infarction, an enormous number of dead CMs are replaced by thick, stiff fibrous scars, resulting in the heart's reduced contractile function and, ultimately, heart failure. Clearly, understanding how such a complex organ develops from various different progenitors in the body will help us to unlock the full potential of stem cell biology for cardiovascular therapy (reviewed in Hansson et al., 2009Hansson E.M. Lindsay M.E. Chien K.R. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 364-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cardiac tissue engineering endeavors to generate functional tissue constructs that can reestablish the structure and function of the injured myocardium. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can generate bona fide CMs, as well as the supporting vascular cells. In an earlier study (Caspi et al., 2007Caspi O. Lesman A. Basevitch Y. Gepstein A. Arbel G. Habib I.H. Gepstein L. Levenberg S. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), the Gepstein laboratory showed that, when CMs and endothelial cells (ECs) derived from hESCs are cultured with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) within a three-dimensional scaffold, they recapitulate early embryonic heart development. Now, in their current work, the same group demonstrates that tissue-engineered vascularized cardiac muscle, generated ex vivo, can form stable grafts in vivo (Lesman et al., 2009Lesman A. Habib M. Caspi O. Gepstein A. Arbel G. Levenberg S. Gepstein L. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2009; (in press. Published online July 30 2009)https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0130Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Implantation of thick, complex constructs has always been a challenge in tissue engineering. Once implanted, the engineered cardiac grafts must endure a hostile ischemic microenvironment with a minimal diffused oxygen supply and high metabolic demand. Consequently, significant cell death follows transplantation, even in the absence of an injury model, mainly due to insufficient graft vascularization. The degree of graft vascularization is crucial not only for the survival and integration of the engineered cardiac grafts, but also for their proper contractile function. Prevascularization of cardiac grafts can be done either in vivo or in vitro. Recently, the Cohen laboratory designed a strategy for the in vivo prevascularization of cardiac grafts by heterotypic transplantation onto the omentum (Dvir et al., 2009Dvir T. Kedem A. Ruvinov E. Levy O. Freeman I. Landa N. Holbova R. Feinberg M.S. Dror S. Etzion Y. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14990-14995Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A porous alginate scaffold was seeded with neonatal CMs in a mixture of Matrigel with prosurvival and angiogenic factors; once tissue organization was achieved, the engineered cardiac graft was transplanted onto the omentum, a blood-vessel-enriched membrane, for further maturation and vascularization. A sustained release of angiogenic factors was able to attract ECs and other perivascular cells, resulting in a highly vascularized engineered cardiac graft. This graft was then explanted and transplanted onto an infarcted heart, demonstrating structural and electrical integration into the host myocardium. An alternative strategy involves prevascularizing the engineered construct in vitro by providing vascular cells and angiogenic factors. Previously, the Langer laboratory demonstrated an approach for the in vitro prevascularization of skeletal tissue constructs (Levenberg et al., 2005Levenberg S. Rouwkema J. Macdonald M. Garfein E.S. Kohane D.S. Darland D.C. Marini R. van Blitterswijk C.A. Mulligan R.C. D'Amore P.A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). In vitro prevascularization was found to require the triculture of myoblasts, ECs, and fibroblasts to generate stable vascularization within the engineered skeletal muscle constructs. In their recent report, the Gepstein laboratory describes a well-designed and well-controlled study to engineer a vascularized cardiac muscle in vitro. Engineered cardiac tissue con-structs were generated by culturing hESC-derived CMs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and MEFs in synthetic biodegradable scaffolds coated with Matrigel (Figure 1). After 2 weeks in culture, the engineered constructs were fully vascularized and exhibited synchronized beating. Upon grafting onto rat hearts, these triculture cardiac constructs exhibited a superior and more complex vascularization than transplanted scaffolds containing only hESC-derived CMs. Additionally, more CD31+ and α-SMA+ cells were found in the triculture constructs, suggesting their integration with the host vasculature. These exciting findings support the hypothesis that perivascular cell precursors, such as embryonic fibroblasts, can serve as active partners with ECs in forming stable and functional blood vessels (Hirschi et al., 1998Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The research suggested three vital roles played by embryonic fibroblasts in the formation of stable blood vessels. First, this population was spread diffusely throughout the cardiac graft, suggesting their role in laying down extracellular matrix to direct vascular morphogenesis. Second, MEF-derived cells were found mostly near the vessel wall and were positive for α-SMA, suggesting that they differentiated into vascular smooth muscle cells to provide physical integrity to the vessels. Third, the triculture systems were found to highly express vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor BB, and angiopoietin-1—all angiogenic factors necessary for the survival of ECs. In a larger context, these findings highlight the importance of combining different cell types to capitalize on their synergistic roles in engineering functional tissue constructs. Once the prevascularized cardiac constructs can anastomose with the host vasculature, the next challenge is to promote CM maturation and synchronization with the electrical syncytium of the existing myocardium, rather than maintaining their own spontaneous contractile activity. Indeed, upon engraftment, the prevascularized cardiac constructs were able to induce CM maturation into elongated and multinucleated myotubes, which contained gap junctions and were organized anisotropically (Lesman et al., 2009Lesman A. Habib M. Caspi O. Gepstein A. Arbel G. Levenberg S. Gepstein L. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2009; (in press. Published online July 30 2009)https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0130Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the degree of CM maturation varied among rats, raising the question of whether the degree of graft vascularization affects CM maturation. Early and late markers of CM differentiation and maturation were highly upregulated in the triculture system but not observed in scaffolds containing only hESC-derived CMs (Lesman et al., 2009Lesman A. Habib M. Caspi O. Gepstein A. Arbel G. Levenberg S. Gepstein L. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2009; (in press. Published online July 30 2009)https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0130Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These findings add to the growing body of evidence linking vascularization and tissue differentiation (Jain, 2003Jain R.K. Molecular regulation of vessel maturation.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), which is crucial when bioengineering a complex and highly vascularized organ. Yet, a critical issue remains: the functional status of the engineered cardiac grafts. Because the hallmark of a functional adult heart is its ability to propagate intricate electrical impulses and to beat synchronously, a relatively immature CM must be further developed, for example by electromechanical stimulation (Vunjak-Novakovic et al., 2009Vunjak-Novakovic G. Tandon N. Godier A. Maidhof R. Marsano A. Martens T. Radisic M. Tissue Eng. Part B Rev. 2009; (in press. Published online October 15 2009)https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0352Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and tested in vitro prior to transplantation (Song et al., 2009Song H. Yoon C. Kattman S.J. Dengler J. Massé S. Thavaratnam T. Gewarges M. Nanthakumar K. Rubart M. Keller G.M. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; (in press. Published online October 21 2009)https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0905729106Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to investigate how the degrees of CM maturation, vascularization, and tissue perfusion affect the electrophysiological function of the engrafted heart. As the emerging field of cardiovascular engineering moves closer to clinical application, this elegant work from the Gepstein laboratory raises several new questions for investigation. Recent exciting findings on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) open the possibility of creating patient-specific therapies for cardiac regeneration. However, engineering an autologous cardiac graft from iPSCs without genetic transformation remains to be addressed. Another critical challenge is to engineer a fully defined construct that can be transplanted into a patient without any animal byproducts. As a proof of concept, most cardiac grafts to date have used Matrigel or other animal-derived matrices to facilitate cell adhesion and vascularization. The challenge remains to develop a xeno-free matrix that mimics the in vivo microenvironments, directs CM differentiation, induces vascularization, and supports tissue organization. Combining the best of both worlds—stem cell biology and tissue engineering—the next era of cardiac regeneration could be closer than ever."

The profragment, LPHα, comprises homologous domains I and II and functions as an intramolecular chaperone in the context of the brush-border LPHβ region of LPH. Here, we analyze the inter-relationship between homologous domains III and IV of LPHβ and their implication in the overall structure, function, and trafficking of LPH. In silico analyses revealed potential domain boundaries for these domains as a basis for loop-out mutagenesis and construction of deletion or individual domain forms of LPH. Removal of domain IV, which contains lactase, results in a diminished phlorizin hydrolase activity, lack of dimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but accelerated transport kinetics from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. By contrast, deletion of domain III, which harbors phlorizin hydrolase, generates a malfolded protein that is blocked in the ER. Interestingly, homologous domain III is transport-competent per se and sorted to the apical membrane in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Nevertheless, it neither dimerizes nor acquires complete phlorizin hydrolase activity. Our data present a hierarchical model of LPH in which the homologous domain III constitutes (i) a fully autonomous core domain within LPH and (ii) another intramolecular chaperone besides the profragment LPHα. Nevertheless, the regulation of the trafficking kinetics and activity of domain III and entire LPH including elevation of the enzymatic activities require the correct dimerization of LPH in the ER, an event that is accomplished by the non-autonomous domain IV.

Finally, LPHβinitial is sorted in the trans-Golgi network with high fidelity (>90%) to the apical or brush-border membrane of the enterocytes.

This has raised the question whether these domains behave as autonomous regions and attain their enzymatically active conformation independently of each other in the context of the folding of the LPH. Moreover, the question as to which domain is more important concerning trafficking and sorting events is still unanswered. In this study, we investigate the influence of each of the two homologous domains comprised by mature LPHβ, i.e. domains III and IV, on the structural and functional features of LPH by directed change of domain composition. Tissue culture dishes were obtained from Greiner (Hamburg, Germany). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimum essential medium, streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, fetal calf serum, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from BioWest (Essen, Germany). DEAE-dextran, pepstatin, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, trypsin, Triton X-100, SDS, and molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were acquired from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). l-[35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Freiburg, Germany).

Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) were used to dissect the LPH domains. Structural alignments were also used to build models of domains III and IV using SWISS-MODEL (31Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5994) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-LPH was generated by cloning the wild type LPH cDNA in the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with the EcoRI sites of pLPH (32Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPH was fused to YFP by subcloning the EcoRI/ScaI fragment from pcDNA3-LPH containing full-length LPH in-frame into the EcoRI/SmaI-digested pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) to create pLPH-YFP. A construct comprising the signal sequence and homologous domain III (D3) of LPH was made by inserting a stop codon into the plasmid pJB20-LPHβfinal with the same system generating plasmid pD3. For the generation of a GFP fusion protein, the cDNA encoding the signal sequence of LPH and homologous domain III was amplified by PCR with pD3 as template and cloned into the EcoRI/AgeI-digested pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara). The applied oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma and are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1A list of the wild type and mutant constructs used in this study Open table in a new tab COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with DNA using DEAE-dextran essentially as described previously (32Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were biosynthetically labeled with 80 μCi of [35S]methionine in methionine-free minimum essential medium. Labeling was performed either continuously or following a pulse- chase protocol where the labeled cells were chased with non-radioactive methionine for different periods of time. In some experiments, the biosynthetically labeled cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with 50 μl/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously by Naim et al. (32Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment is intended to probe for cell surface expression of wild type LPH and the deletion mutants. Immunoprecipitation of LPH or the deletion mutants from detergent extracts of the labeled cells was performed according to Naim et al. (12Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using a mixture of mAb anti-LPH (HBB 1/909 and MLac1, MLac2, MLac4, MLac6, and MLac10), and V496. This mixture recognizes different conformations of LPH. Immunoprecipitates were treated with endo H or endo F (both from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) where indicated according to Naim et al. (12Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) followed by analysis using SDS-PAGE. The radioactively labeled protein bands were visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified with Quantity One® software (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). To generate stable MDCK cell lines expressing domain III (MDCK-D3), the cells were transfected using Metafectene Pro obtained by Biontex (Martinsried, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Selection of stable cells was performed in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml active G418 (Carl Roth GmbH), and after 14–21 days, colonies were isolated and subcultured, and stable transformants were screened by immunoprecipitation. For the analysis of sorting behavior, MDCK-D3 cells were cultured on Transwell filters (obtained from Greiner) and biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine. Proteins that have been secreted into the apical and the basolateral medium, respectively, were isolated by adding anti-LPH mAb and protein A-Sepharose to the removed media. Intracellular proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation after cell lysis. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. To assess the sensitivity of the mutants to trypsin, immunoprecipitated proteins were washed for an additional two times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and were supplemented with 10 μg of bovine serum albumin as a carrier and incubated with 0.33 mg/ml trypsin for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to gel electrophoresis. COS-1 cells were biosynthetically labeled and solubilized in 6 mm dodecyl-β-m-maltoside (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto an 11.5-ml sucrose gradient that consisted of 10–30% or 15–25% sucrose (w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm dodecyl-β-m-maltoside and the same protease inhibitors applied for immunoprecipitation except phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C and divided into 0.5-ml fractions followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. COS-1 cells grown on coverslips were transfected, and confocal images of living cells were acquired 2 days after transfection on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with a ×63 water Plan-Apochromat lens (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany) (34Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and processed with the public domain ImageJ software package (available through the National Institutes of Health). For colocalization studies, the cells were co-transfected with GFP- or YFP-tagged LPH cDNA or the mutant LPH cDNA and the protein marker for the ER ER-DsRed and for the Golgi apparatus Golgi-CFP (Clontech-Takara). Lactase and phlorizin hydrolase activities were assessed as follows. The 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with 100 μl of this buffer containing lactose or phlorizin at 28 mm final concentrations. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the amount of released glucose was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The quantification of the specific activity was related to the radioactive protein band detected by phosphorimaging and the number of methionines for each construct. LPH comprises four extracellular regions that contain 38–55% identical residues (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). An interval of about 100 amino acids within each domain is even more homologous, and this internal homology can also be found by comparison of LPH primary sequences of different species. Although the function of domains I and II that constitute the profragment or proregion of LPH, LPHα, has been assessed before and shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone, the individual roles of the two other domains III and IV are poorly understood. The impact of these homologous domains on the generation of a transport-competent configuration of LPH was addressed in conjunction with the question of whether either domain can fold independently. For this, we first generated several cDNA constructs, each lacking the coding region of one homologous domain (Fig. 1B). In silico analysis provided us with potential domain boundaries as a basis for site-directed loop-out mutagenesis. Fig. 1A shows main structural and functional features of human intestinal LPH. Fig. 1C presents homology-based models of domains III and IV showing typical TIM barrel structure of family 1 glycoside hydrolases. To examine the contribution of each of the two homologous domains to the structural, functional, and trafficking features of LPH, the LPH deletion mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells, and their characteristics were compared with those of wild type LPH (Fig. 2). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated, and the precipitated proteins were treated with endo H to determine their glycosylated state as a measure of trafficking capacity (Fig. 2, A and B). LPHΔ4 partially acquired endo H resistance, compatible with complex glycosylation of this deletion mutant in the Golgi apparatus. By contrast, the mutant lacking homologous domain III, LPHΔ3, was not transport-competent, and the introduction of a spacer containing seven glycines to avoid possible sterical hindrances did not alter its trafficking characteristics. Assessment of the proportions of the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated forms after scanning of the gels revealed a substantial increase in the proportion of the complex glycosylated LPHΔ4 as compared with the wild type counterpart (Fig. 2B). This was surprising because it indicated that the deletion of domain IV in LPHΔ4 leads to a more rapid processing of this deletion mutant than the wild type protein. We further investigated the subcellular distribution of the mutant proteins in more detail by confocal laser microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, LPHΔ3 was retained intracellularly and colocalized with the ER-DsRed marker (Fig. 2D). By contrast, and consistent with the biochemical data, LPHΔ4 colocalized with markers of the ER, the Golgi, and it was also detected at the plasma membrane, similar to the wild type protein (Fig. 2, C–E). The delivery of LPHΔ4 to the cell surface was assessed by probing its accessibility to trypsin in intact cells that were biosynthetically labeled for 4 h. Trypsin cleaves LPH at Arg868/Ala869 to a protein band of 155–160 kDa (LPHβfinal) (Fig. 1A) (see Refs. 15Wüthrich M. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 16Jacob R. Radebach I. Wüthrich M. Grünberg J. Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and for a review, see Ref. 20Naim H.Y. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 553-561PubMed Google Scholar), which remains thereafter resistant to this protease. Because LPHΔ4 contains the trypsin site Arg868/Ala869, a cleaved product derived from this mutant should be generated provided that this protein is expressed at the cell surface. This cleavage product should be substantially smaller in size than its trypsin-cleaved wild type counterpart, LPHβfinal, due to the deletion of domain IV. Fig. 2F demonstrates that trypsin has cleaved LPHΔ4 in intact cells to a band of ∼70 kDa. Similarly, wild type LPH was also cleaved at the cell surface to a band of ∼155–160 kDa. In both cases, the wild type LPH and LPHΔ4, the mannose-rich forms were not cleaved, compatible with an intracellular localization of these protein forms and also with the specificity of the trypsin assay in cleaving only those forms that are exposed at the cell surface. Markedly, the majority of the complex forms of both wild type LPH and LPHΔ4 were cleaved by trypsin, implying a rapid transport of these proteins to the cell surface after terminal glycosylation. Therefore, the differences in the kinetics of trafficking between wild type LPH and LPHΔ4 are restricted to the pathway between the ER and the Golgi. By contrast to wild type LPH and LPHΔ4 no cleavage products could be detected with LPHΔ3 (not shown), supporting the notion that this deletion form is located intracellularly. Dimerization of LPH in the ER is absolutely required for LPH to egress this organelle to the Golgi apparatus (35Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). The differential intracellular distribution and maturation patterns of the deletion mutants as well as the variable proportions of the glycoforms have altogether lead us to examine the quaternary structures of the mutants and assess their relevance to their transport out of the ER. Fig. 3A depicts the results obtained using sucrose density gradients. As has been previously shown, the mannose-rich LPH form was retained in the light as well as dense gradient fractions concomitant with its monomeric and dimeric states, respectively, and indicative of dimerization occurring along the early secretory pathway. The complex glycosylated protein, on the other hand, is detected exclusively in the dense fractions, indicating that the dimerization of the mannose-rich forms of LPH precedes its complex glycosylation and maturation in the Golgi (35Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the transport-competent LPHΔ4 deletion mutant did not require dimerization of its mannose-rich form in the ER prior to ER egress. As shown in Fig. 3A (the second top panel), the mannose-rich form of LPHΔ4 persisted as a monomeric protein, and the complex glycosylated LPHΔ4 initially appeared in the monomeric fractions. The majority of the complex glycosylated molecules were mainly found in the denser gradient fractions. Interestingly, complex glycosylated LPHΔ4 was revealed in two peaks in the gradient, compatible with two quaternary states, a dimeric and presumably a tetrameric state. A tetrameric LPHΔ4 form would be in line with the results obtained by Panzer et al. (36Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for the LPH1646MACT mutant lacking 236 amino acids at the C terminus of homologous domain IV. By contrast, LPHΔ3 was exclusively detected in the lighter fractions of the gradients in its mannose-rich glycoform, compatible with retention in the ER as a monomeric protein. We next analyzed the transport kinetics of the mutants in comparison with wild type LPH in pulse-chase experiments. Here, the immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with endo H to clearly discriminate between the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated forms. Complex glycosylated endo H-resistant LPHΔ4 appeared within 1.5 h of chase, and its proportion was substantially higher than its counterpart in the wild type protein (Fig. 3B, compare also Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that it is more efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus than wild type LPH. By contrast, LPHΔ3 persisted as an endo H-sensitive mannose-rich polypeptide, compatible with ER localization. The Gly spacer containing LPHΔ3-7xGly mutant also revealed similar biosynthetic features as LPHΔ3 (not shown). The variations in the quaternary structure of the deletion mutants as well as in their transport kinetics raised the question of causal folding variations. We therefore examined the folding of these mutants by using three procedures. In the first, the mutants were probed for their protease sensitivity using trypsin; in the second procedure, the enzymatic activities of the mutants were measured; and finally, in the third procedure, reactivity of the mutants with epitope-specific antibodies was assessed. The tryptic digestion patterns of the wild type and mutant proteins are depicted in Fig. 3C. Wild type LPH was digested to two main bands corresponding to cleaved mannose-rich and complex glycosylated LPH (see also Ref. 3Behrendt M. Keiser M. Hoch M. Naim H.Y. Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 2295-2303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This pattern did not change with prolonged digestion times. Similarly, LPHΔ4 pattern was also cleaved to two protein products that correspond to the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated forms. The smaller apparent molecular weights products fit well with a reduction corresponding to the size of the deleted domain IV. In a fashion similar to wild type LPH, the cleaved products of LPHΔ4 were also resistant to trypsin. Importantly, the cleavage of LPHΔ4 to the final products was not preceded by major intermediate cleaved forms, suggesting that one major trypsin site is exp"

A compound identified from this small molecule library, cadein1 (cancer-selective death inducer 1), an isoquinolinium derivative, effectively leads to a G2/M delay and caspase-dependent apoptosis in various carcinoma cells with non- functional p53. The ability of cadein1 to induce apoptosis in p53-defective colon cancer cells was tightly linked to the presence of a functional DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, which is an important determinant in chemosensitivity. Cadein1 was very effective in MMR+/p53− cells, whereas it was not effective in p53+ cells regardless of the MMR status. Consistently, when the function of MMR was blocked with short hairpin RNA in SW620 (MMR+/p53−) cells, cadein1 was no longer effective in inducing apoptosis. Besides, the inhibition of p53 increased the pro-apoptotic effect of cadein1 in HEK293 (MMR+/p53+) cells, whereas it did not affect the response to cadein1 in RKO (MMR−/p53+) cells. The apoptotic effects of cadein1 depended on the activation of p38 but not on the activation of Chk2 or other stress-activated kinases in p53-defective cells. Taken together, our results show that cadein1 may have a potential to be an anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent that is preferentially effective on p53-mutant colon cancer cells with functional MMR.

Taken together, our results show that cadein1 may have a potential to be an anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent that is preferentially effective on p53-mutant colon cancer cells with functional MMR. The p53 tumor suppressor is essential for maintaining genomic stability in mammals. When cells are subjected to stress signals such as hypoxia, radiation, or chemotherapeutic drugs, p53 is activated, and its ubiquitin-dependent degradation is blocked leading to an accumulation of active p53 transcription factor (1Fuster J.J. Sanz-González S.M. Moll U.M. Andrés V. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 192-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Activated p53 regulates most downstream signals for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by affecting the expression of its target genes. Transcriptional targets of p53 include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21/WAF1, and genes involved in cell death, including BAX, PUMA, NOXA, and Fas (2Gudkov A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 444-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 3Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L.

Because p53 activation inhibits cell proliferation, mutation of the p53 gene or disruption of pathways that lead to p53 activation has been frequently observed in most types of human cancer (4El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7486-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The p53-dependent induction of apoptosis in response to genotoxic damages is an important aspect of tumor suppression. Thus, the loss of p53 in human cancers not only contributes to aggressive tumor behavior but often leads to resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. For example, treatment of p53+/+ mouse thymocytes with radiation results in apoptosis, whereas p53−/− thymocytes are resistant. p53+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts transformed by adenoviral E1A protein and Ha-ras oncogene undergo apoptosis in response to γ-irradiation or chemotherapeutic agents, whereas p53−/− fibroblasts are resistant to these anti-cancer therapies (5Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). In addition, some p53 mutations in cancers suppress the function of p73, which induces apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism (6Li Y. Prives C. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, the common loss of p53 function in cancer cells presents a major limitation for anti-cancer therapies. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 3The abbreviations used are: MMRDNA mismatch repairPARPpoly(ADP-ribose)polymeraseATMataxia-telangiectasia mutatedMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. is a post-replicative DNA repair process that corrects single-base mismatches and small mismatched loops in the daughter strand of newly replicated DNA. Loss of MMR by mutation of MSH2 or MLH1 is responsible for the majority of cases of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and is also common in a variety of sporadic cancers including endometrial, ovarian, breast, prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancer (7Fishel R.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In addition to an increased rate of mutation throughout the genome, the loss of MMR often alters the sensitivity to some therapeutic DNA damaging agents. MMR deficiency results in strong resistance to the base analog, antimetabolite 6-thioguanine, moderate resistance to methylating agents, such as N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and temozolomide, and weak resistance to cisplatin and carboplatin (10Griffin S.

In the case of cisplatin, the loss of both MMR and p53 leads to a cooperative increase in resistance and limits the therapeutic potential of cisplatin for colon cancer (14Lin X. Ramamurthi K. Mishima M. Kondo A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1508-1516PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not clear, the decreased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents caused by loss of MMR is likely to be due to decreased levels of apoptosis resulting from impaired detection of DNA adducts or a failure to initiate repair (11Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.H. Longley M.J. Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).

In this study we prepared a small library based on the backbone of protoberberine and screened for compounds with effective anti-proliferative activity. In particular, we searched for an anti-proliferative compound selective to cells without wild type p53 function, as loss of p53 function is a common feature of most cancer cells and often accompanies resistance to anti-cancer therapeutics. A new isoquinolinium derivative, cadein1 (cancer-selective death inducer 1), was identified in the screen, which induces apoptosis most effectively in p53-defective carcinoma cells with functional MMR. The apoptotic effect of cadein1 in cancer cells depends on the activation of p38. Given that decreased sensitivity to chemotherapies in human cancer cells without functional p53 is a major drawback of cancer treatment, cadein1 may be a potent anti-cancer agent against human cancers, specifically p53-deficient cancers with functional MMR. Cadein1 (C33H48ClF3NO2, Mr 564.20), an isoquinolinium salt, was synthesized as follows. Briefly, 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (Aldrich) was acylated with long chain acid chloride (CH3(CH2)14COCl, triethylamine/ethylene dichloride, room temperature, 95%) to yield amide. Amide was subsequently treated with phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3, CH3CN, reflux, 82%) to give isoquinoline, which was further reacted with 2, 6-difluorobenzyllbenzyl chloride (2,6-F2C6H4CH2Cl, CH3CN, reflux, 62%) to yield the desired isoquinolinium salt as a yellow solid. The isoquinolinium salt compound was verified by spectroscopic analysis (1H NMR, 13C NMR, high resolution mass spectrometry). WI-38 human normal lung fibroblast cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (all from HyClone, Logan, UT). Human normal lung fibroblast IMR90, human cervical carcinoma HeLa, and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. SW620 and RKO human colon cancer cells were grown in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium and minimum Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. The four sublines of HCT116 human colorectal adenocarcinoma, HCT116, HCT116-Ch3, HCT116-E6, and HCT116-Ch3/E6, human colorectal cell lines (HT29, DLD-1, and SW480), and H1299 human lung cancer cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. The chromosome-complemented lines (HCT116-Ch3 and HCT116-Ch3/E6) were maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418, and the cell lines expressing Papillomavirus E6 (HCT116-E6 and HCT116-Ch3/E6) were cultured in medium supplemented with 80 μg/ml hygromycin B. All cells were cultured in 5% CO2 in a medium with penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C. For screening of 80 isoquinolinium derivatives, cells were grown for 1 day to 60–70% confluence and treated with various concentrations of derivatives. To determine the anti-proliferative effects of isoquinolinium derivatives including cadein1, the morphology of the cells was observed with a phase contrast microscope (Fig. 1B, Model CK2, Olympus Optical Co.). A stock solution of cadein1 (1 mg/ml) was prepared in 70% (v/v) ethanol. Stock solutions of berberine (1 mg/ml) and SB203580 (10 mm, AG Scientific) were prepared by dissolving these compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to the final concentration in media. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were grown for 1 day to 60–70% confluency and treated with various concentrations of cadein1. Cells were synchronized at G1/S by a modified double thymidine block (15Stein G.S. Borun T.W. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, cells were trypsinized, fixed with cold 70% ethanol (−20 °C), treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma), and stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). The DNA content of cells was measured by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Cell Quest software. Cell proliferation was evaluated by spectrophotometric measurement of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (16Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46481) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 103 cells/ml) were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates for 1 day and incubated with varying concentrations of cadein1 (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 9 μm) for 24 h. After incubation with MTT (5 mg/ml), the dissolved formazan product was measured on a microplate reader (SOFTmax PRO 4.0). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 17 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Specific proteins were detected using the following primary antibodies: phospho-p38, p38, p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68), phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), p38, PARP, phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin E (NeoMarkers, Fremonts, CA); MLH1, p53 (BD Pharmingen); γ-H2AX(Ser-139) (Upstate biotechnology, NY). Immunoreactive bands were normalized to those of control actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or α-tubulin (Calbiochem). Wild type p53 in pcDNA3.1 and pSuper-Neo-p53 were kindly provided by Dr. H. W. Lee (Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea) and Dr. J. Shin (Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea), respectively. shp53-pLKO.1 puro vector was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). pSuperRetro-shMLH1 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Zhitkovich (Brown University). The cells were transfected with those constructs using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transient transfection of wild type p38 and dominant-negative p38 in HeLa cells was performed with the Effectene kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The use of phytochemicals as anti-cancer chemotherapeutics has attracted considerable interest. Among 121 prescription drugs in use for cancer therapy, 90 are derived from natural plant sources (17Craig W.J. J. Am. Diet Assoc. 1997; 97: S199-S204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Craig W.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 70: 491S-499SCrossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Protoberberine-derived alkaloids, such as berberine, have a wide range of pharmacological activities, including cytotoxicity against several carcinomas in vitro (19Orfila L. Rodríguez M. Colman T. Hasegawa M. Merentes E. Arvelo F. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2000; 71: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Iizuka N. Oka M. Yamamoto K. Tangoku A. Miyamoto K. Miyamoto T. Uchimura S. Hamamoto Y. Okita K. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated a privileged small scale chemical library by modifying one of the two isoquinoline rings of protoberberine (Fig. 1A and Ref. 21Kim H.J. Park J.E. Jin S. Kim J.H. Song K. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and screened the anti-proliferative effects of 80 isoquinolinium derivatives in several carcinoma cell lines and non-cancerous cells (Fig. 1B). Given that decreased sensitivity to anti-cancer agents in p53-deficient human cancer cells is the major limitation to cancer therapeutics, our search was focused on identifying an anti-proliferative compound selective to cells without wild type p53 function (Fig. 1B). Thus, in the screen we compared the anti-proliferative effect of each compound in p53-negative cancer cells, such as HeLa and HCT116-Ch3/E6, and in p53-positive HEK293 cells and IMR90 primary cells. Among these compounds, one new isoquinolinium derivative efficiently blocked the proliferation of p53-negative carcinoma cells but not of normal cells (data not shown). We designated this isoquinolinium derivative, cadein1 (cancer-specific death inducer 1). The anti-proliferative effect of cadein1 in p53-negative carcinoma cells was very strong compared with the lead compound berberine (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C, cadein1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells at 6 μm, whereas the lead compound, berberine, did not affect HeLa cells at low concentrations (15 μm or less). To determine the optimal conditions for cadein1 treatment, we first performed MTT assays to assess the effective concentration range for inhibition of cell growth in HeLa, IMR90, and WI-38 cells. As observed in the screen, HeLa cells with non-functional p53 were more sensitive to cadein1 than were p53-positive IMR90 and WI-38 primary cells (Fig. 2A). The viability of HeLa cells was 18.6% at 6 μm cadein1, whereas IMR90 and WI-38 cells were 61.55 and 74.13% viable, respectively (Fig. 2A). Additionally, in low concentrations (9 μm or less) of cadein1, a strong cytotoxic effect was observed in other p53-defective carcinoma cells including human colorectal HT29, SW480, SW620, and HCT116-Ch3/E6 cells and human lung cancer H1229 cells (data not shown). These observations strongly suggest that cadein1 is able to inhibit the proliferation of p53-deficient cancer cells. To examine whether cadein1-induced cell death is the result of apoptosis, we evaluated the expression of proteins in the apoptotic pathway after cadein1 treatment. Because the cleavage of PARP (substrate of caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase) is a hallmark of apoptotic cell death, whole cell lysates from HeLa and WI-38 were subjected to Western blotting using the antibody against cleaved-PARP. When incubated with 6 μm cadein1 for 12 h, activated PARP was significantly detected in HeLa cells, but no cleaved PARP was observed in WI-38 cells (Fig. 2B). We analyzed the cadein1-induced apoptotic cell death by examining the expression of caspase-3 (effecter caspase) and PARP in HeLa and IMR90 cells after treatment with cadein1. When cells were treated with 6 μm cadein1, as expected, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were detected in a time-dependent manner in HeLa cells but not in IMR90 cells (Fig. 2C). These results confirm that cadein1-induced apoptosis in p53-defective cancer cells is mediated by activation of caspase-3. To better assess the hypersensitivity of p53-negative cells to cadein1, the DNA content of cells was analyzed after incubation with 9 μm cadein1 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2D, the sub-G1 fraction, which presumably contains dying cells, was highly increased in HeLa cells (9 μm, 50.27%), whereas a negligible sub-G1 fraction was observed in IMR90 cells (9 μm, 2.11%). These observations showed that, at low concentrations, cadein1 efficiently induces cell death in HeLa cells but not in IMR90 cells, supporting that p53-defective cancer cells are more sensitive to cadein1 than p53-positive normal cells. To investigate the effect of cadein1 on cell cycle progression, we analyzed the cell cycle profiles of cadein1-treated HeLa cells. After synchronization at G1 via a double thymidine block, HeLa cells were released from the G1 block in the presence of 4 μm cadein1. Cadein1 induced a transient G2/M delay in HeLa cells as compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 2E). In addition, cyclin A degradation was delayed, and cyclin B persisted in the cadein1-treated cells over 24 h (Fig. 2E), suggesting that a cell cycle delay at G2/M occurs in response to cadein1 treatment. However, cyclin E was not detectable in these cells due to the G2/M delay (Fig. 2E). Because p53 cooperates with the MMR to induce cell death in response to some chemotherapeutic compounds in colon cancer cells (14Lin X. Ramamurthi K. Mishima M. Kondo A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1508-1516PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of an MMR deficiency on cadein1-induced cell death of p53-negative cells was examined. We assessed the cytotoxic effect of cadein1 across a panel of sublines of the MMR-deficient HCT116 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells because each HCT116 subline contains different combinations of p53 and MMR functions in the same genetic background. Four sublines of HCT116 colon cancer cells were used: HCT116 (MMR−/p53+), HCT116-Ch3 (MMR+/p53+), HCT116-E6 (MMR−/p53−), and HCT116-Ch3/E6 (MMR+/p53−). HCT116 contains a hemizygous mutation in hMLH1 resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional protein (22Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I. Lipford J.R. Kane M. Yin S. Barrett J.C. Kolodner R.D. Kunkel T.A.

The chromosome 3-complemented cells (identified here as HCT116-Ch3 and HCT116-Ch3/E6) are competent in DNA mismatch repair, as MMR function has been restored by transfer of a copy of MLH1 on chromosome 3 (14Lin X.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4308-4312PubMed Google Scholar). In HCT116-E6 and HCT116-Ch3/E6 cell lines, constitutive high level expression of the human Papillomavirus type-16 E6 gene disrupts p53 function, as it promotes the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 (14Lin X. Ramamurthi K. Mishima M. Kondo A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1508-1516PubMed Google Scholar). The HCT116 sublines were exposed to a range of cadein1 (0–4 μm) for 24 h, and the anti-proliferative effect of cadein1 on the HCT116 sublines was measured by an MTT assay. Exposure to cadein1 caused a dose-dependent loss of cell viability (Fig. 3A). The percentages of cell viability in HCT116-Ch3/E6 (MMR+/p53−), HCT116-E6 (MMR−/p53−), HCT116-Ch3 (MMR+/p53+), and HCT116 (MMR−/p53+) cells treated with 4 μm cadein1 were 17.7, 49, 55.4, and 68.6%, respectively (Fig. 3A). The HCT116-Ch3/E6 (MMR+/p53−) cells displayed the most significant sensitivity to cadein1 among the four HCT116 sublines. Although this line does not have functional p53, the HCT116-E6 (MMR−/p53−) cells had decreased sensitivity to cadein1 relative to HCT116-Ch3/E6 cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the viability of HCT116-Ch3 (MMR+/p53+) cells and of HCT116 (MMR−/p53+) cells was not much different at low doses of cadein1 (4 μm or less) even though they have different MMR phenotypes. MMR-deficient cells were resistant to cadein1 even in a p53-negative background (E6-expressed cells; HCT116-Ch3/E6 and HCT116-E6 cells). However, the loss of MMR did not affect the cadein1 sensitivity of p53-proficient cells. These results demonstrate that p53-negative colon cancer cells are selectively sensitive to cadein1, and functional MMR leads to more profound cadein1-induced cell death in p53-deficient cells (Fig. 3A). To understand the selectivity and mechanism of cadein1-induced apoptotic cell death in HCT116 cell sublines, we evaluated the expression of proteins in the apoptotic pathway after cadein1 treatment. Cleaved PARP was most significantly detected in cadein1-treated HCT116-Ch3/E6 (MMR+/p53−) cells relative to other HCT116 sublines (Fig. 3B). We also confirmed apoptotic effect of cadein1 by evaluating the expression of caspase-3 in these cells. As expected, cleaved caspase-3 was detected only in HCT116-Ch3/E6 cells treated with 4 μm cadein1 (Fig. 3C), verifying that cadein1-induced apoptosis in p53-defective cancer cells is mediated by activation of caspase-3. Altogether these observations confirmed that p53-negative cells were more sensitive to cadein1, and the effect of p53 dependence was only observed in MMR-proficient cells. In short, the activity of p53 and MMR determines the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of cadein1. To confirm the function of MMR and p53 for cadein1-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells, we tested other colon cancer cells, HT29 (MMR+/p53−) and DLD-1 (MMR−/p53−), for sensitivity to cadein1. As expected, the viability of HT29 cells that have nonfunctional p53 and functional MMR (MMR+/p53−) was severely decreased by cadein1 relative to DLD-1 (MMR−/p53−) cells (Fig. 4A). Noticeably, the viability in HT29 cells treated with cadein1 was 10.6% at 4 μm, whereas the viability of DLD-1 cells was 51% at 4 μm (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the results obtained from HCT116 sublines (Fig. 3, B and C), activated caspase-3 and PARP were significantly detected in HT29 (MMR+/p53−) cells treated with at least 5 μm cadein1 for 12 h but were not in cadein1-treated DLD-1 (MMR−/p53−) cells (Fig. 4B). These results confirm that only MMR-proficient cells are sensitive to cadein1 when p53 is nonfunctional. In HT29 cells, ∼90% inhibition of growth was observed in Fig. 4A, whereas a 25% cleavage of PARP was detected in Fig. 4B. This discrepancy between the MTT assay and the apoptotic markers is likely due to the difference in incubation time with cadein1. HT29 cells were incubated with cadein1 for 24 h in the MTT assay of Fig. 4A and for 12 h in Fig. 4B. In fact, the % of viable cells was 47.11% for the 12 h incubation but 9.75% for the 24-h incubation in HT29 cells treated with 5 μm cadein1 (supplemental Fig. 1). The function of MMR and p53 for cadein1-induced apoptosis is further studied in MMR-positive SW620 (MMR+/p53−) and p53-positive RKO (MMR−/p53+) colon cancer cells. Consistent with the results obtained from the HCT116 sublines, SW620 cells (Fig. 5, A and B) were more sensitive to cadein1 than RKO cells (Fig. 5, C and D). To validate the role of MMR and p53 in cadein1-induced apoptosis, MMR or p53 functions were knocked down with short hairpin RNAs in SW620 (Fig. 5, A and B) and RKO (Fig. 5, C and D) cells. The viability of SW620 cells was 32% at 4 μm cadein1, whereas MMR-depleted SW620 (shMLH1-transfected SW620) cells were 70% viable by 4 μm cadein1 treatment (Fig. 5A). When these cells were treated with 4 μm cadein1, activated PARP was not detected in MMR- depleted SW620 cells (shMLH1-transfected SW620 cells), although these cells are p53-negative (Fig. 5B). In contrast to MMR-depleted SW620 cells, MMR-deficient RKO cells that were knocked down with p53 did not change the sensitivity to cadein1 (Fig. 5C), and the PARP cleavage was not observed (Fig. 5D). These observations also support the notion that cadein1-induced apoptosis in p53-deficient colon cancer cells depends on the function of MMR. To confirm the role of p53 in cadein1-induced apoptosis, p53- and MMR-positive HEK293 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA p53 and then treated with cadein1. Although the HEK293 cells were not normal cells, they were MMR- and p53-positive cells and have reduced sensitivity to cadein1 relative to HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 2). When cells were treated with 6 μm cadein1, the viability of HeLa cells was 18.6%, whereas HEK293 cells were 61.6% viable (supplemental Fig. 2A). In addition, with 6 μm cadein1 treatment, the cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were detected in HeLa cells in a time-dependent manner, whereas the activation of caspase-3 and PARP was not detected in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. 2B). As shown in supplemental Fig. 2C, the sub-G1 fraction was highly increased in HeLa cells (9 μm, 50.3%), whereas a negligible sub-G1 fraction was observed in HEK293 cells (9 μm, 2.93%). Thus, we evaluated the expression of apoptotic proteins in cadein1-treated HEK293 cells where p53 was depleted by small interfering RNA p53. As shown in Fig. 5E, 92% of HEK293 cells were viable at 4 μm cadein1, whereas the viability at 4 μm cadein1 was 45% in p53-depleted HEK293 cells. In addition, when treated with 4 μm cadein1 for 12 h, the cleaved caspase3 was detected only in p53-depleted HEK293 cells but not in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5F). These observations support that the loss of p53 is directly associated with cadein1-induced apoptosis when MMR is functional. We further studied our results that cadein1 induces apoptosis in p53-deficient cells with functional MMR by examining whether the recovery of p53 abrogates cadein1 sensitivity in MMR-proficient cells. HT29 (MMR+/p53−) cells were transfected with a p53-expressing vector, and their proliferative capacity was tested by MTT assay after treatment with a range of cadein1 concentrations (supplemental Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in contrast to what was observed in HT29 cells, the cytotoxic effect of cadein1 was reduced in p53-overexpressed HT29 cells. These results were verified by the reduction of cleaved PARP and caspase3 in p53-overexpressing HT29 cells relative to p53-deficient HT29 cells (supplemental Fig. 3B). In contrast to p53-overexpressing HT29 cells, neither the activation nor the reduction of cleaved PARP and caspase3 was detected in p53-overexpressing DLD-1 (MMR−/p53−) cells relative to p53-deficient DLD-1 cells (data not shown). These observations, even though they were performed under ectopic overexpression of p53, show that the decreased cadein1 sensitivity of p53-transfected cells is due to the expression of functional p53 and that the effect of p53 depends on the presence of functional MMR. Taken together, these results confirm that MMR function facilitates the cadein1-induced apoptosis in p53-negative cancer cells and functional p53 enables cells to resist to cadein1 even in the presence of MMR. We verified the role of p53 in cadein1-induced apoptosis in other p53-deficient cells. HeLa cells were examined after transfection with a p53-expression plasmid. Activated caspase3 was strongly detected in cadein1-treated HeLa cells, as previously described in supplemental Fig. 3B. However, consistent with the results obtained from HT29 cells, the level of cleaved caspase3 in response to cadein1 trea"
