https://openalex.org/W1966100684,"The TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, BDNF, have an essential role in certain forms of synaptic plasticity. However, the downstream pathways required to mediate these functions are unknown. We have studied mice with a targeted mutation in either the Shc or the phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) docking sites of TrkB (trkB(SHC/SHC) and trkB(PLC/PLC) mice). We found that hippocampal long-term potentiation was impaired in trkB(PLC/PLC) mice, but not trkB(SHC/SHC) mice. BDNF stimulation of primary neurons derived from trkB(PLC/PLC) mice fully retained their ability to activate MAP kinases, whereas induction of CREB and CaMKIV phosphorylation was strongly impaired. The opposite effect was observed in trkB(SHC/SHC) neurons, suggesting that MAPKs and CREB act in parallel pathways. Our results provide genetic evidence that TrkB mediates hippocampal plasticity via recruitment of PLCgamma, and by subsequent phosphorylation of CaMKIV and CREB."

We demonstrate that the proteins encoded by both classes of cDNAs are endoproteolytically processed in the secretory pathway and are released into conditioned medium of transfected CHO cells. We demonstrate that the mammalian Sulfs exhibit arylsulfatase activity with a pH optimum in the neutral range; moreover, they can remove sulfate from the C-6 position of glucosamine within specific subregions of intact heparin. Taken together, our results establish that the mammalian Sulfs are extracellular endosulfatases with strong potential for modulating the interactions of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular microenvironment.

Taken together, our results establish that the mammalian Sulfs are extracellular endosulfatases with strong potential for modulating the interactions of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular microenvironment. Sulfatases are enzymes that hydrolyze sulfate esters (reviewed in Ref. 1Parenti G. Meroni G. Ballabio A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The majority of the known sulfatases are lysosomal enzymes. Enzymes in this class, working in concert with glycosidases, function in the sequential degradation of sulfated macromolecules. Proteoglycans are the major class of sulfated macromolecules; hence, many of the lysosomal enzymes are specific for the sulfate modifications on glycosaminoglycan chains. Steryl sulfatase, another intracellular sulfatase that hydrolyzes 3-β-hydroxysteroid sulfates, is membrane-bound and localized to microsomes (1Parenti G. Meroni G. Ballabio A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Three other sulfatases have a nonlysosomal localization (2Franco B. Meroni G. Parenti G. Levilliers J. Bernard L. Gebbia M. Cox L.

QSulf-1 was inferred to be a sulfatase, because it possesses a domain closely related to the human lysosomal glucosamine-6-sulfatase (HG6S) 1The abbreviations used are: HG6S, human glucosamine-6-sulfatase; 4-MUS, 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CM, conditioned medium; CMK, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone; EST, expressed sequence tag; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; IdoA, l-iduronic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ΔdiHS-NS, 2- deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-l-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose; ΔdiHS-6S, 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-l-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; ΔdiHS-(N, 6)diS, 2deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-l-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; ΔdiHS-(N, 2)diS, 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-l-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; ΔdiHS-(N, 6,2)triS, 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O- sulfo-l-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; ΔDi-0S, 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-galactose; ΔDi-6S, 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-galactose; ΔDi-4S, 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-d-galactose; ΔDi-diSD(2, 6), 2- acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(2-O-sulfo-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-galactose; ΔDi-diSE(4, 6), 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-bis-O-sulfo-d-galactose; contig, group of overlapping clones; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UTR, untranslated region (5Robertson D.A. Freeman C. Morris C.P. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), an enzyme involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate chains. Antisense experiments strongly implicate QSulf-1 in muscle specification within epiaxial somite progenitors. QSulf-1 is apparently targeted to the secretory pathway in that it is expressed on the cell surface of transfected cells. A close relative of QSulf-1 was subsequently discovered in the rat embryo (6Ohto T. Uchida H. Yamazaki H. Keino-Masu K. Matsui A. Masu M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was named RSulfFP1 due to its prominent expression of transcripts in the floor plate of the developing nervous system. In transfected cells, the protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus and the cell surface. Neither QSulf-1 nor RSulfFP1 was shown explicitly to have sulfatase activity. Here we report the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding the human ortholog (HSulf-1) of QSulf-1 and RSulfFP1 as well as a cDNA encoding a closely related protein, designated HSulf-2, and cDNAs for the mouse orthologs of both Sulfs. We demonstrate that the mammalian Sulfs are endoproteolytically processed and secreted into the extracellular space of transfected cells, where they exhibit both arylsulfatase activity and highly specific endoglucosamine-6-sulfatase activity against intact heparin. For the cloning of HSulf-1, we BLAST screened the GenBankTM databases for genomic sequences related to the KIAA1077 cDNA, a partial human cDNA that is closely related to QSulf-1 (4Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We assembled a 257-kb genomic contig from genomic clones (GenBankTM accession numbersAC013746.10 and AC091047.5) that contained the entire Sulf-1 gene. Using the GeneScan exon prediction program (available on the World Wide Web at genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) in conjunction with EST data displayed in the University of California Santa Cruz human genome browser (available on the World Wide Web at genome.ucsc.edu), we identified a 232-bp sequence within this contig (putative first exon) encoding a signal sequence related to that of the QSulf-1 protein. We derived a forward primer (5′-AAGTATTCTTGCTGTGCTCTGGTTTTGGC-3′) from this putative first coding exon and a reverse primer from the 5′ end of the KIAA1077 cDNA (5′-AGAAGCGAGAATTCTTGATTAATCCAAGCC-3′). A PCR-based pool selection technique was applied to a human prostate “Cap-Finder” cDNA library (BD-Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), leading to the identification of a 4669-bp cDNA. The cDNA was fully sequenced on both strands, confirming the sequence derived by genomic analysis. Using the HSulf-1 cDNA sequence in a BLAST search, we identified a highly related partial cDNA sequence (KIAA1247; accession no. AB033073.1) from humans in the GenBankTM data base. We assembled a 311-kb contig from genomic sequences (AL121777.39, AL354813.31, and AL034418.5) and identified a putative first coding exon as described above. A full-length cDNA was predicted by exon scanning. We then used a forward primer 5′-TGCAGGGAACCTTCAAAGGACT-3′ derived from the first coding exon and a reverse primer 5′-GAAGAAAGCTGTCCGGTAGCCA-3′ derived from the 5′ end of the KIAA1247 cDNA to clone a full-length (4279 bp) human Sulf-2 cDNA from a human lung cDNA library (Origene, Rockville, MD) as described above. A full-length cDNA was obtained and sequenced on both strands. The coding sequence exactly matched the sequence predicted from the exons identified in the genomic contig. In order to clone the mouse Sulf-1 ortholog, we screened the GenBankTM mouse EST data base with the predicted HSulf-1 protein sequence and identified EST BB558850 encoding the N terminus of a potential mouse Sulf-1. We then used forward and reverse primers (5′-TGCAGGGAACCTTCAAAGGACT-3′ and 5′-TTCCTGCTGTATCCTTCCTCGG-3′), both derived from this EST, to clone a full-length (4671-bp) cDNA from a mouse 19-day embryo cDNA library (Origene) by pool selection, as described above. The 870-amino acid protein encoded by this cDNA is 93% identical to human Sulf-1, establishing that it is the mouse ortholog. We used this MSulf-1 cDNA to screen for matching genomic sequences on the Ensembl Mouse Genome Server (available on the World Wide Web at www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus) and identified a genomic sequence from mouse chromosome 1A3 (nt 12,800,000–12,915,000) that contained the entire 140-kb mouse Sulf-1 gene. To clone the mouse Sulf-2 ortholog, we screened the GenBankTM mouse EST data base with the predicted HSulf-2 protein sequence and thus identified EST AW763130 encoding the N terminus of a potential mouse Sulf-2. We obtained this EST from the IMAGE collection (clone 3155559), expanded the plasmid, and sequenced its insert. It contains a full-length 3603-bp cDNA, which encodes a mouse Sulf-2 ortholog of 875 amino acids (95% identical to HSulf-2). Using this cDNA to screen for matching genomic sequences, we identified a genomic sequence from mouse chromosome 2 (AL589873.11) containing the entire 82-kb MSulf-2 gene. The locus of this sequence was then mapped to mouse chromosome 2H3 by screening against the mouse genome assembly on the Ensembl server. We established that the mouse and human loci for the respective Sulfs are syntenic, using markers in the mouse genome informatics data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.informatics.jax.org/searches/oxfordgrid_form. shtm). The syntenic markers used were as follows. For Sulf-1, marker EYA-1: in humans, GenBankTM accession number AJ000098; in mice,AF097544. For Sulf-2, marker TDE-1: in humans, AF112227; in mice, AF181684. Hydropathy analysis was done by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (7Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar). The sulfatase domains and coiled-coil regions were identified by analysis with SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool), which is available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de (8Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Adjustments in the boundaries of the sulfatase domains were made by comparing the sequences with those of QSulf-1 (AAK98515) and HG6S (P15586). Adjustments in the coiled-coil boundaries were made using the prediction program (9Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) located on the World Wide Web at npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_lupas.html. The criteria for the two sulfatase signatures are described at us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/get-prodoc-entry?PDOC00117. The signal sequences were predicted with the Signal P program (10Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar) at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. Alignment of proteins was performed with ClustalW (11Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) at pbil.ibcp.fr/NPSA/npsa_clustalw.html. The dendrogram analysis was performed with Dendromaker (www.cib.nig.ac.jp/dda/timanish/dendromaker/home.html). The choice of furin cleavage sites (12Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) was based on the consensus sequence (K/R)X(K/R)X(K/R)R-P1′ in which at least two of the three (K/R) residues are present. At the P1′ position, an amino acid with a hydrophobic aliphatic chain is not suitable. To determine the expression of mRNAs for HSulf-1 and HSulf-2, PCR was applied to a panel of cDNAs prepared from 24 normal human tissues (Origene Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was used to generate first strand cDNAs. The cDNAs were normalized across tissues to contain an equal concentration of actin transcripts. 371-bp HSulf-1 and 314-bp HSulf-2 cDNA products were amplified using the following PCR primers: for HSulf-1, forward 5′-CTCACAGTCCGGCAGAGCACGCGGAAC-3′, reverse 5′-CACGGCGTTGCTGCTATCTGCCAGCATCC-3′; for HSulf-2, forward 5′-GAAAAGAGGCAGATTCACGTCGTTTCCAG-3′, reverse 5′-ATCTGGTGCTTCTTTTGGGATGCGGGAG-3′. The conditions for denaturation, annealing, and extension of the template cDNA were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s; 64 °C for HSulf-1 and 55 °C for HSulf-2 for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles, respectively. For each source of cDNA, PCR was performed at four different cDNA concentrations (1×, 10×, 100×, and 1000×) using TITANIUMTaqDNA Polymerase (Clontech). The PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. DNA fragments that code for full open reading frames were amplified by PCR using HSulf-1 or HSulf-2 cDNA as template. The forward and reverse primers were as follows (boldface residues are restriction sites for cloning; see below): forward 5′-CAGCATCTCGAGACAATGAAGTATTCTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGGATGGATCCCCTTCCCATCCATCCCA-3′ for HSulf-1; forward 5′-ATCTTACTCGAGAAGATGGGCCCCCCGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CACGATAAGCTTCCTTCCCAGCCTTCCC-3′ for HSulf-2. The conditions for denaturation, annealing, and extension of the template cDNA were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for HSulf-1 and 64 °C for HSulf-2, all for 30 s; and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles, respectively. These PCR products of HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 cDNAs were digested with XhoI and BamHI,XhoI, and HindIII restriction enzymes, respectively, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) (Invitrogen). This 5.5-kb vector is designed for overproduction of recombinant proteins with tandem C-terminal tags consisting of a polyhistidine metal-binding tag and the Myc epitope. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)-HSulf-1 or -HSulf-2 using LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was mixed with Plus reagent and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The complexed DNA was combined with LipofectAMINE reagent, diluted in OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The complexes were added to cells in culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 5 h. After incubation, medium was replaced with OptiMEM. Cells were allowed to grow for an additional 48 h before the conditioned medium (CM) was collected. For Western blotting, CM was concentrated on a Centricon30 microconcentrator (Millipore Corp.), separated by electrophoresis on reducing SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT), and blotted to ProBlott™ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated overnight with an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 0.22 μg/ml in 5% nonfat milk. When the anti-tetra-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia City, CA) was used as the primary antibody, the membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 2 h with the antibody at 0.1 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG1 (0.4 μg/ml) (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h before ECL detection reagents (AmershamBiosciences). To determine the amount of His fusion proteins in CM, a 6× His protein ladder from Qiagen was used as a standard, and protein amounts were determined by standard scanning techniques. For analysis of the cellular distribution of the Sulfs, CM and the cells that conditioned the medium were collected separately. One aliquot of the cells was washed extensively and directly extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C overnight. The soluble extract was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min and termed the “total cell lysate.” An equal aliquot of washed cells was subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing in 1 m NaCl in with protease inhibitors present. The supernatant constituted the “aqueous extract.” The residue collected after centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min) was treated overnight with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS plus protease inhibitors to yield the “detergent extract.” 100-fold concentrated CM derived from each transfection of CHO cells was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. The His-tagged fusion proteins were bound to Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) by rotation at 4 °C overnight and then washed with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, three times. 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, was used to elute the His-tagged fusion proteins from Ni-NTA. The resins with bound material or the eluates were mixed with 10 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4-MUS) and 10 mm lead acetate in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for various times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.5 mNa2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 10.7, to each 20-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture. The fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferone was measured on a multiwell plate reader, CytoFluorII (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. A substrate dose-response curve was performed over the concentration range of 1–10 mm 4-MUS. V max values were approximated from these data employing the estimate of the Sulf protein concentrations in the CM (see above). To determine the pH dependence of the activity, His-tagged fusion proteins bound to Ni-NTA resin were washed with H2O three times and mixed with 10 mm 4-MUS, 10 mm lead acetate, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0 or 7.0) or 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0 or 6.0). Human glucosamine-6-sulfatase was purchased from Glyko Inc. (Novato, CA) and was tested at a concentration of 1 milliunit. In order to block the potential N-formylglycine modification of Cys87 of HSulf-1 and Cys88 of HSulf-2, cysteines 87 and 88 of HSulf-1 (designated as HSulf-1 ΔCC) and cysteines 88 and 89 of HSulf-2 (designated as HSulf-2 ΔCC) were mutated to alanines using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedures of Yoshida et al. (13Yoshida K. Miyauchi S. Kikuchi H. Tawada A. Tokuyasu K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were adapted for these assays. CM from transfected CHO cells (wild-type Sulfs, vector control, or the double cysteine mutants) was prepared as described above. The standard reaction mixture contained 5 μmol of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 μmol of MgCl2, 10 μg of porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma), and 20 μl of the 100-fold concentrated CM in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 8 h, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. A mixture of 1 milliunit of heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7; Sigma), 0.25 milliunits of heparinase II (Sigma), and 0.1 milliunits of heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8; Sigma) in 1.5 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The digestion was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 2 min, and the mixture was filtered by centrifugation in an Ultrafree-MC filter (Millipore). The disaccharides of the digested heparin were then analyzed by HPLC on a Partisil-10 strong anion exchange column (Whatman, Fairfield, NJ) run at 41 °C. Disaccharides were eluted from the column by increasing the ionic strength as follows: time 0–5 min, 12 mmKH2PO4; time 5–40 min, gradient from 12 to 600 mm; time 40–45 min, 600 mm. Absorbance at 232 nm was monitored, and components were identified by comparison with authentic unsaturated disaccharide markers from Sigma (i.e.ΔDiHS-0S, ΔDiHS-6S, ΔDiHS-NS, ΔDiHS-(N,6)diS, ΔDiHS-(N,2)diS, and ΔDiHS-(N,6,2)triS). The endoglucosamine-6-sulfatase activities of human Sulf-1 and Sulf-2 against heparin proceeded linearly up to 10 h under these conditions. In other assays, 10 μg of chondroitin 6-sulfate was employed as a substrate in the standard assay. After incubation with CM, 15 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4; Sigma) was used to fragment the chondroitin sulfate. The standards used were as follows: ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-6S, ΔDi-4S, ΔDi-diSD (2Franco B. Meroni G. Parenti G. Levilliers J. Bernard L. Gebbia M. Cox L. Maroteaux P. Sheffield L. Rappold G.A.

As described under “Experimental Procedures,” this sequence allowed us to assemble a 257-kb genomic contig that contained the entire HSulf-1 gene. Exon analysis, used in conjunction with EST information in the NCBI data base, led to the prediction of a full-length cDNA. We then cloned a 4669-bp full-length cDNA from a human prostate library and confirmed the predicted sequence obtained above. The cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2616 bp, predicting a protein of 871 amino acids (Fig. 1) (GenBankTM accession number AY101175). Based on this cDNA, we identified a highly related sequence (KIAA1247) in the NCBI data base. Using a similar approach to that for HSulf-1, we derived a genomic contig and then isolated a corresponding cDNA sequence from a human lung library. The 4286-bp sequence contained an open reading frame of 2613 bp (GenBankTM accession numberAY101176), predicting a protein of 870 amino acids (Fig.2). This protein is termed HSulf-2. We also identified cDNAs corresponding to apparent mouse orthologs, referred to as MSulf-1 (AY101178) and MSulf-2 (AY101177), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins of 870 and 875 amino acids are predicted from these cDNAs.Figure 2HSulf-2 cDNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence.

These mapped to single copy loci on chromosomes 8q13.2–13.3 and 20q13.12 in humans and on chromosomes 1A3 and 2H3 in mice, respectively. Using markers specified in the mouse genome informatics data base (14Blake J.A. Eppig J.T. Richardson J.E. Davisson M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we established that the loci of human and mouse Sulf-1 and those of Sulf-2 are respectively syntenic. The organization of these genes is depicted in Fig.3 and described in further detail in Table I. The coding sequence of all four genes is split into 18–19 exons dispersed over 50–150 kb. All of the introns in the four Sulf genes feature canonical mammalian GT-AG splice junctions (15Burset M. Seledtsov I.A. Solovyev V.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The last exon is always the longest and encodes the last 9 residues of the gene product as well as the entire 3′-UTR of the mature cDNA. Finally, 5′-UTRs of varying lengths are encoded by a few noncoding exons relatively far 5′ of the first coding exon.Table IGenomic organization of Sulf genesExonHSulf-1MSulf-1HSulf-2MSulf-2SizeAmino acidsSizeAmino acidsSizeAmino acidsSizeAmino acidsbpbpbpbp12805′-UTR2555′-UTR5695′-UTR1411-aExon 1 derived from the 5′- end of EST AW210030 (nt 24–164).5′-UTR2955′-UTR955′-UTR2755′-UTR, 1–582675′-UTR, 1–583735′-UTR735′-UTR24059–13824059–13842325′-UTR, 1–572315′-UTR, 1–57152139–189152139–189524058–13724058–137170190–246170190–2466152138–188152138–188151247–296151247–2967170189–257170189–257176297–355176297–3558151246–295151246–295129356–398129356–3989176296–354176296–35457399–41757399–41710129355–397129355–397130418–460130418–4601157398–41657398–416196461–525211461–53012130417–459130417–459229526–602229532–60713217460–531217460–53197603–63497608–63914256532–617253531–61695635–66695640–6711597618–64997617–64860667–68660672–6911695650–68195649–680170687–742170692–7471766682–70366681–702143743–790143748–79518176704–761176703–760124791–831124796–83619143762–809143761–80834832–84334837–84820124810–850124809–84954844–86154849–8662134851–86234850–861986862–870, 3′-UTR902867–875, 3′-UTR221546863–871, 3′-UTR1566862–870, 3′-UTR1-a Exon 1 derived from the 5′- end of EST AW210030 (nt 24–164).

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the mouse and human Sulfs reported in the present study, a Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog (CeSulf-1, AAA83618), and a Drosophila melanogaster Sulf ortholog (DmSulf-1, AAF55296). The analysis demonstrates that QSulf-1 is more homologous to Sulf-1 than to Sulf-2 in both humans and mice. By ClustalW alignment (11Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar), QSulf-1 is 86% identical to HSulf-1 and 64% identical to HSulf-2. The species orthologs are highly homologous. Between mice and humans, the Sulf-1s are 93% identical, and the Sulf-2s are 94% identical. Comparison of the two Sulfs within the same species (mouse or human) shows an identity of 63–65%. RSulfFP1 shows 96% identity to MSulf-1, indicating that it is the rat ortholog of Sulf-1. The structural organization of the mammalian Sulfs is very similar to that already described for both QSulf-1 (4Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and RSulfFP1 (6Ohto T. Uchida H. Yamazaki H. Keino-Masu K. Matsui A. Masu M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (TableII). Cleavable signal sequences, 22–27 amino acids in length, are predicted, and 10 or 11 potentialN-linked sites are present. After the signal sequence, each protein exhibits a sulfatase domain of 372 amino acids (Table II), which is assigned based on comparison with the PFAM (protein family of alignments) data base of protein domain families (8Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Among the lysosomal sulfatases, this domain is most closely related to the sulfatase domain of HG6S (accession number P15586), with a sequence identity of 44%versus HSulf-1 and 46% versus HSulf-2 (Fig.4 B). The overall homology falls off with the other cloned sulfatases (13–15% sequence identity), but, as noted for Qsulf-1 (4Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P.

Previous reports have shown that an unidentified β-cell-specific nuclear factor binds to a conserved cis-regulatory element called RIPE3b and is critical for its glucose-regulated expression. Based on the sequence similarity of the RIPE3b element and the consensus binding sequence of the Maf family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors, we here identified mammalian homologue of avian MafA/L-Maf, an eye-specific member of the Maf family, as the RIPE3b-binding transcriptional activator. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that mafA mRNA is detected only in the eyes and in pancreatic β-cells and not in α-cells. MafA protein as well as its mRNA is up-regulated by glucose, consistent with the glucose-regulated binding of MafA to the RIPE3b element in β-cell nuclear extracts. In transient luciferase assays, we also showed that expression of MafA greatly enhanced insulin promoter activity and that a dominant-negative form of MafA inhibited it. Therefore, MafA is a β-cell-specific and glucose-regulated transcriptional activator for insulin gene expression and thus may be involved in the function and development of β-cells as well as in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Therefore, MafA is a β-cell-specific and glucose-regulated transcriptional activator for insulin gene expression and thus may be involved in the function and development of β-cells as well as in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Insulin is the only polypeptide hormone that critically regulates blood glucose levels and is produced exclusively by β-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. The molecular mechanism of the β-cell-restricted expression of insulin has been extensively studied (for reviews, see Refs. 1Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E.

Biol. 2000; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which led to the identification of various cis-regulatory elements on its promoter region. The most important among them are the conserved E1, A3, and RIPE3b/C1 elements (3Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The islet-restricted transcription factors, Beta2/NeuroD and Pdx1/IPF1/STF1/IDX1/GSF/IUF1, which bind to the E1 and A3 elements, have also been isolated (7Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J.

Gene disruption experiments in mice have revealed that both Beta2 and Pdx1 play critical roles in insulin gene expression as well as in islet development and function (11Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y.

Furthermore, mutations inbeta2 and pdx1 genes are found in some population of patients with type 2 diabetes (14Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat.

The third regulatory element, RIPE3b, has also been shown to play a critical role in β-cell-specific insulin gene transcription as well as in its glucose-regulated expression (4Shieh S.Y. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified a β-cell-restricted RIPE3b-binding factor, called the RIPE3b1 activator, that appears in response to glucose in pancreatic β-cell nuclear extracts (18Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite growing evidence of its importance in the regulation of insulin gene transcription, it remains to be cloned. We and others have previously determined the consensus DNA-binding sequences of the Maf family of transcription factors as the 13- and 14-base pair palindromic sequences TGCTGACTCAGCA and TGCTGACGTCAGCA, which we have called Maf recognition elements (MAREs) 1The abbreviations used are: MARE, Maf-recognition element; HA, hemagglutinin; SID, Sin3 interaction domain; RT, reverse transcription; contig, group of overlapping clones (19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). By searching the GenBankTM data base, we were previously able to make a list of putative Maf-regulated genes that have MARE-related sequences in their regulatory regions, including the insulin gene (19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later, some of them, for example, erythroid lineage-specific genes (α- and β-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase) and eye-specific genes (opsin and crystalline genes) were actually found to be downstream targets of Maf family members (see below). Maf family proteins belong to the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors, and the originally identified member, v-Maf, is an oncoprotein encoded by the avian transforming retrovirus AS42 (21Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To date, several maf-related genes have been identified in various species including human, mouse, rat, chicken, quail, frog, and zebrafish. The Maf family members are divided into two groups depending on their molecular sizes (i.e. the large Maf and small Maf proteins). In both mammalian and chicken genomes, three small mafgenes, mafK, mafF, and mafG, have been identified (22Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Their products lack a transactivator domain, but they activate transcription when they form heterodimers with members of CNC (“cap‘n‘collar”), another basic leucine zipper family (24Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For example, by forming heterodimers with the erythroid-specific CNC member p45, they constitute the erythroid-specific transactivator NF-E2 and activate transcription of the α- and β-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase genes (25Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar,26Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to the small Mafs, the large Maf proteins contain a transactivator domain in their amino terminus and activate transcription as homodimers (27Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In chicken and quail, the c-maf, mafB, and mafA/L-maf genes have been identified as large maf members (28Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 29Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O.

Virology. 1992; 188: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mammals, c-maf, mafB, and nrl have been identified (32Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell.

Nrl shows retina-specific expression and regulates opsin gene expression and retinal development (33Swaroop A. Xu J.Z. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chicken MafA/L-Maf, on the other hand, is exclusively expressed in lens and plays a critical role in the regulation of crystalline genes and lens development (29Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As we have mentioned previously, insulin genes of various species, such as human, mouse, and rat, contain conserved MARE-related sequence in their promoters (19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have noticed that the MARE sequence overlaps with that of the RIPE3b element. In this report, we show that the RIPE3b1 factor contains a previously unidentified mammalian member of the large Maf family. Through GenBankTM data base searches and PCR amplification, we have isolated human and mouse homologues of the mafA gene and demonstrated that MafA is the RIPE3b1 factor. MIN6 cells (39Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki (Osaka University). βTC6 and αTC1 clone 9 (hereafter αTC1) cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection. MIN6 and βTC6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, and αTC1 cells were grown in F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. When controlling the glucose concentration, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing various concentrations of glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiberet al. (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). For the gel mobility shift analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated in DNA-binding buffer (final concentration 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC) on ice for 15 min. Then 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probe was added, and the extracts were further incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer plus 6% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The oligonucleotide probe containing the human RIPE3b element was made by annealing two 32-mer oligonucleotides, 5′-GATCCGGAAATTGCAGCCTCAGCCCCCAGCCA-3′ and 3′-GATCTGGCTGGGGGCTGAGGCTGCAATTTCCG-3′. The core sequences of the mutated 32-mer RIPE3b-oligonucleotides used as competitors are shown in Fig. 2 B. The complete sequences of MARE-related oligonucleotides were described in Ref. 19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Anti-v-Maf serum was previously raised against a nearly full-length recombinant chicken v-Maf protein (41Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-c-Maf (M-153), anti-c-Maf (N-15), anti-MafB (E-20), anti-Nrl (N-19), anti-MafK (C-16), anti-MafK/F/G (C-18), and anti-c-Fos (K-25) sera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-c-Jun serum (42Monteclaro F.S. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6726-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Kazuhiro Chida (Tokyo University). Anti-MafA-specific serum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide (REPSPAQAGPGAAKGC) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal part of mouse MafA. By searching the GenBankTM data base, we found a human genome contig (NT 023684) on chromosome 8q24 and several human expressed sequence tags that were most homologous to avian mafA. From the nucleotide sequence information, we designed primers (5′-agaacggTCCCGGGCGATGGCCGCGGAG-3′ and 5′-agaacggcGTCCGGCGCCTACAGGAAGAAG-3′) and cloned the entire open reading frame of this gene by PCR. Human genomic DNA was used as a template because the chicken and quail mafA genes contain no introns. The same primers were used for cloning the mousemafA homologue from mouse genomic DNA (Balb/c strain) by PCR. The PCR products were cloned into a pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) to generate pGEM-T-easy/h-mafA and pGEM-T-easy/m-mafA. A 2-kb DNA fragment encompassing the human mafA locus was cloned by inverse PCR (43Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from NcoI-digested and self-ligated HeLa genomic DNA (pT7blue/h-mafA-inv-NcoI) using nested primers (first PCR, 5′-GGTTCAGCTCGCGCACCGACATGG-3′ and 5′-GTGCAGCAGCGGCACATTCTGGAG-3′; second PCR, 5′-TTCTGCTTGAGCCGGATGACCTCC-3′ and 5′-AGTCCTGCCGCTTCAAGCGGGTGC-3′) and was used as a probe to determine the chromosomal localization of the human mafA gene by fluorescent in situhybridization as described previously (44Hirai M. Suto Y. Kanoh M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells and mouse tissues (from a 7-week-old male, ICR strain) using the TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis was performed using the Titan One-Tube RT-PCT System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers used were as follows: mafA, 5′-CGCAGGCCACCACGTGCGCTTGGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCGCTGGCGAGGGCTCCCGAGGGAAG-3′; insulin, 5′-CTTAGTGACCAGCTATAATCAGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCTTAGTTGCAGTAGTTCTCCAGC-3′; glucagon, 5′-TCTACACCTGTTCGCAGCTTCAGTCCC-3′ and 5′-CCACTACGGTTACCAGGTGGTCATGTC-3′. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (21Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ThemafA-specific probe (pSae-hA) was constructed by deleting the BssHII-PmlI fragment from pGEM-T-easy/h-mafA to remove the GC-rich and CAC repeat region. To obtain the insulin probe, insulin cDNA was cloned from MIN6 total RNA by RT-PCR using the specific primers 5′-AGGAATTCAACATGGCCCTGTTGGTGC-3′ and 5′-CCTGGTGTTTTATCACAAGCTTCATAC-3′. Aliquots of nuclear extracts were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was then stained with anti-MafA (500× dilution) or anti-c-Maf (M-153; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (2000× dilution) and with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG serum and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). MIN6 cells grown on collagen-coated cover glass (IWAKI) were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and were treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for an additional 15 min. The cells were then stained with anti-c-Maf (M-153) serum (200× dilution), Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG serum (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. To construct the reporter plasmid h-ins-p-luc, the human insulin promoter region was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-caggtaCCCCGCCCTGCAGCCTCCAGCTC-3′ and 5′-agaagcTTCTGATGCAGCCTGTCCTGGA-3′) from human genomic DNA. The fragment was inserted into the KpnI-HindIII site of the pGL2-basic plasmid (Promega) after digesting withKpnI and HindIII. Mutations were introduced into the RIPE3b/MARE element by site-directed overhang extension PCR mutagenesis (45Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-TGCAGCCgactaCCCCAGCCATCTGCC-3′ and 5′-ATGGCTGGGGtagtcGGCTGCAATTTC-3′. pG4×5/TATA/luc plasmid that contains five copies of the Gal4-binding sequence was a gift from Dr. Kazuhiko Igarashi (Hiroshima University). The expression plasmid for mouse MafA was constructed by inserting aNotI fragment excised from pGEM-T-easy/m-mafAinto a pHygEF2 mammalian expression vector. To construct hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human mafA, a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the HA epitope tag sequence (5′-tctagacgcgtccATGGGGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCAGGAATTC-3′) was inserted into the 5′-EcoRI site (T7 side) of pGEM-T-easy/h-mafA. The resultant HA-h-mafAfragment (XbaI-SpeI) was inserted into pHygEF2 to obtain pHygEF2/HA-h-mafA. To construct the expression vector for the repressor form of MafA (pHygEF2/HA-SID-h-mafA), theEcoRI-PmlI fragment of pHygEF2/HA-h-mafA encoding the amino-terminal putative transactivation domain of MafA (amino acids 1–219) was replaced by a DNA fragment encoding the Sin3 interaction domain (SID) of Mxi1 (amino acids 1–70) (46Schreiber-Agus N.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG tag (5′-ctagtaccATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGGAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCATggta-3′) was then inserted into the SpeI-StuI sites. The resultant FLAG-pdx1 and FLAG-beta2 fragments were excised by NotI digestion and were inserted into the NotI site of the pHygEF2 vector. NIH3T3 cells grown in a 35-mm dish were transfected with a total of 1.5 μg of plasmids (0.4 μg of luciferase plasmid, a total of 1.0 μg of expression plasmids, and 0.1 μg of pEF-Rluc (48Kataoka K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Shioda S. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) using 10 μl of Polyfect reagent (Qiagen). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. MIN6 cells grown in a 35-mm dish were transfected with a total of 1.0 μg of plasmids (0.3 μg of luciferase plasmid, 0.6 μg of expression plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pEF-Rluc) using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE and 6 μl of PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0 or 20 mm of glucose, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). As we have previously described (19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the conserved RIPE3b element in the promoter region of the insulin genes of human, mouse, and rat has a nucleotide sequence that is very similar to the consensus MARE sequence (Fig. 1 A). This finding prompted us to examine whether RIPE3b-binding complexes in pancreatic β-cells contain Maf family members. To explore this possibility, we prepared nuclear extracts from insulin-producing mouse β-cell lines, MIN6 and βTC6, grown in the presence or absence of 20 mm glucose, and subjected them to gel mobility shift analysis using an oligonucleotide probe containing the human RIPE3b element. As shown in Fig. 1 B(lanes 1–4), a DNA-protein complex that appeared in the presence of glucose was detected both in MIN6 and βTC6 nuclear extracts. In contrast, we did not detect this complex in nuclear extracts prepared from the non-β-cell lines αTC1 (α-cell) (lane 5), NIH3T3 (embryonic fibroblast) (see Fig.2 C), C2C12 (myoblast), and RAW264 (monocyte) (data not shown). Therefore, this β-cell-specific complex seemed to be identical to the previously reported RIPE3b1 complex (49Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 50Harrington R.H. Sharma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We next tested the DNA binding specificity of this complex. As shown in Fig. 1 C, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled human and mouse/rat RIPE3b-containing oligonucleotides specifically competed for the binding of this factor to the probe (lanes 1–3). The DNA binding specificity of the complex, as determined by the addition of excess cold oligonucleotides bearing various nucleotide substitutions (mut-A to mut-D) (lanes 4–7), was very similar to what has been previously reported (49Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 50Harrington R.H. Sharma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results again confirm the identity of this complex as the previously reported RIPE3b1 complex. Furthermore, the complex formation was inhibited by the addition of oligonucleotides containing the consensus MARE sequence (Fig. 1 C, #1,lane 8) or a related sequence that can bind to Maf family members (#11 and #7, lanes 9 and 10) but not of oligonucleotides that do not bind to Maf (#17 and #23, lanes 11 and 12). Therefore, the RIPE3b1 factor showed similar DNA binding specificity to the Maf family of transcription factors (19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then tested whether the RIPE3b1 complex contains Maf family members using a gel mobility shift analysis with a series of anti-Maf antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the RIPE3b1 complex was supershifted by the addition of antisera that broadly react with large Maf members (anti-v-Maf and anti-c-Maf (M-153), lanes 1–4), whereas anti-small Maf antisera (anti-MafK and anti-MafK/F/G) did not react with the RIPE3b1 complex (lanes 8 and9). The addition of antisera that broadly react with Fos and Jun family members, possible heterodimeric partners for Maf family proteins (19Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), had no effect (lanes 10 and 11). These results clearly indicate that RIPE3b1 does contain a large Maf. However, none of antisera that specifically react with c-Maf (anti-c-Maf N-15), MafB, or Nrl affected the RIPE3b1 complex (lanes 5–7). These results strongly suggest that the RIPE3b1 complex contains an unidentified member of the large Maf family that reacts with anti-v-Maf and anti-c-Maf (M-153) sera. Among the large maf family members identified in vertebrates to date, c-maf, mafB, and nrl genes have been isolated in mammals, but a homologue of avian mafAhas not yet been identified. By searching the GenBankTMdata base, we found a human genome contig on chromosome 8q24 and several human expressed sequence tags that were most homologous to avian mafA. From this nucleotide sequence information, we cloned the entire open reading frame of this gene and its mouse homologue (human and mouse mafA genes) by PCR. From the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse MafA, we raised a MafA-specific antiserum by immunizing a rabbit with a MafA-derived peptide and added it into the gel mobility shift analysis. As shown in Fig.2 B, the RIPE3b1 complex was supershifted by the addition of the anti-MafA serum. We also confirmed that recombinant human and mouse MafA reacted with anti-v-Maf and anti-c-Maf (M-153) sera but not with anti-c-Maf (N-15), MafB, or Nrl sera (data not shown). Furthermore, transfection of an MafA expression vector into NIH3T3 cells resulted in the appearance of a DNA-protein complex of very similar mobility to the RIPE3b1 complex (Fig. 2 C). These results clearly indicate that MafA is a component of the RIPE3b1 factor. Nucleotide sequence analyses of human and mouse mafA (GenBankTMaccession numbers AB086960 and AB086961) have revealed that they encode proteins of 351 (human) and 359 (mouse) amino acids that exhibit the highest homology to avian MafA (Fig. 3,A and B) (29Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 B, the carboxyl-terminal basic domain and leucine zipper of human and mouse MafA that should serve as the DNA-binding and the dimerization domains, respectively, are completely conserved and are highly similar to other Maf family members. They also contain an amino-terminal acidic amino acid/serine/threonine/proline-rich domain, which may serve as a transcriptional activation domain (27Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). The middle part of MafA is relatively divergent but contains clusters of glycine and histidine as do all of the other large Maf members except Nrl. We determined the chromosomal location of the human mafAgene by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Specific hybridization signals were observed on chromosome 8q24.3, and no other hybridization sites were detected (Fig.4). This result is consistent with the map position (8q24) of the mafA-containing human genome contig (NT 023684). We next prepared total RNA from MIN6, βTC6, and αTC1 cells and examined the expression of mafA mRNA by RT-PCR analysis. As is clearly shown in Fig.5 A, mafA mRNA expression was detected in"
https://openalex.org/W2133857970,"We previously have found that advanced glycation end products (AGE), senescent macroproteins formed at an accelerated rate in diabetes, arise in vivo not only from glucose but also from reducing sugars. Furthermore, we recently have shown that glyceraldehyde- and glycolaldehyde-derived AGE (glycer- and glycol-AGE) are mainly involved in loss of pericytes, the earliest histopathological hallmark of diabetic retinopathy. However, the effects of these AGE proteins on angiogenesis, another vascular derangement in diabetic retinopathy, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether these AGE proteins elicit changes in cultured endothelial cells that are associated with angiogenesis. When human skin microvascular endothelial cells (EC) were cultured with glycer-AGE or glycol-AGE, growth and tube formation of EC, the key steps of angiogenesis, were significantly stimulated. The AGE-induced growth stimulation was significantly enhanced in AGE receptor (RAGE)-overexpressed EC. Furthermore, AGE increased transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) and then up-regulated mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in EC. Cerivastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor; pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate; or curcumin was found to completely prevent the AGE-induced increase in NF-kB and AP-1 activity, VEGF mRNA up-regulation, and the resultant increase in DNA synthesis in microvascular EC. These results suggest that the AGE-RAGE interaction elicited angiogenesis through the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene via NF-kB and AP-1 factors. By blocking AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, cerivastatin might be a promising remedy for treating patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2036697811,"The large majority of plastid proteins are nuclear-encoded and, thus, must be imported within these organelles. Unlike most of the outer envelope proteins, targeting of proteins to all other plastid compartments (inner envelope membrane, stroma, and thylakoid) is strictly dependent on the presence of a cleavable transit sequence in the precursor N-terminal region. In this paper, we describe the identification of a new envelope protein component (ceQORH) and demonstrate that its subcellular localization is limited to the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope. Immunopurification, microsequencing of the natural envelope protein and cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA demonstrated that this protein is not processed in the N-terminal region during its targeting to the inner envelope membrane. Transient expression experiments in plant cells were performed with truncated forms of the ceQORH protein fused to the green fluorescent protein. These experiments suggest that neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal are essential for chloroplastic localization of the ceQORH protein. These observations are discussed in the frame of the endosymbiotic theory of chloroplast evolution and suggest that a domain of the ceQORH bacterial ancestor may have evolved so as to exclude the general requirement of an N-terminal plastid transit sequence.

Higher plant plastids contain a genome with limited coding capacity. The large majority of plastid proteins are nuclear-encoded and thus, must be imported within these organelles. To this purpose, the two envelope membranes that surround chloroplasts contain a protein import apparatus constituted of the TOC and TIC complexes (translocon at the inner or outer membranes of the chloroplast envelope) (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Chen X.

The major element of this translocation complex is Toc75, which is the most abundant protein in the outer envelope membrane. Moreover, Toc75 seems to form the central pore of the outer envelope translocation channel (5Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blodel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Google Scholar, 6Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Google Scholar) and interacts specifically with the N-terminal transit peptide of precursor proteins during the import process toward chloroplast (7Ma Y.K. Kouranov A. LaSala S.E. Schnell D.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 315-327Google Scholar). This cleavable and N-terminal transit peptide was shown to be necessary and sufficient for transport of precursors (i) across the two envelope membranes (8Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-501Google Scholar, 9De Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Google Scholar) and (ii) across the thylakoid membrane if the transit sequence is bipartite (it contains additional targeting information for thylakoid lumen targeting) (9De Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Google Scholar). The cleavage of the transit sequence is performed by two proteases, one in the stroma (10VanderVere P.S. Bennett T.M. Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7177-7181Google Scholar) and one in the thylakoid lumen for the bipartite transit sequences (11Chaal B.K. Mould R.M. Barbrook A.C. Gray J.C. Howe C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 689-692Google Scholar). Moreover it is interesting to note that all described inner membrane proteins and intermembrane space proteins possess an N-terminal cleavable transit peptide, while most outer envelope membrane proteins do not have any cleavable transit peptide. In the latter case, the targeting information is contained within the mature protein (12Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Google Scholar), and after their cytosolic synthesis, proteins are directly incorporated in the lipid bilayer through unknown interactions with the outer membrane lipids (13Van't Hof R. Demel R.A. Keegstra K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 350-354Google Scholar, 14Van't Hof R. Van Klompenburg W. Pilon M. Kozubek A. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J.

In this report, we describe the identification of a new component of the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope, which exhibits similarities with a range of quinone oxidoreductase from various organisms (ceQORH for Chloroplast Envelope Quinone OxidoReductase Homologue). Immunolocalization, purification, and microsequencing of this protein and cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA revealed the existence of a protein that does not require the presence of a cleavable N-terminal transit peptide to be targeted to the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope. Transient expression of GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Q-TOF, quadrupole time-of-flight; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region-tagged and truncated forms of the ceQORH protein suggests that the localization of this protein into chloroplast is dependent on an essential but not sufficient internal domain located within the ceQORH amino acid sequence. All operations were carried out at 0–5 °C. Crude chloroplasts were obtained from 3–4 kg of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves and purified by isopyknic centrifugation using Percoll gradients (16Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1982: 239-256Google Scholar). At this step of purification, protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 0.5 mm amino caproic acid) were added to prevent any protein degradation. Purified intact chloroplasts were lysed in hypotonic medium, and envelope membranes were purified from the lysate by centrifugation on sucrose gradients (16Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1982: 239-256Google Scholar). Envelope subfractions respectively enriched in outer and inner membranes were obtained from purified intact spinach chloroplasts as previously described (17Block M.A. Dorne A.-J. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13273-13280Google Scholar). To study polypeptides localized on the external face of the outer membrane, intact chloroplast were treated with thermolysin from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus as previously described (18Joyard J. Billecocq A. Bartlett S.G. Block M. Chua N.H. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10000-10006Google Scholar). All types of envelope membranes preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8, in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine and 0.5 mm amino caproic acid). Protein contents of membrane fractions were estimated using the BIO-RAD protein assay reagent (19Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Solubilization of envelope membrane proteins with CHAPS or Triton X-100 were performed as follows. Envelope proteins (0.8 mg) were diluted in 1 ml of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 or 6 mm CHAPS. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the mix was centrifuged (130,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C) to separate (i) a supernatant containing membrane proteins solubilized by the treatment and (ii) a pellet containing the insoluble proteins. SDS-PAGE analyses of chloroplast subfractions or chloroplast envelope subfractions were performed as described by Chua (20Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-436Google Scholar). For Western blotting experiments, gels were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). The immunoblot assay was performed according to the protocol from BIO-RAD Laboratories except that 5% non-fat dry milk was used to saturate the membrane. The ceQORH protein was detected using the polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinantArabidopsis protein at a 1/5000 dilution using alkaline phosphatase detection. After SDS-PAGE, protein bands were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Conditions for in-gel tryptic digestion and peptide elution were described previously (21Ferro M. Salvi D. Rivière-Rolland H. Vermat T. Seigneurin-Berny D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11487-11492Google Scholar). The peptide solution was introduced into a glass capillary (Protana) for nanoelectrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a Q-TOF (quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight) hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass) to obtain sequence information. Collision-induced dissociation of selected precursor ions was performed using argon as the collision gas and with collision energies of 40–60 eV. Tandem mass spectrometry sequence information were used for data base searching using the programs MS-Edman located at the University of California San Francisco (prospector.ucsf.edu/) and BLAST located at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Prediction for membrane-spanning regions was achieved using the software programs TMpred (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) (22Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). Purification of total RNAs from spinach orArabidopsis leave were performed using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen Laboratories. Purification of mRNA from the total RNA fraction was performed using the mRNA Direct Kit from Dynal Laboratories. Constructions of the spinach andArabidopsis cDNA libraries were performed using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit from Clontech Laboratories. All RACE-PCR experiments were performed using the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix from Clontech Laboratories. Cloning of the ArabidopsiscDNA coding the ceQORH from Arabidopsis was performed by PCR, on an Arabidopsis cDNA library using primers designed on the basis of the Arabidopsis genome sequence (AGI accession number AT4G13010) encoding the putative ceQORH protein (TrEMBL accession number Q9SV68). Two primers TCACATATGGCTGGAAAACTCAATGCAC and ATGGATCCAACGCTCTTATGGCTCGAC were designed respectively to introduce NdeI and BamHI recognition sites (underlined residues) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ceQORH cDNA. The amplified fragment was cloned in pBlueScript SK−. The insert was then digested withNdeI and BamHI and inserted into the expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). The resulting expression plasmid was used to express the N-terminal His-tagged ceQORH protein in E. coli strain BLR(DE3) (Novagen). The recombinant protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography (His-Bind resin, Novagen) and desalted (PD-10 column, Amersham Biosciences). This purified ceQORH from Arabidopsis was used (i) to raise a rabbit polyclonal antibodies against this protein (obtained from theElevage Scientifique des Dombes, F-01400 Châtillon sur Chalaronne, France) and (ii) as a tool in the immunopurification of the ceQORH from spinach chloroplast envelope membranes. Envelope proteins (1 mg) were solubilized in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 6 mm CHAPS and incubated 1 h at 4 °C with 33 μl of serum raised against the purifiedArabidopsis recombinant ceQORH. Protein A-agarose (50 μg; Boehringer) was added, and the mix was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. After three successive washings by centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D, 16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) of the protein A-agarose and pellet suspension in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mmCHAPS), 50 μg of His-tagged recombinant Arabidopsisprotein, incubated in 200 μl of solubilization buffer, was added. The mix was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g (Eppendorf 5415D). Supernatant was incubated for 1 h with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), previously equilibrated in the solubilization buffer to remove the majority of the His-tagged recombinant Arabidopsis protein. After centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D, 16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To isolate the spinach ceQORH cDNA, RACE-PCR were performed using degenerated primers synthesized on the basis of the spinach protein microsequences. Primers Rev (GCNCCYTCNGGNGTYTTRTARTC) and Fwd (GAYTAYAARACNCCNGARGGNGC) were designed respectively for 5′ or 3′ RACE-PCR amplifications. Positive amplification was obtained from 5′ RACE-PCR amplification performed with the primer Rev and the Adaptator Primer AP1 (CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT) provided with the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech Laboratories). Amplified fragments were inserted into the pBlueScript SK− vector and sequenced from both ends with standard T3 and T7 primers as well as with insert-specific primers (the 5′ sequence revealed the ceQORH translation start codon and a stop codon in frame with this ATG in the 5′-UTR). The complete cDNA sequence coding for the spinach ceQORH was obtained from 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR performed with primers AP1 and non-degenerated primers D (CAGCAACATCAGTTCCAGGTATAG) and A (ACACGCATGTAACAGCAACATGTG), respectively. Note that the existence of the stop codon localized within the 5′-UTR and in frame with the translation start codon was confirmed with this new 5′ RACE-PCR using primers D and AP1. The GFP reporter plasmid 35Ω-sGFP(S65T) and the plasmid containing the transit peptide (TP) sequence from RBCS fused to GFP [35Ω-TP-sGFP(S65T)] were described previously (23Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Google Scholar). Construction of the plasmids for expression of truncated Arabidopsis ceQORH protein fused to GFP were performed as follows. The 35Ω-ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) plasmid corresponding to the coding region of Arabidopsis ceQORH was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primers XhoI-N-ter (CCTCTCGAGATGGCTGGAAAACTCATGCAC) and NcoI-C-ter (CAACCCATGGATGGCTCGACAATGATCTTC), and the PCR product was cloned into the pBlueScript SK− Vector. TheXhoI-NcoI fragment cleaved from this plasmid was inserted into the SalI-NcoI digested GFP reporter plasmid 35Ω-sGFP(S65T) to create the 35Ω-ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) vector. The protocol was similar for the other constructions. The 35Ω-Δ(1–31)ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) plasmid corresponding to ceQORH lacking the first 31 amino acids was PCRamplified using the two flanking primers SalI-N-ter (CGGTTGTCGACATGAAGAGTAATGAGGTTTGCCTG) andNcoI-C-ter (CAACCCATGGATGGCTCGACAATGATCTTC). The 35Ω-Δ(1–59)ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) plasmid corresponding to ceQORH lacking the first 59 amino acids was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primers SalI-N-ter (GAATGGTCGACATGTTTCTGCCCCGCAAGTTC) andNcoI-C-ter (CAACCCATGGATGGCTCGACAATGATCTTC). The 35Ω-Δ(1–99)ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) plasmid corresponding to ceQORH lacking the first 99 amino acids was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primers SalI-N-ter (GGTTGTCGACATGCTAGGTGGAGGTGGACTTG) andNcoI-C-ter (CAACCCATGGATGGCTCGACAATGATCTTC). The 35Ω-(6–100)ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) plasmid containing the first six to 100 amino acids of ceQORH was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primersXhoI-N-ter (CCTCTCGAGATGGCTGGAAAAACTCATGCAC) andNcoI-C-ter (ACCCATGGCTAGATGGCTAAGAACCGCTAC). The 35Ω-(60–100)ceQORH-sGFP(S65T) plasmid containing the first 60–100 amino acids of ceQORH was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primers SalI-N-ter (GAATGGTCGACATGTTTCTGCCCCGCAAGTTC) andNcoI-C-ter (ACCCATGGCTAGATGGCTAAGAACCGCTAC). The 35Ω-QORECOLI-sGFP(S65T) plasmid containing the QOR protein fromE. coli (accession number P28304) was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primers XhoI-QORNter (GTTCTCGAGGACACATGGCAACAC) and NcoI-QORCter (CTATTCCATGGATGGAATCAGCAGGCTGGAAC). Correct orientation and sequences of the inserted fragments were controlled. The plasmids used for tissue bombardment were prepared using the QIAfilter Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen Laboratories). Arabidopsis cells were grown in light for 3 days in a Gamborg's B5 media (Sigma, pH 5.8) complemented with 1.5% sucrose and 1 μm naphthalene acetic acid. 15 ml of cell suspension (corresponding approximately to 0.5 g of fresh weight) were applied in Petri dishes containing the same growth media with 0.8% bacto-agar (Invitrogen) and were incubated for 18–36 h in light. BY2 tobacco cells were grown for 5 days at 27 °C in a Murashige and Skoog medium (Duchefa, pH 5.8) complemented with 3% sucrose, 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.2% myo-inositol, 1 μm2.4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid, and 3 μm thiamin. Cell suspension (2.5 ml, corresponding approximately to 0.3 g of fresh weight) were applied in Petri dishes containing the same growth media with 1% bacto-agar and stored at 27 °C during 18–24 h. Plasmids of appropriate constructions (1 μg) were introduced intoArabidopsis and BY2 cells using a pneumatic particle gun (PDS-1000/He; Bio-Rad). The condition of bombardment was helium pressure of 1350 p.s.i., 1100 p.s.i. rupture disks (Bio-Rad), 10-cm target distance using 1 μm of gold microcarriers (Bio-Rad). After bombardment, cells were incubated on the plates for 18–36 h (in light for the Arabidopsis cells). Cells were transferred to glass slides before fluorescence microscopy. Localization of GFP and GFP fusions was analyzed in transformed cells by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope, and the image was captured with a digital charge-coupled devices camera (Hamamatsu). The filter sets used were Zeiss filter set 13, 488013–0000 (exciter BP 470/20, beamsplitter FT 493, emitter BP 505–530) and Zeiss filter set 15, 488015–0000 (exciter BP 546/12, beamsplitter FT 580, emitter LP 590) for GFP and autofluorescence of chlorophylls, respectively. Cells were observed with a 400× magnification. During the course of the identification of new chloroplast envelope protein components (21Ferro M. Salvi D. Rivière-Rolland H. Vermat T. Seigneurin-Berny D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11487-11492Google Scholar,24Seigneurin-Berny D. Rolland N. Garin J. Joyard J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 217-228Google Scholar) some peptide sequences were obtained, which shared homology with a putative Arabidopsis protein (AGI accession number At4g13010; TrEMBL accession number Q9SV68). Whereas most of the envelope proteins identified during these early publications were highly hydrophobic, this putative protein was structurally related to soluble bacterial, fungal, and animal proteins of known quinone oxidoreductase function. Because of its possible function and since this ceQORH protein could participate in the redox chains previously detected in the chloroplast envelope membranes (25Jager-Vottero P. Dorne A.-J. Jordanov J. Douce R. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1597-1602Google Scholar), we decided to further investigate the subcellular localization of this ceQORH protein. To obtain a polyclonal antibody raised against this protein the corresponding Arabidopsis cDNA was cloned and the full-length protein was overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant ceQORH protein overexpressed in E. coli (Fig.1 A) was recovered in two distinct fractions: a soluble fraction in the E. colicytosol (Fig. 1 A, lane S) and an insoluble fraction (Fig. 1 A, lane I). As a high (0.5%) concentration of Triton X-100 did not release the insoluble fraction of the recombinant protein in the soluble phase, this fraction (Fig.1 A, lane I) is likely to correspond to aggregated protein (inclusion bodies). The soluble fraction of the N-terminal His-tagged recombinant protein was further purified by metal affinity chromatography. During this purification process, the ceQORH protein still behaved as a soluble protein (Fig. 1 B) as expected for a member of this quinone oxidoreductase family (26Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Google Scholar). Since the recombinant ceQORH protein appeared to be, at least in part, soluble in the E. colicytosol (Fig. 1 A), actual association of this protein with the chloroplast envelope remained to be demonstrated. Western blots performed on chloroplast subfractions demonstrated that this protein is only present within the chloroplast envelope (Fig.2 A, lane E) and not detected in other chloroplast subfractions (Fig. 2 A,lanes S, T). From these data, it can be concluded that the ceQORH protein is associated exclusively with the envelope membrane and is not a soluble stroma protein contaminating the envelope preparations. It is generally accepted that Percoll-purified intact chloroplasts are free from cytosolic contaminants (16Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1982: 239-256Google Scholar). However, the ceQORH protein could be a soluble protein specifically interacting with the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope thus, co-purifying with the purified chloroplast envelope membranes. To test this hypothesis, intact chloroplasts were treated with the thermolysin ofBacillus thermoproteolyticus as previously described (18Joyard J. Billecocq A. Bartlett S.G. Block M. Chua N.H. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10000-10006Google Scholar). As presented in the Fig. 2 B, the ceQORH protein remained unaffected by the thermolysin treatment performed on intact plastids. In contrast, complete degradation of the ceQORH protein was observed when the same proteolytic treatment was performed on solubilized envelope proteins, thus demonstrating the sensitivity of the ceQORH protein to thermolysin treatment (Fig. 2 C). This result indicates that the ceQORH protein is not accessible to thermolysin from the cytosolic surface of the chloroplast, thus ruling out the hypothesis that the ceQORH protein could be a soluble cytosolic contaminant of the chloroplast envelope preparations or an envelope component associated with the outer face of the outer envelope membrane. Finally, immunodetection of the ceQORH protein demonstrated that this protein is only present in the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope (Fig. 2 D, lane IM). The purity of the envelope subfractions was controlled using antibodies raised against IE18 and OEP24 proteins, which serve as marker molecules for inner and outer envelope membrane proteins respectively (24Seigneurin-Berny D. Rolland N. Garin J. Joyard J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 217-228Google Scholar, 27Rohl T. Motzkus M. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 491-494Google Scholar). Thus, unlike the other members of this quinone oxidoreductase family (26Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Google Scholar), the ceQORH protein behaves as a genuine membrane protein. At this stage, the apparent solubility of the recombinant ceQORH produced inE. coli and its exclusive localization in the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope were contradictory. One hypothesis was that ceQORH could be a soluble protein localized in the intermembrane space between the inner and the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope. This protein could be copurified with inner envelope preparations, sequestrated in membrane vesicles. Some major soluble stroma proteins, which are sequestrated in the envelope vesicles, are known to contaminate envelope fractions (e.g. large Rubisco subunit). These proteins can be released from envelope preparations by opening/closing of the membrane vesicles after sonication (Fig.3 A, lane 2 andRbcL). Since the ceQORH protein was not solubilized after sonication of membrane vesicles (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), it is likely to physically interact with the inner envelope membrane. To test the nature of the association between ceQORH and the inner envelope membrane, membranes were washed by application of salt and alkaline treatments (28Liu M. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29400-29406Google Scholar). One of the standard method to determine the interaction of a protein with a membrane is to examine the effects of an alkaline Na2CO3 solution, which strips peripheral membrane proteins leaving intrinsic proteins associated with the lipid bilayer. Alkaline extractions using Na2CO3 (0.1 m, pH 11) induced a release in the soluble phase of a major part of the protein, and all the protein was solubilized using NaOH (0.1 m) treatment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5, 6). These observations indicate that ceQORH is not a transmembrane protein, bound to membrane through strong hydrophobic interactions (in contrast with IE18, which is not solubilized using Na2CO3treatment; Fig. 3 A, lane 5). Indeed, these observations are consistent with the predicted hydrophobicity of the ceQORH protein, since no membrane-spanning domain could be predicted from its hydropathy profile (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, salt treatments of envelope vesicles with NaCl (0.5 m) or KI (0.5 m) also induced a partial release of the ceQORH protein in the soluble phase (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3,4). Because ceQORH binding to the membrane is sensitive to high salt concentrations, this suggests that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the ceQORH ability to bind to membranes. Moreover, complete release of the ceQORH protein was achieved with a relatively low (0.2%) concentration of Triton X-100 (Fig.3 B), whereas high concentrations are required to release intrinsic membrane proteins (e.g. release of the intrinsic protein IE18 requires a detergent concentration of 2% Triton X-100, see Ref. 24Seigneurin-Berny D. Rolland N. Garin J. Joyard J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 217-228Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that ceQORH is a genuine inner envelope membrane protein. It might be peripherally associated with the membrane via electrostatic interactions, with an intrinsic component of the inner envelope membrane or with the polar surface of this membrane. Moreover, since the recombinant ceQORH protein was, at least in part, soluble when produced in E. coli, this electrostatic interaction might occur via a plant specific posttranslational modification or via interaction with a specific envelope membrane component. Surprisingly, while localized in the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope, the ceQORH protein does not contain a classical N-terminal additional sequence when compared with bacterial or animal homologues (see later). This observation raised the possibility that, conversely to all other known inner envelope proteins, the ceQORH could be targeted to the inner envelope of the chloroplast without classical cleavage of an N-terminal transit sequence. To test this hypothesis, new peptide sequence informations were required in the N-terminal part of the envelope ceQORH protein. Because the purest chloroplast envelope preparations are obtained from spinach and due to requirement of large amounts of envelope protein to perform this experiment, the natural protein was purified from spinach envelope preparations. Immunopurification of the native spinach ceQORH protein was performed (see supplemental data at http://www.jbc.org) using the polyclonal antibody raised against the Arabidopsis ceQORH and mass spectrometry analyses allowed obtaining several new peptide sequences from this purified protein. These peptide sequences were used to clone the spinach cDNA (1179 nucleotides) coding the ceQORH protein (329 amino acids). Identity of the clone was confirmed, since the nine different peptide sequences were identical to the primary sequence deduced from the spinach cDNA (Fig.4). The spinach ceQORH protein presents 75.1% identity and 88.8% similarity with the ArabidopsisceQORH protein. From screening all available databases, no otherArabidopsis protein was found that presents more than 35% identity with the ceQORH from Arabidopsis or spinach. This strongly suggests that orthologous Arabidopsis and spinach genes encode the two plant proteins. A stop codon, localized in the 5′-UTR of the cDNA and in frame with the spinach ceQORH translation start codon (Fig. 4), was identified by two independent 5′ RACE-PCR amplifications performed with two independent primers, thus suggesting that the 5′-part of the cDNA was complete (Fig. 4). Finally, peptide sequences were obtained that correspond to the N-terminal region of the primary sequence"

We investigated neural correlates for the FOK based on the recall-judgment-recognition paradigm. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging with a parametric analysis was used. We found activations in left dorsolateral, left anterior, bilateral inferior, and medial prefrontal cortices that significantly increased as the FOK became greater, and the activations remained significant even when the potentially confounding factor of the response latency was removed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FOK region in the right inferior frontal gyrus and a subset of the FOK region in the left inferior frontal gyrus are not recruited for successful recall processes, suggesting their particular role in metamemory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2038407626,"Previous studies have suggested that recovery or compensation of language function after a lesion in the left hemisphere may depend on mechanisms in the right hemisphere. However, a direct relationship between performance and right hemisphere activity has not been established. Here, we show that patients with left frontal lesions and partially recovered aphasia learn, at a normal rate, a novel word retrieval task that requires the damaged cortex. Verbal learning is accompanied by specific response decrements in right frontal and right occipital cortex, strongly supporting the compensatory role of the right hemisphere. Furthermore, responses in left occipital cortex are abnormal and not modulated by practice. These findings indicate that frontal cortex is a source of top-down signals during learning."
https://openalex.org/W2149933426,"The SMAD-mediated induction of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a fibroproliferative cytokine, by transforming growth factor (TGF)beta is required for the development of sustained fibrosis in humans. Here, we show that in fibroblasts, activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway is required for the SMAD-mediated induction of CTGF by TGFbeta2. We then show that activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in fibroblasts is able to block Ras/MEK/ERK signaling and abolish the fibrotic response. Previously, we found that prostacyclin agonists were able to prevent the induction of CTGF in fibroblasts, and in patients with the fibrotic disease scleroderma. Here, we confirm the in vitro and in vivo antifibrotic effects of prostacyclin derivatives and show that these effects are due to PKA-dependent inhibition of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. Ras/MEK/ERK does not directly affect SMAD signaling. The coordinate and varied biological responses to TGFbeta are in part due to the interactions of signaling pathways within target cells. Specific inhibition of fibroblast Ras/MEK/ERK signaling might prevent fibrosis while leaving other physiological effects of TGFbeta unaltered."

Smith A.E. Sci. Am. 1995; 273: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Organs that secrete mucus or macromolecules, including the sinuses, vas deferens, pancreas, and intestine, become partially or completely filled with inspissated secretions, often before or shortly after birth, leading in some cases to complete blockage and degeneration (2Ramsey B. Richardson M.A. J Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 90: 547-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Oppenheimer E.H. Esterly J.R. J.

Inadequate hydration of epithelial fluids underlies much of this pathology. The proposed role of salt and water was made even before the discovery that CF1 is caused by mutations in CFTR, an anion channel and channel regulator essential for proper salt and water movement across some epithelia (5Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that this general dysfunction also plays an important role in CF airway disease (6Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The most devastating clinical consequence of CF is chronic infection of airways with normally innocuous bacteria and fungi. There is as yet no consensus on how this is related to altered epithelial salt and water transport, but the earliest and most persistent hypothesis has been that some defect in airway mucus is responsible. The role of mucous clearance as a primary innate defense mechanism of the airways has recently received renewed attention (6Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In CF airways, infecting organisms are confined to the mucus (6Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin.

Infection. 1987; 15: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but they are neither killed nor cleared, and their diffusible products provoke an intense but ineffective neutrophilic inflammatory response that further degrades the airways, eventually leading to death from pulmonary failure (11Meyer K.C. Zimmerman J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 121: 654-661PubMed Google Scholar). Within airways, CFTR is most highly expressed in serous cells of submucosal glands (12Engelhardt J.F. Yankaskas J.R. Ernst S.A. Yang Y. Marino C.R. Boucher R.C. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Submucosal glands, which are estimated to supply >95% of upper airway mucus (13Reid L. Thorax. 1960; 15: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), occur with a frequency of ∼1/mm2 in human trachea (14Tos M. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1966; 68: 1-130PubMed Google Scholar). Each gland comprises multiple tubules that feed into a collecting duct, which then narrows into a ciliated duct that is continuous with the airway surface (Fig. 1 and Ref. 15Meyrick B. Sturgess J.M. Reid L. Thorax. 1969; 24: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Tubules are lined with mucous cells in their proximal regions and with serous cells in the distal acini (15Meyrick B. Sturgess J.M. Reid L. Thorax. 1969; 24: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Normal glands are ∼60% serous and 40% mucous cells by volume, and the abundant serous cells secrete water, electrolytes, and a rich mixture of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant substances, whereas mucous cells provide most of the mucin component (16Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Meyrick B. Reid L. J. Anat. 1970; 107: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their key role in fighting mucosal infections, serous cells have been described as “immobilized neutrophils” (16Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Remarkably, despite their possible relevance for CF lung disease, the behavior of intact, CF submucosal glands has never been directly studied. However, ion and fluid secretion is reduced in cultures of CF gland cells (18Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L491-L494PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jiang C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Miller S.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 637-647Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in glands pharmacologically treated with CFTR inhibitors (20Ballard S.T. Trout L. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Crews A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L694-L699PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with patch clamp studies of primary cultures of serous cells (21Becq F. Merten M.D. Voelckel M.A. Gola M. Figarella C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the Calu-3 serous cell model (22Haws C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L502-L512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicate that CFTR is the only physiologically relevant apical anion channel in such cells. Ussing chamber studies with permeabilized cell sheets of Calu-3 cells confirm those studies and further indicate that functional CFTR is required for secretion to calcium-elevating agonists (23Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar, 24Moon S. Singh M. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1208-L1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is predicted that fluid secretion from serous cells in CF glands should be deficient to all mediators. However, because glands also contain mucous cells that do not appear to contain CFTR (12Engelhardt J.F. Yankaskas J.R. Ernst S.A. Yang Y. Marino C.R. Boucher R.C. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), the expected serous cell defect should be most easily detected if an agonist could be found that preferentially activated serous cell secretion.

In isolated submucosal glands from cats, VIP stimulates glycoconjugate release without stimulating contraction of myoepithelial cells (27Shimura S. Sasaki T. Ikeda K. Sasaki H. Takishima T. J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 65: 2537-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding sites for VIP are detected on human submucosal glands (28Sharma R.K. Addis B.J. Jeffery P.K. Pulm. Pharmacol. 1995; 8: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the Calu-3 human serous cell model has functional VPAC1 (VIP/PACAP-II) receptors (29Linden A. Yoshihara S. Cardell L.O. Kaneko T. Stjarne P. Nadel J.A. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition to stimulating macromolecular secretion, we recently showed that VIP stimulates sustained fluid secretion from pig submucosal glands (30Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28167-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, VIP seemed to be a good choice to test the hypothesis that serous cell secretion is defective in CF glands (24Moon S. Singh M. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1208-L1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); forskolin was also used to circumvent variations in VIP receptor density (28Sharma R.K. Addis B.J. Jeffery P.K. Pulm. Pharmacol. 1995; 8: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Human tracheal and bronchial tissues were obtained following lung transplants, or in one CF case, from a necropsy specimen obtained 4 h post-mortem. These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Stanford University. Usable data were obtained from 33 subjects. Subject characteristics are given in Table I.Table ISubjectsDonor tracheasOther diseasesCystic fibrosisNumber of subjects15108Male, n(%)8 (53%)4 (40%)4 (50%)Age (mean ± S.D.)29 ± 1250 ± 732 ± 14 Open table in a new tab Other diseases consisted of patients diagnosed with α1antitrypsin deficiency (n = 4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 3), and bronchiolitis obliterans pulmonary emphysema, and cardiomyopathy with pulmonary fibrosis plus IgA deficiency (n = 1 each). No obvious differences in gland secretion were observed among the non-CF disease conditions, and so they were grouped for analysis. Tissues were transported to the laboratory in cold PhysiosolTM solution (Abbott) and were then transferred to ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, where they were maintained until use. The Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer composition was: 115 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 1.0 μm indomethacin. pH was 7.4, and osmolarity was adjusted to ∼290 mosm. A piece of ventral trachea or bronchus of ∼1.5 cm2 was pinned mucosal-side-up, and the mucosa with underlying glands was dissected from the cartilage and mounted in a 35-mm diameter, Sylgard-lined plastic Petri dish with the serosa in the bath (∼2 ml volume) and the mucosa in air. The tissue surface was cleaned and blotted dry with cotton swabs and further dried with a stream of gas, after which 30–70 μl of water-saturated mineral oil was placed on the surface. The tissue was warmed to 37 °C at a rate of ∼1.5 °C min−1 and continuously superfused with warmed, humidified 95% O2, 5% CO2. Pharmacological agents were diluted to final concentration with warmed, gassed bath solution and were added to the serosal side by complete bath replacement. Two experimental paradigms were used in an attempt to detect minor levels of VIP/forskolin-mediated secretion in CF tissues. In one, we waited until basal secretion (if present) was stopped or stable and then added 1 μm VIP or 10 μm forskolin serially or together. Forskolin was used to control for the possibility that VIP receptors are decreased in CF tissues. After intervals of 40 min to 1 h, 10 μm carbachol was then added to test for gland viability. In the second procedure, we first stimulated transiently with a 2.5 μm solution of carbachol until small bubbles of mucus formed over some gland ducts and then repeatedly replaced the bath with fresh Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer until secretion either stopped or returned to basal values. VIP + forskolin was then applied, and the secreted droplets of mucus were followed for at least 40 min to detect any slight increase in the rate of secretion. A second application of 10 μm carbachol was then applied. Bubbles of mucus within the oil layer were visualized by oblique illumination, and digital images were captured with a CCD sensor mounted on a microscope (small field) or were obtained directly with the macro lens of a Nikon digital camera (large field). For macro images, each image contained an internal reference grid to compensate for any minor adjustments in magnification made during the experiment. Stored images were analyzed either by direct measurement or with Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Mucous volumes were determined from the size of the spherical bubbles; bubbles that were not spherical were omitted from secretion rate analyses. Details of these methods are given in Refs. 30Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol.

Compounds (Sigma) were made fresh or maintained at −20 °C in the following solvents: carbachol and VIP in distilled water, indomethacin in ethanol, and forskolin in Me2SO. All were diluted 1:1,000 with bath solution (except indomethacin, which was diluted 1:10,000) immediately before use at the concentrations indicated. Data are means ± S.E., and Student'st test for unpaired data was used to compare the means of different treatment groups unless otherwise indicated. The difference between the two means was considered to be significant whenp < 0.05. Pieces of human tracheal or bronchial epithelia were prepared so that spherical bubbles of uncontaminated mucus formed within an oil layer on the surface (Fig. 2). The bubbles of mucus, which remained attached to the gland ducts, were optically monitored, and their volumes were estimated by assuming that they were spheres (31Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glands sometimes began secreting at room temperature or started secreting as the bath was warmed (Fig. 2 a). This basal secretion was variable, usually diminished or stopped within 30 min after the tissue reached 37 °C, and in general was less pronounced than in sheep and pigs (30Joo N.S. Saenz Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28167-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Trout L. Corboz M.R. Ballard S.T. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), fluid secretion produced by the elevation of [cAMP]i is mediated by HCO3−secretion and is CFTR-dependent. Prior studies of [cAMP]i-mediated, serous cell protein secretion emphasized pathways through β-adrenergic receptors (16Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but isoproterenol produces minimal mucous secretion in sheep (31Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pigs (30Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L639-L645PubMed Google Scholar), so these latter agents were used. Treatment of control tissues with VIP or forskolin resulted in gland mucous secretion that reached a maximal value at about 10 min and was then sustained (Figs. 2 b and3). Secretion in response to VIP or forskolin was observed in each of 15 donor tracheas and in bronchial glands from each of 10 subjects with non-CF diseases (100%). Secretion rates and profiles in response to VIP/forskolin were quantified for a subset of glands in donors and other diseases (Fig. 3). For a subset of 68 glands from donor tracheas, secretion rates varied from 0 to a maximal rate of 4.50 nl·min−1 gland−1 with a mean rate of 1.04 ± 0.23 nl·min−1 gland−1. In a subset of 48 glands from non-CF diseases, secretion rates ranged from 0 to 5.02 nl·min−1 gland−1 with a mean rate of 1.14 ± 0.35 nl·min−1 gland−1. As with responses to carbachol in sheep (31Joo N.S., Wu, J.V. Krouse M.E. Saenz Y. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pigs (30Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28167-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we observed wide variations in secretion rates to VIP/forskolin among glands within subjects (Figs. 2 and 3). In marked contrast with the gland secretory responses seen in all non-CF subjects, submucosal glands from CF subjects were completely refractory to stimulation with VIP or forskolin or to combined treatment (Figs.4 and 5). We observed no gland secretion to either agent, alone or in combination, in any of eight CF subjects followed for periods of 40–60 min (p < 0.001 for CF versus either control group, Chi square). All of the glands counted as refractory to forskolin were otherwise functional because they secreted in response to the [Ca2+]i-elevating agonist carbachol (Figs.4 and 5) (35Jayaraman S. Joo N.S. Reitz B. Wine J.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8119-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The percentage of carbachol-responsive glands that also responded to forskolin was 73% for donor trachea (605/827 glands), 89% for bronchi from diseases other than CF (148/166 glands), and 0% for CF (0/450 glands) (Fig. 6).Figure 5Forskolin failed to stimulate mucus secretion from CF glands. Initial secretion was produced by stimulating with 2.5 μm carbachol. After a thorough wash, two glands were followed for 45 min during which a low rate of secretion continued (0.15 nl·min−1 gland−1). Stimulation for 70 min with 10 μm forskolin caused no increase in the secretion rate, but glands were still viable because they subsequently responded vigorously to 10 μm carbachol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Summary of airway submucosal gland responses to VIP/forskolin. a, subjects tested (open bar) and responding (closed bar). b, glands tested (open bar) and responding (closed bar). The asterisk indicates zero responses of all CF glands in all subjects.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our animal studies of carbachol-mediated secretion, we observed no diminution in responsiveness for tissues up to 24 h after harvest. In human donor tissues, responses to carbachol also appeared to be undiminished for at least 24 h after harvest, but responses to VIP/forskolin were less robust and declined in responsiveness after ∼10 h (Fig. 7), although some control glands were observed responding to forskolin for up to 40 h after harvest. The mean ages of tissues at the time of experiments for donors, other diseases, and CF were 15 ± 11, 13 ± 8, and 11 ± 9 h, respectively. Thus, CF tissues were tested on average several hours earlier than controls, eliminating a time-dependent change in responsiveness as a basis for the absence of responses in the CF tissues. One possible explanation for the complete lack of cAMP-mediated secretion from CF glands is that such secretion is proposed to originate from serous cells, and conversion of serous to mucous cells has been observed in chronic bronchitis (13Reid L. Thorax. 1960; 15: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 36Glynn A.A. Michaels L. Thorax. 1960; 15: 142-152Crossref Google Scholar). However, such conversion has not been claimed for CF glands, and histological examination of glands from the CF and non-CF subjects we studied showed abundant serous cells in the CF glands (Fig. 8). As reported by others (37Reid L. de Haller R. Bibl. Paediatr. 1967; 86: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bedrossian C.W. Greenberg S.D. Singer D.B. Hansen J.J. Rosenberg H.S. Hum. Pathol. 1976; 7: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 39Hays S.R. Woodruff P.G. Ferrando R.E. Cadbury P. Wong H.H. Lallas D. Stulbarg M. Fahy J.V. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2001; 32: 305Google Scholar), simple inspection revealed CF glands to be much larger than glands in the non-CF groups. Although we have not yet quantified the extent of CF gland hypertrophy in our samples, the volume of serous cells in the CF airways we studied is clearly greater than in control tissues, further highlighting the remarkable absence of responsiveness to VIP or forskolin. We found that glands from cystic fibrosis airways completely lack secretion stimulated by VIP or forskolin. Our experiments with intact, individually monitored airway glands are the first to demonstrate a defect in CF airway gland volume secretion, but they were preceded by highly informative experiments with primary cultures of serous-like cells derived from CF airway glands, which showed defects in stimulus-evoked short circuit current (18Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L491-L494PubMed Google Scholar) and fluid secretion (19Jiang C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Miller S.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 637-647Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40Jiang C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. McCray P.B., Jr. Miller S.S. Science. 1993; 262: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Together with localization of CFTR to gland serous cells (12Engelhardt J.F. Yankaskas J.R. Ernst S.A. Yang Y. Marino C.R. Boucher R.C. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), the present and previous studies establish serous cell dysfunction as a consistent feature of CF submucosal glands. In our study, serous cell dysfunction was not caused by general debility, inactivity, or inflammation because every non-CF transplant patient responded to VIP/forskolin stimulation. Because forskolin was also ineffective, a deficiency in VIP receptors cannot explain the results, nor can serous-mucous cell conversion because direct inspection revealed abundant serous cells within CF submucosal glands. The absence of [cAMP]i-mediated serous cell fluid secretion in CF glands generates a series of questions about gland secretion, which are discussed with reference to the model of gland secretion shown in Fig. 9. In that model, gland mucus is the joint product of serous cells and mucous cells, which normally secrete together. In the following discussion, we distinguish between fluid secretion, which we use as shorthand for electrolyte-driven water transport, and macromolecular secretion, which refers to the secretion of everything else, including mucins and non-mucin proteins. Normal mucus is ∼98% water. Our results are consistent with the serous cell model developed by studies of Calu-3 cells (22Haws C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L502-L512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and primary cultures of serous cells (18Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L491-L494PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jiang C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Miller S.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 637-647Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in which CFTR is required for anion secretion to all mediators (see Introduction). Secretion in response to agents that elevate [Ca2+]i is effected either because CFTR is normally open or because stimulation releases ATP and activates CFTR via an apical autocrine pathway (41Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ballard and colleagues (32Trout L. Corboz M.R. Ballard S.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L639-L645PubMed Google Scholar) showed that mucus secretion by pig airways is maximally stimulated by ACh, that forskolin produces about 60% of that volume, and that the two agonists are not additive. CFTR expression, studied with a well characterized polyclonal antibody and with in situ hybridization, was observed in serous but not mucous tubules (12Engelhardt J.F. Yankaskas J.R. Ernst S.A. Yang Y. Marino C.R. Boucher R.C. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), although others have reported more extensive expression (42Jacquot J. Puchelle E. Hinnrasky J. Fuchey C. Bettinger C. Spilmont C. Bonnet N. Dieterle A. Dreyer D. Pavirani A. Dalemans W. Eur. Respir. J. 1993; 6: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar). If CFTR is localized to serous cells, then the absence of forskolin-stimulated secretion in CF glands suggests that normal mucous cells do not secrete fluid in response to forskolin, whereas the continued ability of CF glands to secrete to ACh suggests that fluid secretion by mucous cells does not require CFTR. Most prior studies of secretion by cultured gland cells or explants have studied either the release of labeled macromolecules or short circuit current, but these two features of secretion may be uncoupled, especially in glands expressing a genetic defect. Prior studies with explants of whole bronchial segments (43Rogers D.F. Alton E.W. Dewar A. Lethem M.I. Barnes P.J. Exp. Lung Res. 1993; 19: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or primary submucosal gland cell cultures (44Merten M.D. Figarella C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L93-L99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from CF subjects found defective stimulus-evoked secretion of macromolecules. We have not addressed that possibility in the present experiments. Given the total loss of secretion to VIP and forskolin in CF glands, is the secretion that remains to carbachol indistinguishable from normal secretion? That is, can this Ca2+-elevating agent induce CF serous cells to secrete? The model of gland function shown in Fig. 9predicts that it cannot, resulting in gland fluid secretion to cholinergic agents that will be mediated only by fluid secretion from mucous cells. It is not a simple matter to determine whether such secretion is deficient. As documented by others, the CF glands in our study appeared much larger than normal, but we have not yet established that point with morphometry. Given the expected hypertrophy of CF submucosal glands (a 4-fold increase was observed in a recent study (39Hays S.R. Woodruff P.G. Ferrando R.E. Cadbury P. Wong H.H. Lallas D. Stulbarg M. Fahy J.V. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2001; 32: 305Google Scholar)), a meaningful comparison of secretion rates requires that the rates be expressed relative to gland volumes. Such studies are now underway. Surprisingly, secretions of pig glands in response to forskolin or carbachol had equivalent pH values (30Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28167-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and again surprisingly, [Na+] and pH values for carbachol-stimulated gland secretions were equivalent in CF and control subjects (35Jayaraman S. Joo N.S. Reitz B. Wine J.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8119-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Whether the loss of CFTR will alter protein secretion from serous cells in situ, as occurred for cultured CF gland cells (44Merten M.D. Figarella C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L93-L99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is uncertain. It remains possible that the only component missing from CF mucus is CFTR-dependent salt and water flux. VIP is one of the most abundant peptides in the lungs, and a plethora of studies have implicated VIP pathways in the suppression of inflammation and cell damage (45Said S.I. Dickman K.G. Regul. Pept. 2000; 93: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exactly how this occurs is unknown. If selective VIP activation of serous cells occurs naturally, it is possible that it could contribute to the anti-inflammatory role of VIP in the airways, and its loss in CF may contribute to the heightened inflammatory state that is a hallmark of CF airway disease (46Tirouvanziam R. de Bentzmann S. Hubeau C. Hinnrasky J. Jacquot J. Peault B. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 47Kube D. Sontich U. Fletcher D. Davis P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L493-L502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). People with cystic fibrosis die primarily because their lungs become chronically infected with bacteria and fungi that are easily cleared from normal lungs. Importantly, the pathogens in CF airways are trapped within the mucus (8Ulrich M. Herbert S. Berger J. Bellon G. Louis D. Munker G. Doring G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the ability of even normal mucus to inhibit the growth of pathogens is incomplete and wanes over time, emphasizing the importance of mucociliary clearance and cough in limiting the residence time of pathogens in the airways (48Cole A.M. Dewan P. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3267-3275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of serous cell secretion may dispose the airways to infections via multiple mechanisms, including slower transport of mucus, absolute stasis of mucus caused by tethering to glands (49Sakakura Y. Eur. J. Respir. Dis. Suppl. 1983; 128: 348-354PubMed Google Scholar), reduced secretion of antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory agents, and reduced bioavailability of these agents because of inadequate dispersal (50Clarke L.L. Walker N.M. Phillips T.E. Franklin C.L. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2001; 32: 241Google Scholar). All of these features will be exacerbated by increased fluid absorption and decreased fluid secretion by the surface epithelium (6Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 51Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) Based on the above results and reasoning, our working hypothesis is that secretion by CF submucosal glands lacks the electrolyte-driven fluid component normally supplied by serous cells. Macromolecular secretion by both serous and mucous cells, as well as electrolyte-driven fluid secretion by mucous cells, are hypothesized to be intact. Because the rheological properties of mucous depend critically on the concentration of macromolecules during initial formation of the gel and are resistant to subsequent changes, we hypothesize that a deficiency in electrolyte-driven water transport deep within the gland tubules will increase the concentration of gland mucus, adversely affecting mucus clearance from the glands and contributing to impaired mucociliary and cough clearance.

https://openalex.org/W2094575179,"Bile acid synthesis occurs mainly via two pathways: the “classic” pathway, initiated by microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and an “alternative” (acidic) pathway, initiated by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27). CYP27 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where cholesterol content is very low. We hypothesized that cholesterol transport into mitochondria may be rate-limiting for bile acid synthesis via the “alternative” pathway. Overexpression of the gene encoding steroidogenic acuteregulatory (StAR) protein, a known mitochondrial cholesterol transport protein, led to a 5-fold increase in bile acid synthesis. An increase in StAR protein coincided with an increase in bile acid synthesis. CYP27 overexpression increased bile acid synthesis by <2-fold. The rates of bile acid synthesis following a combination of StAR plus CYP27 overexpression were similar to those obtained with StAR alone. TLC analysis of 14C-labeled bile acids synthesized in cells overexpressing StAR showed a 5-fold increase in muricholic acid; in chloroform-extractable products, a dramatic increase was seen in bile acid biosynthesis intermediates (27- and 7,27-hydroxycholesterol). High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that 27-hydroxycholesterol accumulated in the mitochondria of StAR-overexpressing cells only. These findings suggest that cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane is the predominant rate-determining step for bile acid synthesis via the alternative pathway.

Vlahcevic Z.R. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Chisari F.V. Fausto N. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 231-247Google Scholar, 2Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1988: 617-641Google Scholar). Bile acid synthesis in liver is the major pathway for cholesterol output. The biotransformation of cholesterol to primary bile acids occurs via two main pathways. In the “classic/neutral” pathway, metabolism of the sterol nucleus occurs before side chain modifications and begins with hydroxylation of cholesterol at the 7α-position (3Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the initial and rate-determining step in this pathway of bile acid synthesis. In the “alternative” pathway of bile acid synthesis, commonly called the “acidic” pathway, side chain modifications precede modifications in the sterol nucleus. The initial and presumed rate-determining step in the acidic pathway is catalyzed by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27). In contrast to CYP7A1, which is found only in the liver, CYP27 has a wide tissue distribution. The ability of peripheral cells to 27-hydroxylate cholesterol has been proposed to be important in “reverse cholesterol transport” (4Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E. Xiu R.J. Deeb S. Reshef A. Leitersdorf E. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26253-26261Google Scholar, 5Bjorkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Google Scholar, 6Lund E. Andersson O. Zhang J. Babiker A. Ahlborg G. Diczfalusy U. Einarsson K. Sjovall J. Bjorkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, CYP27 located in peripheral tissues generates oxysterols that are more water-soluble than cholesterol. These metabolites can then be transported to the liver and converted to bile acids. It is possible that CYP27 in peripheral tissues may both down-regulate cholesterol synthesis and enhance the efflux of cholesterol to the liver for elimination. Thus, up-regulation of CYP27 could represent a treatment of hyperlipidemia. However, overexpression of the gene encoding CYP27 in primary rat and human hepatocytes or HepG2 cells led to only an ∼50% increase in bile acid synthesis (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that increasing cholesterol delivery to and/or into the mitochondria where CYP27 is located could potentially increase the rate of bile acid synthesis via the acidic pathway. Precedence for this has previously been demonstrated in other steroidogenic tissues. In the adrenal gland, increased expression of the mitochondrial cholesterol transport protein steroidogenic acuteregulatory (StAR) 1The abbreviations used are: StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Ad, adenovirus; ACTH, adrenocorticotropin. protein was shown to increase mitochondrial cholesterol delivery and steroidogenesis (8Christenson L.K. Strauss J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Google Scholar). This study shows that overexpression of the gene encoding StAR protein in primary rat hepatocytes dramatically increases bile acid synthesis, which suggests that cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane is the rate-determining step for bile acid biosynthesis via the alternative pathway rather than CYP27. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing cholesterol transport to inner mitochondrial CYP27 bypasses the highly regulated CYP7A1 of the “classic/neutral” pathway of bile acid biosynthesis. These findings provide an entirely new insight into how bile acid biosynthesis is regulated. Cell culture reagents and supplies were purchased from Invitrogen. The RPA II kit was purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). [14C]Cholesterol and 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 25-, 7α-, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol were purchased from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI).

Silica Gel 1B TLC sheets were purchased from VWR Scientific Products (Bridgeport, NJ). HPLC-grade solvents were purchased from Fisher. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) as previously described by us (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar) using the collagenase perfusion technique of Bissell and Guzelian (9Bissell D.M. Guzelian P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 85-98Google Scholar). Cells were routinely harvested after 72 h of culture as previously described (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar). Unless specified, cells were maintained under conditions in which CYP7A1 activity is undetectable (i.e. cultured as previously described (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar) in the absence of thyroid hormone). The adenovirus constructs used in this study were obtained through the Massey Cancer Center Shared Resource Facility of the Virginia Commonwealth University. The CMV-CYP27 recombinant adenovirus clone (Ad-CMV-CYP27) was constructed as previously described (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar, 11Pandak W.M. Bohdan P. Franklund C. Mallonee D.H. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Gil G. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1801-1809Google Scholar). Briefly, the CMV-StAR adenovirus construct (Ad-CMV-StAR) was obtained using a pTG-CMV system as previously described (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar, 11Pandak W.M. Bohdan P. Franklund C. Mallonee D.H. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Gil G. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1801-1809Google Scholar). A 1.6-kb human adrenal cortex StAR cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Jerome Strauss, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) was cloned into theSalI/NotI restriction sites of pZeroTG-CMV, a plasmid containing the CMV promoter, multiple cloning sites, and a partial DNA sequence from Ad5dl324 (12Christenson L.K. McAllister J.M. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Osborne T.F. Strauss J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30729-30735Google Scholar). The resulting pZeroTG-CMV/HStAR plasmid was cotransformed withClaI-linearized pTG-CMV (containing the entire Ad5dl324 genome) into Escherichia coli. Recombinant plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Adenovirus DNA from the resulting plaques was further screened by Southern blotting for the presence of the insert. Large-scale production of recombinant virus was accomplished by infecting confluent monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (grown in 15-cm tissue culture dishes) with stock adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell. After 2 h of infection, unbound virus was removed, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum was added. Infected monolayers were harvested by scraping when >90% of the cells showed cytopathic changes and centrifuged at 2700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and subjected to five cycles of freeze/thaw lysis to release the recombinant virus. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 7700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To purify the recombinant virus, the crude supernatant was carefully layered over a two-step gradient containing 3 ml of CsCl (d = 1.4 g/ml) in TD buffer (0.14 mNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 19 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.7 mm Na2HPO4), layered over 3 ml of CsCl (d = 1.25 g/ml) in TD buffer, and centrifuged at 155,000 × g for 1 h at 20 °C. The viral band was removed, layered over 8 ml of CsCl (d = 1.33 g/ml) in TD buffer, and centrifuged at 155,000 × g for 18 h at 20 °C. The pure viral opalescent band was removed and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The virus was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until used. The virus titer (plaque-forming units) was determined by plaque assay, and virus particles were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm by spectrophotometry. Primary rat hepatocyte cultures, prepared as previously described (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar), were plated on 150-mm tissue culture dishes (∼2.5 × 107 cells) in Williams' E medium containing dexamethasone (0.1 μm). Unless otherwise specified, cells were maintained in the absence of thyroid hormone, a condition under which only the acidic pathway of bile acid synthesis is functional (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar). In selected studies, thyroid hormone (l-thyroxine) was added as previously described (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1.0 μm, a culture condition under which both bile acid biosynthesis pathways are fully functional. Twenty-four hours after plating, the culture medium was removed, and 2.5 ml of fresh medium was added. Cells were then infected with unpurified adenovirus encoding either CMV-StAR or CMV-CYP27 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. All experiments were compared with the Ad-CMV control virus and no-virus cultures. The virus was allowed to dwell for at least 2 h in minimal culture medium, with the plates being gently shaken every 15 min. After 2 h of infection, unbound virus was removed and replaced with 20 ml of fresh medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells were then harvested as previously described (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar). RNA was isolated as previously described (13Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C. Heuman D.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3416-3421Google Scholar). CYP7A1 and CYP27 mRNAs were quantified using Northern blot assays (20 μg of total RNA). After infection, either cells were harvested by adding sample buffer as indicated, or subcellular fractions were separated and isolated by centrifugation as previously described (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar). Proteins were then solubilized by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (5 mmTris buffer (pH 8.3), 29% (w/v) SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 38 mm glycine, and 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue), followed by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Solubilized proteins (3 μg) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis was performed at 20 mA for 2 h in a Bio-Rad minigel system. StAR protein was identified by Western blot analysis. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 25 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05% NaN3; immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) against the human StAR protein (a generous gift from Dr. Jerome Strauss) in HEPES buffer; washed with the same buffer plus 0.05% Tween 20; and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000; Sigma). Bands were visualized using chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Kodak BioMax film. CYP27 immunoblotting was performed as previously described (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat CYP27 protein was a generous gift from Dr. N. Avadhani (University of Pennsylvania). Mitochondria and microsomes were prepared as previously described (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar, 10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar). The specific activities of CYP7A1 and CYP27 were determined by HPLC assays as previously described (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar, 10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar). Bile acid synthesis rates were determined by addition of 2.5 μCi of [14C]cholesterol to each 150-mm plate of confluent primary rat hepatocyte cultures (∼2.45 × 107 cells) 24 h after plating. The medium and cells were harvested 48 h after viral infection. Conversion of [14C]cholesterol to [14C]methanol/water-soluble products was determined by scintillation counting after Folch extraction (14Folch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar) with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) of cells and of the culture medium. The rates of bile acid biosynthesis following recombinant adenovirus infection were calculated as the ratio of [14C]methanol/water-soluble counts to the sum of chloroform/methanol/water-soluble counts. Individual bile acids were identified as previously described (11Pandak W.M. Bohdan P. Franklund C. Mallonee D.H. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Gil G. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1801-1809Google Scholar). Briefly, to identify the individual bile acids, the [14C]methanol/water phase was first base-hydrolyzed and then separated by TLC in a solvent system of ethyl acetate/cyclohexane/acetic acid (7.7:2.3:1, v/v/v).14C-Labeled bile acids were visualized with a PhosphorImager. Time points for conversion of [14C]cholesterol to14C-labeled bile acids were carried out using 150-mm tissue culture dishes Aliquots (100 μl) of the medium were collected in duplicate in a microcentrifuge tube and kept frozen until analysis. A mini-Folch extraction was carried out by adding the following to the culture medium sample to help separate the phases: 50 μl of water, 250 μl of methanol, 537 μl of chloroform (H2O/MeOH/CHCl3, 2:3:7), and 3 μl of 1m Na2CO3. The tubes were vigorously vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 6 min. The phases were collected separately and counted. Time points for the 7α-[14C]hydroxycholesterol conversion to bile acids were taken from 60-mm tissue culture dishes plated for that purpose. In selected studies, the rate of 7α-hydroxycholesterol uptake and subsequent metabolism to bile acids was determined. Twenty-four hours after plating, isolated primary rat hepatocytes were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding the CMV-driven StAR gene, null virus (control), or no-virus addition. Following infection, 7α-[14C]hydroxycholesterol (1 × 105dpm/60-mm plate) and unlabeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol (5 μm) were added. Samples were collected in duplicate and extracted, and methanol/water-soluble counts were determined. Bile acid synthesis was measured as conversion of 7α-[14C]hydroxycholesterol to [14C]methanol/water-extractable counts. Conjugated bile acids in the bile collected from biliary diverted rats were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as previously described (13Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C. Heuman D.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3416-3421Google Scholar). In chronic biliary diverted rats, bile acid synthesis is equivalent to biliary bile acid secretion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were housed under controlled lighting conditions on a natural light-dark cycle. Groups of age- and weight-matched animals were used in all experiments. Under brief methoxyflurane anesthesia, intravenous and biliary fistula cannulas were placed as previously described (13Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C. Heuman D.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3416-3421Google Scholar, 15Pandak W.M. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 79-90Google Scholar, 16Vlahcevic Z.R. Jairath S.K. Heuman D.M. Stravitz R.T. Hylemon P.B. Avadhani N.G. Pandak W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G646-G652Google Scholar). After cannula placement, each rat was intravenously infused with 1–1.5 × 1011 virus particles of recombinant adenovirus containing CMV-StAR or control virus. Following surgery, the rats were housed in individual metabolic cages with free access to water and chow. Diverted bile was collected in timed increments throughout the course of the experiment. All animals received a continuous infusion of glucose/electrolyte replacement solution at 1.07 ml/h. Throughout the experiment, dietary intake, activity, and bile flow were monitored as previously described (13Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C. Heuman D.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3416-3421Google Scholar). At the end of the experiments, animals were briefly anesthetized and decapitated, and blood was collected to measure serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels as previously described (16Vlahcevic Z.R. Jairath S.K. Heuman D.M. Stravitz R.T. Hylemon P.B. Avadhani N.G. Pandak W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G646-G652Google Scholar). Animals were killed at 9–10 a.m. Data are reported as means ± S.E. Where indicated, data were subjected to t test analysis and determined to be significantly different if p is <0.05. Infection of primary rat hepatocytes with Ad-CMV-StAR produced high StAR mRNA and protein levels with no evidence of cell toxicity. Fig. 1 shows the increase in StAR mRNA and protein levels 48 h following infection (see “Experimental Procedures”). Rat adrenal poly(A) RNA was used as a control. Two mRNA species (1.6 and 4.0 kb) were observed (Fig. 1A), representing parental and mature forms of StAR mRNA as previously shown (18Liu J. Heikkila P. Kahri A.I. Voutilainen R. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 43-50Google Scholar, 19Sugawara T. Lin D. Holt J.A. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12506-12512Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of mitochondrial proteins showed one major immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of 30 kDa, consistent with the mature StAR protein (Fig. 1B), as previously reported (8Christenson L.K. Strauss J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Google Scholar, 17Stocco D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 184-197Google Scholar). Primary rat hepatocyte subcellular fractions were then isolated, and distribution of StAR protein was examined by Western blot analysis. In hepatocytes overexpressing StAR, StAR protein was found widely distributed in the cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria (data not shown). A comparison of StAR protein levels in StAR-overexpressing primary hepatocytes and in rat testis and adrenal gland is shown in Fig. 1C. The recombinant StAR protein had a molecular mass similar to that in rat testis and adrenal gland; however, the level of StAR protein in hepatocytes following StAR overexpression was significantly higher than that expressed under normal physiologic conditions in rat testis or adrenal gland. CYP27 is responsible for the 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol as the initial step in the acidic pathway of bile acid synthesis. To compare the effects of StAR and CYP27 overexpression, primary rat hepatocytes were infected with recombinant adenovirus containing the CMV-driven gene encoding CYP27 (Ad-CMV-CYP27). The infected cells produced very high CYP27 mRNA and protein levels without inducing any evidence of cell toxicity. Northern blot analysis showed a 2.1-kb mRNA band representing mature CYP27 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis of mitochondrial proteins showed one major immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of 55 kDa (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of StAR, either alone or in combination with CYP27, did not alter CYP27 protein levels or catalytic activity (data not shown). Overexpression of StAR protein dramatically increased the rates of bile acid synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes. Time courses showing the increase in StAR protein levels, bile acid synthesis, and [14C]cholesterol uptake in primary rat hepatocytes after StAR overexpression are shown in Fig. 3. StAR protein was easily detected at 12 h following infection with recombinant adenovirus and steadily increased up to 48 h (Fig. 3A). The effects of StAR protein on the rates of bile acid synthesis in the cells were determined via conversion of [14C]cholesterol to [14C]methanol/water-extractable products (Fig. 3B). CYP27 overexpression only slightly increased bile acid synthesis rates over that observed in controls (cells infected with control recombinant adenovirus). In contrast, the rates of bile acid synthesis increased dramatically upon expression of StAR protein (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, overexpression of CYP27 and StAR together did not increase bile acid synthesis rates any more than StAR overexpression alone (Fig. 4). These results show that an increase in StAR protein is capable of increasing bile acid synthesis more efficiently than an increase in CYP27 expression. The effects of StAR protein on cellular cholesterol uptake are shown in Fig. 3C. To determine that this increase in bile acid synthesis was not the result of an increase in cholesterol uptake, the rates of cholesterol uptake were determined as [14C]cholesterol “disappearance” (chloroform phase) from the cell culture medium. As shown, neither StAR nor CYP27 overexpression affected cellular cholesterol uptake rates.Figure 4Effect of StAR and/or CYP27 overexpression on the rates of bile acid synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes.Primary rat hepatocytes were infected with the indicated recombinant adenoviruses and incubated with [14C]cholesterol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Forty-eight hours after infection, both cells (A) and the culture medium (B) were harvested, and bile acid synthesis levels were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bile acid synthesis levels are expressed as a percentage of control (null) virus and represent means ± S.E. of three to nine experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The rates of bile acid synthesis were further determined by quantifying the bile acid levels in the culture medium and within cells at 48 h after infection, as shown in Fig. 4. Within the cells, overexpression of StAR and co-overexpression of StAR plus CYP27 produced a >10-fold increase (p < 0.001) in the amount of bile acids over that observed in control cells (i.e. infected with control recombinant adenovirus), whereas CYP27 overexpression alone only led to only a 1.4-fold increase (Fig. 4A). In the culture medium, an ∼6-fold increase (p < 0.001) in bile acids (i.e. less than within the cell) was seen following StAR overexpression and StAR plus CYP27 co-overexpression, with a 76 ± 58% increase following infection with recombinant adenovirus containing the CMV-driven gene encoding CYP27 alone compared with the control virus (Fig. 4B). The differences in the rates of bile acid synthesis following overexpression of the genes encoding StAR and StAR plus CYP27 were not significant. The increase in the rates of bile acid synthesis following addition of unlabeled cholesterol (5 μm) to saturate and competitively slow [14C]cholesterol uptake into cells was >2-fold (data not shown). The steroid products in chloroform- and water/methanol-extractable phases were further analyzed by TLC (Fig. 5). 14C-Labeled steroid-extractable products in the chloroform phase were mainly composed of cholesterol esters, cholesterol, 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, 3-oxo-7-hydroxycholesterol, and 7,27-dihydroxycholesterol (Fig. 5A). Cholesterol and cholesterol esters were decreased in the culture medium of cells overexpressing StAR or StAR plus CYP27. Conversely, 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7,27-dihydroxycholesterol levels increased significantly in cells overexpressing StAR or StAR plus CYP27. Because CYP27 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it is assumed that 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7,27-dihydroxycholesterol are products of the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis. The results from TLC analysis of products in the methanol phase of the culture medium are shown in Fig. 5B. A 5-fold increase was seen in soluble steroids, β-muricholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 5B) in the culture medium following StAR or StAR plus CYP27 overexpression. In selected studies, thyroid hormone was added to the culture medium as described under “Experiment Procedures.” Under these conditions. CYP7A1 and the neutral (classic) pathway of bile acid synthesis are fully active. Of note is that CYP7A1 mRNA levels under these culture conditions are greater than those found in the up-regulated cholestyramine-fed rat model (10Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16866-16871Google Scholar). These studies were performed to address the question, is StAR overexpression capable of increasing the rate of bile acid synthesis over the basal rates found in the presence of a fully functional neutral pathway? Using these culture conditions, overexpression of StAR still led to a >2-fold increase (p < 0.001) in the rates of bile acid synthesis (data not shown). To demonstrate that StAR overexpression leads to an increase in the product of CYP27, mitochondrial 27-hydroxycholesterol levels were determined following StAR and CYP27 overexpression (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar). Mitochondrial sterol analysis revealed an easily detectable retention peak for endogenous 27-hydroxycholesterol in the mitochondria of StAR-overexpressing hepatocytes (Fig. 6). Of note is that neither control cells nor cells overexpressing CYP27 had detectable 27-hydroxycholesterol levels in their mitochondria (previously determined detection sensitivity of ∼20 pmol). 27-Hydroxycholesterol accumulated only following StAR overexpression. Following the determination of endogenous mitochondrial 27-hydroxycholesterol levels, mitochondria were assayed for CYP27 specific activity. Interestingly, no detectable increase in CYP27 activity over controls was found following StAR overexpression. These findings suggest that the ability of StAR to increase mitochondrial cholesterol transport and its subsequent conversion to 27-hydroxycholesterol occurred prior to mitochondrial isolation for CYP27 activity analysis. Furthermore, these results show, given the existing basal cellular CYP27 protein levels, that cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane is the key rate-determining step in bile acid synthesis via the alternative pathway. The above findings, coupled with the inability of overexpression of the genes encoding CYP27 plus StAR to further increase bile acid synthesis above overexpression of the StAR gene alone, suggest that there exists an abundance of CYP27 under normal physiologic conditions. Overexpression of StAR did not alter the neutral pathway of bile acid synthesis. 7α-Hydroxycholesterol is the product of the initial and rate-determining step in the neutral (classic) pathway of bile acid synthesis. However, to be metabolized to bile acids, 7α-hydroxycholesterol must first be 27-hydroxylated by CYP27 in the mitochondria. To assess whether StAR protein might also induce the uptake and metabolism of 7α-hydroxycholesterol to mitochondrial CYP27, 7α-[14C]hydroxycholesterol was added to cells (see “Experiment Procedures”). Shown in Fig. 7 is the time course for 7α-[14C]hydroxycholesterol in cells overexpressing the gene encoding StAR. The time course for 7α-[14C]hydroxycholesterol utilization in primary rat hepatocytes showed no effect on the metabolism of 7α-hydroxycholesterol. These results further suggest that StAR protein up-regulates bile acid synthesis via the alternative (acidic) pathway via the delivery of cholesterol (and not bile acid intermediates) to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Infection of biliary diverted rats with recombinant adenovirus encoding CMV-StAR markedly increased StAR mRNA and protein levels (data not shown). Biliary diverted rats infected with StAR 3 days earlier at the time of their biliary diversion increased their rates of bile acid synthesis by 2.5-fold (n = 6;p < 0.001) over their basal synthesis rates at 20–24 h (Fig. 8). This represented a 1.8-fold (n = 3; p < 0.03) increase over 3-day biliary diverted controls (i.e. infected with control recombinant adenovirus). Thus, overexpression of StAR was able to dramatically increase bile acid synthesis rates over and above the usual ∼1.5–2-fold increase in basal rates observed in control biliary diverted rats 3 days following the loss of negative bile acid feedback. The bile acid concentration following both StAR and CYP7A1 overexpression was also similarly increased (data not shown). StAR protein has previously been shown to mobilize cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane in steroidogenic cells (i.e. adrenal cortex and gonads) (8Christenson L.K. Strauss J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Google Scholar, 17Stocco D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 184-197Google Scholar). Cholesterol transport is a principal control point for regulation of steroidogenesis by ACTH and other hormones acting through the adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ pathways (18Liu J. Heikkila P. Kahri A.I. Voutilainen R. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 43-50Google Scholar). Observations by Sugawaraet al. (19Sugawara T. Lin D. Holt J.A. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12506-12512Google Scholar) have subsequently provided evidence that not only is mitochondrial cholesterol transport rate-determining for steroidogenesis, but that StAR-induced mitochondrial cholesterol transport is capable of enhancing mitochondrial cholesterol metabolism by enzymes other than the steroidogenic cytochrome P450scc. There is, however, an abundance of StAR protein within the adrenal mitochondria. In contrast, StAR mRNA or protein has not been detected in liver tissue (18Liu J. Heikkila P. Kahri A.I. Voutilainen R. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 43-50Google Scholar, 20Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Driscoll D. Strauss J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy K.P. Hart I.M. Clark B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Google Scholar). Still, the existence of StAR or a StAR-like protein in liver hepatocytes seems to be necessary for bile acid synthesis to occur via the alternative pathway, as cholesterol must first be transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane before it can undergo 27-hydroxylation. Furthermore, the inability to dramatically increase bile acid synthesis in hepatocytes overexpressing CYP27 suggests that 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is not rate-limiting for the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis. The contribution of the “alternative” pathway to total bile acid synthesis is unclear, as under most physiologic conditions, the “classic” pathway appears to be the dominant pathway (3Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Google Scholar, 21Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D176-D193Google Scholar). It is currently believed that the “alternative” pathway of bile acid synthesis may play at least three roles in cholesterol homeostasis (3Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Google Scholar). 1) The 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol, both in the periphery and the liver, forms a regulatory oxysterol (i.e.27-hydroxycholesterol) (3Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Google Scholar, 7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar). The liver is capable of hydroxylating these regulatory oxysterols, leading to their subsequent metabolism to bile acids. 2) The “alternative” pathway may act as a “backup pathway” when the “classic” pathway is down-regulated. In CYP7A1 “knockout” animals, alternative pathways appear to be capable of producing adequate amounts of bile acids for survival and growth (22Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Bjorkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Google Scholar). 3) The “alternative” pathway may serve to regulate the ratios of bile acid species in bile, as this pathway is thought to generate mostly chenodeoxycholic acid in humans (3Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Google Scholar). It has been shown that up to 50% of bile acid biosynthesis may occur via an alternative pathway in the rat (23Princen H.M. Meijer P. Wolthers B.G. Vonk R.J. Kuipers F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 501-505Google Scholar, 24Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Russell T.L. Heizer M.L. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 337-347Google Scholar). Studies in humans have found a lower contribution under normal physiologic circumstances (25Duane W.C. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1194-1199Google Scholar). However, in human liver cholestatic conditions, this contribution has been found to be much higher, suggesting that the “alternative” pathway can be a major pathway under certain pathophysiologic conditions (26Axelson M. Mork B. Aly A. Wisen O. Sjovall J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1877-1882Google Scholar). Evidence supporting mitochondrial cholesterol transport as the rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis via the “alternative” pathway would give rise to a new hypothesis regarding regulation of the alternative pathway. It would also give strong evidence as to why CYP27 is localized in the mitochondria under highly regulated cholesterol access. In the “alternative” pathway, the initial and presumed rate-determining step is catalyzed by mitochondria CYP27. This study shows that cholesterol transport into the inner mitochondrial membrane is the rate-limiting step in the “alternative” pathway of bile acid synthesis rather than CYP27. Furthermore, in an unregulated state (i.e. increased expression of StAR protein with increased mitochondrial cholesterol transport), the highly regulated “neutral (classic)” pathway of bile acid synthesis can be bypassed, demonstrating the absolute necessity of tight regulation of mitochondrial cholesterol transport in the liver. The observation made in primary rat hepatocytes cultured in the presence of thyroid hormone is supportive of this statement. We have previously shown that upon addition of thyroid hormone to our standard culture medium, CYP7A1 is markedly up-regulated to levels greater than found in the up-regulated cholestyramine-fed rat (13Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C. Heuman D.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3416-3421Google Scholar). StAR overexpression under these culture conditions still led to a >2-fold increase in the rates of bile acid synthesis. In in vivo studies, overexpression of the StAR gene in the biliary diverted rat also led to a 1.8-fold increase in bile acid synthesis over controls (Fig. 8), a model previously believed to have maximal rates of bile acid synthesis. Our results show that overexpression of the StAR gene or co-overexpression of StAR and CYP27 led to the accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in mitochondria, whereas overexpression of CYP27 alone did not. Meanwhile, overexpression of the gene encoding StAR increased bile acid synthesis by 6-fold, whereas in direct comparison, overexpression of the gene encoding CYP27 increased synthesis by <2-fold. These findings are consistent with the increase in bile acid synthesis seen in HepG2 cells following overexpression of the gene encoding CYP27 (7Hall E. Hylemon P. Vlahcevic Z. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N. Pandak W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Google Scholar). StAR protein overexpression increases transport of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane, possibly leading to saturating cholesterol concentrations within the inner mitochondrial membrane and allowing maximal rates of bile acid synthesis. However, the accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and other bile acid intermediates in the mitochondria suggests the possibility of another rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis, i.e. transport of 27-hydroxycholesterol and/or other bile acid intermediates across mitochondrial membranes. StAR (StARD1) is a member of a family of proteins, each containing an ∼200–210 amino acid StAR-related lipidtransfer (START) domain (27Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 130-132Google Scholar). Recently, Soccio et al. (28Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Google Scholar) have discovered several more members of a subfamily of START (i.e. “StAR”) domain-containing proteins, StARD4, StARD5, and StARD6. Both StARD4 and StARD5 are ubiquitously expressed, with the greatest abundance in the liver and kidney, whereas StARD6 is exclusively expressed in the testis. Whether one of these liver START domain-containing proteins could function as a liver mitochondrial cholesterol transporter is currently not clear. Of interest is that most other previously identified START domain-containing proteins contain an N-terminal domain that appears to be important in directing their function (i.e. StARD1) (8Christenson L.K. Strauss J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Google Scholar, 17Stocco D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 184-197Google Scholar). However, StARD4, StARD5, and StARD6 are only 205–233-amino acid proteins consisting almost entirely of a START domain (28Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Google Scholar). Furthermore, StARD4–6 share only an ∼20% identity with the cholesterol-binding StARD1 and ∼30% identity with each other, allowing one to hypothesize that each may have a distinct function in the maintenance of intracellular lipid homeostasis (28Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6943-6948Google Scholar). In summary, the results reported in this study show that the “alternative” pathway of bile acid synthesis is primarily regulated by cholesterol transport into the mitochondria and suggest that the hepatocyte must have StAR or homologs for transporting cholesterol into the inner mitochondrial membrane. This study also suggests alternative mechanisms for increasing the rates of bile acid synthesis and cholesterol output from the body. Previously unsuspected, this study also demonstrates that a sufficient increase in mitochondrial cholesterol transport within the hepatocyte is capable of bypassing the usually dominant “classic” pathway of bile acid synthesis, obviating the rate-limiting function of the highly regulated CYP7A1. We acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Jerome Strauss, without whose help this study would not have been possible."
https://openalex.org/W2169546367,"Defective Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is responsible for some types of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and ventral horn motor neurons (VMN) have been shown to die through a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway after chronic exposure to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). VMN are also selectively vulnerable to mild spinal cord injury (SCI); however, the involvement of SOD1, ROS, and apoptosis in their death has not been clarified. Mild compression SCI was induced in SOD1-overexpressing transgenic rats and wild-type littermates. Superoxide production, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 were examined, and apoptotic DNA injury was also characterized. In the wild-type animals, increased superoxide production, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 were observed exclusively in VMN after SCI. Subsequently, a majority of VMN (75%) selectively underwent delayed apoptotic cell death. Transgenic animals showed less superoxide production, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation, resulting in death of only 45% of the VMN. These results suggest that the ROS-initiated mitochondrial signaling pathway possibly plays a pivotal role in apoptotic VMN death after SCI and that increased levels of SOD1 in VMN reduce oxidative stress, thereby attenuating the activation of the pathway and delayed cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2022103709,"The pikromycin biosynthetic gene cluster contains the pikAV gene encoding a type II thioesterase (TEII). TEII is not responsible for polyketide termination and cyclization, and its biosynthetic role has been unclear. During polyketide biosynthesis, extender units such as methylmalonyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) may prematurely decarboxylate to generate the corresponding acyl-ACP, which cannot be used as a substrate in the condensing reaction by the corresponding ketosynthase domain, rendering the polyketide synthase module inactive. It has been proposed that TEII may serve as an “editing” enzyme and reactivate these modules by removing acyl moieties attached to ACP domains. Using a purified recombinant TEII we have tested this hypothesis by using in vitro enzyme assays and a range of acyl-ACP, malonyl-ACP, and methylmalonyl-ACP substrates derived from either PikAIII or the loading didomain of DEBS1 (6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase; ATL-ACPL). The pikromycin TEII exhibited highKm values (>100 μm) with all substrates and no apparent ACP specificity, catalyzing cleavage of methylmalonyl-ACP from both ATL-ACPL(kcat/Km 3.3 ± 1.1m−1 s−1) and PikAIII (kcat/Km 2.9 ± 0.9m−1 s−1). The TEII exhibited some acyl-group specificity, catalyzing hydrolysis of propionyl (kcat/Km 15.8 ± 1.8m−1 s−1) and butyryl (kcat/Km 17.5 ± 2.1m−1 s−1) derivatives of ATL-ACPL faster than acetyl (kcat/Km 4.9 ± 0.7m−1 s−1), malonyl (kcat/Km 3.9 ± 0.5m−1 s−1), or methylmalonyl derivatives. PikAIV containing a TEI domain catalyzed cleavage of propionyl derivative of ATL-ACPL at a dramatically lower rate than TEII. These results provide the first unequivocal in vitro evidence that TEII can hydrolyze acyl-ACP thioesters and a model for the action of TEII in which the enzyme remains primarily dissociated from the polyketide synthase, preferentially removing aberrant acyl-ACP species with long half-lives. The lack of rigorous substrate specificity for TEII may explain the surprising observation that high level expression of the protein inStreptomyces venezuelae leads to significant (>50%) titer decreases.

Polyketides are a large and structurally diverse class of natural products that possess a wide range of biological activities (1Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2497Google Scholar). These compounds are used throughout medicinal and agricultural fields as antimicrobials, immunosuppressants, antiparasitics, and anticancer agents. Despite their structural diversity, polyketides are assembled by a common mechanism of decarboxylative condensations of simple malonate derivatives by polyketide synthases (PKSs) 1The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; PikPKS, pikromycin (Pik) polyketide synthase; DEBS, 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase; KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyltransferase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; TE, thioesterase; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. in a manner very similar to fatty acid biosynthesis (2Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Google Scholar, 3Katz L. Donadio S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 875-912Google Scholar). Type I PKSs are a family of PKSs that are analogous to vertebrate fatty acid synthase that catalyze the biosynthesis of the polyketide moieties of various secondary metabolites in Streptomyces (4Donadio S. Staver M.J. McAlpine J.B. Swanson S.J. Katz L. Science. 1991; 252: 675-679Google Scholar, 5Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7839-7843Google Scholar). They are gigantic multifunctional modular proteins. Each module is responsible for one cycle of polyketide chain elongation and contains a set of discrete catalytic domains of ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP). Ketoreductase, dehydratase (DH), and enoyl reductase domains may also be present, allowing structural variation in the level of processing of the β-ketoacyl chain (4Donadio S. Staver M.J. McAlpine J.B. Swanson S.J. Katz L. Science. 1991; 252: 675-679Google Scholar, 6Schwecke T. Aparico J.F. Molner I. Konig A. Khaw L.E. Haydock S.F. Oliynyk M. Caffrey P. Cortes J. Lester J.B. Bohm G.A. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7839-7843Google Scholar). The fully extended polyketide chain bound to the PKS as an acyl-ACP thioester is often released and cyclized by a thioesterase domain (TEI) covalently linked to the last extending module of the PKS (7Gokhale R.S. Hunziker D. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 117-125Google Scholar). In many cases, additional genes encoding a TE have been found within a polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster, for example, the tylosin PKS ofStreptomyces fradiae (8Merson-Davies L.A. Cundliffe E. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 349-355Google Scholar), pikromycin PKS ofStreptomyces venezuelae (5Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Google Scholar), rifamycin PKS ofAmycolatopsis mediterranei (9August P.R. Tang L. Yoon Y.J. Ning S. Muller R. Yu T.W. Taylor M. Hoffmann D. Kim C.G. Zhang X. Hutchinson C.R. Floss H.G. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 69-79Google Scholar), and the erythromycin PKS (DEBS) of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (10Haydock S.F. Dowson J.A. Dhillon N. Roberts G.A. Cortes J. Leadlay P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 120-128Google Scholar). These genes encoding a discrete protein were named as TEII to differentiate from the chain releasing TEI domains in modular polyketide synthases. Discrete TEII enzymes are also associated with bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthases, responsible for the production of macrocyclic peptide compounds (11Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 404-410Google Scholar), and animal fatty acid synthases (12Witkowski A. Naggert J. Wessa B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18514-18519Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that these thioesterases are probably structurally and evolutionarily related (13Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Google Scholar). They have a common serine esterase motif, GXSXG, ∼100 residues from the N terminus and another conserved downstream motif, GXH, of which histidine might accept a proton from the hydroxyl group of the active site serine, thereby increasing its nucleophile character (13Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Google Scholar). Because TEI domains have been shown to be a necessary and sufficient factor for the release and cyclization of the polyketide chain in vivo and in vitro (7Gokhale R.S. Hunziker D. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 117-125Google Scholar, 14Aggarwal R. Caffrey P. Leadlay P.F. Smith C.J. Staunton J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1995; 15: 1519-1520Google Scholar, 15Pieper R. Luo G. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Nature. 1995; 378: 263-266Google Scholar, 16Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Nature. 2000; 403: 571-575Google Scholar), the role of the TEII enzyme encoded within many PKS gene clusters has presented an intriguing question. By far most of the information about the role of TEII in polyketide biosynthesis comes from gene disruption and complementation studies. When the rifR gene (encoding a TEII) was deleted from the rifamycin PKS, production of the polyketide rifamycin B dropped to 30–60% of the normal yields in A. mediterranei (17Doi-Katayama Y. Yoon Y.J. Choi C.Y. Yu T.W. Floss H.G. Hutchinson C.R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2000; 53: 484-495Google Scholar). Disruption of the TEII-encoding gene (tylO) in the tylosin producer S. fradiae also resulted in 85% reduction of polyketide production (18Butler A.R. Bate N. Cundliffe E. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 287-292Google Scholar). Production in the disrupted strain was restored by complementation with the intact tylO gene. More interestingly, it was reported that heterologous TEIIs (nbmBfrom S. narbonensis and scoT fromStreptomyces coelicolor) could also successfully complement the inactivated TEII gene by restoring polyketide production (18Butler A.R. Bate N. Cundliffe E. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 287-292Google Scholar, 19Kotowska M. Pawlik K. Butler A.R. Cundliffe E. Takano E. Kuczek K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1777-1783Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations it has been reported that deletion of the TEII-encoding pikAV gene and srfA-TE gene does not lead to decreases in the production of the aglycones produced by the pikromycin PKS (20Chen S. Roberts J.B. Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. Gene. 2001; 262: 255-264Google Scholar) and surfactin by the non-ribosomal peptide synthases (21Cosmina P. Rodriguez F. Ferra F.d. Grandi G. Perego M. Venema G. Sinderen D.v. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 821-831Google Scholar), respectively. These observations have led to the suggestion that the TEII might play a beneficial but not essential role common to most if not all biosynthetic processes catalyzed by modular PKSs (19Kotowska M. Pawlik K. Butler A.R. Cundliffe E. Takano E. Kuczek K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1777-1783Google Scholar). One proposal has been an editing role in which TEII removes aberrant groups attached by thioester linkage ACP domains within the PKS extension modules, which might otherwise block the normal chain elongation process (18Butler A.R. Bate N. Cundliffe E. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 287-292Google Scholar). Recent studies on KS domains show they can catalyze a decarboxylation reaction of the ACP-bound dicarboxyl extender unit even when the KS active site cysteine is not primed with incoming acyl intermediates (Fig. 1) (22Long P.F. Wilkinson C.J. Bisang C.P. Cortes J. Dunster N. Oliynyk M. McCormick E. McArthur H. Mendez C. Salas J.A. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1215-1225Google Scholar, 23Bisang C. Long P.F. Cortes J. Westcott J. Crosby J. Matharu A.-L. Simpson T.J. Leadlay P.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 502-505Google Scholar). Polyketide chains grow by decarboxyl condensations between a β-ketoacyl chain bound to the KS domain and a carboxylated extender unit (malonyl-, methylmalonyl-, ethylmalonyl-ACP, etc.). If the extender unit is decarboxylated to a nonactivated acyl group (acetyl-, propionyl-, butyryl-ACP, etc.), the intermediate acyl chain cannot be processed to downstream domains through the normal condensation reaction. The polyketide biosynthetic process would thus be derailed, resulting in low yields of the fully extended polyketide product (24Heathcote M.L. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 2001; 8: 207-220Google Scholar). TEII-catalyzed cleavage of these ACP-bound acyl residues would allow the activated dicarboxylic acid extender units to be loaded onto the PKS, restoring polyketide production. Consistent with such a role is the observation that the homologous TEII and TEI from an animal fatty acid synthases have substrate specificity for medium length fatty acid chains (C8, C10, and C12) and longer chain fatty acids (C14, C16, and C18), respectively (25Naggert J. Witkowski A. Wessa B. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 787-790Google Scholar). Recent studies on TEII (tylO) of the TylPKS show that it could hydrolyze synthetic acyl (acetyl-, propionyl-, and butyryl-)-p-nitrophenyl esters andN-acetylcysteamine thioesters, providing additional preliminary support for the proposed editing role of TEII (24Heathcote M.L. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 2001; 8: 207-220Google Scholar). In this study, we have generated recombinant TEII (PikAV) from S. venezuelae and performed the first catalytic study of such an enzyme with physiologically relevant substrates, various acyl- and carboxylated acyl-ACP thioesters. The pikromycin TEII exhibits a very high Km for all ACP substrates and likely is predominantly dissociated from the PKS, minimizing its potential to block the normal biosynthetic process. TEII is active with a wide range of ACP-bound thioesters, consistent with an editing role for all of the modules within a PKS. However, this lack of rigorous substrate specificity allows the TEII to remove acyl-ACP thioesters in the PKS-loading module required to initiate the process or the activated carboxylated acyl-ACP thioesters in the extension modules. Thus, either an excess or lack of TEII may lead to decreases in polyketide production. In vivo experiments with overexpression of pikAV in pikromycin-producing cultures ofS. venezuelae are shown to be consistent with this observation. [1-14C]Acetyl-CoA (53 mCi/mmol, 50 μCi/ml), [1-14C]propionyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol, 50 μCi/ml), [1-14C] butyryl-CoA (53 mCi/mmol, 100 μCi/ml), and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol, 20 μCi/ml) were purchased from Movarek Biochemicals.dl-2-[214C]methylmalonyl-CoA (60 mCi/mmol, 10 μCi/ml) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest available grade. Standard molecular cloning techniques were employed (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were performed using standard PCR strategies with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene and Wiley, New York1991Google Scholar). TEII was obtained by expression of pikAV of S. venezuelae inEscherichia coli. The pikAV gene (GenBankTM accession number AF79138: 36989–37834) was amplified from a genomic library of S. venezuelae by PCR using the following primers designed with NdeI andHindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (5′-AAGCGGGCATATGACCGACAGACCTCTGAA-3′ and 5′-TCGTAAGCTTCCGTGGGTTCTGCCATCT-3′). The PCR product was ligated into the pET21c expression vector to give pBK18, which was maintained in E. coli TG2. E. coliBL21-CodonPlus-RP was used as a host for the expression of PikAV. Overexpression (2–4 mg/liter) was accomplished by induction using 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA600 = 0.5–0.6 and incubation of the culture at 28 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g and resuspended with buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol). After disruption of the cells using French press at 10,000 p.s.i., the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and washed with 10 mmimidazole in the same buffer. The pikromycin TEII was eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated with a CentriconTM(Amicon, Inc.) concentrator and subsequently diluted with buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. The concentrated protein was further purified using a HiTrap chelating high performance column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient elution from 5 to 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The purification was monitored spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 280 nm. The pooled peak fractions were concentrated, and buffer was subsequently changed to buffer B (100 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol). The concentration of the resulting pure TEII solution was determined using the dotMETRICTM assay kit from Bioworld. The last module of PikPKS, PikAIV, containing a TEI domain was expressed in E. coli. After several steps of PCR and subcloning, the pikAIV gene (GenBankTM accession number AF79138: 32952–36992) was cloned into pET24b as anNdeI and HindIII fragment to give pDHS4188, which expresses pikAIV as a C-terminal His-tagged fusion protein. The plasmid pDHS4188 was transferred into BL21(DE3) strain harboring the sfp gene (pRSG56) (28Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 923-936Google Scholar) and induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.6 absorbance. After overnight culture at 25 °C, the cells were harvested and disrupted using a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. The PikAIV-TEI was expressed at level of 8–12 mg/liter and purified as described above for TEII. The protein (2.5 mg/ml) was kept in 100 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.3), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol after dialysis in the same buffer. The activity of TEII and TEI was confirmed by hydrolysis assay using the p-nitrophenyl esters of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 100 μm EDTA as described previously (24Heathcote M.L. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 2001; 8: 207-220Google Scholar). The substrates were dissolved into assay buffer using dimethyl sulfoxide. To obtain the loading domain (ATL-ACPL) of DEBS1 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, the corresponding gene (GenBankTM accession number 63677) was cloned as anXbaI-HindIII fragment into pET21c (Novagen) overexpression vector to give pBK12. The PCR amplification was from a DEBS1 construct (pBK3) (29Kim B.S. Cropp T.A. Florova G. Lindsay Y. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10827-10833Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-GAATTCGAGCATATGGACGCGTGGCGGACC-3′ and 5′-TTCGTTAAGCTTGCGGGTTTCCCGTTG-3′. For expression of the holo-ATL-ACPL didomain, pBK12 was introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene) containing the plasmid pRSG56, which carries a kanamycin gene and thesfp gene. BL21-CodonPlus-RP/pBK12 was cultured in LB supplemented with 50 mg/ml kanamycin and 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the growth reached A600 = 0.5–0.6, expression of the didomain (16- 18 mg/liter) was induced by 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by 12 h of incubation at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g and resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The resuspended cells were lysed by a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The published purification procedure was then used to obtain 8.6 mg/ml concentration ofholo-ATL-ACPL (30Lau J. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10514-10520Google Scholar). The pikAIII gene (GenBankTM accession number AF79138: 28161–32849) was cloned into pET28b as anNdeI-HindIII fragment after multi-step PCR reactions and subcloning steps. The resulting construct (pDHS4405) was used to express PikAIII (8–12 mg/liter) as a fusion protein with an N-terminal His tag in E. coli. Expression and purification were analogous to that described for PikAIV. To generate a radiolabeled acyl-ATL-ACPL,holo-ATL-ACPL (50 μm) was incubated at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 180 μm [1-14C]propionyl-CoA, 100 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. After a 45-min incubation, the reaction mixture was concentrated, and the excess propionyl-CoA was removed by exchanging buffer using a CentriprepTMconcentrator (Amicon). The radiolabeled propionyl-ATL-ACPL (20 μm) was incubated with 5 μm TEII in 50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 6 h. A control incubation in the absence of TEII was carried out simultaneously. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 30 min in ice. The proteins were pelleted and rinsed with acetone. The pellet was redissolved into 20 μl of protein gel-loading buffer. The mixture was loaded onto a 1.5-mm 12% polyacrylamide gel and run at 70 V. When the marker dye reached the bottom of the gel, it was stained, destained, and dried on filter paper. The dried gel was subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) for 48 h. The enzyme activity of TEII was measured on several radiolabeled acyl-ACP substrates. Typical reactions to make radiolabeled acyl-ACPs contained 50 μm either ATL-ACPL or PikAIII in a mixture of 1:9 or 1:5 radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled acyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, or methylmalonyl-CoA (1 mm), 100 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. After a 1–3-h incubation, the reaction mixture was concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) using a CentriprepTM concentrator. A time course experiment was performed using a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 5.7 μm TEII or PikAIV (containing TEI), 100 μmpropionyl-ATL-ACPL, 50 mm phosphate (pH 8.0). For kinetic analyses, a range of concentrations (5–150 μm) of each acyl-ACP and carboxylated acyl-ACP substrate was incubated with 1.4 μm TEII or PikAIV-TEI in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, final volume 25 μl) at room temperature for 40 min (the reaction rate was linear over 40 min; see Fig. 4A). Triplicate analyses were carried out for each concentration. The reactions were quenched by 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Each pellet was rinsed with an excess of 10% trichloroacetic acid and dissolved into 200 μl of SDS solution (2% SDS, 20 mm NaOH). The protein suspension was mixed with 5 ml of liquid scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The loss of radioactivity compared with the control reaction without TEII/PikAIV-TEI was used to calculate the amount of hydrolyzed acyl chain from the ACP domain. The TEII gene (pikAV) was PCR-amplified as a XbaI and HindIII fragment and cloned into a high copy plasmid pSE34, a derivative of pWHM3 with theermE* promoter (31Vara J. Lewandowska-Skarbek M. Wang Y.-G. Donadio S. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5872-5881Google Scholar), to give pSC70. The pikAVgene was also cloned into a derivative of pDHS702 (16Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Nature. 2000; 403: 571-575Google Scholar) (a low copy number plasmid based on SCP2* origin of replication) for expression of TEII under the control of the pikAI promoter. Expression of the TEII from the resulting pSC38 plasmid resembles a natural expression pattern of pikA cluster in S. venezuelae. A site-directed mutation was introduced to pSC70 to produce an expression plasmid of inactive TEII protein (pBK56). Ser-99 was changed to Ala using QuikChangeTM XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers 5′-CGGGCACGCCCTCGGCGCTAGCGTCGCCTTCGAGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCGAAGGCGACGCTAGCGCCGAGGGCGTGCCCG-3′ (the alanine codon is underlined). The TEII expression plasmids are shuttle vectors having a ColE E. coli origin of replication. They were introduced to S. venezuelae SC1022 strain, which has an in-frame deletion of 687 bp of pikAV (32Chen S. Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 2000; 7: 907-918Google Scholar). Each of the transformants was cultured in 50 ml of SCM medium (20Chen S. Roberts J.B. Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. Gene. 2001; 262: 255-264Google Scholar) supplemented with thiostrepton and kanamycin at 25 μg/ml in a 250 ml flask. After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C, the culture broth was clarified by centrifugation at 4000 × g, and the supernatant was extracted with chloroform twice. The aglycone production was quantified by HPLC using a C18 column with monitoring at 230 nm as described previously (20Chen S. Roberts J.B. Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. Gene. 2001; 262: 255-264Google Scholar). The TEII protein encoded by pikAIV was expressed from plasmid pBK18 in E. coli as a fusion protein tagged with a C-terminal hexahistidine and purified to homogeneity using Ni2+ affinity column chromatography (Fig. 2). The recombinant protein was stable in 50 mm phosphate buffer with 1 mm EDTA during the purification procedures. Overnight dialysis or high salt concentration buffer, however, resulted in partial precipitation of the TEII. The esterase activity of the TEII was confirmed by hydrolysis assay using p-nitrophenyl ester derivatives (data not shown), which are well known substrates for serine proteases and have been used for thioesterase studies in the animal fatty acid synthase (33Witkowski A. Witkowska H.E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Google Scholar) and the TEII associated with the tylosin PKS (24Heathcote M.L. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 2001; 8: 207-220Google Scholar). The TEII showed significant hydrolytic rates with acetyl, propionyl, and butyryl esters. However, the substrate specificity of TEII with these model systems could not readily be addressed due to high background hydrolysis rates and limited solubility of the substrates under the assay conditions. Similar observations have been made with these substrates using the TEII (TylO) encoded within the tylosin biosynthetic gene cluster (24Heathcote M.L. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 2001; 8: 207-220Google Scholar). To further probe the role of TEII in polyketide biosynthesis, we examined catalytic activity with a more physiologically relevant substrate, a PKS ACP thioester of monocarboxylic acid, as might be generated by aberrant decarboxylation of malonate or malonate derivatives bound to ACP domain. We selected the loading domain of DEBS (ATL-ACPL) because this is known to have relaxed substrate specificity accepting acetyl-, propionyl-, butyryl-, malonyl-, and methylmalonyl-CoA (30Lau J. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10514-10520Google Scholar), allowing a clear comparison of TEII hydrolysis of thioesters of these groups on the same ACP. The gene encoding the ATL-ACPL didomain region of DEBS1 was PCR amplified as an NdeI andHindIII fragment and cloned into an expression vector pET21c to give pBK12. The didomain fragment includes the N-terminal 107 extra amino acids that have been shown recently to be essential for activity of this didomain (30Lau J. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10514-10520Google Scholar). The gene encoding the Sfp (a phosphopantetheine transferase from Bacillus subtilis) was co-expressed to ensure posttranslational modification of the apo-ATL-ACPL to the holo form (28Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 923-936Google Scholar). The holo-ATL-ACPL was expressed as a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein and purified by nickel affinity chromatography to 99% purity. The ATL-ACPL was incubated with [1-14C]propionyl-CoA, leading to rapid acylation. Other acyl-ATL-ACPL derivatives were also generated in the same reaction mixture using different radiolabeled CoA derivatives (acetyl-, butyryl-, malonyl-, and methylmalonyl-CoA). Prolonged incubations (up to 3 h) ensured that greater than 95% of the protein was converted to the thioester, even with substrates such as malonyl-CoA. The radiolabeled propionyl-ATL-ACPL was incubated at room temperature with or without TEII for 6 h. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The reaction without TEII showed a clear radioactive protein band at the position of ATL-ACPLprotein, whereas the corresponding band was barely detected in the reaction containing TEII protein (Fig. 3), indicating hydrolysis of the radioactive propionyl residue from the protein. A kinetic analysis of this phenomenon using liquid scintillation counting showed that the loss of radioactivity of propionyl-ATL-ACPL was proportionally correlated with the TEII concentration, indicating the deacylation is the result of enzyme reaction by TEII. These results provide the first clear evidence of thioesterase activity of TEII on the acyl thioester of a PKS ACP domain, as might be generated by aberrant decarboxylation of extending units during polyketide biosynthesis. A comparison of the thioesterase activity of PikAV TEII was made with that of TEI at the C terminus of PikAIV. The pikromycin PikAIV"

Here we show that PCNA directly interacts with the newly discovered pol λ cloned from human cells. This interaction stabilizes the binding of pol λ to the primer template, thus increasing its affinity for the hydroxyl primer and its processivity in DNA synthesis. However, no effect of PCNA was detected on the rate of nucleotide incorporation or discrimination efficiency by pol λ. PCNA was found to stimulate efficient synthesis by pol λ across an abasic (AP) site. When compared with pol δ, human pol λ showed the ability to incorporate a nucleotide in front of the lesion. Addition of PCNA led to efficient elongation past the AP site by pol λ but not by pol δ. However, when tested on a template containing a bulky DNA lesion, such as the major cisplatin Pt-d(GpG) adduct, PCNA could not allow translesion synthesis by pol λ. Our results suggest that the complex between PCNA and pol λ may play an important role in the bypass of abasic sites in human cells."

This positron emission tomography (PET) experiment measured changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in normal human participants during the presentation of abstract visual information in four conditions that varied in their encoding demands. As encoding increased across the different conditions, there was an increase in activity in the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal region. No significant activation peaks were present in any other region of the frontal or temporal lobe. These findings indicate that the orbitofrontal cortex, which is massively connected to the medial temporal cortex, is a critical frontal region for memory formation."

Rolling adhesion greatly increases the time a cell spends in a post-capillary venule and enables surveillance of endothelium for activating signals such as chemoattractants. Firm adhesion results in the arrest of the leukocyte in the postcapillary venule, and sets the stage for diapedesis. The integrin αLβ2 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)1) mediates adhesion and migration of leukocytes in immune and inflammatory processes by binding to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), which are members of the Ig superfamily (1Springer T.A.

The β2 integrins are far more facile in mediating firm adhesion than rolling adhesion. In many in vitro andin vivo systems in which β2 integrins mediate firm adhesion and selectins mediate rolling adhesion, β2integrins are not seen to mediate tethering in shear flow or rolling (2Lawrence M.B.

Recently, β2 integrins have also been found to be capable of contributing to rolling in vivo and in special cases to support on their own rolling in vitro. When multiple adhesion pathways are blocked in vivo, i.e.selectins together with β2 integrins or ICAM-1, or LFA-1 together with α4 integrins, β2 integrins and in particular αLβ2 can be seen to contribute to accumulation of rolling cells, the stability of rolling, and the velocity of rolling cells (8Henderson R.B.

It was suggested that the I domain represents a transient ligand-binding domain and that cooperation with other ligand-binding domains was required for firm adhesion. However, recent studies have shown that the isolated I domain, when stabilized in a conformation that has high affinity for ligand, is sufficient for the same amount of adhesiveness in static binding assays as maximally activated αLβ2(13Lu C.

In integrins that contain I domains, conformational changes within the I domain regulate ligand binding (17Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A downward movement of the C-terminal α-helix of the I domain is linked to structural rearrangements in the metal ion adhesion site and surrounding loops that constitute the ligand-binding site of the I domain, as shown by crystallographic studies of αM and α2 (18Emsley J.

Movements in the same regions of the αL I domain occur in the presence of an ICAM-1 fragment as shown by NMR chemical shift experiments (20Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A.

Two conformations of the I domain termed open and closed have been shown to have high and low affinity for ligand, respectively. An engineered disulfide bond in the αL I domain that locks the loop between the C-terminal β-strand and α-helix into the open conformation has been shown to activate cell adhesiveness in static binding assays and to increase the affinity of the locked open I domain in soluble ligand-binding assays 9,000-fold relative to the wild type I domain (13Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Shimaoka M., Lu, C.

Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The increase in affinity was the result of a 50-fold increase in on-rate to 140,000m−1s−1 and a 200-fold decrease in off-rate from 5 s−1 to 0.025 s−1. A mutant I domain that was analogously locked in the closed conformation was similar in affinity to the wild type I domain, and all evidence suggests that the closed conformation is lower energy than the open conformation and is the predominant conformation assumed by isolated I domains. Small molecule antagonists directed to the I domain of αLβ2 have been developed. Crystal and NMR structures show that they bind to the closed conformation of the I domain, between the C-terminal α-helix and the body of the domain, distal from the ligand-binding site on the “top” of the I domain (21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Giblin P.A. Kelly T.A. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 2001; 36: 181-190Crossref Google Scholar). These antagonists are allosteric modulators that stabilize the closed conformation of the I domain, as confirmed by failure to antagonize I domains locked in the open conformation with disulfide bonds (15Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The effect of conformational alterations in integrins on rolling interactions has not been studied, although it is known in general that activation can convert rolling to firm adhesion for both α4 and β2 integrins. It has long been hypothesized that rapid kinetics for bond association and dissociation are important in rolling (23Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and that slower bond dissociation would favor firm adhesion. Although there exists now an extensive body of literature on the kinetics of bond dissociation for receptors that mediate rolling (24van der Merwe P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R419-R422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), there is no data on how conformational change, with accompanying alterations in bond association and dissociation kinetics, would affect adhesive behavior in shear flow. Recent crystal structure, NMR, and electron microscopic studies have revealed that integrins, including αLβ2, assume a highly bent conformation in the resting state, and that activation results in a dramatic switchblade-like opening (25Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 26Beglova N. Blacklow S.C.

Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In the bent conformation the headpiece is close to the membrane, whereas in the active, extended conformation it moves ∼15 nm upwards and into an orientation much more favorable for ligand binding. Furthermore, these conformations are in rapid equilibrium, and activation should be viewed as a shift in the equilibrium rather than fixing a particular conformation. The I domain, although not directly visualized in these studies, is connected to the headpiece and would become dramatically more accessible to ligand in the extended conformation. To examine the effect of only conformational change within the I domain, which is likely to be linked to global conformational change in native integrin heterodimers, we study I domains expressed in isolation from other integrin domains on the cell surface. We demonstrate that αL integrin I domain conformation, as influenced by disulfide bonds that lock in specific conformations, or binding of a small molecule antagonist that stabilizes the closed conformation, regulates rolling interactions in shear flow. Furthermore, we compare for the first time the efficacy of cell surface αLβ2 heterodimers and isolated αL I domains in rolling assays, and describe some surprising differences. K562 cells stably transfected with αLβ2 containing wild type, locked open (K287C/K294C), or locked closed (L289C/K294C) I domains, or these I domains expressed in the absence of other integrin domains using a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) transmembrane domain and the first five amino acid residues of the PDGFR cytoplasmic domain were described previously (13Lu C.

All mutant constructs were verified here to be expressed at similar levels on the cell surface as previously shown (13Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mouse anti-human αL monoclonal antibodies TS2/6 (28Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and MHM24 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) were used to block LFA-1-mediated interactions. A non-binding mouse IgG1 (X63) as control and two different anti-human αL I domain monoclonal antibodies, TS1/11 and TS1/12, were used to determine surface expression of the transfectants by immunofluorescence flow cytometry (29Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion of K562 cell transfectants to ICAM-1 purified from human tonsil (30Lawrence M.B. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Springer T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and coated at 6 μg/ml on 96-well plates was assayed as described (29Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester, and resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing either 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mmMg2+, or 2 mm Mg2+ + 1 mm EGTA. Cells were added to the ICAM-1-coated wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation wells were washed and the fluorescence read. Three different forms of ICAM-1 were immobilized on substrates. Human tonsil ICAM-1 was directly coated on polystyrene Petri dishes for 1 h at 37 °C in coating buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 20 mm bicarbonate, pH 9.0). Substrates were washed and blocked with 2% human serum albumin in coating buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Soluble IC1–5/IgA chimera containing the five Ig domains of human ICAM-1 fused to the Fc portion of IgA (ICAM-1-Fcα) was described previously (31Martin S. Casasnovas J.M. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICAM-1-Fcα (10 μg/ml in coating buffer) was spotted on a dish previously coated with 20 μg/ml goat anti-human IgA in coating buffer (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and blocked with 2% human serum albumin in coating buffer. ICAM-1-Fcγ (10 μg/ml in coating buffer unless noted otherwise) was spotted on a dish previously coated with protein A (20 μg/ml) in coating buffer for 1 h at 37 °C and blocked with 2% human serum albumin in coating buffer (32Fuhlbrigge R.C. Alon R. Puri K.D. Lowe J.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HUVECs (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in medium 199 modified Earle's salt solution containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml endothelial growth supplement (Sigma), 1% Nutridoma-NS (Roche), and 100 μg/ml heparin at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were grown on polystyrene cell culture dishes pre-coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin and used for no more than five passages. For flow experiments, HUVECs were seeded onto fibronectin-coated wells of six-well cell culture dishes at 90% confluency and cultured for 3–4 days prior to use. Cells either received no treatment or were activated with TNF-α (100 ng/ml) for 5 or 24 h prior to each experiment. ICAM-1 surface expression was determined by flow cytometry using IC1/12, a mouse anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (33Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Diamond M.S. Nusrat A. Liang T.W. Springer T.A. Madara J.L. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 489-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) directly conjugated with Alexa488, and CBRM1/23-Alexa488, an anti-human αM monoclonal antibody (34Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) as a negative control. ICAM-1 substrates or HUVEC monolayers were assembled as the lower wall in a parallel wall flow chamber and mounted on an inverted phase-contrast microscope (2Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with Ca2+ and Mg2+-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and resuspended at 5 × 106/ml in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (buffer A) and kept at room temperature (22 °C) throughout the experiment. Cells were diluted to 5 × 105/ml in buffer A containing 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ or 2 mm Mg2+ + 1 mm EGTA immediately before infusion in the flow chamber using an automated syringe pump. Images were captured using a CCD camera mounted on an inverted microscope with a 10× objective and recorded on Hi-8 videotape. Cells were allowed to accumulate at 0.3 dynes/cm2 for 30 s. Shear stress was increased every 10 s up to 36 dynes/cm2. Rolling velocity at each shear stress was calculated from the average distance traveled by rolling cells in 3 s. The number of cells interacting for more than 3 s with the coated surface was measured at each shear stress. To avoid confusing rolling with small amounts of movement due to tether stretching or measurement error, a velocity of 1.5 μm/s, which corresponds to a movement of 1/2 cell diameter during the 3 s measurement interval, was the minimum velocity required to define a cell as rolling instead of firmly adherent. To evaluate the strength of the αLβ2 and I domain interactions with ICAM-1, cells were infused into the flow chamber and allowed to settle onto the substrate in stasis for 2 or 5 min as indicated. Flow was initiated at a shear stress of 0.3 dyn/cm2 and increased every 10 s. The number of cells that remained attached at the end of each shear interval was counted. The statin-like LFA-1 antagonist LFA703 (35Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Cottens S. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). LFA703 (100 mm in Me2SO) was diluted in assay buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution/Hepes/bovine serum albumin). Cells were preincubated with LFA703 (0–100 μm) at room temperature for 15–30 min prior to infusion in the flow chamber. The 0 μm LFA703 or Me2SO control used the same concentration of Me2SO (0.1%) as in the highest LFA703 concentration. Wild type and high affinity αLβ2 and I domain expressing K562 cells were incubated with 1 μm latrunculin A (Calbiochem) or Me2SO for 20 min at RT. (22 °C). Cells were resuspended in Buffer A containing 2 mmMg2+. Cells were infused at 107/ml and accumulated as described above. Shear stress was increased every 10 s, and the number of cells adherent at the end of each 10 s interval was counted. Binding of transfected cells expressing wild type αLβ2 heterodimer or the wild type or locked closed isolated αL I domain to substrates coated with native ICAM-1 purified from tonsils is barely detectable if at all in conventional static adhesion assays in Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 1 A) (13Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, locking the I domain in the open conformation by mutational introduction of a disulfide bond, or activation of wild type αLβ2 heterodimers with Mg2+/EGTA results in marked binding to ICAM-1 (Fig. 1 A) (13Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Contrasting results in Ca2+ and Mg2+ were obtained when cells were allowed to settle in stasis for 5 min on native ICAM-1 substrates and then subjected to controlled shear flow forces. Laminar flow was initiated at a wall shear stress of 0.3 dyn/cm2 and then incremented every 10 s. The number of cells that were initially in the field of view at stasis was determined, and then the percentage remaining at the end of each 10 s step was determined (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with the data in the static adhesion assays in Ca2+ and Mg2+, K562 transfectants expressing locked open αLβ2 heterodimers and the locked open αL I domain were able to bind to ICAM-1. In both cases the cells were firmly adherent; the average velocity of all adherent cells was close to 0 μm/s (Fig. 1 C), and detachment from the substrate was not preceded by rolling. In further agreement with the results of the static assays, transfectants with closed I domains or closed heterodimers were not adherent, and transfectants with wild type αLβ2heterodimers were also not adherent. However, in marked contrast to the results of the static assays, transfectants expressing the wild type isolated I domain were adherent in the shear flow assay (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, this was accompanied by a contrasting adhesive behavior: the cells rolled (12Knorr R. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Excluding the highest shear stress, at which few cells remained, the cells rolled at a velocity of 15 to 30 μm/s, corresponding to several cell diameters per second. Although we found that native ICAM-1 adsorbed to a substrate did not support adhesion by wild type αLβ2 transfectants, these transfectants have been reported to support rolling adhesion on ICAM-1-Fcγ chimeras bound to protein A substrates. Therefore, we compared different types of ICAM-1 substrates for support of adhesion in shear flow in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mmMg2+. The initial cell binding to the substrate occurred in shear flow at 0.3 dyn/cm2 rather than in stasis. ICAM-1 directly adsorbed to substrates or ICAM-1 fused to the Fc portion of IgA (ICAM-1-Fcα) and immobilized by binding to anti-IgA on a substrate supported adhesion in shear flow and rolling of cells expressing the αL I domain, but not adhesion in shear flow and rolling of cells expressing αLβ2(data not shown). However, ICAM-1 fused to the Fc portion of IgG (ICAM-1-Fcγ) and immobilized by binding to protein A on a substrate supported rolling of both I domain and αLβ2transfectants (16Sigal A. Bleijs D.A. Grabovsky V. van Vliet S.J. Dwir O. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Alon R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Rolling through αLβ2 was faster in velocity and less shear-resistant than rolling through the αL I domain (Fig. 2). The ability of unactivated αLβ2to support rolling was not nearly as robust as the ability of activated αLβ2 to support firm adhesion but was consistent with its ability to contribute, in combination with other adhesion pathways, to tethering and rolling in vivo and on cellular substrates in vitro (see Introduction). The great sensitivity of native wild type αLβ2 but not the isolated αL I domain to the mode of ICAM-1 presentation on the substrate is consistent with adoption of the bent conformation by resting αLβ2, in which the I domain would have limited accessibility to ligand (26Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To compare interactions mediated by the isolated I domain and αLβ2 using a more physiologically relevant presentation and density of ICAM-1, we used a monolayer of HUVECs either in basal conditions or after stimulation with TNF-α for 5 or 24 h. In basal conditions, HUVECs express low amounts of ICAM-1 on their surface (6.6 M.F.I. measured with IC1/12 monoclonal antibody directly conjugated with Alexa488) and support no interaction in shear flow with K562 cells expressing the isolated I domain or αLβ2 (not shown). After incubation with 100 ng/ml TNF-α, ICAM-1 expression increased in a time-dependent manner (57.3 mean fluorescence intensity at 5 h and 238.9 M.F.I. at 24 h) as previously shown (36Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The isolated I domain expressed on K562 cells efficiently interacted with TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells (Fig. 2). The number and velocity of cells rolling on HUVEC stimulated 5 h with TNF-α was comparable with the number and velocity of rolling cells observed in 10 μg/ml ICAM-1-Fcγ/protein A-coated substrates (Fig. 2). Compared with cells expressing the isolated I domain, K562 cells expressing αLβ2 bound less efficiently to stimulated HUVEC monolayers. The number of adherent αLβ2-K562 cells on HUVEC and ICAM-1-Fcγ/protein A-coated substrates was comparable (Fig. 2 A). Most cells adhered to the substrate during flow at 0.3 dyn/cm2 because there was little additional adhesion after the flow rate was increased (Fig. 2 A). The K562 cells expressing αLβ2 rolled when flow was incremented to 0.4 dyn/cm2 but then quickly became firmly adherent (Fig. 2 B). This reflects a difference in behavior on HUVEC compared with purified substrates that may reflect the ability of TNF-stimulated HUVEC to activate adhesion of αLβ2 on K562 transfectants. However, the main point for this study is that adhesion and rolling of I domain transfectants is very similar on ICAM-1-Fcγ/protein A and TNF-stimulated HUVEC substrates. Controls in all experiments showed that rolling and firm adhesion were dependent on the I domain, as demonstrated by complete abrogation by two different antibodies to the I domain, TS2/6 and MHM24 (data not shown). Furthermore, both rolling and firm adhesion were comp"

Here, we have investigated T1/ST2 signal transduction, using either transient overexpression of T1/ST2 or a cross-linking monoclonal antibody to activate cells.

However, a chimera comprising the extracellular domain of the type 1 IL-1 receptor and the intracellular domain of T1/ST2 activates NF-κB both by overexpression and in response to IL-1. This artificial activation requires the IL1RAcP recruited via the extracellular portion (IL1R1) of the chimera.

In addition to being a stable cell marker on Th2 cells, T1/ST2 has been shown to be important in Th2 effector function since treatment of mice with a monoclonal antibody against T1/ST2 inhibited allergic airway inflammation in response to both allergen provocation and viral antigen (9Coyle A.J.

Takagi T. Tsukamoto T. Tetsuka T. Tominaga S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The superfamily can be broadly divided into two subfamilies. All have a homologous Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain in their cytosolic portions, responsible for signal transduction. The two subfamilies differ extracellularly, with the IL1R subgroup having immunoglobulin domains and the Toll-like receptor subgroup having leucine-rich repeats. T1/ST2 belongs to the IL1R subgroup (14O'Neill L.A. Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 206-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The gene for T1/ST2 is tightly linked to the genes encoding other receptors in the IL1R subgroup on both mouse (3Yanagisawa K. Takagi T. Tsukamoto T. Tetsuka T. Tominaga S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and human chromosomes (15Sims J.E. Painter S.L. Gow I.R. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, T1/ST2 does not bind IL-1α, IL-1β or the IL-1 receptor antagonist (16Yanagisawa K. Naito Y. Kuroiwa K. Arai T. Furukawa Y. Tomizuka H. Miura Y. Kasahara T. Tetsuka T. Tominaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As yet there is no functional ligand identified for T1/ST2, although two binding proteins have been identified (17Kumar S. Minnich M.D. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,18Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Bonnert T.P. Renshaw B.R. Sonoda G. Taguchi T.

The signaling pathway for the IL-1 receptor has now been well characterized, and several other members of the family such as the IL18R and TLR2, -4, -5, and -9 share many of the intracellular signaling components with IL1RI (19Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3909) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding both IL1R1 and IL18R require recruitment of their respective accessory proteins to signal (20Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Born T.L. Thomassen E. Bird T.A. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29445-29450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein MyD88, which also possesses a TIR domain, is then recruited to the active complex and interacts with the receptors through homotypic TIR domain interactions. The IL1R-associated kinases IRAK, IRAK2 and the recently identified IRAK4 (22Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H.

IRAK and IRAK2 have been shown to interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6) (24Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). TRAF-6, in a presassembled complex with TAK-1 binding protein (TAB)-2, can then cause activation of the transcription factor NF-κB through the kinase TAK-1 and the IκB kinase complex (25Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). In addition it has been shown that these receptors can cause activation of p42/p44 and p38 MAP kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of these kinases also occurs through MyD88 and IRAK, and recently a role for the low molecular weight G protein Ras in p38 activation has been demonstrated (26Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Little is known about how T1/ST2 signals. It was demonstrated that treatment of cells expressing a chimeric receptor comprising the extracellular domain of IL1R1 and the intracellular domain of T1/ST2 with IL-1 activated NF-κB (27Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and p38 MAP kinase (17Kumar S. Minnich M.D. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), implying that T1/ST2 might signal in a similar way to IL1R1. The ability of the T1/ST2 chimera to activate NF-κB is somewhat inconsistent with data indicating that NF-κB activation is more associated with Th1 type responses. Furthermore, the putative unpurified ligand for T1/ST2 described by Kumar et al. (17Kumar S. Minnich M.D. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was unable to activate NF-κB but was shown to activate p38 MAP kinase. Here we have examined T1/ST2 signal transduction in detail, using either overexpression of T1/ST2 or an anti-T1/ST2 cross-linking antibody. We have found that T1/ST2 can activate JNK, p38, p42/p44 MAP kinase, and the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Interestingly we can find no evidence for NF-κB activation and demonstrate that the effect of the IL1R1-T1/ST2 chimera on NF-κB occurs via the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAcP). Finally, we have found that anti-T1/ST2 induces IL-4 production from naı̈ve T cells, and importantly that the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocks this effect. Our study is therefore the first to characterize T1/ST2 signaling and demonstrates that T1/ST2 is a TIR domain-containing receptor, which cannot activate NF-κB when homodimerized, consistent with its role in promoting Th2 responses.

The anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma. The IκB antibody was a kind gift from Prof. R. Hay (University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, UK). The JNK inhibitor SP600125 was purchased from Calbiochem (CN Biosciences, Notts, UK). The cloning of T1/ST2 into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 has already been described (9Coyle A.J. Lloyd C.

Using this as template, T1/ST2 was subcloned into pCMV-Flag (IBI Kodak, New Haven, CT) using oligonucleotide primers of sequence 5′-GTCAGATCTCAGTAAATCGTCCT-3, 5′CTGGTCGACTCAAAAGTGTTTCAG-3′. The components for the PathDetectTM CHOP, Elk-1, and c-Juntrans-reporting system (pFA-CHOP, pFA-Elk-1, pFA-c-Jun, pFc2-dbd, pFR-Luc, pFc-MEK3, pFC-MEKK, and pFC-MEK1) were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

The chimeric IL1R-T1/ST2 construct was a kind gift from Prof. J. Sims (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). HEK293 and EL4 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium while the P815 and EL4 D6/76 cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. All medium contained 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For use in transfection assays, HEK293 were typically seeded at 2 × 104ml–1 in 96-well plates 24 h prior to transfection, whereas EL4 and EL4 D6/76 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 ml–1 16 h prior to being used. P815 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 106ml–1 for cross-linking and immunoblot analysis. EL4 and EL4D6/76 cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in the figure legends in a final volume of 0.6 ml using DEAE-dextran. Following 16–18 h of recovery, cells were seeded at a density of 106 ml–1 viable cells (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) prior to stimulation. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid concentrations as indicated in the figure legends with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection efficiency was normalized in all experiments by transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding 40 ng ofRenilla luciferase. In all cases the amount of DNA transfected was kept constant by the addition of various amounts of the appropriate empty vector plasmid. Cells were either left untreated or stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 6 h as indicated following a period of recovery (16–18 h). To assay firefly and Renillaluciferase activity, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega, Southhampton, UK), and luciferase activity was determined by standard protocols. For surface staining, an anti-T1/ST2 rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody 3E10 was used. For P815 cells biotinylated 3E10 was detected with streptavidin-PE (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Staining of 3E10 was blocked by preincubating the cells with a 100-fold excess of unconjugated 3E10. Gates were set on viable cells according to forward and side scatter and exclusion of propidium iodide (0.3 μg/ml) Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). 6-well plates were coated with 20 μg/ml of either mAb 3E10 (rat anti-mouse T1/ST2) or rat IgG (PharMingen) for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and 2 ml of P815 cells were added at a density of 2 × 106 ml−1 for 3 h at 37 °C. Control cells were stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were harvested samples prepared for either immunoblot analysis or electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For cross-linking studies on naive spleen cells 24-well plates were coated with 3E10 or control IgG under the same conditions prior to the addition of cells at a density of 1 × 106ml−1. Treatment of cells was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Total cell lysate from each sample was extracted in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, RIPA: (phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 10 μl/ml sodium orthovanadate). Protein estimations of cell extracts were determined by the dye binding assay of Bradford. Equal amounts of protein (4–8 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting according to the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The antibodies recognizing FLAG, phosphorylated p42/p44, JNK, c-Jun, and ATF-2 were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in 1% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween. The IκB antibody was used at a dilution of 1:50 in 5% fat-free milk. HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p38 and other plasmids as described in the figure legend and allowed to recover for 16 h. Prior to harvesting cells were treated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were lysed with 500 μl of 1× lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and FLAG-p38 was immunoprecipitated with 2–5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak). Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and then with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). Pellets were resuspended with 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for phosphorylated ATF-2 or FLAG-p38. Nuclear extracts were prepared from P815 cells following cross-linking as described previously (29Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). P815 cells were collected by centrifugation before preparation of nuclear extracts as above. Nuclear extracts were assessed for NF-κB binding activity as described previously (30Mansell A. Khelef N. Cossart P. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43597-43603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Intracellular detection of IL-4 and IFN-γ in CD4+ T cells was performed essentially as described (31Fallon P.G. Smith P. Dunne D.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1408-1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All intracellular antibodies and reagents were from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). Cells from the spleens of naı̈ve Balb/c mice were either left in medium for 1 h or were pretreated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 for 1 h. Cells were then added to plates precoated with 20 μg/ml 3E10 mAb or isotype-matched control rat IgG for 5 h. After 1 h of incubation 10 μg/ml of Brefeldin A (Sigma) was added. Cells were washed and surface-stained with Tricolor-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb. Cells were permeabilized and intracellular cytokines detected with PE-conjugated anti-IL-4 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IFN-γ. Lymphocytes were gated on CD4-positive cells, and quadrants set using PE- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated isotype control mAbs. The frequencies of IL-4- or IFN-γ-positive cells were determined, and data are presented as the mean percentages of IL-4- or IFN-γ-stained CD4+ cells. We first investigated the effect of T1/ST2 on the transcription factor NF-κB. As shown in Fig.1 A we were unable to observe any activation of an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct upon overexpression of T1/ST2 in EL4 cells over a range of plasmid concentrations. This lack of effect was not due to an inability of these cells to respond to activators of NF-κB since overexpression of the IL1R1 (Fig. 1 A, left panel) and treatment with IL-1 (Fig. 1 A, right panel) both activated NF-κB. To ensure that this lack of effect was not cell-specific, several other cell lines were tested including HEK293 cells and HeLa cells. Similarly, no activation of NF-κB by T1/ST2 was observed in any of the cell lines tested (not shown). To confirm this result we employed a different approach involving an anti T1/ST2 cross-linking monoclonal antibody on P815 cells. These cells express T1/ST2 as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 1 B), and this antibody has been shown to induce IL-4 and IL-5 production (32Meisel C. Bonhagen K. Lohning M. Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Radbruch A. Kamradt T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3143-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Following cross-linking, no effect on NF-κB was observed above an isotope-matched control IgG when measured using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, nor was any degradation of IκB observed (Fig. 1 C). Incubation time of the cells with anti-T1/ST2 mAb was 3 h (Fig. 1 C,lane 3). Earlier incubation times of the cells with antibody showed no responses (not shown). Treatment of the cells with IL-1 for 15 min activated NF-κB and caused IκB degradation (Fig.1 C, lane 2). We next investigated the ability of T1/ST2 to activate another transcription factor, AP-1. It has been reported that IL-1, IL-18, and several of the known TLR ligands can also activate AP-1 through their respective receptors (33Jones B.W. Means T.K. Heldwein K.A. Keen M.A. Hill P.J. Belisle J.T. Fenton M.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 1036-1044PubMed Google Scholar). T1/ST2 was able to induce an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct in EL4 cells up to 4-fold above control levels (Fig.1 D). Treatment of the cells with IL-1 also activated AP-1. In addition cross-linking of P815 cells with anti-T1/ST2 antibody caused phosphorylation of c-Jun at contact times of 1 and 3 h (Fig. 1 E, lanes 2 and 4). These results implied that T1/ST2 is able to activate AP-1 but not NF-κB. It has previously been reported that a chimera consisting of the extracellular portion of the IL1R1 and the intracellular portion of T1/ST2 could activate both NF-κB (27Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and p38 MAP kinase (17Kumar S. Minnich M.D. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in COS7 and Jurkat cells both by overexpression and in response to IL-1 treatment. As this was in contrast to our results observed with overexpression of full-length T1/ST2, we investigated the effect of the chimera in our system. In Fig.2 A it can be seen that overexpression of a chimera, comprising the IL1R1 extracellular and transmembrane regions and the cytosolic domain from T1/ST2 (IL1Rextm-T1/ST2cyto), was capable of activating NF-κB in EL4 cells. This effect was seen by overexpression of the plasmid (Fig. 2 A) and was promoted following IL-1 treatment (not shown). The effect of the chimera on NF-κB activation was inhibited by overexpression of the isolated TIR domain of MyD88, which acts as a dominant negative form of MyD88 (Fig.2 B) (24Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). It was possible that the IL1R-T1/ST2 chimera was acting via the IL1RAcP. We investigated this possibility by transfecting this chimera into the IL1RAcP-deficient cell line EL4 D6/76. It is known that this cell line is unresponsive to IL-1 due to the absence of IL1RAcP. As shown in Fig. 2 C, we confirmed this and then demonstrated that the responsiveness of EL4 D6/76 cells to IL-1 can be restored upon co-transfection of IL1RAcP (20Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We observed that overexpression of the chimera IL1Rextm-T1/ST2cyto was unable to activate NF-κB in these cells (Fig. 2 D) implying a requirement for IL1RAcP. This was further suggested when IL1RAcP was transfected into the cells since the chimera potentiated the response to IL1RAcP alone by up to 2-fold at an IL1RAcP plasmid concentration of 5 μg/ml (Fig. 2 D). Conversely, Fig. 2 E shows that co-transfection of T1/ST2 and IL1RAcP had no effect on the level of activation of NF-κB by IL1RAcP (right side). T1/ST2 alone also has no effect on these cells (left side). Taken together, these results imply that the IL1R1-T1/ST2 chimera activates NF-κB because it recruits IL1RAcP, which cannot be recruited by full-length T1/ST2. As we had observed the ability of T1/ST2 to activate AP-1 we next investigated further upstream signals involved in this activation. JNK is a well characterized upstream activator of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. To investigate this, a reporter assay using atrans-reporter system of a c-Jun-GAL4 construct and Gal-luciferase, which serves as a readout for JNK activation, was used. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that in a similar fashion to the combined effect of IL1R1/IL1RAcP, overexpression of T1/ST2 can activate JNK in both HEK293 (left panel) and EL4 cells (right panel). This effect was inhibited when cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding JNK inhibitory protein-1 (JIP-1), implying that the effect of T1/ST2 is specific for JNK (Fig. 3 B). This effect was unlikely to be due to nonspecific activation of JNK by an overexpressed protein since other overexpressed proteins such as IKK-2 and truncated forms of MyD88 had no effect (not shown). In addition, cross-linking of P815 cells also caused phosphorylation of JNK with activation occurring at 3 h (Fig.3 C, lane 3). Phosphorylation of c-Jun, as observed by cross-linking, was inhibited by the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 5 and6). IL-1 was also found to increase JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation on P815 cells (Fig. 3 C,lane 2and 3 D,lane 3). We next investigated the ability of T1/ST2 to activate p42/p44 MAP kinase using an Elk-1 trans-reporter system consisting of an Elk-1-GAL4 construct and Gal-luciferase, which serves as a readout for p42/44 activation. As shown in Fig.4 A, overexpression of T1/ST2 in HEK293 cells (left panel) or EL4 (right panel) activated p42/p44. 20 or 50 ng of a plasmid encoding T1/ST2 was required for this effect in HEK293 cells, while 2.5 μg of plasmid was required for EL4 cells. 20 ng each of IL1RI and IL1RAcP were able to activate p42/44 in HEK293 cells (left panel).

https://openalex.org/W1973358445,"The amplified in breast cancer-3 (AIB3, ASC-2, RAP250, PRIP, TRBP, NRC, or NcoA6) gene is characterized as a cancer-amplified transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors, which include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). To assess its biological function, we deleted theAIB3 gene in mice by homologous recombination. AIB3+/− mice are developmentally normal and fertile. AIB3−/− embryos exhibit growth restriction and lethality during 9.75–11.5 days postconception. The embryonic lethality is probably attributed to defects in the development of the placental vascular network and cardiac hypoplasia. These defects include the failure of labyrinthine development, the dilation of maternal blood sinuses, the massive erythrophagocytosis by trophoblasts, the alteration of trophoblast populations, and the lower proliferation of myocardium, which are similar to those encountered in mice lacking PPARγ or the PPARγ-binding protein (PBP, TRAP220, or DRIP205). In addition, the transcriptional activities of PPARγ are significantly affected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking AIB3. These results suggest that AIB3 is required for PPARγ function in placental development and for normal heart development. These results also indicate that the biological function of AIB3 is not redundant with other classes of nuclear receptor coactivators such as PBP and members of the steroid receptor coactivator family.

These results also indicate that the biological function of AIB3 is not redundant with other classes of nuclear receptor coactivators such as PBP and members of the steroid receptor coactivator family. The AIB3 gene was initially identified from a highly amplified chromosomal region (20q11–12) in human breast tumor cells (1Guan X.Y. Meltzer P.S. Dalton W.S. Trent J.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 155-161Google Scholar). In addition to amplification in 10% of breast cancers,AIB3 is amplified in 30% of colon cancers and 13% of lung cancers, suggesting that AIB3 may play an important role in cell growth and tumorigenesis (2Guan X.Y.

Apart from nuclear receptors, AIB3 also serves as a coactivator for other classes of transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses such as AP-1, serum response factor (SRF), CREB, C/EBPα, and NF-κB (6Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar, 8Lee S.K. Na S.Y. Jung S.Y. Choi J.E. Jhun B.H. Cheong J. Meltzer P.S. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol.

These studies suggest that AIB3 may play important roles in multiple signaling pathways regulated by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. AIB3 is a widely expressed nuclear coactivator that mediates transcriptional activities of transcription factors through interaction with proteins including SRC-1, CBP, p300, DRIP130, TBP, and TFIIA (3Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H. Cheong J.H. Lee Y.C. Meltzer P.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

SRC-1, CBP, and p300 possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferases and are important components of the coactivator complex that also contains other histone acetyltransferase activities such as p/CAF and protein methyltransferases such as CARM1 (10Xu J. O'Malley B.W. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2002; 3: 183-190Google Scholar, 11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar, 12Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Google Scholar). Recruitment of the SRC-1·CBP coactivator complex to the promoter by ligand-bound nuclear receptors facilitates local chromatin remodeling and target gene transcription (10Xu J. O'Malley B.W. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2002; 3: 183-190Google Scholar, 11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar). DRIP130 is a component of the TRAP or DRIP coactivator complex that was thought to coactivate transcription by nuclear receptors and transcription factors through direct contact with general transcription factors (13Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Google Scholar, 14Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Google Scholar). Therefore, AIB3 may function through bridging both SRC-1·CBP and TRAP common coactivator complexes to the transcription factors and through interacting with the general transcription machinery (TBP and TFIIA). Although studies based on protein-protein interactions and transient transfection assays provided basic conceptual knowledge concerning AIB3 function, the results from in vitro experiments may not be easily extrapolated to the in vivo physiological conditions. To study the biological function of AIB3, we have generated and characterized AIB3 null mice. We show that deletion of theAIB3 gene causes abnormal heart morphology, severe defects in placental development and embryonic lethality during 9.75–11.5 dpc, probably due to the impairment of PPARγ function. The NotI-HSV.tk-SacII DNA fragment for a negative selection marker was subcloned into the parent plasmid pNTR-LacZ-PGKneo by using a linker with XhoI andSacII sites. The 7-kb AIB3 genomic DNA spanning exons 7–9 (GenBankTM NM_019825: 2718–2997 bp) was amplified by PCR from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell DNA and inserted into aNotI site between the neo and the tk expression cassettes to serve as the 3′-targeting arm. The 5-kb AIB3 genomic DNA spanning exons 1–3 (GenBankTM NM_019825: 245–544 bp) was also amplified by PCR and subcloned into SalI and XhoI sites located 5′ to LacZ-PGKneo to serve as the 5′-targeting arm (Fig.1 A). The targeting vector was linearized bySalI digestion and electroporated into TC-1 ES cells as described previously (15Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Google Scholar, 16Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Google Scholar). Individual clones resistant to G418 and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil were isolated. Targeted clones were identified by Southern blot using both 5′ and 3′ probes located in exon 1 (GenBankTMNM_019825: 24–240 bp) and exon 9 (GenBankTM NM_019825: 3001–3417 bp) and used to generate chimeric mice through microinjection as described previously (15Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Google Scholar, 16Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from tail tips or yolk sacs. AIB3 wild type and mutant alleles were distinguished by PCR using allele-specific primer pairs (Fig.1 A). PCR with P11 (ggcctgcagaaatgtcactctg) and P12 (gtcaacctgtctcagatgatgc) amplifies a 262-bp band from the wild type allele, while PCR with P-neo (cgctatcaggacatagcgttgg) and P11 amplifies a 550-bp band from the mutant allele. For Western blot, protein lysates were prepared from 9.5-dpc individual embryos and the amount of 0.1-mg protein for each sample was separated on SDS-PAGE. The blots were analyzed by using polyclonal antibodies against amino acids 714–999 and 1641–2063 of human TRBP (AIB3) (6Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar). Mouse embryos and placentas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and processed for paraffin sectioning at 5 μm for the hematoxylin and eosin staining. To prepare semithin sections, placentas were cut into pieces and fixed in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, postfixed in the same buffer with 1% OsO4 for 1 h, and embedded in an Epon mixture. Semithin sections were cut at 0.5 μm and stained with toluidine blue. Immunostaining was performed on rehydrated paraffin sections as described previously (17Yuan Y. Liao L. Tulis D.A. Xu J. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2653-2659Google Scholar). The PECAM-1 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen), VEGF-R2 (Flk-1) monoclonal antibody (PharMingen), smooth muscle α-actin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and phosphohistone H3 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) were applied according to manufacturers' instructions. BrdUrd (Amersham Biosciences) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant mice at 9.5 dpc in a dose of 0.5 mg/g body weight. Two hours after injection, mice were sacrificed and placentas processed for paraffin sectioning. A BrdUrd immunostaining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and a TUNEL assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used to detect proliferating cells and apoptotic cells, respectively. In situ hybridization was performed on rehydrated mouse placenta and heart sections by using 35S-labeled RNA probes. Primary MEFs were isolated from individual embryos at 9.75 dpc following digestion with 0.25% trypsin for 20 min at 37 °C. MEFs were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNAs using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent according to the product instruction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To generate AIB3 mutant mice, a targeting vector was constructed and used to disrupt theAIB3 gene through homologous recombination in ES cells (Fig.1 A). In the targeted allele, expression of the first three exons preceding the deletion region and encoding aa 1–170 is predicted. However, this N-terminal peptide does not contain structural domains for interaction with any transcription factors or for transcriptional activation (3Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H. Cheong J.H. Lee Y.C. Meltzer P.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34283-34293Google Scholar, 4Caira F. Antonson P.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Google Scholar). The 21.4-kb DNA region encoding Pro171–Leu895 was deleted by the targeting, which was confirmed by Southern blot and real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1, B and C). The exons located downstream the deletion region for aa 896–2067 were disrupted and transcriptionally terminated by the insertion of the neocassette with a signaling sequence for transcriptional termination (Fig. 1 A), which was confirmed by the absence of the C-terminal domains for interaction with transcription factors, DNA-dependent protein kinases, and other protein complexes (6Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar) in AIB3 knock-out embryos (Fig. 1 D and data not shown). On Western blots probed with polyclonal antibodies against aa 714–999 and aa 1641–2063, the AIB3 protein was clearly detected in wild type and AIB+/− embryos, but not detected in AIB3−/− embryos. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the targeted AIB3 allele can not produce any functional proteins. From a total of 768 examined ES clones, four correctly targeted clones were identified and microinjected into recipient blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric founders capable of germ line transmission were obtained from three independent ES clones and were crossed to wild type (AIB3+/+) C57BL/6 females to produce heterozygous (AIB3+/−) mutants. AIB3+/− mice exhibited normal development and fertility, although AIB3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced when assayed at 9.5 dpc by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that several AIB3 mutant mouse lines are established. No AIB3−/− mice were identified at weaning among 204 progeny from AIB3+/− intercrosses, indicating that AIB3−/− mice died at an earlier stage (TableI). At 8.5 dpc, AIB3−/−embryos exhibited no obvious morphological changes, but by 9.75 dpc they were smaller than AIB3+/+ littermates. At 10 and 10.5 dpc, AIB3−/− embryos exhibited severe growth restriction (Fig. 2, A and B), and the number of viable AIB3−/− embryos was significantly reduced (Table I). Accordingly, the percentage of dead AIB3−/− embryos reached 15% (10 dpc) and 53% (10.5 dpc). The number of resorbed embryos was also increased at 10.5 dpc. At 11.5 dpc, seven out of nine AIB3−/− embryos identified from a total of 64 embryos were dead. The two living AIB3−/− embryos at 11.5 dpc looked pale with irregular and depressed heart beats, indicating that they were moribund. At 12.5 dpc, no viable AIB3−/− embryos were found, and 22% of embryos were resorbed (Table I). These results indicate that AIB3−/− embryos exhibit growth restriction, and the majority die between 9.75 and 11.5 dpc.Table ILethal stages of AIB3−/− embryosStagesnaNumber of embryos or pups.GenotypesResorbed embryosbResorbed embryos were not genotyped.+/++/−−/−8.5 dpc481124103 (6%)cThe percentile of resorbed to total embryos.9.5 dpc165437833 (1)dThe number of dead AIB3−/− embryos.10 (6%)9.75 dpc125316026 (4)4 (3%)10 dpc131336119 (10)8 (6%)10.5 dpc11227575 (11)12 (11%)11.5 dpc6415302 (7)10 (16%)12.5 dpc419180 (5)9 (22%)WeaningeThe weaning was on day 21 after birth.204631410a Number of embryos or pups.b Resorbed embryos were not genotyped.c The percentile of resorbed to total embryos.d The number of dead AIB3−/− embryos.e The weaning was on day 21 after birth. Open table in a new tab Prior to their death, about 15–20% of AIB3−/− embryos presented with edamatous pools of blood in their hearts and/or severe pericardial effusion at 10.5 dpc, suggesting cardiovascular failure in these mutant embryos (Fig. 2 B). Histological analysis revealed that all of the basic heart structures were developed in AIB3−/− embryos. However, the atrial and ventricular walls of AIB3−/− hearts were much thinner than those of normal hearts (Fig. 2, C and D). Especially, the compact zone of the ventricular wall was more severely affected. The trabeculaes were not only thinner, but also deformed. In addition, a significant portion of the AIB3−/− endocardium was detached from the myocardium (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that the requisite intimate interaction between the endocardium and the myocardium was affected. To elucidate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the heart abnormalities, molecular markers for proliferation and differentiation of the myocardium were examined by performing immunostaining andin situ hybridization. Immunostaining of the Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3, a marker of cell mitosis (18Ajiro K. Yoda K. Utsumi K. Nishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13197-13201Google Scholar), revealed that the cell proliferation rates of AIB3−/− myocardium were 24.4 ± 3.2% (n = 5 embryos), which was significantly lower than the proliferation rates of wild type mycardium (36.1 ± 3%,n = 5, p < 0.001 by ttest). However, immunostaining showed similar expression patterns of the smooth muscle α-actin in both wild type and AIB3−/−hearts (data not shown). In addition, the myosin light chain 2v (MLC2v), a contractile protein gene expressed in the striated muscle, was also equally expressed in both wild type and AIB3−/−ventricular myocardium (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that the hypoplastic development of AIB3−/− hearts correlates with the decrease in myocardial proliferation. However, AIB3 may not be required for myocardial differentiation. Several classes of abnormalities were observed in AIB3−/− placentas. First, the essential labyrinthine layer in AIB3−/− placentas was not successfully developed. In AIB3+/+ and AIB3+/− placentas, the labyrinthine layer was formed by 9.5 dpc and further developed into a densely packed thick structure with the fetal vascular network supported by spongiotrophoblasts and surrounded by maternal blood sinuses (Fig. 3, A,C, and E). Between the maternal blood sinuses and the fetal endothelium, the three-cell-layered epithelial barrier characteristic of mouse and human hemochorial placentas was tightly packed to warrant appropriate material exchanges between maternal and fetal blood (Fig. 3 G). In contrast, the fetal blood vessels in AIB3−/− placentas did not successfully invade into the presumptive labyrinth, even by 10.5 dpc (Fig. 3, B,D, and F) as demonstrated by a lack of fetal vessels containing nucleated erythrocytes (Fig. 3, compare Fwith E). Immunostaining of endothelial cell markers, PECAM-1 and VEGF-R2, further confirmed that the fetal capillaries in AIB3−/− placentas were poorly developed in the labyrinth (Fig. 3, C and D, and data not shown). Although occasionally, a few AIB3−/− fetal vessels were able to grow into the labyrinthine layer, the invaginating chorionic villi were surrounded by excessively thickened trophoblast cell layers destroying the characteristic three-cell-layered epithelial barrier required for nutrition and oxygen exchange (Fig. 3 H). Second, AIB3−/− maternal blood sinuses, which in normal placentas were compact and well defined (Fig. 3 E), were often dilated or ruptured (Fig. 3 F), sometimes expanding the entire zone to form huge blood pools in AIB3−/− placentas (not shown). AIB3−/− syncytiotrophoblasts lining the wall of maternal blood sinuses were loosely attached or even detached (Fig. 3, compare I with J and see arrows). Third, the erythrophagocytic activity of syncytiotrophoblasts and trophoblast giant cells, which is also an indication of vascular defects, was extremely active in AIB3−/− placentas. A number of maternal erythrocytes were observed in the cytoplasms of many trophoblasts in the junctional zone of AIB3−/− placentas (asterisks in Fig. 3, K and L). Cumulatively, these results indicate that AIB3 is essential for the development and maintenance of the placental vascular system. Overall distributions of the mPL-1-expressing trophoblast giant cells, the 4311-expressing spongiotrophoblasts, and the Mash2-expressing spongiotrophoblasts and labyrinthine trophoblasts in AIB3−/− placentas were similar to those in normal placentas, suggesting that AIB3 is not essential for the determination of trophoblast cell lineages (Fig. 3, M–R). However, a higher number of trophoblast giant cells, a lower number of spongiotrophoblasts, and a much lower number of labyrinthine trophoblasts were observed in AIB3−/− placentas, as reflected by the hybridization signals in AIB3−/−placentas. Accordingly, the proliferation rate of AIB3−/−trophoblast giant cells (42%) was significantly higher than that of AIB3−/− trophoblast giant cells (27%) (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, the 25% proliferation rate of AIB3−/− spongiotrophoblasts was significantly lower than the 52% proliferation rate of AIB3+/+spongiotrophoblasts (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that the balance of three types of trophoblasts is disrupted in AIB3−/− placentas, and the population of labyrinthine trophoblasts is more severely affected in AIB3−/− placentas. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for AIB3 function in PPARγ-regulated transcription, we isolated MEFs and assayed transcriptional activities of PPARγ in cells lacking AIB3. The transcriptional activities of PPARγ in AIB3+/+ and AIB3+/− MEFs were increased 20-fold after ligand treatment. However, the transcriptional activities of PPARγ in AIB3−/− MEFs were only increased 10-fold after ligand treatment (Fig. 4). These results suggest that PPARγ function is impaired in AIB3 null cells. Recently, a number of coactivators have been shown to enhance transcriptional activation by many nuclear receptors and other transcription factors in a redundant fashion when they are overexpressed in cultured cells (10Xu J. O'Malley B.W. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2002; 3: 183-190Google Scholar, 11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar). A significant challenge is to define the functional relationships among individual coactivators and transcription factors under physiological conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the function of coactivators of the SRC family are partially redundant, and mice lacking SRC-1, TIF2, or SRC-3 (p/CIP) are viable although they exhibit distinct phenotypes (15Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Google Scholar, 16Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, mice lacking the cancer-amplified coactivator AIB3 exhibit intrauterine growth restriction, hypoplastic heart development, defective placentation, and embryonic lethality during 9.75–11.5 dpc. These results indicate that AIB3 is essential for embryonic development beyond 9.75 dpc, and it is not functionally redundant with any other classes of coactivators such as the SRC family members. Noticeably, mice lacking either PPARγ or its binding protein, PBP, are lethal at 10–11.5 dpc, and their lethality is largely attributed to defects in placental development (22Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Google Scholar, 23Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Google Scholar). Since AIB3 is highly expressed in the placenta (4Caira F. Antonson P. Pelto-Huikko M. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5308-5317Google Scholar), AIB3 serves as a coactivator for PPARγ (5Zhu Y. Kan L. Qi C. Kanwar Y.S. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13510-13516Google Scholar), and AIB3−/− embryos die at a similar stage, we reasoned that AIB3 may play an important role in placentation through mediating PPARγ function. Analyses of placental structure, specific molecular markers for the fetal endothelium and trophoblasts, and PPARγ transcriptional activities in AIB3−/− cells confirmed this prediction and, therefore, provided the first in vivo evidence of AIB3 as a coactivator of PPARγ. Indeed, most histological defects observed in the placentation of AIB3−/− embryos are also observed in PPARγ and/or PBP mutant mice (22Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Google Scholar, 23Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Google Scholar), which include: failure of labyrinth formation, dilation of maternal blood sinuses, and erythrophagocytosis by trophoblasts. The reproducibility of the placental phenotypes in AIB3, PBP, and PPARγ knock-out models strongly suggests that these three proteins function through a linear signaling pathway in vivo. These data demonstrate that AIB3 is essential for the development and maintenance of the placental vascular network. Therefore, the failure of placentation may be one of the major causes for the embryonic lethality of AIB3−/− embryos. Since human diseases of the “missed abortion” and some types of intrauterine growth restriction often arise from reduced branching of chorionic villi and the underlying vasculature (24van Lijnschoten G. Arends J.W. Geraedts J.P. Placenta. 1994; 15: 765-773Google Scholar, 25Krebs C. Macara L.M. Leiser R. Bowman A.W. Greer I.A. Kingdom J.C. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1996; 175: 1534-1542Google Scholar), these findings should qualify AIB3 as a potential candidate gene to be examined in these diseases. The expression of PECAM-1 and VEGF-R2 in the endothelium of AIB3−/− fetal vessels near the chorionic plate revealed that AIB3 is not essential for endothelial lineage differentiation. However, successful outgrowth of fetal vessels into the labyrinthine layer requires multiple angiogenic factors secreted from trophoblasts. Fetal vessels in AIB3−/− placentas are unable to penetrate into the labyrinthine layer, suggesting a maturation block of trophoblasts. The lack of the characteristic three-cell-layered epithelial barrier between fetal vessels and maternal blood sinuses in AIB3−/− placentas clearly indicates that the terminal differentiation of the labyrinthine trophoblasts is affected. Furthermore, AIB3−/− syncytiotrophoblasts also exhibit differentiation problems as abnormal morphologies and detachment from their underlining trophoblast layer. In turn, the incomplete lining of the blood sinus wall causes the leakage of maternal erythrocytes into interstitial regions and extensive erythrophagocytosis by trophoblasts. In addition, the expanded maternal blood sinuses in AIB3−/− placentas may be a consequence of the increase of trophoblast giant cell proliferation and the decrease of spongiotrophoblast proliferation. In PPARγ mutants, the thin myocardial wall syndrome can be completely rescued through replacement of their trophoblast lineage by tetraploid chimera methodology (22Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Google Scholar). Similarly, the hypoplastic myocardial wall and deformation of the trabeculaes in AIB3−/− hearts may be also secondary to the defective placentation, since in the developing heart, PPARγ is not expressed and AIB3 is expressed relatively low (4Caira F. Antonson P. Pelto-Huikko M. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5308-5317Google Scholar, 22Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possible role of AIB3 in the regulation of myocardium proliferation, the decrease in AIB3−/− myocardium proliferation might be also a reflection of malnutrition. Most interestingly, the hypoplastic heart development correlates with developmental defects of fetal vessels in the placenta in multiple animal models including PPARγ and AIB3 knock-out mice. The reproducibility of this correlation may indicate a common structural and functional relationship between the heart and the placenta. From a hemodynamic standpoint, the placenta is a low resistance vascular network. The lack or reduction of this low resistance vasculature system may cause an increase in afterload for the developing heart and, therefore, contribute to the disintegration of myocardial architecture through a mechanical effect. However, the defect in the placenta labyrinth alone may not fully explain the severe growth restriction of AIB3−/− embryos, because other mouse mutants lacking PPARγ, PBP, and Mash2 with very similar placentation defects exhibit only mild or no growth retardation (22Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Google Scholar, 23Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

On the other hand, defects in the yolk sac vasculature frequently cause growth restriction in fetuses and dilatation of the pericardium. Indeed, about 15–20% of AIB3−/− embryos exhibit pericardial effusion, suggesting that AIB3 may also play some role in the yolk sac development and function. Since PPARγ is not expressed in the yolk sac, and mice lacking PPARγ and PBP have no yolk sac abnormalities (22Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Google Scholar, 23Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Google Scholar), the coactivator function of AIB3 in the yolk sac may be associated with other unknown transcription factors. Therefore, future studies on other parts of AIB3−/− embryos in which PPARγ is not expressed will gain more insight into the functional relationships between AIB3 and other interactive transcription factors.

https://openalex.org/W2142407976,"When a different pattern is presented to each eye, the perceived image spontaneously alternates between the two patterns (binocular rivalry); the dynamics of these bistable alternations are known to be stochastic. Examining multistable binocular rivalry (involving four dominant percepts), we demonstrated path dependence and on-line adaptation, which were equivalent whether perceived patterns were formed by single-eye dominance or by mixed-eye dominance. The spontaneous perceptual transitions tended to get trapped within a pair of related global patterns (e.g., opponent shapes and symmetric patterns), and during such trapping, the probability of returning to the repeatedly experienced patterns gradually decreased (postselection pattern adaptation). These results suggest that the structure of global shape coding and its adaptation play a critical role in directing spontaneous alternations of visual awareness in perceptual multistability."
https://openalex.org/W1985134966,"It is widely acknowledged that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake modulates the cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) acting as a transient Ca2+ buffer. In addition, mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M) regulates the rate of respiration and may trigger opening of the permeability transition pore and start apoptosis. However, no mechanism for the physiological regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has been described. We show here that SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, strongly stimulates ruthenium red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, both in intact and in permeabilized HeLa cells. The [Ca2+]M peak induced by agonists was increased about fourfold in the presence of the inhibitor, with a concomitant reduction in the [Ca2+]c peak. The stimulation occurred fast and was rapidly reversible. In addition, experiments in permeabilized cells perfused with controlled [Ca2+] showed that SB202190 stimulated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by more than 10-fold, but only in the physiological [Ca2+]c range (1-4 mM). Other structurally related p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (SB203580, PD169316, or SB220025) produced little or no effect. Our data suggest that in HeLa cells, a protein kinase sensitive to SB202190 tonically inhibits the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. This novel regulatory mechanism may be of paramount importance to modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake under different physiopathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2025383376,"Upon antigen stimulation, lymphocytes enter in cell cycle and proliferate, and most of the activated T cells die by apoptosis. Many of the proteins that regulate lymphocyte activation are Under the control of transcription factors belonging to the NFAT family. As previously demonstrated, NFATC2-/- mice consistently showed a marked increase in lymphocyte proliferation. Here, we evaluate the role of NFATC2 in regulating lymphocyte proliferation and its involvement in the control of cell cycle progression during lymphocyte activation. NFATC2-/- lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells and B cells, hyperproliferated upon stimulation when compared with NFATC2+/+ cells. Analysis of cell death demonstrated that NFATC2-/- lymphocytes displayed an increased rate of apoptosis after antigen stimulation in addition to the hyperproliferation. Cell cycle analysis after antigen stimulation showed that NFATC2-/- cultures contained more cycling cells when compared with NFATC2+/+ cultures, which is related to a shortening in time of cell division upon activation. Furthermore, hyperproliferation of NFATC2-/- lymphocytes is correlated to an overexpression of cyclins A2, B1, E, and F. Taken together, our results suggest that the NFATC2 transcription factor plays an important role in the control of cell cycle during lymphocyte activation and may act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation in normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087482639,"Bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells express a background K+channel (IAC) that sets the resting potential and acts pivotally in ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion. We have cloned a bTREK-1 (KCNK2) tandem-pore K+ channel cDNA from AZF cells with properties that identify it as the native IAC. The bTREK-1 cDNA is expressed robustly in AZF cells and includes transcripts of 4.9, 3.6, and 2.8 kb. In patch clamp recordings made from transiently transfected cells, bTREK-1 displayed distinctive properties of IAC in AZF cells. Specifically, bTREK-1 currents were outwardly rectifying with a large instantaneous and smaller time-dependent component. Similar to IAC, bTREK-1 increased spontaneously in amplitude over many minutes of whole cell recording and was blocked potently by Ca2+ antagonists including penfluridol and mibefradil and by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP. Unitary TREK-1 and IAC currents were nearly identical in amplitude. The native IAC current, in turn, displayed properties that together are specific to TREK-1 K+ channels. These include activation by intracellular acidification, enhancement by the neuroprotective agent riluzole, and outward rectification. bTREK-1 current differed from native K+ current only in its lack of ATP dependence. In contrast to IAC, the current density of bTREK-1 in human embryonic kidney-293 cells was not increased by raising pipette ATP from 0.1 to 5 mm. Further, the enhancement of IAC current in AZF cells by low pH and riluzole was facilitated by, and dependent on, ATP at millimolar concentrations in the pipette solution. Overall, these results establish the identity of IAC K+ channels, demonstrate the expression of bTREK-1 in a specific endocrine cell, identify potent new TREK-1 antagonists, and assign a pivotal role for these tandem-pore channels in the physiology of cortisol secretion. The activation of IAC by ATP indicates that native bTREK-1 channels may function as sensors that couple the metabolic state of the cell to membrane potential, perhaps through an associated ATP-binding protein.

IAC displays a number of properties typical of background or leak-type channels that function in setting the resting membrane potential of various cells. However, native IACchannels also exhibit a combination of properties not observed previously in a single type of K+ channel. In whole cell patch clamp recordings, IAC appears as a non-inactivating, outwardly rectifying K+ current that displays weak voltage dependence and grows spontaneously over many minutes (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen.

At the single channel level, the conductance and rectifying properties of these channels depend strongly on the presence of divalent cations (5Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar). In symmetrical K+, with physiological concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, the channels are outwardly rectifying, whereas they become nearly ohmic in the absence of divalent cations (4Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar). In whole cell patch clamp recordings, IAC is inhibited potently by ACTH and angiotensin II, the two peptide hormones that regulate cortisol secretion physiologically (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20942-20951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IAC channels are also inhibited by paracrine factors, including ATP and adenosine, which act through specific G protein-coupled nucleotide receptors (7Xu L. Enyeart J.J. J. Physiol (Camb.). 1999; 521.1: 81-97Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second messengers synthesized or released upon activation of these receptors, including Ca2+ and cAMP, inhibit IACchannels. However, inhibition appears to involve atypical signaling pathways, because responses to peptides and second messengers are insensitive to inhibition of cAMP and Ca2+-activated protein kinases (3Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar, 6Mlinar B.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1526-C1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among background K+ channels, IAC channels are unique in their activation by hydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable forms of ATP, applied intracellularly at physiological concentrations through a recording pipette (4Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These background channels are also activated by UTP, GTP, and by inorganic polytriphosphate (PPPi) (4Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,5Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar). IAC channels also display a unique pharmacological profile. Specifically, these channels are relatively insensitive to many standard K+ channel antagonists, including 4-AP and TEA (respective IC50 values of 2.8 and 24.3 mm), whereas they are blocked by others such as quinidine (IC50 = 24.1 μm) (10Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 266-275PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, IAC K+ channels are blocked potently by the Ca2+ antagonists penfluridol and mibefradil at far lower concentrations (respective IC50 values of 0.20 and 0.50 μm) (10Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 266-275PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although IAC K+ channels function as background or leak K+ channels that set the resting potential of AZF cells, their aggregate properties do not match the profile of any K+ channel yet described. Regardless, these channels appear to function critically in the physiology of cortisol secretion. In this capacity, they act as sensors that integrate hormonal and metabolic signals and couple these to depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry. Because of their distinctive properties as a metabolic sensor and role in cortisol secretion, it will be important to determine the molecular identity of IAC channels. In this regard, K+-selective ion channels in mammals can be divided into several families, based on structure and membrane topology. Voltage-gated K+ channels include a major subunit that consists of one pore domain and six transmembrane segments (1P/6TMS) (12Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). A second family that consists of channel subunits containing a single pore domain and two membrane-spanning segments (1P/2TMS) includes inward rectifiers many of which contribute to the resting potential and some of which are inhibited directly by intracellular ATP (12Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 13Takano M. Noma A. Progr. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Terzic A. Tung R.T. Kurachi Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). K+-selective leak or background channels comprise the third and most recently described family of K+ channels. In mammals, the largest group of leak K+ channels possesses distinctive subunits that consist of two pore domains and four transmembrane segments. These 2P/4TMS channels are typically non-inactivating K+ channels that set the resting potential in a range of cells (15Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev.

Since 1995, more that a dozen members of the 2P/4TMS family have been identified and characterized by molecular cloning and patch clamp techniques (15Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev.

Although similar in structure, 2P/4TMS K+ channels can be distinguished based on a variety of functional properties including unitary conductance, rectification, sensitivity to mechanical stimulation, pH and temperature, modulation by cAMP, fatty acids, membrane phospholipids, general anesthetics, and the neuroprotective agent riluzole (15Lesage F.

These leak-type channels also show variable sensitivity to standard K+ channel blockers (15Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev.

At least one member of this family is reported to acquire voltage-dependent gating upon phosphorylation (20Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although IAC functions in AZF cells as a classic leak-type K+ channel, its distinctive properties are not duplicated in any of the 2P/4TMS K+ channels yet described. In particular, direct modulation of K+ channels by ATP has only been demonstrated in KATP channels of the 1P/2TMS type, which are inhibited rather than activated by this nucleotide (13Takano M. Noma A. Progr. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,14Terzic A. Tung R.T. Kurachi Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have cloned a 2P/4TMS channel TREK-1 (KCNK2) K+ channel cDNA from AZF cells that appears to code for IACK+ channels. When expressed in cell lines, bTREK-1 currents share several distinctive features with native IACcurrents. Evidence is presented that indicates that, in AZF cells, bTREK-1 channels acquire additional properties including ATP sensitivity.

Penfluridol was obtained from Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Beerse, Belgium). p3-CD8 clone was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Seed, Department of Genetics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Rat TREK-2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. D. Kim, Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, Finch University of Health Sciences, The Chicago Medical School, Chicago, IL. HEK-293 and CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from steers (age range 1 to 3 years) within 1 h of slaughter at a local slaughterhouse. Fatty tissue was removed immediately, and the glands were transported to the laboratory in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% dextrose. Isolated AZF cells were prepared as described previously (4Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After isolation, cells were either resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and the antioxidants 1 μmtocopherol, 20 nm selenite and 100 μmascorbic acid (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12+) and plated for immediate use or resuspended in fetal bovine serum/5% Me2SO, divided into 1-ml aliquots each containing about 2 × 106 cells, and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use. Cells were plated in either 60- or 35-mm dishes containing 9-mm2 glass coverslips. Dishes or coverslips were treated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min then rinsed with warm, sterile phosphate-buffered saline immediately before adding cells. Cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12+ and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) that had been treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to remove genomic contamination were used to extract total RNA from AZF cells that had been cultured overnight. poly(A)+ mRNA was extracted from total RNA using a Poly(A) Pure kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Reverse transcription and cDNA amplification were performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting AZF double-stranded cDNA was used as the template for all PCR and RACE PCR reactions. RACE and PCR reactions were run as per Clontech instructions on a Thermolyne Temptronic thermal cycler. Noting the sequence similarities among double-pore channels, particularly at the transmembrane and pore regions, degenerate primers were designed using human TREK-1 (AF171068), and human TRAAK (AF247042) pore (P1) and transmembrane (M2) sequences as templates. For an initial 3′RACE reaction, a degenerate primer designed from P1 5′-CTG GGA CCG TCA TCA CVA CCA TMG G-3′) was used as the forward primer, and the Clontech adaptor primer 1 was used as the reverse primer. Using the product of this initial reaction, nested 3′RACE was performed using a degenerate primer from the M2 region (5′-TGG GGA TTC CGC TGT TTG GKW TYY T-3′) as the forward primer, and the Clontech adaptor primer 2 was used as the reverse primer. The 3′ nested RACE product was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide/UV transillumination. A 750-bp 3′ RACE product was excised from the gel and cloned into pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Clones were sequenced using an Applied Systems sequencer, model 3700, version 3.6.1 software. Using this initial 750-bp product to design specific nested primers for 5′ RACE PCR, the 5′ end of bTREK-1 was obtained. For transfection, the full-length bTREK-1 clone was produced by PCR using a low error rate DNA polymerase (Pfu DNA polymerase; Invitrogen), bTREK-1-specific primers 5′-/5phos/GCG ATT CCG TGT CTT CTC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-AAG GTC TAA TTG CTA TGC CTG AG-3′ as the reverse primer, and AZF double-stranded cDNA as the template. The PCR product obtained was subcloned into the pCR3.1-Uni expression vector (Invitrogen) for transfection into HEK-293 cells or CHO-K1. For patch clamp recording of bTREK-1 currents, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with a mixture of pCR®3.1-Uni-bTrek-1 and an expression plasmid (p3-CD8) for the α-subunit of the human CD8 lymphocyte surface antigen at a 5:1 ratio using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were visualized 1–2 days post-transfection after a 15-min incubation with anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal Biotech Inc., Lake Success, NY) as described (21Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). 7 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA, isolated as described above, was separated on a denaturing 8% formaldehyde, 1.0% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Gene Screen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV-cross-linking using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Northern blots were prehybridized in heat-sealable plastic bags for 2 h at 42 °C in ULTRAhyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) for probing using either a 1415-bp fragment that contained the entire coding region of bTREK-1 or a 206-bpBamHI fragment primarily from the bTREK-1 5′-untranslated end. The blots were hybridized with a random-primed32P-α-dCTP radiolabeled probe (Prime-it-II; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) overnight in minimal volume of hybridization solution. After 18–24 h the blots were washed twice at room temperature in 2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA for 15 min, twice at 40 °C in 2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS for 30 min with a final wash at 65 °C with 0.1 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS for 20 min. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing the blots for 2 to 5 h to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of K+ currents were made from AZF cells or bTREK-1-transfected HEK-293 cells. The standard pipette solution was 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 5 mm MgATP, and 200 μm GTP, with pH buffered to 7.2 using KOH. Deviations from these solutions with respect to nucleotide and pH are described in the text. The external solution consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.35, using NaOH. All solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters. AZF cells were used for patch clamp experiments 2–12 h after plating. Typically, cells with diameters of <15 μm and capacitances of 8–15 picofarads were selected. Coverslips were transferred from 35-mm culture dishes to the recording chamber (volume, 1.5 ml), which was perfused continuously by gravity at a rate of 3–5 ml/min. Drugs were applied externally by bath perfusion controlled manually by a six-way rotary valve. Patch electrodes with resistances of 2.0–5.0 megohms were fabricated from Corning 0010 glass (WPI, Sarasota, FL). K+ currents were recorded at room temperature (20–23 °C) following the procedure of Hamill et al.(22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar), using an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA) or List EPC 7 patch clamp amplifier. HEK-293 or CHO-K1 cells were used for patch clamping 24–72 h after transfection with bTREK-1. Transfected cells were plated on 9-mm glass coverslips as described above. Fifteen min before initiating a patch clamp experiment anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads were added to the culture dish. Upon transferring coverslips to the recording chamber, transfected cells were identified based on decoration with the beads. Whole cell bTREK-1 K+ currents in transfected cells were recorded as described for AZF cells. Smaller cells with capacitances of 10–15 pF were selected for recording. Pulse generation and data acquisition were done using a personal computer and PCLAMP software with a TL-1 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). Currents were digitized using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) Linear leak and capacity currents were subtracted from current records using hyperpolarizing steps of ⅓ to ¼ amplitude. Data were analyzed and plotted using PCLAMP 5.5 and 6.04 (Clampan and Clampfit) and SigmaPlot (version 5.0). Previous studies using whole cell and single channel patch clamp recording showed that IACchannels resembled 2P/4TMS channels of the TREK-1 and TRAAK with regard to single channel conductance and rectification (5Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar, 16Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Degenerate primers were designed using the P1 and M2 regions of hTREK-1 and hTRAAK as templates, and 3′RACE PCR was performed using AZF cell double-stranded cDNA generated from poly(A)+ mRNA. A 750-bp product was obtained that showed 92% nucleotide sequence identity to human TREK-1. No PCR products were obtained that were homologous to hTRAAK. Specific primers were designed from this TREK-1-like product for extension in the 5′ direction using nested 5′ RACE PCR. Combining the 3′ and 5′ RACE products yielded a 1534-nt cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AY148474). This coding sequence consists of an open reading frame of 411 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence for bTREK-1 is given in Fig.1, with the four transmembrane and two pore sequences noted. The bovine sequence AAN37591-1 shows 99% protein sequence identity to human TREK-1 (protein ID, NP_055032.1), 96% identity to rat TREK-1 (protein ID, AAL95708), and 96.4% to mouse TREK-1 (Protein ID, XP_123605). Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA showed that bTREK-1 mRNA is expressed highly in the bovine adrenal cortex. A 1415-bp DNA probe that included the full-length coding region of bTREK-1 hybridized to separate ∼4.9-, 3.6-, and 2.8-kb mRNA transcripts isolated from AZF cells (Fig. 1 B, left lane). To eliminate the possibility that these transcripts could be the result of the full-length TREK-1 probe hybridizing to mRNA coding for homologous channels present in the adrenal cortex, a TREK-1-specific probe consisting of a 206-bp BamHI fragment derived primarily from the 5′untranslated end of bTREK-1 was used to probe a separate poly(A)+ blot. The 206-bp fragment also hybridized to the same three transcripts (Fig. 1 B,right lane), with the strongest hybridization signal originating from the 3.6- and 2.8-kb transcripts. Properties of bTREK-1 currents were studied in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. Successfully transfected cells were identified based on decoration with anti-CD-8 antibody-coated beads, as described under “Methods.” In whole cell patch clamp recording, bTREK-1 was remarkably similar in several respects to the native IAC current in bovine AZF cells. Specifically, in physiological saline bTREK-1 appeared as a non-inactivating current that increased spontaneously in amplitude to a maximum value over many minutes of whole cell recording (Fig.2 A). In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2 A, during 17 min of recording, bTREK-1 amplitude doubled from its initial value of ∼1250 pA. This spontaneous time-dependent increase in the amplitude of bTREK-1 current was observed in nearly all of the more than 75 cells tested. It occurred at pipette solution pHs ranging from 6.4 to 7.3 and was independent of ATP concentrations between 0.1 and 5.0 mm. Further, this phenomenon was not specific to HEK-293 cells. The growth of bTREK-1 current with time was also observed in transfected CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Although the time-dependent growth of IAC in whole cell recordings has been established as a hallmark of this current in AZF cells (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), this phenomenon has not been reported previously for other native or cloned TREK-1 channels. Similar to IAC, when bTREK-1 is activated from a holding potential of −80 mV to various test potentials, this current consists of a large instantaneous component and a smaller time-dependent component that could be fit with a single exponential (Fig. 2, A (left) and B). In physiological saline, bTREK-1 is outwardly rectifying (Fig.2 B). If native IAC and cloned bTREK-1 K+ channels are identical then they should display a similar pharmacological profile. The pharmacology of 2P/4TMS K+ channels, including TREK-1, is currently being investigated. Murine and human TREK-1 channels are relatively insensitive to standard organic K+ channel antagonists, including TEA and 4-AP (23Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 24Meadows H.J. Benham C.D. Cairns W. Gloger I. Jennings C. Medhurst A.D. Murdock P. Chapman C.G. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). High concentrations of these two drugs are also required to inhibit native IAC channels (10Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 266-275PubMed Google Scholar). However, IAC channels are inhibited potently by several organic Ca2+ antagonists, including diphenylbutylpiperidines (DPBPs) and mibefradil (10Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 266-275PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the DPBP penfluridol and mibefradil also potently inhibit cloned bTREK-1 channels expressed in mammalian cell lines. DPBPs such as penfluridol inhibit IACK+ channels with IC50 values of ∼0.2–0.4 μm (10Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 266-275PubMed Google Scholar). Penfluridol inhibited bTREK-1 expressed in HEK-293 cells with an IC50 of 0.35 μm (Fig.3 A and C). Inhibition of bTREK-1 by penfluridol was independent of voltage at test potentials of −40 to +40 mV (Fig. 3 B). bTREK-1 was also inhibited by a second DPBP, pimozide (data not shown). Mibefradil inhibits IAC K+ channels with an IC50 of 0.5 μm (11Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This drug also inhibited cloned bTREK-1 channels with similar potency (Fig.4 A). At concentrations of 0.5 and 2.5 μm, mibefradil inhibited bTREK-1 by 52 ± 15% (n = 4) and 81 ± 8.3% (n = 9), respectively. Other agents including La3+ and glibenclamide inhibited bTRE"
https://openalex.org/W2059354304,"In mammals cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a universal calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores, is generated from NAD+ at the outer cell surface by the multifunctional ectoenzyme CD38 and by related ADP-ribosyl cyclases. Recently, influx of extracellular cADPR has been observed in 3T3 murine fibroblasts, where it elicits Ca2+-mediated enhancement of proliferation. Here we addressed the nature and the properties of cADPR influx into CD38− 3T3 cells, which showed pleiotropic mechanisms of both equilibrative and concentrative transport. Based on selective inhibitors or experimental conditions (e.g.abrogation of Na+-dependent active symport processes and transient transfection experiments) and on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of transcripts in 3T3 fibroblasts and comparatively in HeLa cells, we identified cADPR-transporting activities with specific nucleoside transporters (NT), both equilibrative (ENT2) and concentrative (CNT2 and a nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-inhibitable NT). A reciprocal inhibition relationship was observed between inosine and cADPR fluxes across these NT species. Concentrative (but not equilibrative) transport of nanomolar extracellular cADPR took place in CD38− 3T3 cells co-cultured for 48 h in transwells on feeders of CD38-transfected, cADPR-generating 3T3 fibroblasts.

Ther. 2001; 90: 283-296Google Scholar). During phylogenesis, the physiological role of cADPR has evolved in parallel with the increasing complexity of the biological systems where it is present: from cell cycle regulator in Euglena gracilis (6Masuda W. Takenaka S. Inageda K. Nishima H. Takahashi K. Katada T. Tsuyama S. Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 104-106Google Scholar), to signal molecule in response to environmental stress in higher plants (7Wu Y. Kuzma J. Marechal E. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Foster R. Chua N.H. Science. 1997; 278: 2126-2130Google Scholar) and in Porifera (8Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In mammals, cADPR is involved in a number of Ca2+-dependent cell- and tissue-specific functions, including proliferation, contraction, and secretion (1Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 199-257Google Scholar, 3Lee H.C. Physiol.

Biol. 2001; 1: 11-21Google Scholar).In several mammalian cells and tissue microenvironments, cADPR and its metabolic precursor NAD+ have recently been demonstrated to undergo a variable though potentially intense transmembrane trafficking (13De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002Google Scholar). By virtue of these subcellular and intercellular movements, cADPR can access its ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+stores/channels despite generation of this cyclic nucleotide by ADP-ribosyl cyclases at sites that are topologically opposite to the stores (13De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002Google Scholar, 14De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Usai C. Zocchi E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 79-98Google Scholar). The most represented member of these cyclases in mammalian cells is CD38 (15Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815Google Scholar), a type II glycoprotein involved in several transduction pathways (16Mehta K. Umar S. Malavasi F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1408-1417Google Scholar) and a multifunctional ectoenzyme that synthesizes cADPR from NAD+ and also hydrolyzes cADPR to ADP-ribose (17States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Google Scholar, 18Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Google Scholar). An important additional activity of CD38 is synthesis of the potent calcium mobilizer NAADP+ from NADP+ and nicotinic acid (18Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Google Scholar, 19Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Google Scholar).Availability of intracellular NAD+ to the ectocellular active site of CD38 is made possible by its controlled release from cells across an equilibrative transport system, represented by hexameric hemichannels of the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (Cx43) (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Google Scholar). Subsequent cADPR generation at the outer cell surface can be steadily followed by its influx into CD38+ cells because of the peculiar property of transmembrane oligomeric CD38 to couple cADPR synthesis to its active translocation across the cell membrane to reach the Ca2+ stores in the intracellular environment (21Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Usai C. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1507-1520Google Scholar). Such autocrine cross-talk between NAD+-releasing Cx43 hemichannels and CD38 has been demonstrated to finely up-regulate the [Ca2+]i levels in 3T3 murine fibroblasts (22Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Zocchi E. Contini P. Bisso A. Usai C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48300-48308Google Scholar).However, the peculiar localization and the properties of the catalytic site of CD38 suggest that a significant fraction of ectocellularly produced cADPR might escape transport across CD38 and thus be present in the extracellular environment, especially in close proximity of CD38+ cells. This assumption was strongly supported by the finding of 40–60 nm concentrations of NAD+ in human blood plasma 2T. F. Walseth, personal communication.2T. F. Walseth, personal communication. and by the recent demonstration that nanomolar concentrations of cADPR are consistently detectable in the medium of heterologous transwell co-cultures of CD38+/CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts (23Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Google Scholar). Both data raised the question whether extracellular cADPR can permeate across the plasma membrane of cADPR-responsive cells through mechanisms (either diffusion or transport) independent of those featured by CD38 as a catalytically active transporter of cADPR itself (21Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Usai C. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1507-1520Google Scholar). Recently, such CD38-unrelated transport system was reported to be active in native, constitutively CD38−, 3T3 fibroblasts. This process proved to account for the increased [Ca2+]i levels and consequently for the enhanced proliferation of CD38− cells when these are grown on cADPR-generating CD38+ cell feeders (23Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Google Scholar). A role for the CD38-independent cADPR transport system can be retrospectively extended to explain the Ca2+-related functional responses elicited by extracellular cADPR in a number of cell types: murine B lymphocytes (24Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Google Scholar), rat cerebellar granule cells (25De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. Pestarino M. Usai C. Marchetti C. Fedele E. Fontana G. Raiteri M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 665-672Google Scholar), smooth myocytes in intact trachea fragments (26Franco L. Bruzzone S. Song P.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Google Scholar).These facts prompted us to start a study aiming to elucidate the properties and the nature of the transport system(s) whereby several cells can respond to extracellularly generated cADPR. The results reported here identify specific equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters (NT) responsible for cADPR translocation: these NT are widely though variably expressed in mammalian cells (29Wang J.

Accordingly, a functional link is established between nucleosides and cADPR, which may bear novel and unexpected consequences on the control of Ca2+-related cell processes and on possible therapeutic strategies to control them.DISCUSSIONInflux of extracellular cADPR into 3T3 murine fibroblasts occurs both after incubation of intact cells with the cyclic nucleotide and following their co-culture with cADPR-producing, ectocyclase-expressing feeder layers (23Franco L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Google Scholar).The results obtained in this study demonstrated that both equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters are responsible for this influx, which had been previously described at a phenomenologic level (23Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Google Scholar). Therefore, rather unexpectedly, some of these transmembrane proteins proved to behave as promiscuous transporters beyond the current concept of broad acceptance of both pyrimidine and purine nucleosides, to include also the cyclic nucleotide cADPR. The quite compact structure of cADPR, as revealed by x-ray crystallography (52Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Google Scholar), might be responsible for such behavior.The use of two cell types, 3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells, that exhibit different nucleoside transport systems, helped discriminate among the cADPR-translocating NT forms. Equilibrative uptake of cADPR occurs through ENT2, whereas ENT1 is not involved. Na+/cADPR symport activities have been detected in 3T3 fibroblasts, but not in HeLa cells. The almost complete inhibition afforded by uridine, guanosine, and inosine identified these activities with nucleoside transport systems. The largest part of Na+-dependent cADPR uptake is susceptible to inhibition by low concentrations of NBMPR (affording 75% inhibition), a property shared with cs and csg (47Paterson A.R.P. Gati W.P. Vijayalakshmi D. Cass C.E. Mant J.J. Young J.D. Belch A.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 14Google Scholar, 48Flanagan S.A. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18026-18032Google Scholar, 49Soler C. Felipe A. Mata J.F. Casado F.J. Celada A. Pastor-Anglada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26939-26945Google Scholar). Whether this NBMPR-sensitive Na+/cADPR symport system is identifiable with either cs or csg is still unknown, however. The residual concentrative transport activity (25%) could be featured by CNT2, which is expressed in 3T3 cells and is not sensitive to NBMPR. This low level might explain the variability of cADPR influx observed in co-cultures where the CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts were pretreated with CNT2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (see “Results”). Indeed, transient transfection experiments on COS-7 cells demonstrated that CNT2 has intrinsic cADPR-transporting activity (Fig. 9). Whether additional concentrative Na+/cADPR symport systems exist, as reported earlier for Na+/nucleoside transport in the related COS-1 cell line (41Patel D.H. Crawford C.R. Naeve C.W. Belt J.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 51-58Google Scholar), requires further investigations, aimed also to establish whether they are identifiable with, or unrelated to, professional nucleoside transporters.As widely recognized for NT species, also unequivocal identification and characterization of concentrative cADPR transporters seems to be a difficult task because of the following reasons: (i) co-expression of multiple equilibrative and concentrative transporters in the same cell type and their possible distinctive regulation, as that afforded by cytokines on murine macrophages (40Soler C. Garcı̀a-Manteiga J. Valdés R. Xaus J. Comalada M. Casado F.X. Pastor-Anglada M. Celada A. Felipe A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1979-1988Google Scholar); (ii) intrinsic variability of expression of NT; (iii) possible interferences between influx and efflux of permeating solutes in the presence of selective inhibitors (53Crawford C.R. Ng C.Y. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13730-13734Google Scholar): a relevant example is the apparently low extent of inhibition of cADPR influx into 3T3 cells by thymidine (Fig. 2), which might in fact be due to blockade of cADPR release from the cells via ENT2 while cADPR is actively pumped into the same cells by CNT forms; and (iv) lack of availability of related transporting proteins, as those corresponding to csg and cs NT (47Paterson A.R.P. Gati W.P. Vijayalakshmi D. Cass C.E. Mant J.J. Young J.D. Belch A.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 14Google Scholar, 48Flanagan S.A. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26939-26945Google Scholar), this hampering their localization in specific cells and tissues.Despite these limitations, the identification in the plasma membrane of 3T3 fibroblasts of pleiotropic cADPR-translocating NT opens new perspectives for elucidating the mechanisms of regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis in cADPR responsive cells. Our findings cast serious doubts on the possibility of a similar role being played by cADPR-transporting ENT2 (Table III), although extracellular cADPR might reach, in specific districts and under particular conditions (e.g. extensive cell death) levels high enough to determine its equilibrative uptake by neighboring cells. On the contrary, the NT responsible for concentrative cADPR influx proved in the heterologous co-cultures of CD38+/CD38−3T3 fibroblasts to actively accumulate cADPR into the CD38− cells against largely unfavorable concentration gradients. In this experimental system, the eventual, remarkably high gradient between intracellular (almost micromolar) and extracellular (nanomolar) concentrations of cADPR, despite presence of ENT2-mediated equilibrative activity which could dissipate the gradient itself, might be accounted for by progressive sequestration of intracellular cADPR by specific binding proteins, notably by its receptors on the ryanodine stores/channels (54Noguchi N.

Indeed, the balance between kinetics of cADPR generation by CD38+ cells and of its concentrative influx into the cADPR-responsive CD38− cells proved to be functionally adequate to elicit Ca2+-mediated responses in the co-culture conditions (23Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Google Scholar, 28Zocchi E. Podestà M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Google Scholar). From a more general standpoint, the principle of concentrative uptake of extracellular cADPR, possibly at sites distant from those of its generation, is reminiscent of endocrine processes in which hormones, still at very low concentrations, regulate a number of functions in target cells quite far from the endocrine tissues that release them in the bloodstream. Interestingly, the cADPR concentration in human plasma was estimated to be around 1 nm (not shown).The concentrative nature of at least two components of cADPR uptake (i.e. CNT2 and the NBMPR-sensitive system identified in 3T3 fibroblasts) bears relevance to “in vivo” events occurring in several tissue microenvironments including intact trachea (26Franco L. Bruzzone S. Song P. Guida L. Zocchi E. Walseth T.F. Crimi E. Usai C. De Flora A. Brusasco V. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L98-L106Google Scholar), synapses (60Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U. De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1-13Google Scholar), and bone marrow (28Zocchi E. Podestà M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Google Scholar), where Ca2+-related cell functions are elicited by protracted generation of extracellular cADPR (13De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002Google Scholar, 14De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Usai C. Zocchi E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 79-98Google Scholar). The molecular characterization of concentrative cADPR transporter(s) should allow us to elucidate to what extent and through which mechanisms a site-targeted and constant supply of extracellularly generated cADPR can influence Ca2+-related responses. The molecular and functional interactions between NAD+-releasing Cx43 hemichannels and either CD38 or concentrative Na+/cADPR symport systems require challenging “in situ ” studies, whose results would be a biochemical paradigm for many physiological and pharmacological processes involved in the regulation of [Ca2+]i levels.Finally, the present results raise the possibility that several ectoenzymes involved in nucleotide and nucleoside metabolism at the outer surface of different cells have a role, although indirect, in the regulation of [Ca2+]i levels. The site-specific, ectocellular synthesis of a number of nucleosides potentially inhibiting influx of extracellular cADPR into cADPR-responsive cells seems to support this contention. Topological proximity of these ectoenzymes, including CD38, and of the selective transporters of NAD+ and cADPR, as well as possible preferential interactions thereof within the plasma membrane, might confer high efficiency to the related regulatory mechanisms. In any case, the cADPR transporters in the plasma membrane, and especially the concentrative ones, seem to be promising targets for new therapeutic strategies designed to control calcium-related dysfunctions in cADPR-responsive cells and tissues.

Ther. 2001; 90: 283-296Google Scholar). During phylogenesis, the physiological role of cADPR has evolved in parallel with the increasing complexity of the biological systems where it is present: from cell cycle regulator in Euglena gracilis (6Masuda W. Takenaka S. Inageda K. Nishima H. Takahashi K. Katada T. Tsuyama S. Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 104-106Google Scholar), to signal molecule in response to environmental stress in higher plants (7Wu Y. Kuzma J. Marechal E. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Foster R. Chua N.H. Science. 1997; 278: 2126-2130Google Scholar) and in Porifera (8Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In mammals, cADPR is involved in a number of Ca2+-dependent cell- and tissue-specific functions, including proliferation, contraction, and secretion (1Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 199-257Google Scholar, 3Lee H.C. Physiol.

In several mammalian cells and tissue microenvironments, cADPR and its metabolic precursor NAD+ have recently been demonstrated to undergo a variable though potentially intense transmembrane trafficking (13De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002Google Scholar). By virtue of these subcellular and intercellular movements, cADPR can access its ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+stores/channels despite generation of this cyclic nucleotide by ADP-ribosyl cyclases at sites that are topologically opposite to the stores (13De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002Google Scholar, 14De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Usai C. Zocchi E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 79-98Google Scholar). The most represented member of these cyclases in mammalian cells is CD38 (15Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815Google Scholar), a type II glycoprotein involved in several transduction pathways (16Mehta K. Umar S. Malavasi F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1408-1417Google Scholar) and a multifunctional ectoenzyme that synthesizes cADPR from NAD+ and also hydrolyzes cADPR to ADP-ribose (17States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Google Scholar, 18Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Google Scholar). An important additional activity of CD38 is synthesis of the potent calcium mobilizer NAADP+ from NADP+ and nicotinic acid (18Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Google Scholar, 19Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Google Scholar). Availability of intracellular NAD+ to the ectocellular active site of CD38 is made possible by its controlled release from cells across an equilibrative transport system, represented by hexameric hemichannels of the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (Cx43) (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Google Scholar). Subsequent cADPR generation at the outer cell surface can be steadily followed by its influx into CD38+ cells because of the peculiar property of transmembrane oligomeric CD38 to couple cADPR synthesis to its active translocation across the cell membrane to reach the Ca2+ stores in the intracellular environment (21Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Usai C. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1507-1520Google Scholar). Such autocrine cross-talk between NAD+-releasing Cx43 hemichannels and CD38 has been demonstrated to finely up-regulate the [Ca2+]i levels in 3T3 murine fibroblasts (22Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Zocchi E. Contini P. Bisso A. Usai C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48300-48308Google Scholar). However, the peculiar localization and the properties of the catalytic site of CD38 suggest that a significant fraction of ectocellularly produced cADPR might escape transport across CD38 and thus be present in the extracellular environment, especially in close proximity of CD38+ cells. This assumption was strongly supported by the finding of 40–60 nm concentrations of NAD+ in human blood plasma 2T. F. Walseth, personal communication.2T. F. Walseth, personal communication. and by the recent demonstration that nanomolar concentrations of cADPR are consistently detectable in the medium of heterologous transwell co-cultures of CD"
https://openalex.org/W2001757458,"Telomerase activity is closely correlated with cellular proliferative activity in human tissues. Human cells with high proliferative potential, such as tumor cells or stem cells, exhibit telomerase activity, whereas most normal human somatic cells do not. Telomerase activity is tightly regulated by the expression of its catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Through an expression cloning approach, we identified E2F-1 as a repressor of the hTERT gene in human tumor cells. Ectopic expression of E2F-1 repressed hTERT promoter activity by inhibiting Sp1 activation of the hTERT promoter. In contrast to the repressor function of E2F-1 in human tumor cells, we demonstrated that E2F-1 is an activator of the hTERT gene in normal human somatic cells. Ectopically expressed E2F-1 activated the hTERT promoter through a noncanonical DNA binding site. E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 (but not E2F-4 and E2F-5) repressed hTERT promoter activity in human tumor cells, whereas they activated it in normal somatic cells. These contrasting effects of E2F transcription factors on the hTERT promoter could underlie the paradoxical biological activities of E2F, which can both promote and inhibit cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053892103,"CD99, a unique integral membrane protein present on the surface of all human T cells, has previously been shown to regulate cell function and fate. In peripheral T cells, it triggers immediate activation of alpha4b1 integrin and cell arrest on inflamed vascular endothelium, whereas it mediates an apoptotic signal in double-positive thymocytes undergoing the selection process. Two isoforms of CD99 exist, a long form corresponding to the full-length protein and a short form harboring a deletion in the intracytoplasmic segment. Here, we show that while peripheral T cells display exclusive expression of the long form, double-positive thymocytes express both isoforms. Moreover, differential expression of these two CD99 molecules can lead to distinct functional outcomes. Expression of the long form in a CD99-deficient Jurkat T cell line is sufficient to promote CD99-induced cell adhesion, whereas coexpression of the two isoforms is required to trigger T-cell death. When coexpressed, the two proteins form covalent heterodimers, which locate within glycosphingolipidic rafts and induce sphingomyelin degradation. Cholesterol depletion experiments show that this localization is required for the induction of apoptosis. Thus, the surface expression pattern of CD99 isoforms determines T-cell functional outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2063403336,"Clinical observations in patients with peroxisomal disorders and studies employing corresponding mouse models have shown that supraphysiological concentrations of dietary branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are associated with a high level of toxicity, which is poorly understood at present.

Under the conditions used, the apoptosis-promoting effect of BCFAs was neither shared by saturated or unsaturated straight chain fatty acids nor by artificial peroxisome proliferators, which, like phytanic and pristanic acid, have been shown to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). We could demonstrate, however, that BCFA induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) activation and secretion, which is an obligatory step required for induction of apoptosis by BCFAs. Furthermore, incubation of VSMCs with BCFA increased inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein concentrations markedly within 2 h of treatment. Correspondingly, apoptosis was significantly reduced when the cells were co-treated with the competitive NOS inhibitors monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate and aminoguanidine.

In humans, PHH deficiency is associated with neurological abnormalities, episodes of weight loss, and sudden cardiac death (1Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.G. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). Secondly, MFP-2 deficiency, is associated with accumulation of phytanic acid along with pristanic acid and bile acid precursors as a result of a block in the β-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids and bile acid precursors at the level of the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase/2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction (13van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E. Ijlst L. Vreken P. de Klerk J.B. Adamski J. Lemonde H. Clayton P.T. Cuebas D.A. Wanders R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2128-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Compared with Refsum disease, MFP-2 deficiency follows a much more severe clinical course, leading to neonatal death due to functional impairment of multiple tissues and cell types. Finally, we have constructed a null mouse model for SCP2/SCPx deficiency lacking the peroxisomal thiolase (SCPx or pThiol2) required for the ketolytic cleavage step in peroxisomal β-oxidation of BCFA and bile acid precursors. Although the condition was mild in the absence of BCFA from the diet, dietary uptake of only moderate amounts of BCFA, which led to excessive storage of phytanic acid along with pristanic acid, were lethal for the SCP2/SCPx-null mice, whereas these diets did not affect genetically normal animals (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W. Wanders R.J. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These data led to the assumption that accumulation of pristanic acid, either alone or in combination with phytanic acid, may have been responsible for the observed toxicity of BCFA-containing diets in the MFP-2-deficient patients and the SCP2/SCPx-null mice. In the present study, we therefore investigated potentially toxic effects of phytanic and pristanic acid in vitro in VSMCs, which express PPARα and RXR. We could demonstrate that treatment of VSMCs with relatively moderate concentrations of phytanic and/or pristanic acid can induce apoptosis, which, to our surprise, was not related to RXR/PPAR superstimulation but to activation of a so far unknown signaling pathway leading to activation of autocrine secretion of TNFα along with a very significant induction of iNOS gene expression by phytanic and pristanic acid.

Aminohydroxyguanidine was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany), Wy 14.643 was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), fetal calf serum from ICN Biomedicals (Eschwege, Germany), and pristanic acid was obtained from H. J. Tenbrink (University of Amsterdam, NL). Rat VSMCs, a gift from Dr. M. Tepel (Herne, Germany), were isolated from thoracic aortas of male Wistar rats by the method of Franks et al. (15Franks D.J.

VSMCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with antibiotic/antimycotic supplement (Sigma) and passaged with 1× trypsin/EDTA solution (human and porcine VSMCs) or 10× trypsin/EDTA solution (Sigma) in the case of rat VSMCs. Cells at passages 4–15 were used for the experiments. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were a gift from Dr. A. Skaletz-Rorowski (Münster, Germany) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor (5 μg/liter), fibroblast growth factor (0.5 μg/liter), hydrocortisone (500 μg/liter), and endothelial growth supplement (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany). Human monocyte-derived macrophages were a gift from P. Cullen (Münster, Germany) and cultured with RPMI 1640 containing 10% of human serum. For all incubation experiments, the indicated concentrations of the ligand were dissolved in Me2SO at a final concentration of 1%, and the serum concentration was reduced to 1% as described in Ref. 17Champagne M.J.

If not stated otherwise, data are expressed as mean ± S.D. obtained from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate and analyzed with the Student's t test. Differences withp < 0.05 were considered significant. Subconfluent VSMCs were stimulated with agonists for various time intervals, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were collected by trypsinization followed by centrifugation. For the determination of annexin V binding, 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter Hepes pH 7.2, and 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2 and annexin V-FITC (Bender Med-Systems Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) according to the supplier's instructions. The cell suspension was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to flow cytometry. For the determination of the cell membrane permeability, 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with YO-PRO (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at a final concentration of 0.1 μmol/liter as described in Ref. 18Idziorek T.

All flow cytometric measurements were performed on a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer equipped with a 15 milliwatt argon ion laser (Coulter Corporation, Hialeah, FL) (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; fluorescence emission, 525 nm; data rate, ∼300 cells/s). Cells were harvested in a buffer consisting of 25 mmol/liter Hepes pH 7.2, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, supplemented with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and lysed by 4 freeze/thaw cycles. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations and caspase-3 activities were determined in the supernatant according to the protocol of the CaspACE™ Fluorimetric Assay System (Promega). Data are expressed as picomole of the fluorescent substrate liberated per minute and microgram of protein. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from VSMCs incubated for different time periods with 100 μmphytanic or pristanic acid alone or in the presence of 1 ng/ml TNFα antibody or 3 ng/ml TGFβ1, respectively. Quantitation of the iNOS mRNA was done by exploiting the 5′ nuclease activity of theTaqDNA polymerase to cleave a target gene specific TaqMan probe during RT-PCR. All TaqMan probes contained a 6-carboxy-fluorescein moiety as reporter dye at the 5′-end and a carboxytetramethyl rhodamine moiety as quencher dye at the 3′-end of the probe. Amplifications and sequence detections were carried out on an ABI PRISM 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Primers and TaqMan probes were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Forward and reverse PCR primers were used at a final concentration of 300 nm, TaqMan probes at a final concentration of 150 nm. Relative expression of the iNOS mRNA were evaluated relative to the expression of the β-actin mRNA in the same sample. All TaqMan experiments were performed using the Universal Master Mix system from PE Applied Biosystems. Cycling parameters were: 1 min 50 °C, 1 min 95 °C, 1 min 60 °C. To prevent amplification of target sequences from contaminating genomic DNA, all RNA samples were subjected to digestion with RNase-free DNase I prior to the RT-PCR step. Subconfluent VSMCs were treated with 100 μm phytanic or pristanic acid alone or in combination with 3 ng/ml TGFβ1 or 1 ng/ml TNFα antibody for various time intervals. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 0,5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate supplemented with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture. Thereafter, the cells were lysed by four freeze/thaw cycles and centrifuged in an Eppendorf benchtop centrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed. 50 μg of supernatant protein were then subjected to Western blotting, performed according to standard procedures. The blots were developed with a 1:4000 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for murine iNOS purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Subconfluent rat VSMCs were grown in standard 6-well dishes and co-transfected with 0.5 μg/well of a pCAT3 vector (Promega) containing the NFκB response element and the pCMV-βgal vector together with 1.5 μl per well of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). 20 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and 100 μm phytanic or pristanic acid for various time intervals. β-galactosidase and CAT activities were measured with an ELISA detection kit supplied by Roche Diagnostics. Subconfluent rat VSMCs were treated with 100 μm phytanic or pristanic acid for the indicated time intervals, and the TNFα concentration was determined in the culture medium employing a commercially available ELISA kit for rat TNFα (Biozol, Eching, Germany). The lower detection limit of the assay was ∼17 pg/ml. For each experiment, a standard curve was obtained by serial dilutions of a rat TNFα stock solution to yield 0–500 pg/ml. To evaluate the effect of phytanic acid on exponentially growing rat VSMCs, 70% confluent cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of phytanic acid in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum as a survival factor. After 4 h of incubation in the presence of 100 μm phytanic acid, cells rounded, shrunk, and lost contact to their neighbors (Fig. 1). As these observations were suggestive of cell death, we next stained VSMCs treated with phytanic acid with YO-PRO in order to detect plasma membrane permeability. As shown in Fig.2 A, the fraction of YO-PRO-positive cells increased at 6 h of incubation with 100 μm phytanic acid compared with the Me2SO-treated control. Another well characterized marker for the detection of apoptotic and/or necrotic cells consists of annexin V binding (19Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4626) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, annexin V binding increased upon incubation with the fatty acid. Differentiation of apoptosis from necrosis was performed by three means. (i) Simultaneous incubation with propidium iodide and fluorescently labeled annexin V showed that >90% of the cells were annexin V-positive/propidium iodide-negative. (ii) We induced necrotic cell death with a 5-min incubation at 42 °C and compared the propidium iodide staining of the necrotic cells with that of the BCFA-treated cells by flow cytometry. Based on the fluorescence intensity per cell, we identified a fraction of only 5.6% of necrotic cells after 6 h of treatment with 100 μm phytanic acid (control: 4.0%) (data not shown). (iii) We measured the activity of caspase-3, which is a major effector during the execution phase of apoptosis (20Wang H. Keiser J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1132-H1140PubMed Google Scholar). We found that phytanic acid led to a steep time and dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2 C). The maximum effect was observed at 5 h at a concentration of 100 μm of the fatty acid. To characterize the species specificity of phytanic acid induced apoptosis, we next incubated VSMCs from porcine and human origin with 100 μm of this fatty acid. As is evident from Fig. 3, the effect of phytanic acid was not species-specific, although human cells were somewhat less susceptible in comparison to rat and porcine ones. Neither human umbilical vein endothelial cells nor human monocyte-derived macrophages could be forced to programmed cell death by a 6-h incubation with 100 μm phytanic acid (data not shown).Figure 2Phytanic acid-induced apoptosis of rat VSMCs.

C, VSMCs were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of phytanic acid or Me2SO.

We incubated rat VSMCs with palmitic acid, nervonic acid or linoleic acid, as well as with the artificial activators bezafibrate and Wy 14,643. None of these compounds were able to induce morphological changes, which were indicative for apoptosis (not shown). They also did not increase caspase-3 activity when administered to the cells for 6 h at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig.4 A) or overnight at concentrations up to 250 μm (data not shown). In vivo, phytanic acid is degraded via an α-oxidation step, yielding pristanic acid, before entering the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle (21Verhoeven N.M. Wanders R.J. Poll-The B.T. Saudubray J.M. Jakobs C. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 697-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pristanic acid activates PPARα more effectively than phytanic acid but it does not activate RXR (4Zomer A.W. van Der Burg B. Jansen G.A. Wanders R.J. Poll-The B.T. van Der Saag P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1801-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kitareewan S. Burka L.T. Tomer K.B. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Stevens R.D. Forman B.M. Mais D.E. Heyman R.A. McMorris T. Weinberger C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of pristanic acid on VSMC apoptosis. We found that pristanic acid at a concentration of 100 μm for 6 h led to a significant activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 4 A). The time course of caspase-3 activation differed between the two BCFA. At 100 μm, maximal caspase-3 activity was reached already between 2 and 3 h compared with 5 h for phytanic acid (Fig.4 B). To elucidate the mechanism of phytanic- and pristanic acid-induced apoptosis we characterized key regulators of the process. Since induction of apoptosis in VSMCs can be mediated by the production of NO (22Nishio E. Fukushima K. Shiozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35), we reasoned that the BCFA effect might be due to excessive production of this compound. Since NO is produced via nitric-oxide synthases, we co-incubated VSMCs with phytanic or pristanic acid and different NOS inhibitors to test this hypothesis. We could demonstrate that the competitive inhibitor of all three NOS isoforms, monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate (l-NMMA, 250 μm), as well as addition of the specific inducible NOS inhibitor, aminohydroxyguanodine (AHG, 200 μm), prevent BCFA induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). Our hypothesis that BCFA-induced apoptosis is mediated by NO was furthermore consistent with the observation that VSMCs treated simultaneously with phytanic acid and TGFβ1 were partially protected from programmed cell death (Fig. 5). It is known that TGFβ1 destabilizes iNOS mRNA, which decreases the amount of NO production (23Finder J. Stark Jr., W.W. Nakayama D.K. Geller D. Wasserloos K. Pitt B.R. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L862-L867PubMed Google Scholar). As regulation of NO release from iNOS-expressing cells occurs predominantly at the DNA transcription and/or protein stability level we next analyzed the expression pattern of iNOS by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cultured VSMCs were treated for different time intervals with 100 μm phytanic acid alone or in combination with 3 ng/ml of TGFβ1 (Fig.6). We could demonstrate that the amount of iNOS mRNA and protein markedly increased 2 h after onset of incubation and increased further with the duration of treatment with phytanic acid (Fig. 6, A and B). Co-incubation with TGFβ1 inhibited the increase in iNOS expression significantly at the level of mRNA (Fig. 6 A) and also of iNOS protein (Fig. 6 B). Since the promotor region of the iNOS gene includes several binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NFκB), we next measured NFκB activity using a transactivation assay. Subconfluent VSMCs were transfected with a plasmid containing a CAT reporter gene under the control of the NFκB responsive element as well as with a β-gal normalization vector. 20 h after transfection cells were incubated with 100 μm phytanic acid for different time periods and CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured. NFκB was activated shortly (between 15 and 30 min) after addition of phytanic acid, and its activity peaked at 60 min of incubation (Fig.7 A). TNFα, a membrane-bound cytokine that is cleaved by a specific membrane metalloprotease upon activation, is a well known activator of iNOS. Therefore, we next analyzed whether this cytokine may be involved as upstream factor in phytanic acid-induced apoptosis. To study the involvement of TNFα, we first inhibited the mature soluble form of TNFα in the medium by incubating VSMCs simultaneously with 100 μm phytanic acid and a TNFα neutralizing antibody. As shown in Fig. 7 A, blocking TNFα with the antibody prevented the phytanic acid-mediated activation of the NFκB reporter gene construct almost completely. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic potential of phytanic acid resulting in increased caspase-3 activation was also almost completely abolished in the presence of the TNFα antibody (Fig. 7 B), whereas incubation with a series of IgG fractions obtained from control sera had no effect (data not shown). To further corroborate this data we investigated whether the TNFα antibody was capable of preventing the intensive phytanic acid-induced expression of iNOS. VSMCs were treated with 100 μm phytanic acid in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml of the TNFα-antibody. As shown in Fig.8, A and B, the TNFα antibody reduced the level of iNOS protein, as detected in Western blots of cell extracts, and the steady state concentrations of the iNOS mRNA in comparison to VSMCs incubated with phytanic acid alone. To show the role of TNFα in a more direct manner, we next quantified the amount of functional TNFα in the medium. Subconfluent VSMCs were incubated with 100 μm phytanic acid for different time intervals between 30 min and 3 h. Subsequently, the concentration of mature TNFα was measured in the medium using a rat TNFα-specific ELISA. As shown in Fig. 8 C, the content of TNFα in the medium was significantly higher in those media obtained from cells that had been treated with phytanic acid compared with the non-treated controls. Since these data suggest that TNFα induction may be an upstream event involved in apoptosis induction by BCFA, we continued to investigate whether TNFα alone is sufficient of induce apoptosis in VSMCs. The cells were incubated in the presence of TNFα with or without cycloheximide for 8 h and caspase-3 activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 9, TNFα did not induce caspase-3 activation at concentrations of 20 or 40 ng/ml. In contrast, a moderate activation could be observed in the presence of TNFα and cycloheximide. However, the effect was distinctively smaller than obtained with phytanic or pristanic acid. In this study, we show that BCFA induced apoptosis in VSMCs and that they exerted their effect via TNFα secretion and iNOS up-regulation. This is the first time that a fatty acid has been reported to induce apoptosis in VSMCs in vitro. However, it is known that various straight-chain fatty acids, like palmitate and stearate, are able to induce apoptosis in other cell types, such as cardiac myocytes or pancreatic β cells (24Paumen M.B.

Acta. 2000; 1485: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our study, the pro-apoptotic effect was specific for isoprenoid BCFAs like phytanic and pristanic acid and was not mimicked by saturated or unsaturated straight chain fatty acids. To test whether albumin affected the apoptosis-promoting activity of BCFA, we also performed the assays with media supplemented with up to 30 mg/ml of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (which would be sufficient to bind ∼3 mm of fatty acid assuming a binding stoichiometry of 7:1). However, albumin neither inhibited the apoptosis promoting effect nor altered its specificity (data not shown). VSMCs of porcine and rat origin showed similar susceptibility toward BCFA-induced apoptosis whereas this effect was somewhat less pronounced in human VSMCs. Whether this difference was due to more rapid degradation of BCFA, the preponderance of other signaling pathways or to more efficient up-regulation of anti-apoptotic survival genes remains to be elucidated. Regarding the major cell types of the vascular wall, the pro-apoptotic effect of BCFA was specific for VSMCs as these fatty acids failed to cause programmed cell death in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages if subjected to the same conditions as were employed for VSMCs (data not shown). Our group and others (2Ellinghaus P. Wolfrum C. Assmann G. Spener F. Seedorf U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2766-2772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Wolfrum C.

PPARα was first identified in liver cells as an important regulator of fatty acid metabolism but is also expressed within cells of the vascular wall like endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages (6Inoue I.

It was shown that stimulation of PPARα with the hypolipidmic drug Wy 14,643 causes apoptosis in macrophages (8Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) whereas it suppresses the IL-1β-induced inflammatory response in human VSMCs (7Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate a pro-apoptotic effect of phytanic and pristanic acid, which is neither shared by the very potent artificial PPARα activator Wy 14,643 nor by several straight chain fatty acids, which have been shown to act as natural PPARα agonists. These findings correspond to results from the group of Staels who demonstrated that an incubation of human VSMCs with high concentrations of Wy 14,643 did not alter the viability of the cells (7Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Conclusively, activation of PPARα is most likely not responsible for the programmed cells death caused by BCFAs in VSMCs. Our study reveals some mechanistic insights into BCFA-induced apoptosis. We could demonstrate that apoptosis induced by BCFA depends on TNFα activation and secretion because a TNFα neutralizing antibody blocked apoptosis almost completely. In addition, we could show that BCFA induced a steep increase of TNFα concentrations in the medium of VSMCs shortly after incubation with BCFA. This implies that BCFA or one of their downstream metabolites stimulate the cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor form of TNFα, leading to release of the mature soluble form of the cytokine. In addition, our data support that BCFA, either directly or indirectly, trigger the secretion of TNFα in an autocrine manner, subsequently leading to programmed cell death. Consistent with previous reports (27Geng Y.J. Wu Q. Muszynski M. Hansson G.K. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we could show however, that TNFα alone is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in VSMCs. Thus, induction of apoptosis may require TNFα along with a combination of other metabolic changes or cytokines. So far, our attempts to identify the relevant factors that are affected by BCFA along with TNFα and thus may act in concert to induce apoptosis in VSMCs were however not successful. There are several pathways that are known that lead from TNFα binding to its receptor to programmed cell death. The most prominent is activation of caspase-8 subsequently resulting in activation of effector caspases mediating the key processes during programmed cell death (28Leong K.G. Karsan A. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 1303-1325PubMed Google Scholar). We could demonstrate that caspase-8 is not involved in BCFA-induced apoptosis as no increase of activity of this enzyme could be detected after incubating VSMCs with these fatty acids for various time periods (data not shown). In addition to the signaling pathway leading to caspase-8 activation, TNFα regulates gene expression via activation of several transcription factors. One example for this is the induction of iNOS gene expression as a consequence of cytokine treatment in VSMCs (29Nakayama I. Kawahara Y. Tsuda T. Okuda M. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11628-11633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this concept, we could demonstrate that iNOS mRNA as well as protein levels are more than 100-fold up-regulated after incubation of VSMCs with BCFA. The induction of iNOS was obliterated when TNFα secretion was blocked by adding a TNFα-specific antibody to the cells. Furthermore, we were able to show that stimulation of iNOS expression is a necessary step during BCFA-induced cell death as different inhibitors of NOS abolished the pro-apoptotic effect of these fatty acids. Also the effects of TGFβ1, previously shown to destabilize iNOS mRNA (30Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.C. Hsieh C.M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-15600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are consistent with an important role of NO in VSMC apoptosis. Nishioet al. (22Nishio E. Fukushima K. Shiozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that incubation of VSMCs with various NO donors have the ability to induce apoptosis within this cell type (22Nishio E. Fukushima K. Shiozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). So far, it is not entirely clear, however, whether iNOS induction is sufficient to induce apoptosis in VSMCs. Because we could show directly that iNOS stimulation depends on TNFα secretion, one may speculate that the activation of the first is mediated via NFκB. It has been demonstrated by several groups that iNOS gene expression is tightly regulated by NFκB with several responsive elements being found in the promoter region of the iNOS gene. Accordingly, we observed a significant 2-fold activation of endogenous NFκB when VSMCs were incubated with BCFA. However, it is not clear at present whether a 2-fold up-regulation of the transcription factor may be sufficient to account for the observed more than a hundred-fold induction of iNOS. Moreover, it was demonstrated earlier that NFκB may not be the only transcription factor that can mediate the cytokine-induced activation of iNOS gene expression (31Spink J. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24417-24425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,32Zhang H. Teng X. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the conditions of our current in vitro study differ from the situation in the intact organism, we will be interested to study whether apoptosis may be responsible for some of the toxic effects that result from supraphysiological concentrations of BCFA under in vivo conditions. Serum concentrations of phytanic acid up to 1 mm are present in patients suffering from peroxisomal disorders like Zellweger syndrome or Refsum disease. In addition, other conditions are known which are associated with an accumulation of phytanic acid along with pristanic acid as a result of a block in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of BCFA-CoA."

In the current investigation, we examined the effects of ASA on COX and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathways and its impact on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) levels in rat liver cells. In Kupffer cells, the liver resident macrophages, ASA switched eicosanoid biosynthesis from prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4) formation. In hepatocytes, ASA significantly inhibited PPARalpha protein expression and CINC-1 secretion, effects that were also observed in hepatocytes exposed to the selective PPARalpha agonist Wy-14643. In contrast, treatment of hepatocytes with PGE2 in association with LTB4 had no significant effect on PPARalpha but stimulated CINC-1 release. Interestingly, the endogenous antiinflammatory eicosanoids LXA4 and ASA-triggered 15-epi-LXA4, in addition to inhibiting macrophage 5-LO activity to a similar extent as PGE2, significantly reduced PPARalpha and CINC-1 levels in hepatocytes. Taken together and because arachidonic acid-derived products, PPARalpha levels, and CINC-1 secretion are involved in the extent and duration of an inflammatory response, these findings provide additional molecular mechanisms for the pharmacological properties of ASA."
https://openalex.org/W2050684519,"Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), structurally related to focal adhesion kinase, has been shown to play a role in signaling cascades. Endothelial cells (ECs) under hemodynamic forces increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) that modulate signaling pathways and gene expression. In the present study, we found that bovine ECs subjected to cyclic strain rapidly induced phosphorylation of PYK2 and Src kinase. This strain-induced PYK2 and Src phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreating ECs with an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Similarly, ECs exposed to H2O2 increased both PYK2 and Src phosphorylation. An increased association of Src to PYK2 was observed in ECs after cyclic strain or H2O2 exposure. ECs treated with an inhibitor to Src (PPI) greatly reduced Src and PYK2 phosphorylation, indicating that Src mediated PYK2 activation. Whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (calphostin C) pretreatment was shown to inhibit strain-induced NADPH oxidase activity, ECs treated with either calphostin C or the inhibitor to NADPH oxidase (DPI) reduced strain-induced ROS levels and then greatly inhibited the Src and PYK2 activation. In contrast to the activation of PYK2 and Src with calcium ionophore (ionomycin), ECs treated with a Ca2+chelator inhibited both phosphorylation, indicating that PYK2 and Src activation requires Ca2+. ECs transfected with antisense to PKCα, but not antisense to PKCε, reduced cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activation. These data suggest that cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activity is mediated via Ca2+-dependent PKCα that increases NADPH oxidase activity to produce ROS crucial for Src and PYK2 activation. ECs under cyclic strain thus activate redox-sensitive PYK2 via Src and PKC, and this PYK2 activation may play a key role in the signaling responses in ECs under hemodynamic influence.

(also known as RAFTK, CAKβ), a protein-tyrosine kinase related to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is a recently identified non-receptor tyrosine kinase (1Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Google Scholar). Studies suggest that PYK2 acts as a common mediator of signaling by a number of stimuli including growth factors (2Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Google Scholar), lipids (3Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

PYK2 also serves as a cellular mechanism for convergence between integrins and signaling cascades (7Nakamura I. Lipfert L. Rodan G.A. Le T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Google Scholar, 8Litvak V. Tian D. Shaul Y.D. Lev S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32736-32746Google Scholar). PYK2 is activated by signals that increase intracellular Ca2+concentration (9Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T.M. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Google Scholar). Other intracellular signaling pathways including tyrosine kinase Src physically associates with PYK2 and activates PYK2 through phosphorylation (5Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K. Chiu E.S. Okigaki M. Cary L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Google Scholar). PYK2 was shown to act as one of the signaling mediators required for the G protein-coupled receptor to the MAPK pathway (10Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Google Scholar, 11Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Google Scholar, 12Shi C.S.

However, the downstream effects of PYK2 and how PYK2 plays a role in cellular responses have not been fully elucidated. PYK2 has been shown to trigger several signaling pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), or p38 MAPK (2Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Google Scholar, 10Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Google Scholar, 13Pandey P. Avraham S. Kumar S.

The adaptor protein Grb2/Sos complex has been shown to associate PYK2 to ERK activation, whereas the adaptor protein p130Cas and Crk link PYK2 to the JNK pathway (14Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PYK2 activation is redox-sensitive (15Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 761-765Google Scholar). How the intracellular redox status affects PYK2 activation and whether PYK2 plays a role in signaling mechanisms in ECs under oxidative stress have not been addressed.Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly under rhythmic distension because of pulsatile flow. This rhythmic distension-induced cyclic strain plays an important role in modulating endothelial gene expression. Studies including this group (16Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Google Scholar, 17Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31368-31375Google Scholar, 18Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Google Scholar) have shown that ECs under hemodynamic forces transmit mechanical forces into secondary messengers and subsequently gene alteration. Secondary messengers involved include the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium mobilization (19Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Google Scholar, 20Sandoval R. Malik A.B. Naqvi T. Mehta D. Tiruppathi C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L239-L247Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that the Ras/Raf1/ERK pathway is involved in cyclic strain-induced early growth factor-1 (Egr-1) expression in ECs (16Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Google Scholar). Our most recent study further showed that PKC isoforms α and ε are required for sustained ERK activation in ECs under cyclic strain (17Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31368-31375Google Scholar). In addition to ERK, JNK and p38 are also activated in ECs by cyclic strain (16Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Google Scholar, 21Azuma N. Duzgun S.A. Ikeda M. Kito H. Akasaka N. Sasajima T. Sumpio B.E. J. Vasc. Surg. 2000; 32: 789-794Google Scholar). Among the secondary messengers involved in cellular responses, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a pivotal role in various growth factor- or cytokine-induced cellular responses and gene expression (22Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Google Scholar, 23Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Google Scholar). We previously showed that intracellular ROS induced by hemodynamic forces including cyclic strain consequently stimulate the expression of various genes including Egr-1, c-Fos, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (16Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Google Scholar,24Hsieh H.J. Cheng C.C. Wu S.T. Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Wang D.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 156-162Google Scholar, 25Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Hsieh H.J. Shyy Y.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1-7Google Scholar, 26Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 125-130Google Scholar). However, the initial cellular responses, including the alteration of redox status induced by hemodynamic forces are complex and remain to be further defined. Since PYK2 is a non-receptor kinase related to FAK, and FAK is known to act as a signal transducer for mechanical forces (27Yano Y. Geibel J. Sumpio B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C635-C649Google Scholar, 28Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Google Scholar), this redox-sensitive PYK2 may play a role in endothelial response to mechanical forces. In the present study, we examined the role of PYK2 in ECs under cyclic strain and found that PYK2 is rapidly activated via Ca2+ and PKCα-dependent mechanisms. This PYK2 activation is redox-sensitive and is mediated via the tyrosine kinase Src. Our findings indicate that cyclic strain to ECs activates PKC-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase activity that is crucial for PYK2 activation via Src. This cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activation may play an important role in signaling cascade during endothelial responses to hemodynamic forces.DISCUSSIONECs subjected to cyclic strain increase intracellular ROS that are involved in the regulation of cellular responses and gene expression. The increased ROS modulate the signaling pathway of Ras/Raf/ERK in ECs by cyclic strain. Mechanical force-induced endothelial responses thus appear to be redox-sensitive (16Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Google Scholar, 26Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 125-130Google Scholar, 35Matsushita H. Lee K.H. Tsao P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81 Suppl. 36: 99-106Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is sensitive to redox changes in cyclic strain-treated ECs. This cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activation was inhibited by an antioxidant NAC pretreatment. This redox-sensitive PYK2 activation was also observed in ECs treated with H2O2. Our observation of this redox-sensitive PYK2 is consistent with the previous finding of PYK2 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (15Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 761-765Google Scholar). This redox-sensitive PYK2 activation by cyclic strain is PKC- and calcium-dependent. We showed earlier that PKCα and PKCε are involved in cyclic strain-induced ERK1/2 activation and gene expression (17Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31368-31375Google Scholar). PKCα is involved in the early response to cyclic strain caused by calcium influx immediately after the onset of cyclic strain. The majority of PKCα returned to the cytosolic fraction 6 h after continuous cyclic strain. The initial response of this PKC- and calcium-sensitive PYK2 activation is consistent with the pattern of PKCα activation after cyclic strain. The inhibition of PYK2 activation in ECs treated with antisense oligonucleotides to PKCα further confirms the role of PKCα in PYK2 activation. The participation of PKCα in PYK2 activation clearly supports the importance of specific PKC isozymes in cellular responses to mechanical forces. This study demonstrates that calcium-dependent PKCα contributes to the initial response of ECs to cyclic strain, and this PKCα activation is required for the activation of Src and PYK2. Due to the rapid response of PKCα and a redox-sensitive nature of this tyrosine phosphorylation to cyclic strain, the PKCα activation may not be sufficient to maintain the steady state level of tyrosine phosphorylation. The redox status altered by H2O2 after activation of NADPH oxidase appears to be required for the sustained activation of Src and PYK2 under cyclic strain.Shear stress that induced Src kinase activity in ECs was reported previously (36Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that cyclic strain activates Src kinase activity, a PP1-sensitive step, leading to an increase of PYK2 association and activation. This phenomenon is similar to the response of H2O2 treatment of ECs (Fig. 2). This Src kinase activity induced by cyclic strain, similar to PYK2 activation, is also a redox-sensitive step. This is consistent with earlier report that Src activation was sensitive to antioxidant treatment in angiotensin II-activated smooth muscle cells (37Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Becker P.L. Hilenski L. Halleran S. Alexander R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 489-495Google Scholar). Cyclic strain to ECs increases intracellular ROS with an alteration of redox status and results in gene induction (16Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Google Scholar, 26Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 125-130Google Scholar). The main source of ROS generation during cellular activation has not been well defined. However, NADPH oxidase has been reported as a major source of ROS in smooth muscle cells after angiotensin II stimulation (38Schieffer B. Luchtefeld M. Braun S. Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Drexler H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1195-1201Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase was suggested to be mainly responsible for ROS production in ECs under various stimulations including cyclic strain (35Matsushita H. Lee K.H. Tsao P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81 Suppl. 36: 99-106Google Scholar). In the present study, NADPH oxidase appears to be involved in cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activation because ECs pretreated with an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI, greatly reduced PYK2 activation. NADPH oxidase was well studied in neutrophils containing several components including Rac, a Rho family GTPase. Recent studies indicate that a gp91phox-containing NADPH oxidase is selectively expressed in ECs (31Gorlach A. Brandes R.P. Nguyen K. Amidi M. Dehghani F. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 26-32Google Scholar, 39Bayraktutan U. Blayney L. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1903-1911Google Scholar). The assembly of these components including Rac, is essential for NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide production in ECs (40Sohn H.Y. Keller M. Gloe T. Morawietz H. Rueckschloss U. Pohl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18745-18750Google Scholar). We earlier indicated that Rac-dependent NADPH oxidase contributed to cyclic strain-induced ROS production, and that ECs pretreated with DPI reduced this strain-induced ROS generation resulting in a decrease of MCP-1 expression (32Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Shyue S.K. Wang D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1941-1947Google Scholar). These results support the notion that cyclic strain-induced PYK2 is a redox-sensitive response via a NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism. This is also in agreement with a recent study indicating that ROS generation by cyclic strain is mediated via NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells (35Matsushita H. Lee K.H. Tsao P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81 Suppl. 36: 99-106Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase was shown to be activated by PKC via phosphorylation (41Dang P.M. Fontayne A. Hakim J. El Benna J. Perianin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1206-1213Google Scholar,42Regier D.S. Waite K.A. Wallin R. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36601-36608Google Scholar). PKCα is one among those PKC isoforms involved in the phosphorylation of p47phox, one of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase (43Fontayne A. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El-Benna J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7743-7750Google Scholar). In this study, ECs treated with a PKC inhibitor reduced their cyclic strain-induced NADPH oxidase activity, resulting in a decrease of PYK2 phosphorylation. We previously showed that cyclic strain to ECs increased the activity of PKC, mainly through the sequential activation of PKCα and PKCε (17Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31368-31375Google Scholar). Cyclic strain may increase the calcium influx that results in the activation of PKCα that then leads to NADPH oxidase activation. In the present study we also showed that H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Src and PYK2 was inhibited by calphostin C pretreatment, indicating that PKC is also important for the effects of ROS generated by NADPH oxidase. Although the mechanism of ROS effects involving PKC activation is not clear, H2O2 generated in the cells may activate PKC by tyrosine phosphorylation as previously demonstrated (44Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Google Scholar). PKCα is one of those PKC isoforms that were tyrosine phosphorylated by H2O2. A protein tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) was shown to phosphorylate PKC in the presence of H2O2 (45Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Google Scholar). Moreover, intracellularly produced H2O2 may exert its effect via the global inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase as previously indicted (46Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Google Scholar,47Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kwon J. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/53/pe1)Google Scholar). It is likely that a tyrosine kinase upstream of PKC is activated via the inhibition of phosphatase by H2O2. The inhibition of tyrosine protein phosphatases by H2O2 may contribute to at least some if not all of effects on tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition to the inhibition of tyrosine protein phosphatase by H2O2, these ROS may also interfere the signaling pathways via altering the heme or thiol redox status in molecules as indicated previously (48Forman H.J. Torres M. Fukuto J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 49-62Google Scholar, 49Nordberg J. Arner E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Google Scholar, 50Wolin M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1430-1442Google Scholar). Despite this ambiguity, our study clearly shows that ROS generation from NADPH oxidase is involved in the phosphorylation of Src and PYK2 induced by cyclic strain.The physiological role of PYK2 is not yet clear. PKY2 has been shown to play a role in ERK, JNK, and p38 activation. The association of adaptor protein p130Cas to PYK2 has been reported to link the PYK2 activation to the JNK pathway (14Blaukat A.

A decrease of c-junpromoter activity was observed in ECs transfected with PYK2 kinase inactive mutant, 2D. L. Wang and J.-J. Cheng, unpublished observations. supporting this PYK2/JNK pathway. This PYK2 mutant transfection also leads to a decreased activation of a transcriptional factor, Elk-1, one of the JNK substrates.2 Various studies including ours have shown that both ERK and JNK are involved in hemodynamic force-induced cellular signaling mechanisms (16Wung B.S.

Res. 1997; 81: 1-7Google Scholar) showing that cyclic strain- or shear stress-induced gene expression is redox-sensitive. Cyclic strain-induced PYK2 phosphorylation and the subsequent downstream signaling pathway are consistent with the notion that ECs under hemodynamic forces induce genes that are Src- and redox-sensitive.PKC-dependent activation of Src has been reported in cells after stimulation (51Bruce-Staskal P.J.

Sequential activation of PKC and Src was indicated (54Robin P. Boulven I. Desmyter C. Harbon S. Leiber D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C251-C260Google Scholar). In the present study, PKCα activation appears to be required for the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and PYK2. The inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase by H2O2 intracellularly produced may also be required for the sustained activation of Src and PYK2 under cyclic strain. It has been reported that Src kinases are critical for activation of PYK2, and Src forms a complex with PYK2, which in turn phosphorylates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (5Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K. Chiu E.S. Okigaki M. Cary L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Google Scholar). Src-dependent PYK2 activation has been shown to be involved in the osteoclastic activation during adhesion (55Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Google Scholar). These are consistent with our present finding that cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activity is mediated via Src. Activation of PKC by phorbol ester results in a focal adhesion targeting of PYK2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation in an integrin clustering-dependent manner (56Ohmori T. Yatomi Y. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 561-569Google Scholar). EGFR has been shown to be involved in mechanical stretch-induced responses (57Iwasaki H. Eguchi S. Ueno H. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H521-H529Google Scholar). Mechanical forces triggering integrin-dependent cellular responses have been well documented (58Goldschmidt M.E. McLeod K.J. Taylor W.R.

Recent studies further showed the involvement of PYK2 in outside-in signaling by forming a complex with p130Cas and paxillin in human ECs (60Anfosso F. Bardin N. Vivier E. Sabatier F. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1564-1569Google Scholar). For those ECs under cyclic strain, an increased association of PYK2 with paxillin was also observed.2 Thus, cyclic strain-triggered PYK2 activation may play an important role in modulating the early signaling pathways in ECs subjected to mechanical forces.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that cyclic strain to ECs activates redox-sensitive PYK2 via Src. This cyclic strain-induced PYK2 activity is mediated via calcium-dependent PKCα that increase NADPH oxidase activity. The ROS thus generated appears to be crucial for Src and PYK2 activation. This PYK2 activation may play an important role in regulating endothelial responses. Because PYK2 phosphorylation is rapid and redox sensitive, its signaling role in regulating vascular gene expression and maintaining vessel integrity remains to be elucidated and warrants further investigation.

PYK2 is activated by signals that increase intracellular Ca2+concentration (9Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T.M. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Google Scholar).

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has a central role in airway inflammation and is the receptor for 90% of rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus infection of airway epithelium induces ICAM-1. Because redox state is directly implicated in inflammatory responses via molecular signaling mechanisms, here we studied the effects of reducing agents on rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 expression, mRNA up-regulation, promoter activation, and nuclear factor activation. To investigate the effects of rhinovirus infection on the intracellular redox balance, we also studied whether rhinovirus infection triggers the production of reactive oxygen species. We found that reduced (GSH) but not oxidized (GSSG) glutathione (1-100 microM) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation and mRNA induction in primary bronchial and A549 respiratory epithelial cells. GSH but not GSSG also inhibited rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 promoter activation and rhinovirus-induced NF-kB activation. In parallel, we found that rhinovirus infection induced a rapid increase of intracellular superoxide anion that was maximal at the time of NF-kB activation. This oxidant generation was completely inhibited by GSH. We conclude that redox-mediated intracellular pathways represent an important target for the therapeutic control of rhinovirus-induced diseases."

In maize (Zea mays L.) pollen coat, the predominant protein is a 35-kDa endoxylanase, whose mRNA is located in the tapetum cells enclosing the maturing pollen in the anthers. This 2.0-kb mRNA was found to have an open reading frame of 1,635 nucleotides encoding a 60-kDa pre-xylanase. In developing anthers, the pre-xylanase protein appeared prior to the 35-kDa xylanase protein and enzyme activity and then peaked and declined, whereas the 35-kDa xylanase protein and activity continued to increase until anther maturation. An acid protease in the anther extract converted the inactive pre-xylanase to the active 35-kDa xylanase in vitro. The protease activity was inhibited by inhibitors of serine proteases but unaffected by inhibitors of cysteine, aspartic, or metallic proteases. Sequence analysis revealed that the 60-kDa pre-xylanase was converted to the 35-kDa xylanase with the removal of 198 and 48 residues from the N and C termini, respectively. During in vitro and in vivo conversions, no intermediates of 60–35 kDa were observed, and the 35-kDa xylanase was highly stable.

A major step in sexual reproduction in plants is the interaction between the male gamete-containing pollen and the pollen-receiving stigma in flowers (1Bewley J.D. Hempel F.D. McCormick S.

This interaction manifests at the contact between the pollen coat and the surface structures of the stigma. The coat of pollen contains special constituents that are essential to the initial sexual contact and thus the success of fertilization. Its chemical compositions vary, depending on the species. In insect or self-pollinating species, of which Brassica andArabidopsis are the best studied (5Wu S.S.H. Platt K.A. Ratnayake C. Wang T.W. Ting J.T.L. Huang A.H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant J. 1997; 11: 549-562Google Scholar), the pollen coat is thick and contains steryl esters and very non-polar lipids as the major lipids and oleosins as the predominant proteins. The lipids are for water-proofing, whereas the amphipathic oleosins may act as a “wick” for water uptake to initiate germination. These major coat lipids and proteins are synthesized and accumulated initially in the tapetum cells, which enclose the pollen locule in the anthers. Upon lysis of the tapetum cells, the accumulated lipids and proteins are discharged onto the microspores (maturing pollen), forming the bulk of the pollen coat. The coat also contains minor proteins involved in self-incompatibility that are synthesized in the pollen interior (11Doughty J. Hedderson F. McCubbin A. Dickinson H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 467-471Google Scholar,12Kachroo A. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S227-S238Google Scholar). In wind-pollinating species, the pollen coat is thin (13Horner H.T.

Bot. 1995; 82: 1017-1023Google Scholar), and major biochemical studies have been carried out only with maize (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). The coat of maize pollen contains undefined neutral lipids and a predominant protein. This protein is a 35-kDa xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8). Upon contact with the stigma surface, the pollen would release the xylanase to hydrolyze the xylan on the stigma surface. The hydrolysis would generate a gap on the stigma for the pollen tube to penetrate into the pollen tube track to reach the ovules. The 35-kDa xylanase on the maize pollen coat has been extracted and purified to homogeneity (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). The enzyme is an active endoxylanase, as it catalyzes the in vitro hydrolysis of internal xylose-xylose linkages in oat-spelt xylan. Its gene has been cloned with use of reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; ORF, open reading frame; nt, nucleotide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; UTR, untranslated region; EST, expressed sequence tag. 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; ORF, open reading frame; nt, nucleotide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; UTR, untranslated region; EST, expressed sequence tag.-PCR on the basis of its N-terminal amino acid sequence. The transcript is present in the tapetum cells enclosing the pollen locule in the anthers and is absent in the microspore or pollen interior. At the late stage of anther development, the tapetum cells lyse and deposit the xylanase onto the pollen, where it becomes the predominant protein. The xylanase transcript has 2.0 kb, which is very long for encoding the xylanase of 35 kDa. Initial sequencing of the transcript showed an ORF of 933 nt, which could encode the 35-kDa xylanase completely and was separated from another ORF of 525 nt at the 5′ upstream region. We subsequently re-sequenced the transcript and the gDNA (to be shown in this report) and found that the two ORFs are actually linked in-frame to be a longer ORF of 1,635 nt. The protein encoded by this ORF and its relationship to the active xylanase were unknown and have been studied by us. A recent report (16Caspers M.P.M. Lok F. Sinjorgo K.M.C. van Zeijl M.J. Nielsen K.A. Cameron-Mills V. Plant J. 2001; 26: 191-204Google Scholar) showed that during germination of barley seed, the aleurone layer contains a long xylanase-mRNA similar to that in the maize tapetum reported earlier (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). This barley mRNA produces a large precursor, which is processed to become an active xylanase of about 30–34 kDa. The barley aleurone xylanase is released at a late stage of germination to the adjacent storage endosperm, where it hydrolyzes the remaining cell walls to release sugars for germination. The maize and barley xylanases are in two different tissues and organs and carry out very dissimilar physiological functions. Their relationship at the gene and protein levels was unknown and has been investigated by us. In this report, we present our findings on the maize tapetum-pollen xylanase. The xylanase is synthesized initially as a large, inactive 60-kDa pre-xylanase, which is processed to become the active 35-kDa xylanase. This is the first tapetum-exported enzyme shown to have undergone an extensive processing and activation. The processing is carried out by an acidic serine protease, which is highly specific at defined sites at both the N and C termini of the pre-xylanase. We also describe the cloning of a barley gene encoding the tapetum xylanase. This gene and the gene encoding the aleurone-layer xylanases have strict tissue-specific expressions. Maize (Zea mays L.; B73) plants were grown in a greenhouse at 28 °C with a 14/10-h day/night cycle (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). Pollen was collected on sunny mornings when the anthers had just opened. Anthers of five developmental stages were obtained on the basis of the following criteria. At stage I, the tassel was still embedded in the shoot apex. The anthers filled up about one-third of each floret. Each microspore mother cell had undergone meiosis to produce a tetrad of microspores, which were still encased within a callose wall. At stage II, part of the tassel had protruded from the shoot apex. The anthers filled up about one-half of the floret. Young microspores had been released from the dissolved callose wall, and the outer pollen wall (exine) had been synthesized. At stage III, the tassel had protruded completely out of the top of the plant. The anthers filled up about two-thirds of the floret. The microspores had enlarged and contained multiple small vacuoles. The first mitosis had occurred, and the microspores were binucleate. At stage IV, the anthers filled up the floret completely. Second mitosis in the microspores had occurred, and the microspores were trinucleate. At stage V, the tassel became yellow. Some of the florets on the tassel were open, and the pollen was ready to be released. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. Himalaya) seed was soaked in water for several hours and allowed to germinate and grow on several layers of cheesecloth in a dark chamber at 16–18 °C. The aleurone layers were dissected from seed that had germinated for 1 to 10 days and combined as one sample for RT-PCR. Five-day-old whole seedlings were used for gDNA extraction. The seedlings were allowed to grow in potted soil in the above-mentioned greenhouse. Anthers of different developmental stages were collected and combined as one sample for RT-PCR. A sample of 5 mg of freshly collected pollen was placed in 1.5 ml of germination medium containing 100 ppm Ca(NO3)2, 10 ppm H3BO3, 37.5 ppm lysine, 5 ppm cystine, 0.05 ppm glutamic acid, and 15% (w/v) sucrose (17Saini J.P. Dube S.D. Maydica. 1986; 31: 227-232Google Scholar). More than 90% of the pollen underwent germination, and the length of the pollen tube was about 0.5 and 10 times the diameter of the pollen after 15 and 60 min, respectively. Glass beads (425–600-μm diameter) were added to the germination medium, and the whole mixture was homogenized by use of a mortar and pestle. Three freshly collected stage-4 anthers were placed in a solution of 0.05m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and dissected under the microscope to remove all the microspores. The solution containing the microspores was collected and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was combined with the leftover, dissected anthers as the anther wall fraction. The microspores in the pellet were resuspended with 40 μl of 0.1 m Na-acetate, pH 5.0, and the solution removed the proteins on the microspore surface (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L.

The extraction was repeated once, and the combined supernatants were called the microspore coat fraction. The leftover microspores were homogenized in 0.05 m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and the homogenate was called the microspore interior fraction. The coat materials were extracted from mature pollen with diethyl ether (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol.

To partially purify the 60-kDa xylanase pre-protein, stage-2 anthers were homogenized in a medium of 0.05m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 2 mm dithiothreitol gently with the use of a mortar and pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove the microspores and anther debris. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of 20% (w/v). The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and ammonium sulfate was added to give a final concentration of 40%. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet (to be shown to contain the partially purified 60-kDa pre-xylanase) was retained and resuspended in 0.05 mHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. To partially purify the 55-kDa protein, stage-2 anthers were homogenized as described in the preceding paragraph. Ammonium sulfate was added to the homogenate to give a final concentration of 10% (w/v). The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove the supernatant, and the pellet (to be shown to contain the 55-kDa protein) was retained and resuspended in 0.05m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. Fifty stage-3 anthers were homogenized in 1 ml of 0.05m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 m sucrose. The homogenate was layered on top of a solution containing 0.05 m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.8 m sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The top layer of 0.4 m sucrose solution (to be shown to contain the protease activity) was collected. Duplicates of a 1-ml reaction mixture of 0.1 m Na-acetate, pH 5.0, each containing the partially purified 55- or 60-kDa protein and 50 μl of the anther crude protease fraction, were incubated at 30 °C for various durations. Each reaction mixture was used to analyze for proteins (30 μl) by immunoblotting and xylanase activity (800 μl) by an enzyme assay (to be described). To test the effect of protease inhibitors on the protease hydrolysis of the 60-kDa pre-xylanase, the inhibitor was added to the protease reaction mixture described in the preceding paragraph and incubated for 4 h. The inhibitors and their final concentrations in the reaction mixture were as follows: aprotinin, 1.5 μm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm; cystatin, 42 μm; E-64, 10 μm; pepstatin, 1 μm; trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm; and EDTA, 10 mm. To test the effect of pH on the protease hydrolysis of the 60-kDa pre-xylanase, the crude anther protease fraction was mixed with the partially purified 60-kDa pre-xylanase in a 0.1 m buffer at 30 °C for 2 h. The buffer included sodium acetate, pH 4, 4.5, 5, and 5.5; potassium phosphate, pH 6; and Tris-HCl, pH 7, 8, and 9. To test the protease activities in anthers of different developmental stages, 0.5 μl of total anther extract of each developmental stage was incubated with the partially purified 60-kDa pre-xylanase in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C for 2 h. The total anther extract was prepared by homogenizing 50 anthers in 1 ml of 0.05 m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. The proteins in the partially purified 60-kDa pre-xylanase, 55-kDa protein, and the pollen-coat (containing the 35-kDa xylanase) fractions were separated with the use of 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and small gels (8 × 8 cm). The gel slices containing the 60-, 55- and 35-kDa proteins were obtained. Each gel slice was cut vertically into ∼1-mm pieces. The pieces were washed three times with 400 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min and then soaked in 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. The acetonitrile was removed, and the gel pieces were dried in a Speed Vac for 30 min. The gel pieces were rehydrated in 50 μl of a trypsin solution (0.01 μg/μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. A 50-μl solution of 50% acetonitrile and 5% trifluoroacetate was added, and the mixture was incubated at 24 °C for 1 h. The supernatant containing the trypsin-digested fragments was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The gel pieces in the pellet were re-extracted once with acetonitrile and trifluoroacetate, and the combined supernatants were dried with the use of a Speed Vac. The extracted protein fragments were subjected to mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis with the use of Voyager DE-STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the major fragments detected between 900 and 2,400m/z (920.53, 1150.61, 1914.81, 1975.32, 1992.01, 2034.38, and 2388.13) in the 35-kDa xylanase sample were also found in the 60-kDa pre-xylanase sample. A fragment of 565.42m/z was present in the 35-kDa xylanase sample but not in the 60-kDa pre-xylanase sample; it corresponded to the RASATTD at the C terminus of the 35-kDa xylanase. The N-terminal sequence of the 35-kDa xylanase was determined by Edman degradation to be RLGFPFGNAVTKEILGLPA (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). All procedures followed those described earlier (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). Proteins were separated with the use of 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and then destained. For immunoblot analyses, proteins fractionated on the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter membrane and then subjected to immunodetection. Rabbit antibodies were raised against the purified recombinant protein of the mature 35-kDa xylanase (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). RBB-xylan (4-O-methyl-d-glucurono-d-xylan linked covalently to Remazol Brilliant Blue R, obtained from Sigma) was used as the substrate. The xylanase reaction mixture of 900 μl contained an enzyme sample (either the anther or pollen extracts or the protease reaction mixture; see “Analyses of the Anther Protease Activity on the 60-kDa Pre-xylanase and the 55-kDa Protein”), 2.57 mg of RBB-xylan, and sodium acetate, pH 5.0, to make a final buffer concentration of 0.1 m. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C. At time intervals, an aliquot of 200 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 400 μl of 95% ethanol to terminate the reaction. The mixture was shaken gently and left at 24 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and its absorbance at 595 nm was determined with the use of a spectrophotometer. Each enzyme assay was monitored at four time intervals within a 12-h period to ensure linearity of the reaction. During the long incubation period, 0.5 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added to the xylanase reaction mixture every 2 h to prevent proteolytic activities. The inserted maize DNA in a xylanase genomic clone λ-g-XYN (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar) and a full-length cDNA clone pXYN-60 (to be described) were sequenced with internal primers by the DNA Sequencing Core Laboratory, University of Maine. A comparison of their sequences allowed us to determine the site of the intron. Total RNA was extracted with the use of guanidine hydrochloride (18Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Google Scholar) from maize anthers of different developmental stages and from barley anthers and aleurone layers of combined developmental stages. A sample of 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with oligo(dT)15 primer (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from maize RNA of stage-2 anthers. A cDNA clone (pXYN-60) containing the complete sequence encoding the 60-kDa pre-xylanase was constructed by first making a 5′ portion and a 3′ portion and then ligating the two portions. In constructing the 5′ portion, the 5′ primer was 5′-ATCCGCAGTGCCTTGGCGA-3′ (corresponding to nts +1 to +19, to be shown in Fig. 1), and the 3′ primer was 5′-AAGAATTCGAACATGAATAGGAT-3′ (corresponding to nts +1185 to +1165) and contained an EcoRI site (underlined). In constructing the 3′ portion, the 5′ primer was 5′-ACCAAGGAGATCCTCGG-3′ (corresponding to nts +745 to +761), and the 3′ primer was 5′-GACTCGATGCGACATCGA(dT)17-3′ (corresponding to the poly(A) tail). The two PCR portions were each subcloned into the vector pGEM-T. The two cDNA clones were digested with EcoRI andSpeI. The 900-bp EcoRI/SpeI fragment from the cDNA clone containing the 3′ portion was ligated to theEcoRI/SpeI-digested cDNA clone containing the 5′ region to produce pXYN-60. A cDNA clone (pXYN-45) containing the coding region of the mature 35-kDa xylanase plus the remaining C-terminal portion of the pre-xylanase was amplified from PXYN-60 by PCR. The 5′ primer was 5′-ATGGGCGCCAACGACAAGCC-3′ (corresponding to nts +661 to +681, to be shown in Fig. 1), and the 3′ primer was the adapter 5′-GACTCGATGCGACATCGA-3′. The PCR fragment was ligated into the vector pGEM-T to form pXYN-45. The sequences of pXYN-60 and pXYN-45 were confirmed via DNA sequencing. The Riboprobe labeling system was used to perform the in vitrotranscription, and the wheat-germ system was used for in vitro translation. Both systems were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The in vitro transcription and translation were performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions. [35S]Methionine was used to label the proteins; methionine residues are distributed throughout the 60-kDa pre-xylanase and the 35-kDa xylanase sequences (to be described in Fig. 1). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from RNA of barley anthers of combined developmental stages. The 5′ primer (5′-CGAGAACGAGATGAAGTGGTAC-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-CCCAGAACACGATGCCCTCC-3′) corresponded to the conserved regions of the ORF of ZmXYN1 (AF149016) and HvXYN1 (AF287731), respectively (18Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Google Scholar). The PCR products were analyzed with the use of a 1% agarose gel. A single fragment of 682 bp was obtained and purified with the use of a QIAGENE gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the plasmid was transformed into JM 109 competent cell (Promega, Madison, WI) for production and sequencing. The 682-bp fragment contained a portion of the ORF of a new barley xylanase gene termed HvXYL2. The 3′ region ofHvXYN2 was obtained by RT-PCR with the use of the 5′ primer (5′-TACCCCGGCAACGACGGCA-3′, corresponding to the 3′ end of the above-mentioned 682-bp fragment of HvXYN2) and oligo(T)15 as the 3′ primer. A single fragment of 752 bp was observed from the agarose gel. It was purified, cloned, and sequenced as described. The overlapping 682- and 752-bp fragments contained a continuous 1,169-bp sequence of the 3′ region ofHvXYN2. For HvXYN1, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from the barley aleurone-layer RNA. For a nonspecific gene probe, a 674-bp fragment corresponding to a major portion of the ORF was amplified with the use of a 5′ primer, 5′-GCTCAAGTGGTACCACACGG-3′, and a 3′ primer, 5′-CCCAGAACACGATGCCCTCC-3′. For a gene-specific probe, a 453-bp fragment corresponding to a small 3′-terminal portion of the ORF and the 3′-UTR was amplified with a 5′ primer, 5′-AATGTGGCGCCAGAACGCC-3′, and a 3′ primer, 5′-TGGCTAGTAAGACCAATAGGC-3′. For HvXYN2, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from RNA of barley anthers of combined developmental stages. For a nonspecific gene probe, the 682-bp fragment described in the preceding paragraph, which corresponded to a major portion of the HvXYN2 ORF, was used. For a gene-specific probe, a 463-bp fragment corresponding to a small 3′-terminal portion of the ORF and the 3′-UTR was amplified with the use of a 5′ primer, 5′-GCACGGATGCTGGGTCATG-3′, and a 3′ primer, 5′-TTGGTCTAAGACTCGGTCCG-3′. The fragments were purified with the use of Millipore Microcon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and then32P-labeled with the use of a Multiprimer DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA from barley anthers or aleurone layers of combined developmental stages was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA. The cDNAs were used as a template to do PCR with the use of a pair of gene-specific primers described in the preceding paragraph. The PCR fragments were analyzed with a 1% agarose gel. For a barley actin gene, a 5′ primer (5′-GGTTACTCCTTCACCACGAC-3′) and a 3′ primer (5′-CAGACACTGTACTTCCTCTCAG-3′) were designed from two conserved nucleotide sequence regions of a maize actin gene (GenBankTM, Maz56, U60514) and a barley partial actin EST (GenBankTM, AJ234400), respectively. gDNA was extracted from barley seedlings by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (20Suen D.F. Wang C.K. Lin R.F. Kao Y.Y. Lee F.M. Chen C.C. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1997; 94: 331-337Google Scholar). Each hybridization reaction mixture contained 30 μg of gDNA and one restriction enzyme (to be listed in the legend of Fig. 8). After digestion, the DNA fragments were separated with the use of a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was treated in 0.25 m HCl for 20 min, rinsed with water twice, shaken in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH for 1 h, and equilibrated in 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1.5 m NaCl for 1 h. After equilibration, the DNA fragments were blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was pre-hybridized at 65 °C in potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 m EDTA for 4 h, hybridized with32P-labeled gene-specific or gene-nonspecific probes overnight, and then washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 to 30 min, all at 65 °C. We obtained the sequences of the gDNA and cDNA of the maize xylanase gene (ZmXYN1) after re-sequencing and revising a few misplaced bp of the sequences reported earlier (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a 2.1-kb gDNA sequence that encodes the complete transcript and has a short intron of 106 nt. This sequence and its 1.7-kb 5′ upstream promoter region can be found in GenBankTM (AF149016). The transcript has 2.0 kb, as deduced from the cDNA sequence and by RNase protection assay, and an ORF of 1,635 nt. If the entire ORF is used to encode a protein, the transcript would have 23 nt of 5′-UTR and about 300 nt of 3′-UTR. Within the ORF are 30 possible ATG codons, 21 of which are in-frame with the sequence corresponding to the known 35-kDa xylanase sequence (15Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Google Scholar). These 21 ATG codons are distributed throughout the ORF (Fig. 1). Seven of them are at the 5′ region preceding the sequence encoding the final 35-kDa xylanase (its N-terminal sequence is FPFG—(referring to the amino acid sequence starting at FPFG shown in Fig. 1)). Any of these seven ATG codons could be the initiation codon. If the first ATG codon is used, the protein would have 60.59 kDa, and if the sixth and seventh ATG codons are used, the protein would have 41.37 and 40.66 kDa, respectively. We used in vitro translation to test whether the transcript produces a large precursor of about 60 kDa or a precursor of a molecular mass fairly similar to that of the 35-kDa xylanase. We constructed pXYN-60 containing the entire ORF, which would encode a protein of 60.59 kDa. The plasmid was subjected to in vitrotranscription, and the transcript was used to do in vitrotranslation with the use of the wheat-germ system. The transcript produced one major protein of about 60 kDa and several minor and smaller proteins (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of this major protein estimated by its mobility in the current SDS-PAGE system was about 61 kDa; for convenience, we termed the protein a 60-kDa protein. Thus, the first ATG codon (calculated to produce a protein of 60.59 kDa), or less likely the second ATG codon (calc"

We have reported recently that cAMP potentiates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, primarily because of a protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (Bruce, J. I. E., Shuttleworth, T. J. S., Giovannucci, D. R., and Yule, D. I. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 1340–1348). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the functional and molecular mechanism whereby cAMP regulates Ca2+ clearance pathways in parotid acinar cells. Following an agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i the rate of Ca2+clearance, after the removal of the stimulus, was potentiated substantially (∼2-fold) by treatment with forskolin. This effect was prevented completely by inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) with La3+. PMCA activity, when isolated pharmacologically, was also potentiated (∼2-fold) by forskolin. Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum of streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was largely unaffected by treatment with dibutyryl cAMP. Finally, in situ phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PMCA was phosphorylated by treatment with forskolin but only in the presence of carbamylcholine (carbachol). This effect of forskolin was Ca2+-dependent, and protein kinase C-independent, as potentiation of PMCA activity and phosphorylation of PMCA by forskolin also occurred when [Ca2+]i was elevated by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid and was attenuated by pre-incubation with the Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The present study demonstrates that elevated cAMP enhances the rate of Ca2+ clearance because of a complex modulation of PMCA activity that involves a Ca2+-dependent step. Tight regulation of both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ efflux may represent a general feature of the mechanism whereby cAMP improves the fidelity and specificity of Ca2+ signaling.

Tight regulation of both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ efflux may represent a general feature of the mechanism whereby cAMP improves the fidelity and specificity of Ca2+ signaling. Intracellular calcium is perhaps the most ubiquitous second messenger system in biology, yet the molecular mechanisms that confer specificity of Ca2+-dependent processes continue to intrigue investigators. Regulation of both the spatial and temporal properties of intracellular Ca2+ signals is believed to underlie the specificity of stimulus-response coupling in a variety of cell types (1Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Google Scholar, 2Brini M. Carafoli E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 354-370Google Scholar, 3Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S.

Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). Recently an accumulation of evidence suggests that specific regulatory control over a variety of Ca2+ signaling pathways can be achieved by the concomitant activation of additional signaling pathways, in particular those that elevate cyclic AMP (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar, 6Giovannucci D.R. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. Yule D.I. J. Biol.

Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Google Scholar). Parotid acinar cells represent an excellent model system not only for the study of Ca2+ signaling in general but also to investigate cross-talk between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling (2Brini M. Carafoli E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 354-370Google Scholar). This is because there is an abundance of evidence showing that both acetylcholine-evoked fluid secretion and exocytosis are potentiated markedly by cAMP-raising pathways (9Baldys-Waligorska A. Pour A. Moriarty C.M. Dowd F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 929: 190-196Google Scholar, 10Bobyock E. Chernick W.S. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 68: 1489-1494Google Scholar, 11Larsson O. Olgart L.

In addition, we have demonstrated recently in parotid acinar cells that raising cAMP potentiates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, primarily because of a PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; CCh, carbamylcholine (carbachol); PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; SL-O, streptolysin-O; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; CaM, calmodulin; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; CaMK, CaM kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; CCh, carbamylcholine (carbachol); PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; SL-O, streptolysin-O; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; CaM, calmodulin; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; CaMK, CaM kinase.-mediated phosphorylation of type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar). This was hypothesized to be the major mechanism for the potentiation of fluid secretion by cAMP-raising agonists in the parotid. In addition to potentiation of Ca2+ release, it was also observed that the rate of Ca2+ clearance upon removal of CCh was potentiated substantially in the presence of forskolin. This may represent an important additional mechanism by which cAMP tightly controls the spatial and temporal properties of Ca2+signaling in parotid acinar cells. The aim of the present study was to systematically determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the potentiation of Ca2+ clearance by cAMP in mouse parotid acinar cells. The study revealed a novel, complex mechanism by which cAMP can modulate Ca2+ signaling by potentiating PMCA activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Because the PMCA has been suggested to respond to dynamic fluctuations in cytosolic [Ca2+] due to its CaM binding properties (14Foder B. Scharff O. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 581-591Google Scholar, 15Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Google Scholar), further regulation by cAMP may be important for the fine tuning of Ca2+ signaling. This regulatory control likely contributes to the general mechanism by which cAMP-elevating agonists shape Ca2+ signaling, a process that may have relevance to the regulation of a wide array of specific functions in various cell types. Clusters of parotid acinar cells were isolated by collagenase digestion as described previously (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar). Following isolation, cells were re-suspended in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution containing the following (in mm): 5.5 glucose, 137 NaCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 CaCl2. Aliquots of cell suspensions were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature after which they were re-suspended in HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution and kept at 4 °C until ready for use. During experiments, cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip, which formed the base of a gravity-fed perfusion chamber. Cells were perfused continually with HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution, and automatic valves were used for switching solutions. [Ca2+] imaging experiments were performed using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a ×40 oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). Most experiments utilized an imaging system consisting of a DG-4 illumination system (Sutter), a 12-bit progressive interline charged coupled device camera (Sensicam), and Axon Imaging Workbench acquisition software as described previously in more detail (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar). This imaging system was used for most standard experiments that required a relatively slow image acquisition rate of 0.1 to 1 Hz and 100- to 300-ms exposure times. For the rapid atropine-evoked Ca2+clearance experiments faster acquisition rates of 10 to 20 Hz and 10- to 20-ms exposure times were required; therefore, an alternative imaging system was used. This contained essentially the same optics and camera but used a TILL polychrome IV monochromator illumination system and TILL VisION acquisition and analysis software (see Ref. 6Giovannucci D.R. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33704-33711Google Scholar for detailed description). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Measurement of Ca2+ uptake into the ER was isolated by imaging streptolysin (SL-O)-permeabilized parotid acinar cells loaded with the low affinity Ca2+-sensing fluorescent dye, fura-2FF/AM (10 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C as described previously (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were perfused continually with a Chelex-100 “scrubbed” cytosol-like medium containing the following (in mm): 135 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 0.5 EGTA, 0.5N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), 0.5 nitriloacetic acid, and 20 HEPES/KOH (pH 7.1). MgCl2, CaCl2, and MgATP were added accordingly (as calculated by MaxChelator program) to give constant free Mg2+, Ca2+, and ATP concentrations of 0.9 mm, 0.06–1.0 μm, and 1 mm, respectively. Permeabilization was achieved by perfusion with an ATP-containing (but Ca2+-free) cytosol-like medium containing 0.4 international unit of SL-O. Because fura-2FF accumulates in virtually every compartment of the cell, permeabilization could be verified by monitoring the decline in the 360-nm excitation signal (isosbestic point for fura-2FF) as the cytosolic dye leaked out of the cell leaving dye trapped in intracellular organelles (<20% of pre-permeabilized cells). Image acquisition rate was 0.1 Hz (100-ms exposure). Measurement of organelle [Ca2+] was achieved similarly to fura-2 (340- and 380-nm excitation and 510-nm emission) with an image acquisition rate of 0.1 Hz and 300-ms exposure, and fura-2FF 340/380 ratio images were calculated online. Following perfusion of cells with cytosol-like medium devoid of SL-O, Ca2+, or ATP for 5–10 min, rapid Ca2+ uptake was achieved upon addition of 1 mm Mg-ATP and [Ca2+] between 0.06 and 1.0 μm. The fura-2FF 340/380 ratio, representing organelle [Ca2+], reached a maximum within 3 min presumably because of an equilibrium being established between opposing Ca2+fluxes across the organelle membrane (steady state). Subsequent addition of 3 μm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, 30 μm cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), and 1 μm FCCP evoked a rapid decrease, slow decrease, or no change in fura-2FF ratio, respectively, confirming that Ca2+ was taken up into the ER. The rate of Ca2+ uptake into the ER for each cell at each ambient [Ca2+] was fit to a single exponential decay to yield the time constant (τ). The mean time constant was compared in the absence and presence of 100 μm dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP). Parotid acinar cells were isolated from 4–6 mice as described above, aliquotted appropriately, and treated for 10 min with or without the following test reagents: 1 μm CCh, 10 μm forskolin, 150 nmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 30 μm CPA. In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated with 20 μmBAPTA/AM for 30 min at room temperature to buffer any change in [Ca2+]i. Cells were then pelleted rapidly by centrifugation and re-suspended in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing the following (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 NaCl, 5 EDTA, 100 NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were then sonicated, left on ice for 30 min, and vortexed every 5 min. Each lysate was incubated with the monoclonal anti-PMCA antibody (∼1 μg/mg protein; clone 5F10, Affinity Bioreagents) for 1 h, followed by 80 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) for another hour at 4 °C, to immunoprecipitate PMCA protein. As a secondary control (blank) an aliquot of cell lysates from untreated cells was incubated with beads without any antibodies. As described previously (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar) the beads-protein complex was washed five times in lysis buffer and denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer (Laemmli) for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) and Western blotted using the phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) to detect phosphorylated PMCA protein. To confirm that approximately equal amounts of protein were loaded into each lane of the gel or whether the above treatments altered PMCA levels, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in stripping solution (62.5 Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 100 mβ-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C to dissociate any bound antibodies. The membrane was then re-probed subsequently by Western blotting with the anti-PMCA antibody. In some experiments quantification of phosphorylation was achieved by densitometric analysis of visible bands detected by the phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody. This was performed by imaging nitrocellulose membranes exposed to chemiluminescence reagents (Westpico/Westfemto Super Signal; Pierce) using a 12-bit charged coupled device camera (Sensicam) and LabWorks imaging and analysis software (UVP Bioimaging Systems). This measures the total pixel intensity above background of equal sized areas of interest for each visible band. Duplicates on each membrane were averaged, and to account for variability in band intensities between gels comparisons were made between treated and control conditions using a paired Student's t test. Because of the nature of most experiments an unpaired experimental design was applied (unless otherwise stated in the text), whereby statistical significance was determined between groups of experiments (control and treated) using an unpaired t test or Mann Whitney test. Occasionally, statistical significance was determined, where appropriate, using a paired t test, Wilcoxan test for pairs, or one samplet test. For Ca2+ clearance data the rate of Ca2+ clearance was fit to a single exponential decay using Microcal Origin 5.0 software and quantified by comparing time constants (τ). For any parameter analyzed from several cells in a particular experiment, an average value was determined. These values were in turn averaged to give the values expressed in the text as means ± S.E. We have shown previously that elevated cAMP potentiates CCh-evoked Ca2+ release (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar). In the present study, under similar conditions, the rate of Ca2+ clearance was determined following removal of CCh by fitting the falling phase of the change in fura-2 340/380 ratio to a single exponential decay (Fig. 1B). Time constants (τ) were compared quantitatively in the absence and presence of 10 μm forskolin using a paired t test (Fig. 1C). These initial experiments revealed that forskolin caused a 5.3 ± 1.2-fold increase in Ca2+ clearance by reducing τ from 12.6 ± 2.0 to 2.9 ± 0.5 s (Fig. 1C; n = 7 experiments, 34 cells). In some cells the rate of decrease in fura-2 340/380 ratio following removal of CCh was initially slow, suggesting that the rate of solution exchange was contributing to the variability. Therefore to increase the accuracy and precision of the data, experiments were repeated by initiating clearance of Ca2+ from the cytosol by adding a 10-fold higher concentration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (10 μm), in the continued presence of 1 μmCCh (Fig. 2). This reduces any error associated with solution exchange, because as soon as just 10% of the perfusate exchanges, the atropine will have essentially displaced all the CCh from the receptors. Because under these conditions atropine will remain bound for a long time, the effect of forskolin was compared with unpaired control experiments. Under these conditions forskolin increased Ca2+ clearance ∼2.5-fold by reducing τ from 8.27 ± 1.2 to 3.43 ± 0.52 s (n = 14 experiments, 57 cells; see Fig. 2). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that elevating intracellular cAMP levels by activation of adenylyl cyclase, with forskolin, potentiates Ca2+clearance pathways.Figure 2Forskolin potentiates the clearance of [Ca2+]i following addition of atropine in the presence of CCh. A, clearance of [Ca2+]i was initiated by addition of 10 μm atropine in the presence of 1 μm CCh.B, to improve the precision and accuracy, data were acquired 10 times faster (10 Hz versus 1 Hz as in Fig. 1) during the period in the dashed box in A. C, similar to Fig. 1 clearance of [Ca2+]i was fit to a single exponential decay. The mean τ was compared between control and forskolin-treated cells using an unpaired t test (*, p < 0.05). Under these conditions forskolin caused an ∼2.5-fold increase in the rate of Ca2+ clearance (n = 14 experiments, 57 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The major routes for Ca2+ clearance in non-excitable cells, such as parotid acinar cells, are believed to be Ca2+uptake into the ER by the SERCA, Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane by the PMCA, and Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria (1Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Google Scholar, 3Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S. MacKenzie L. De Smet P. Travers M. Tovey S.C. Seo J.T. Berridge M.J. Ciccolini F. Lipp P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 3-10Google Scholar, 4Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the specific molecular loci for the effects of elevated cAMP, on Ca2+ clearance, the following experiments were designed to physically or pharmacologically isolate these different Ca2+ clearance pathways. The rate of Ca2+ clearance during each experimental paradigm varied markedly and thus may not accurately represent the actual rate of each isolated Ca2+ clearance pathway in vivo or under physiological Ca2+signaling conditions. Nevertheless, the relative rate of Ca2+ clearance following a particular treatment under each condition was always consistent, thereby verifying each experimental protocol. One of the major routes for Ca2+clearance following stimulation is believed to be the re-uptake of Ca2+ into the ER by SERCA (1Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Google Scholar, 3Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S. MacKenzie L. De Smet P. Travers M. Tovey S.C. Seo J.T. Berridge M.J. Ciccolini F. Lipp P. Semin. Cell Dev.

In addition, SERCA activity is potentiated by elevated cAMP in cardiac cells because of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the inhibitory accessory protein, phospholamban (16Tada M. Inui M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 565-575Google Scholar, 17Tada M. Inui M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Kuzuya T. Abe H. Kakiuchi S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 335-346Google Scholar, 18James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Google Scholar, 19Brittsan A.G. Kranias E.G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2131-2139Google Scholar). Therefore, a likely locus for the effects of elevated cAMP on Ca2+ clearance in parotid acinar cells is Ca2+ uptake into the ER. To isolate Ca2+ uptake into the ER, parotid acinar cells were permeabilized with SL-O, and Ca2+ uptake was initiated by perfusion with a cytosol-like solution (see “Experimental Procedures”) containing 1 mm ATP and varying concentrations of ambient Ca2+ (0.06–1.0 μm). Ca2+ uptake was indicated by an increase in the fura-2FF 340/380 ratio, which reached a steady state between 0.5 and 3.5 min depending on ambient [Ca2+] (Fig. 3A). Once Ca2+uptake reached a steady state, addition of more Ca2+ failed to increase the fura-2FF 340/380 ratio further (data not shown). Application of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate evoked a rapid Ca2+ release confirming that Ca2+ had been taken up into the ER by SERCA Ca2+ pumps (5Bruce J.I.E. Shuttleworth T.J.S. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Google Scholar). Moreover, the SERCA inhibitor CPA and removal of ATP evoked a slow Ca2+leak, whereas the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP failed to have any effect (data not shown). The rate of Ca2+ uptake was fit to a single exponential decay, and the mean time constant (τ) was determined for each ambient (loading) [Ca2+] in the absence or presence of Bt2-cAMP and compared using an unpaired t test (Fig. 3B). The rate of Ca2+ uptake into the ER increased by ∼4-fold as the ambient [Ca2+] increased from 60 to 200 nm (mean τ decreased from 28.7 ± 1.4 s for 60 nm, to 16.7 ± 2.0 s for 100 nm, and to 7.8 ± 0.8 s for 200 nm ambient [Ca2+]). The rate of Ca2+ uptake did not further increase significantly by increasing ambient [Ca2+] above 200 nm (mean τ = 7.3 ± 0.8 s for 600 nm and mean τ = 7.6 ± 1.5 s for 1 μm ambient [Ca2+];n = 3–6 experiments, 9–22 cells). This suggests that the rate of Ca2+ uptake into the ER increases as cytosolic [Ca2+] increases over the range of 60–200 nm[Ca2+] but is activated maximally above 200 nm [Ca2+]. In pancreatic acinar cells, under almost identical conditions the rate of Ca2+ uptake was shown to be much slower and increased over a much broader range of ambient [Ca2+] (20van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Google Scholar). This suggests that SERCA is much more active and sensitive to small elevations of [Ca2+]i above resting levels in parotid than in pancreatic acinar cells. This is consistent with our previous data, which shows that the deactivation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents was greater in parotid compared with pancreatic acinar cells and that this was due, in part, to a greater SERCA activity (21Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 469-484Google Scholar). Whatever the specific mechanisms that control the Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ uptake into the ER, the most important observation from the present study was that at all the ambient [Ca2+] tested (100, 200, and 600 nm) the rate of Ca2+ uptake into the ER was not affected significantly by treatment with 100 μmBt2-cAMP (Fig. 3B). To further assess the effect of Bt2-cAMP on Ca2+ uptake into the ER of parotid acinar cells, a paired experimental design was utilized in the following way. Ca2+uptake was initiated in the absence of Bt2-cAMP by addition of ATP and 0.2 μm Ca2+. Upon reaching steady state, 100 μm Bt2-cAMP was added, and removal of Ca2+ and ATP caused a slow decline in fura-2FF 340/380 ratio, presumably because of depletion of the ER Ca2+ store (Fig. 3C). Upon reaching a new steady state (10 to 15 min) a second Ca2+ uptake was initiated in the continued presence of Bt2-cAMP (Fig. 3C). Using this paired experimental design the second Ca2+ uptake (mean τ = 9.4 ± 0.5 s) in the absence of Bt2-cAMP was ∼30% slower than the first Ca2+ uptake (mean τ = 7.2 ± 0.4 s) during time matched control experiments. Nevertheless, under the same conditions the change in rate of Ca2+ uptake following treatment with Bt2-cAMP (1.27 ± 0.03-fold increase in τ) was not significantly different from time-matched control experiments (1.32 ± 0.04-fold increase in τ; see Fig. 3D). These data therefore reinforce the initial observation that elevation of cAMP fails to enhance Ca2+ uptake into the ER of permeabilized parotid acinar cells. Despite rigorous attempts to isolate Ca2+uptake into the ER of SL-O-permeabilized parotid acinar cells it remains unlikely that the effects of elevated cAMP on Ca2+clearance are because of enhanced SERCA activity. However, a simple explanation for the lack of effect of Bt2-cAMP could be the permeabilization process itself, which may wash away critical cytosolic factors, such as calmodulin or phospholamban, important for SERCA pump activity (16Tada M. Inui M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 565-575Google Scholar, 17Tada M. Inui M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Kuzuya T. Abe H. Kakiuchi S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 335-346Google Scholar, 18James P.

To address this further, the effects of elevated cAMP on Ca2+ clearance in intact cells was determined following inhibition of SERCA activity by CPA. Intact parotid acinar cells were stimulated with 30 μm CPA, which slowly raised [Ca2+]i primarily because of leak from the ER and activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (22Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20856-20862Google Scholar, 23Takemura H. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 409-412Google Scholar, 24Takemura H. Hughes A.R.

A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar). The increase in [Ca2+]i reached a maximum and then declined slowly to a new steady state, representing a balance of Ca2+ efflux and Ca2+ influx. Removal of external Ca2+, by chelation with 1 mm EGTA, evoked an immediate clearance of Ca2+ that was primarily because of the PMCA. Similar to previous experiments, the rate of Ca2+ clearance was fit to a single exponential decay (Fig. 4A), and the time constants (τ) were compared between control and forskolin-treated cells using an unpaired experimental design (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions forskolin caused an ∼2-fold increase in the rate of Ca2+ clearance, as indicated by a decrease in the mean τ from 28.2 ± 2.1 in control cells (n = 5 experiments; 27 cells) to 16.4 ± 1.9 (n = 5 experiments; 22 cells) in forskolin-treated cells (Fig. 4B). Although the major mechanism for Ca2+ clearance during dynamic Ca2+ signaling is believed to be because of SERCA, these data suggest that potentiation of Ca2+ clearance by elevated cAMP may be because of a pathway other than SERCA, most likely the PMCA. Because the potentiation of Ca2+ clearance by elevated cAMP appears independent of SERCA activity, another Ca2+ clearance pathway such as Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane (PMCA activity) may be the target for the effects of cAMP. To test this hypothesis, experiments similar to those described in Fig. 2 were carried out in the continued presence of 1 mm La3+, a known inhibitor of PMCA (26Furukawa K. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988;"

Minicollagen trimers in isolated nematocyst capsules proved to be sensitive to SDS and were engaged in polymeric structures with additional cross-links that were resistant to reducing agent. Nematocysts are explosive organelles of defense, capture of prey, and locomotion found exclusively in Cnidaria (Coelenterates) likeHydra, jellyfish, and corals. A specialized cell type, the nematocyte, produces them during a complex cellular secretion process that involves the formation of the capsule and its long cylindrical tubule from a giant post-Golgi vesicle by a regulated assembly of different protein layers (1Skaer R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1973; 13: 371-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Holstein T. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1981; 75: 276-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The final maturation step of the cyst is characterized by a compaction and hardening of the capsule wall, during which the matrix of the capsule is filled with poly-γ-glutamate (2 m) and its cations, leading to an increase of the internal osmotic pressure to 150 megapascals (3Weber J. Schurholz T. Neumann E. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar,4Szczepanek S. Cikala M. David C.N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 745-751PubMed Google Scholar). Upon triggering, the capsule is discharged and ejects the inverted tube in an ultra-fast (<3 ms) exocytosis process driven by the kinetic energy stored in the capsule wall (5Holstein T. Tardent P. Science. 1984; 223: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The existence of hydroxyproline-rich collagens in the wall and tubule structures of nematocysts was suggested very early by amino acid analysis of Hydra nematocyst proteins (6Lenhoff H.M. Kline E.S. Hurley R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 204-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further experiments revealed that the collagenous proteins contained in the nematocysts obviously formed disulfide-linked polymers soluble only under reducing conditions (7Blanquet R. Lenhoff H.M. Science. 1966; 154: 152-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A first step in unraveling the molecular basis of the nematocyst wall was taken in isolating a family of genes coding for short collagen-like molecules from a HydracDNA library (8Kurz E.M. Holstein T.W. Petri B.M. Engel J. David C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1159-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Hydra minicollagens up to now comprise seven members with a characteristic modular architecture that is also reflected in a related transcript isolated from a reef-building coral, Acropora donei (9Anderluh G. Podlesek Z. Macek P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The central collagen (Gly-X-Y) region is flanked on both sides by a probably hydroxylated polyproline stretch followed by a cysteine-rich domain that is highly conserved among some of the minicollagen molecules including minicollagen-1. During nematocyst morphogenesis, minicollagens are assembled to the electron-lucent inner layer of the capsule wall that is covered on the outside by densely packed globular particles containing the NOWA 1The abbreviations used are: NOWA, nematocyst outer wall antigen; MBP, maltose-binding protein protein (8Kurz E.M.

Atomic force microscopy and biochemical evidence showed that minicollagens form a dense fibrillar structure in the inner wall accessible only by reducing agents in mature nematocysts (10Holstein T.W. Benoit G.M. Herder G.v. Wanner G. David C.N. Gaub H.E. Science. 1994; 265: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We were able to express minicollagen-1 in a eucaryotic expression system using 293 cells (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A fusion protein containing a C-terminal His-tag and the native signal and prosequences was properly processed and secreted but showed a high tendency for self-aggregation. To confirm the trimeric state of minicollagen-1, a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP) linked to the C terminus, was designed and expressed in 293 cells. Minicollagen-1-MBP proved to be soluble under native conditions and showed trimers of the globular MBP parts on transmission electron micrographs. Here we characterize the trimeric nature of the minicollagen-1-MBP fusion construct and its capacity to form polytrimeric networks triggered by an in vitro reshuffling process. Minicollagen detected in isolated capsules formed insoluble polymers in mature wall structures that even after reduction showed polymeric fractions suggesting a different type of cross-linking. The minicollagen-1-MBP fusion construct was designed as described previously (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MBP cDNA was fused to the C terminus of minicollagen-1 using the overlap extension method (22Ho S. DNA Protein Eng. 1990; 2: 50-55Google Scholar), and the resulting fragment was subcloned into the pCEP-Pu vector for expression in mammalian cells. For stable transfection, 293 EBNA cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Gln, and PenStrep. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected overnight with 1 μg of vector DNA using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. The selection of positive clones was performed by culturing transfected cells with 2 μg/ml puromycin with frequent changes of medium until a resistant population appeared. All reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. EBNA 293 cells stably transfected with minicollagen-1-MBP cDNA were grown to high density in 125-ml cell culture flasks using complete medium. For expression of recombinant fusion protein, cells were switched to serum-free expression medium containing 500 μg/ml ascorbic acid to ensure hydroxylation of the prolines within the collagen sequence (13Myllyharju J. Nokelainen M. Vuorela A. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 353-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell supernatants were harvested frequently until the cells detached, pooled, and passed through a syringe filter. Conditioned medium was then purified using amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. Before solubilizing in non-reducing sample buffer, samples were incubated with different concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol as indicated in the experiments. Samples were not boiled to preserve the trimeric state of the minicollagen molecules. The melting of the triple helix was performed by incubating samples for 10 min in a water bath (Julabo) at increasing temperatures and treated immediately with sample buffer to prevent refolding. For resolving minicollagen-trimers and higher aggregates, non-reducing gradient gels (3–10%) were applied with 2.5% stacker gels to ensure that high molecular complexes entered the separating gel. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining. Western blot analysis was performed using minicollagen polyclonal antibody (rabbit) generated against His6-minicollagen-1 (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Primary antibody (1:1000) was detected using an anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody (1:2000) and the ECL chemoluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). A Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics was employed. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed at 54000 rpm and sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 10000 rpm at a filling height of 2 mm. All measurements were performed at 20 °C. The molecular masses were calculated from sedimentation equilibrium runs using a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the base-line absorption to obtain the best linear fit of ln A versus r 2 (A = absorbance; r = distance from the rotor axis). A partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g for minicollagen-1-MBP was used for the calculation, and the sedimentation velocity coefficient was corrected to standard conditions (H2O at 20 °C). Intact undischarged nematocysts were isolated from whole Hydratissue as described previously (14Weber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9664-9669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 capsules were suspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl and sonicated for 1 h at room temperature using a water bath (Elgasonic). Capsules were centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 rpm in a table centrifuge (Heraeus), and the supernatant was carefully removed. Capsule integrity was verified by light microscopy confirming that capsules had not discharged or lost pressure by wall rupture. Capsule supernatants were then taken for Western blot analysis using different concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were not heated to preserve minicollagen-trimers in the preparations. The minicollagen-1-MBP fusion protein was designed as described with maltose-binding protein added to the C terminus via a flexible linker of 12 amino acids (Fig.1 A) (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The MBP fusion part enabled solubility and purification of the minicollagen-1 molecules under native conditions. As MBP does not contain cysteines, it is supposed not to interfere with the disulfide connectivity and oligomeric state of the minicollagen molecules. Minicollagen-1-MBP was expressed and secreted by 293 cells exclusively as a soluble trimer with an apparent molecular mass of ∼190 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The trimer was resolved with the use of a non-reducing polyacrylamide gradient (3–10%) gel charged with unheated samples to prevent denaturation of the triple helix. The calculated mass for the minicollagen-1-MBP monomer is 58 kDa, which corresponds well to the apparent molecular mass on SDS gels (60 kDa). As noted earlier, upon incubation of minicollagen samples with reducing agent the apparent molecular mass slightly shifted up probably because of a more extended shape of the minicollagen-1 molecules caused by the dissociation of intrachain disulfide bonds. The trimeric state of minicollagen-1-MBP was additionally confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (TableI). Minicollagen-1-MBP sedimented with a single profile and a sedimentation coefficient of 5.7 S. Sedimentation equilibrium yielded a molecular mass of 168 kDa, which corresponds to a trimerized fusion molecule. The frictional ratiof/f o = 1.6 suggests an elongated shape of the trimeric protein reflecting the rodlike appearance of minicollagen-1 molecules observed in scanning transmission electron microscopy (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Table ISedimentation coefficient (S20,w) and average molecular mass of the minicollagen-1-MBP trimer as determined by analytical ultracentrifugationMinicollagen-1-MBPConcentrationS 20,wMolecular massObservedCalculatedμg/mlSkDaTrimer2005.7168174 Open table in a new tab We next asked whether interchain disulfide bonds were involved in the formation of the collagen triple helix or whether all cysteinyl residues were engaged in intrachain bridges only. Minicollagen-1-MBP samples were treated with increasing concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol followed by incubation at room temperature or 100 °C for 10 min and analyzed using gradient (3–10%) SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, non-heated samples displayed the observed molecular shift with reduction while completely retaining the trimeric state (left panel). The heating of minicollagen-1-MBP, however, lead to quantitative denaturation of the collagen triple helix in the presence and absence of reducing agent (right panel). Upon the reduction of the boiled samples, a pronounced double band could be observed that probably indicates heterogeneous hydroxylation of the prolines within the collagen and polyproline stretches. These data demonstrate that the cysteine-rich tails are not involved in the maintenance of the trimeric minicollagen structure but instead form independent domains with initially all-intrachain disulfide bonds. To estimate the thermal stability of the collagen triple helix, minicollagen-1-MBP samples were incubated at rising temperatures and the dissociation of the triple helix was assayed by gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Melting took place between 35 and 60 °C. The T m value for the triple helix under reducing conditions (1 m β-mercaptoethanol) was ∼45 °C (Fig. 3, left panel). The same experiment performed under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3, right panel) did not show any alteration of the melting point, confirming that there is no contribution to trimer stability by interchain disulfide bonds within a trimer. The structural model for the minicollagens in the nematocyst wall (10Holstein T.W. Benoit G.M. Herder G.v. Wanner G. David C.N. Gaub H.E. Science. 1994; 265: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) suggests that they form disulfide-linked polymers in which the N- and C-terminal domains overlap, yielding a repeating pattern of collagen helix and cysteine-rich domains. To reproduce this polymerization process in vitro, we reduced minicollagen-1-MBP quantitatively by treatment with 10 mmdithiothreitol and allowed it to reoxidize slowly via dialysis against non-reducing buffer. An analysis of the reoxidized samples by gradient SDS-PAGE revealed that high molecular aggregates had been formed that hardly entered the separating gel under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4 A). Upon reduction, these polymers were gradually dissolved displaying a ladder of protein bands with molecular weight sizes matching polymeric minicollagen-1-MBP trimers. Nearly a total reduction to trimers was achieved by applying β-mercaptoethanol concentrations above 1m. We did not observe any precipitation as a result of the polymerization process, which might be explained by the limiting protein concentration (0.2 μm) applied in these experiments. To confirm that reoxidation led to disulfide-linked polymers only, SDS-PAGE was performed with boiled samples (Fig.4 B), demonstrating that minicollagen-1-MBP polymers are resistant to heat and dissociated to monomers only upon reduction. We have shown earlier that minicollagen-1 antibody recognizes distinct antigens in mature nematocysts, displaying several bands between 30–50 kDa that are attributed to different members of the minicollagen family (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate the polymeric state of the minicollagens in nematocysts, we isolated wall proteins under non-reducing conditions by mild sonication of purified capsules in a water bath. This treatment led to partial dissociation of the outer wall structure while retaining capsule integrity as confirmed by light microscopy. The sonicated capsules were centrifuged, and the supernatant was taken for Western blotting under reducing and non-reducing conditions using minicollagen-1 antibody for detection. As shown in Fig.5 A, no minicollagen proteins could be detected in the non-reduced supernatant, showing that the total minicollagen fraction was engaged in high molecular weight aggregates. Incubation with increasing concentrations of reducing agent allowed the separation of four minicollagen species ranging from 36 to 70 kDa with the higher bands being overrepresented, but most of the material remained in polymeric state not penetrating the separating gel. The 70-kDa band was not observed in capsule samples before (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and might represent a cross-reaction with a longer member of the minicollagen family. A second fraction of bands could be detected in the molecular mass range between 100 and 120 kDa, and by treatment of the capsule supernatant with 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, higher aggregates were made visible that were diffused by glycosylation. Heating of the samples did not result in a qualitative change of the band pattern, demonstrating that collagen trimers in the capsule wall were obviously SDS-sensitive already at low temperatures. The resistance of the polymeric fractions to reducing agents observed in this experiment points to a further mechanism of intermolecular connectivity beside that facilitated by disulfide bonds. In a second experiment, purified capsules were applied to Western blotting under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig.5 B). In contrast to the minicollagen fractions of mature cell wall fragments, capsules contained yet unpolymerized moieties running at 70 and 100 kDa, respectively (left lane inboth panels). Reduction by β-mercaptoethanol produced the same pattern of monomer and polymer fractions as in Fig. 5 A, but most of the capsule material remained insoluble and did not enter the separating gel. Nearly all oligomeric and polymeric fractions could be converted to monomers by heat denaturation (right panel). Non-reduced polymers were heat-stable in SDS similar to the polymers of the recombinant minicollagen-1-MBP. Invertebrate collagens fulfill a series of different biological functions that is reflected by their high structural versatility (23Engel J. Science. 1997; 277: 1785-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The minicollagens of Hydra are particularly distinguished by their unusual domain organization and extreme shortness. The central triple helical collagen regions are followed by rodlike polyproline-II helices of varying length and an 18-residue long domain that contains six cysteines in a narrow well conserved arrangement. The nematocyte capsule is constructed to withstand extremely high osmotic pressures, and its tensile strength has been estimated to be near that of steel (10Holstein T.W. Benoit G.M. Herder G.v. Wanner G. David C.N. Gaub H.E. Science. 1994; 265: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the volumetric changes during a nematocyst discharge suggest some flexibility, allowing the storage of mechanical energy in the wall structure. It was proposed that to meet these requirements, the minicollagen trimers are arranged linearly to form disulfide-linked protofilaments spread around the capsule wall in different layers with shifted angles. The fine structure of a filament analyzed by atomic force microscopy revealed a repetitive pattern consistent with the periodicity of triple helix and polyproline stretches of the linearly assembled minicollagens. Our results provide the first biochemical evidence for triple helix formation of a recombinant minicollagen molecule from Hydraand its capacity to form disulfide-linked polymers similar to those found in mature capsule walls. Minicollagen-1-MBP was expressed in a mammalian system ensuring proper folding of the cysteine-rich domains and hydroxylation of prolines in Y positions within the collagen part because of the presence of prolyl-4-hydroxylase. SDS-PAGE showed that purified minicollagen-1-MBP existed exclusively as a trimer reflecting the soluble precursor form of minicollagens in immature nematocysts. As observed earlier for His6-minicollagen-1, the reduction of minicollagen-1-MBP led to an increase of the apparent molecular weight of 5–10%, indicating a more compact shape of the cysteine-rich domains in the non-reduced state. Trimerization was also confirmed by ultracentrifugation analysis, which revealed a frictional ratio of 1.6, suggesting a distinctly non-globular shape for the full-length protein. This finding is conform with the scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis of His6-minicollagen-1, which had shown rodlike particles with a central stalk of ∼13 nm in length and 4 nm in diameter from which the polyproline helices protruded as shorter rods of ∼7 nm (12Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The transition temperatures of collagens from different sources have been shown to be quite close to the upper limit of the physiological temperatures of the donor species (15Rigby B.J. Robinson M.S. Nature. 1975; 253: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The measured heat stability of 45 °C in our study is 9 °C above the temperature tolerance described for Hydra viridissima (35–36 °C), the difference being even more pronounced if compared with the temperature tolerance of stenotherm species (24–25 °C) (16Schroeder L.A. Callagham P.S. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1981; 24: 1092-1103Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The melting of the minicollagen-1 triple helix under reducing conditions did not decrease the transition point as described recently for a “minicollagen” in which the three chains containing the COL1 and NC1 domains of collagen XII are disulfide-linked (17Mazzorana M. Cogne S. Goldschmidt D. Aubert-Foucher E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27989-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This confirms that the cysteine-rich domains of minicollagen-1 do not function in triple helix stabilization, indicating that the high stability of minicollagen-1 conferred mainly by the hydroxylation of prolines in theY positions, is supposed to increase the heat stability as a consequence of an inductive effect. Total reduction and reoxidation of the purified minicollagen-1-MBP resulted in the formation of high molecular polymers that were resistant to SDS at 100 °C but could be reduced to monotrimeric and polytrimeric bands by reopening of disulfide bonds (Fig. 4,A and B). The same result was obtained when the reshuffling was induced enzymatically by incubation with protein disulfide isomerase in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol or by applying a glutathione reoxidation system (data not shown). Minicollagen-1-MBP did not show any tendency to aggregate in non-reduced state as confirmed by ultracentrifugation experiments performed with protein concentrations as high as 10 μm. We conclude from this that partial reduction is sufficient to trigger the polymerization of minicollagens, which might be an enzymatically controlled process in the nematocyst morphogenesis probably induced by changes in the redox state of the matrix. A similar disulfide exchange process was described for the formation of von Willebrandt factor multimers in promoting platelet adhesion (18Wagner D.D. Lawrence S.O. Ohlsson-Wilhelm B.M. Fay P.J. Marder V.J. Blood. 1987; 69: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, crystallographic evidence provided a molecular mechanism for the cysteine-dependent dimerization of prion protein PrPc, which involved domain swapping (19Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Such a symmetric rearrangement would need only a minimum of free energy as the new linkage is made with an identical structural unit provided by the partner molecule. We speculate that a similar dimerization process might hold true for the cysteine-rich domains of the Hydraminicollagens (20Özbek S. Engel U. Engel J. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This mechanism of polymerization would only require the opening of a single exposed cysteine bridge while retaining the overall structure of the domain. Minicollagen in isolated nematocysts as detected by the minicollagen-1 antibody showed different properties from the recombinant minicollagen-1-MBP, probably because of different post-translational modifications during the process of capsule formation. Most of the minicollagen was engaged in aggregates that could be solubilized only partially by applying reducing agents. Polymeric structures from mature wall fragments isolated by mechanical force in SDS gels displayed minicollagen fractions only after reduction, whereas capsules contained also soluble minicollagen molecules. Trimeric molecules were sensitive to SDS, and reduction led to dissociation to monomers already at room temperature. The partially solubilized polymeric fractions, in contrast to those of recombinant minicollagen-1-MBP, proved resistant to high concentrations of reducing agent, indicating that minicollagen molecules in nematocysts were interlinked not only by disulfide linkage but also by other covalent cross-links that might be essential for the correct assembly of the capsule wall. Such intermolecular cross-links have been described to be of the same nature in higher vertebrates as well as in primitive invertebrates (21Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nematocyst morphogenesis follows a very complex developmental pathway that involves the gradual deposition of proteins on the inner side of a post-Golgi vacuole to form the capsule wall. We have shown by immunolocalization that the assembly of minicollagen-1 in this process is preceded by the appearance of the NOWA protein in Hydra(11Engel U. Özbek S. Engel R. Petri B. Lottspeich F. Holstein T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3923-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). NOWA forms the outer layer of the nematocyst capsule and is believed to play a regulatory role in minicollagen assembly as its C-terminal part consists of an octad repeat of a cysteine-rich domain similar to that in minicollagens. Therefore, it was suggested that NOWA might form covalent links with minicollagen molecules via disulfide bonding (11Engel U. Özbek S. Engel R. Petri B. Lottspeich F. Holstein T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3923-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that by mechanical removal of soluble outer wall particles, it is possible to isolate minicollagen that is exclusively engaged in high molecular aggregates. These complexes proved to be sensitive to reduction as the polymers formed by the recombinant minicollagen-1-MBP after reoxidation. It remains to be analyzed whether these aggregates are composed of minicollagen only or represent heterogeneous complexes with NOWA protein."

AMPA receptor subunits contain a large extracellular N-terminal domain that is important for receptor assembly (1Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Google Scholar). To further investigate the determinants of receptor assembly and surface expression, we have epitope-tagged the N-terminal domain of the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1, and expressed it in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and hippocampal neurons. Full-length GluR1 was readily detected on the cell surface in both cell types. However, surface expression was profoundly decreased by deletion or replacement of nine amino acids in the extreme N terminus. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the mutant GluR1 in which this sequence was deleted still interacts with GluR2, suggesting that mutant GluR1 is capable of at least partial assembly into heteromeric structures. The mutant forms of GluR1 co-localize with an endoplasmic reticulum marker suggesting that they are retained in this structure. These results suggest a specific function of a short sequence present in the N-terminal domain in controlling anterograde trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors.

These results suggest a specific function of a short sequence present in the N-terminal domain in controlling anterograde trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are routinely subdivided into three classes termed α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid; NTD, N-terminal domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Narp, neural activity-regulated pentraxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin receptors,N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and kainate receptors. These are found at virtually all excitatory synaptic connections in the mammalian brain and mediate the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Google Scholar, 3Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 291-298Google Scholar). They are thought to be assembled as heteromers of most likely four (4Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Google Scholar, 5Mano I. Teichberg V.I. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 327-331Google Scholar, 6Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Google Scholar) or perhaps five (7Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2741-2744Google Scholar,8Premkumar L.S. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Google Scholar) individual subunits that share similar membrane topology (9Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar, 10Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Google Scholar). Starting from the N-terminus this includes an extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) of ∼400 amino acids and an S1 domain that precedes the first transmembrane domain and is necessary for ligand binding. A reentrant loop follows this transmembrane domain and forms the pore for the channel. This is followed by a second transmembrane domain and a large extracellular loop that contains the S2 region of the ligand-binding domain. Finally, the protein transverses the membrane a third time and ends intracellularly with a 50–100-amino acid C-terminal domain. A major means by which glutamatergic signaling is modulated in vivo is by membrane trafficking processes controlling the surface expression of receptors (11Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Google Scholar). Protein interactions with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of glutamate receptor subunits are thought to play important roles in regulating both anterograde trafficking to and endocytic removal from the neuronal plasma membrane (11Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Google Scholar). Extracellular surfaces of ionotropic glutamate receptors are well known to mediate ligand binding and to contribute to intersubunit interactions involved in the assembly of functional receptors (1Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that extracellular surfaces of glutamate receptors may also play additional roles in controlling the membrane trafficking of receptors. The neural activity-regulated pentraxin Narp is a secreted protein that interacts with extracellular domains of GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 subunits and promotes synaptic clustering of receptors in certain neurons (12O'Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Neuron. 1999; 23: 309-323Google Scholar). Studies of other classes of membrane protein such as voltage-gated potassium channels indicate that subunit oligomerization can indirectly regulate membrane trafficking by controlling the exposure of anterograde or retrograde trafficking signals on the cytoplasmic surface (13Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Google Scholar, 14Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Google Scholar). Interestingly, a large deletion in the NTD of GluR2 that strongly inhibits subunit assembly did not disrupt surface expression of receptor subunits in non-neural cells (which do not express Narp) (15Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that additional mechanisms may exist that control the membrane trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are not dependent on Narp protein interactions or on subunit oligomerization itself. We have addressed this question by examining the surface targeting of epitope-tagged mutant versions of GluR1 and GluR2 expressed in heterologous non-neural cells and in cultured hippocampal neurons in which these subunits are endogenously expressed. Our results indicate that the extreme N terminus of both GluR1 and GluR2 contains a sequence that is required for anterograde membrane trafficking of glutamate receptor subunits to the plasma membrane and, when mutated, results in ER retention of subunits without detectably affecting subunit oligomerization. A core motif (IQI) is highly conserved across species and is required for ER export and surface expression of receptor subunits both in non-neural cells and in hippocampal neurons. Thus we propose that ionotropic glutamate receptors contain a Narp-independent anterograde trafficking signal in the extreme N-terminal extracellular domain. Standard molecular biology protocols were used to construct FLAG-tagged GluR1 proteins (16Lissin D.V. Gomperts S.N. Carroll R.C. Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Google Scholar, 17Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Google Scholar). Serial deletions in the extreme N terminus of GluR1 were performed by PCR-based mutagenesis, and all mutant constructs were sequenced to confirm there were no PCR errors. Alanine mutation of GluR1 was accomplished by incorporating the mutation in the PCR primers. All constructs were placed under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. CD4-GFP-KKYL was kindly provided by Lily Jan (University of California San Francisco) and HA-NR1 by S. Okabe (Tokyo, Japan). Hippocampal cell cultures were prepared as described previously (18Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were taken from P0 rat pups and the dentate gyri were removed. Tissue dissociation was facilitated by papain treatment and was followed by tituration with glass pipettes. Cells were plated on poly(d-lysine)-coated cover slips and grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. Media were changed by half on the day after plating and in part each week thereafter. Glial growth was inhibited by fluorodeoxyuridine after 1 week in culture. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells (both HEK 293 cells and primary hippocampal neurons (8–10 days in vitro)) were transfected using a calcium phosphate method (18Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Google Scholar) and were examined 2 days after transfection. All constructs were examined in at least three independent transfections. FLAG monoclonal antibody M1 (Sigma) was used at 1 μg/ml for either live feeding or permeabilized staining. For live surface labeling the FLAG antibody was diluted in conditioned medium and then incubated with cells for 15 min at 37 °C. The excess antibody was washed out, and the cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with non-permeabilizing blocking buffer (non-permeabilizing buffer: 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for at least 40 min before being stained with Alexa 568 conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). For permeabilized staining the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then blocked in permeabilizing buffer (permeabilizing buffer: 0.1% Triton X-100 in non-permeabilizing buffer) for at least 40 min. The primary antibody (anti-FLAG antibody) was then diluted in permeabilizing buffer and incubated with the cells for 1 h before they were stained with secondary antibody. Most experiments in this study first involved performing the live surface feeding procedure followed by the permeabilized staining procedure to label the intracellular protein using a different fluorophore. The antibody to the ER marker calnexin was from Stressgen, and the antibody to the Golgi marker coatmer protein (COP II) was a gift from Dr. Suzanne R. Pfeffer (Stanford University). Coverslips were mounted on slides with fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and cells were imaged using a 63× oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop2. Images were digitized using a cooled CCD camera (Hammamatsu) and were analyzed using Metamorph Software (Universal Imaging). For individual experiments images for all conditions were analyzed using identical acquisition parameters. Surface expression of constructs was visually obvious (>10 times background) and therefore not quantified in most experiments. To make a quantitative estimate of the relative surface expression of the FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1 construct compared with wild type FLAG-GluR1, a three-step amplification procedure was used (16Lissin D.V. Gomperts S.N. Carroll R.C. Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Google Scholar) with two modifications: the secondary antibody was a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), which was amplified using streptavidin-linked Alexa 564 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories); and the surface expression of FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1 was estimated by calculating the total surface immunofluorescence (above background) per unit cell area for cells expressing FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1 and directly comparing this value to that of cells expressing FLAG-GluR1 from the same culture preparation and using identical acquisition parameters. The levels of expression of the two constructs were comparable as measured by the total immunofluorescence obtained using our standard two-step procedure (primary antibody followed by fluorescent secondary antibody). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with two glutamate receptor subunits, and cells were harvested after 2 days of expression. The cells were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog number 1697498). After using a 25-gauge needle to break the cell membranes, the total extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were spun again at the same centrifugal force. The resulting supernatant was then subject to immunoprecipitation using FLAG monoclonal antibody (2 μg), which was added to 0.5-ml aliquots incubated on ice for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose (50 μl) was used to precipitate antibodies. Protein G pellets were washed three times with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured with loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) in duplicate. One membrane was probed with anti-FLAG antibody, and the other was probed with an anti-GluR2/3 antibody (Chemicon International) or an antibody against the C terminus of GluR1 (Chemicon International). For previous experiments designed to study mechanisms that control the surface expression of AMPA receptors, we epitope-tagged GluR1, a ubiquitous subunit of endogenous AMPA receptors on the very N terminus of its extracellular domain using a FLAG epitope tag sequence (Fig.1) (16Lissin D.V. Gomperts S.N. Carroll R.C. Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Google Scholar). To maintain the exact length of this extracellular domain the N-terminal first nine amino acids of the mature GluR1 (ANFPNNIQI) were replaced by the FLAG tag. Two assays suggested that this FLAG-tagged GluR1 construct produced functional AMPA receptors. When expressed in HEK 293 cells, application of agonist generated characteristic AMPA receptor-mediated currents, and when the currents were expressed in hippocampal neurons, we observed surface clusters of FLAG-GluR1 at synapses (16Lissin D.V. Gomperts S.N. Carroll R.C. Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Google Scholar). However, despite the robust overexpression of FLAG-GluR1 the amount of recombinant protein on the cell surface was relatively low when compared with endogenous AMPA receptors as evidenced by the relatively small currents that were generated in HEK 293 cells and the fact that a three-step amplification procedure was required to visualize the surface FLAG-GluR1 receptors (16Lissin D.V. Gomperts S.N. Carroll R.C. Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that the nine deleted N-terminal amino acids may play an important role in the normal surface expression of GluR1. To test this possibility we compared the surface expression of this original construct (now termed Flag-ND9-GluR1) with the full-length GluR1 tagged at the N terminus with FLAG (now termed FLAG-GluR1) (Fig.1). In both HEK 293 cells and hippocampal neurons, FLAG-GluR1 exhibited robust, easily detectable surface staining using a standard surface staining procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”) whereas FLAG-ND9-GluR1 yielded very low or undetectable surface expression (Fig. 2). This was not caused by significant differences in the level of expression of the two constructs, because permeabilized staining revealed that large amounts of recombinant GluR1 were present (Fig. 2). Thus whereas FLAG-ND9-GluR1 is capable of surface expression (16Lissin D.V. Gomperts S.N. Carroll R.C. Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Google Scholar), it is severely defective compared with full-length GluR1. Similar results were obtained when the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 was examined. FLAG-ND9-GluR2 showed minimal or no surface expression when expressed in either HEK 293 cells or hippocampal neurons (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the FLAG tag itself affects surface expression, we also examined the consequences of deleting these nine N-terminal amino acids in GluR1 that was not tagged with FLAG. When expressed in HEK 293 cells wild type GluR1 exhibited clear surface expression (detected by an antibody to an extracellular domain of GluR1 (19Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Google Scholar)), whereas ND9-GluR1 was not detectable on the cell surface (Fig.3). Again, permeabilized staining revealed that both proteins were robustly expressed. Two general mechanisms can account for the defect in surface expression of ND9-GluR1. One is that it cannot be transported normally through the biosynthetic pathway and rarely reaches the cell surface. The second possibility is that the mutation greatly enhances the endocytosis of GluR1 relative to its delivery to the cell surface, and thus very low levels of surface receptors are detected. To address this latter possibility we co-expressed FLAG-ND9-GluR1 with a dominant negative form of dynamin (mDynamin), which has been shown to block the endocytosis of endogenous AMPA receptors (19Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Google Scholar). Co-transfection with mDynamin still did not yield detectable surface expression of FLAG-ND9-GluR1, even though an increase in the surface expression of FLAG-GluR1 was observed when expressed with mDynamin (data not shown). An alternate way of blocking endocytosis is incubation of cells with a high concentration of sucrose, a manipulation that like the mDynamin blocked the endocytosis of endogenous AMPA receptors (19Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Google Scholar). However, incubation of HEK 293 cultures with 0.35 m sucrose for 30 min before the labeling procedure still did not result in detectable surface expression of FLAG-ND9-GluR1 (data not shown). These results suggest that some failure in its transport through the biosynthetic pathway accounts for the lack of surface expression of FLAG-ND9-GluR1. To begin to determine in which subcellular organelle FLAG-ND9-GluR1 is retained, we compared its intracellular localization with that of well established protein markers of the Golgi and ER. Co-labeling with an antibody to the ER marker calnexin showed near perfect co-localization (Fig.4 B), whereas co-labeling with an antibody to the Golgi marker COP II gave two distinct immunofluorescence patterns (Fig. 4 A). We also co-expressed FLAG-ND9-GluR1 with an ER marker protein CD4-gfp-KKYL (18Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Google Scholar, 20Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Google Scholar), and these two recombinant proteins exhibited strong co-localization (Fig.4 C) providing further evidence that FLAG-ND9-GluR1 appears to be trapped in the ER. Since transmembrane receptor proteins usually assemble in the ER before they are transported to the Golgi and the plasma membrane, it is possible that the trapping of FLAG-ND9-GluR1 in the ER occurred because it cannot assemble with other AMPA receptor subunits. To address this possibility we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments (15Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Google Scholar, 21Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Google Scholar) with co-expressed GluR2, which is known to assemble with GluR1 in the formation of endogenous AMPA receptors (22Wenthold R.J. Petralia R.S. Blahos J. II Niedzielski A.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1982-1989Google Scholar). FLAG-GluR1 and GluR2 were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells, and detergent (1% Triton X-100)-soluble fractions were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 5 shows that GluR2 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-GluR1, confirming that FLAG-GluR1 and GluR2 interact with each other. We then performed the same assay using FLAG-ND9-GluR1 and again found that immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged protein co-immunoprecipitated a substantial amount of GluR2 (Fig. 5). In control experiments using cells expressing FLAG-GluR1 only, immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody did not yield a band on SDS-PAGE after probing with the anti-GluR2/3 antibody (data not shown), indicating (as specified by the manufacturer) that this antibody does not cross-react with GluR1. To further test the specificity of this assay, we co-expressed FLAG-GluR1 or FLAG-ND9-GluR1 with HA-NR1 (23Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Google Scholar), an epitope-taggedN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit. As expected FLAG-GluR1 and FLAG-ND9-GluR1 co-immunoprecipitated a minimal amount of HA-NR1 (data not shown). Because FLAG-ND9-GluR1 still binds and presumably assembles with GluR2, we wondered whether GluR2 would rescue the surface expression of FLAG-ND9-GluR1. To test this we co-expressed FLAG-ND9-GluR1 and GluR2 in both HEK 293 cells and neurons, but in neither cell type did GluR2 rescue the surface expression of FLAG-ND9-GluR1 (data not shown). We next performed a more detailed mutational analysis to determine which of the nine amino acids deleted in FLAG-ND9-GluR1 are necessary for GluR1 surface expression. Surprisingly, the deletion of amino acids 2–6 (FLAG-ND5-GluR1:Δ(NFPNN)) (Fig. 1) did not impair the surface expression of GluR1 in either HEK 293 cells or hippocampal neurons (Fig. 6). In contrast, the deletion of the three-membrane proximal amino acids (FLAG-Δ(IQI)-GluR1) (Fig. 1) completely disrupted the surface expression of GluR1 in both cell types (Fig. 6) as did alanine scanning mutagenesis of these three amino acids (FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1) (Figs. 1 and 6). Thus the IQI motif at amino acids 7–9 appear to be necessary for the export of GluR1 out of the ER and hence surface expression. In a final set of experiments we attempted to estimate the relative percentage of the mutant constructs that can reach the plasma membrane of hippocampal neurons. To accomplish this we used the FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1 construct and performed a three-step amplification procedure to label surface receptors (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using this approach we were able to detect surface expression of FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1. However, the total surface immunoreactivity was only ∼6% of that of FLAG-GluR1. In independent experiments we estimated that ∼50–70% of the total FLAG-GluR1 reaches the cell surface, suggesting that only ∼3–4% of the mutant FLAG-(I7AQ8AI9A)-GluR1 reaches the plasma membrane. The main new finding from this work is that the extreme N termini of GluR1 and GluR2 are critical for their surface expression in both HEK 293 cells and hippocampal neurons. The specific amino acid motif IQI at positions 7–9, which is conserved in both GluR1 and GluR2, is particularly important in that it appears to be necessary for the export of the receptor out of the ER, although it is not required for binding to other subunits. Previous work suggests that the NTDs of AMPA receptor subunits are necessary for dimer formation (15Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Google Scholar, 24Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Google Scholar, 25Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Google Scholar), whereas further dimerization of two dimers to form a functional receptor is thought to be mediated by the interactions of the S2 and/or transmembrane domains (1Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Google Scholar, 24Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Google Scholar). The higher affinity association between NTDs and S2 domains within a subfamily determines the favorable association among intra-subfamily subunits (1Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Google Scholar, 15Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Google Scholar, 24Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Google Scholar). Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5) indicate that amino acids 1–9 of the very NTD of GluR1 are not required for dimer formation. Furthermore, the fact that folding generally occurs before assembly (26Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Google Scholar, 27Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Google Scholar) makes it unlikely that the mutant GluR1s are misfolded. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that ND9-GluR1 and wild type GluR1 show a similar degree of detergent solubility (data not shown). The very NTD of GluR1 could be required for export from the ER and surface expression in two general ways. First, it could be important for secondary dimerization if this process required both compatible S2 domains and full-length integral NTDs. The fact that the S1,S2 domain itself can form a dimer in crystal (28Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Google Scholar) makes this possibility unlikely. Second, the mutant GluR1 constructs could be fully capable of assembly into a functional receptor. However, the mutant GluR1 constructs could not be exported out of ER either because of the unmasking of an ER retention signal (13Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Google Scholar, 14Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Google Scholar, 18Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Google Scholar, 31Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Google Scholar) or because they are missing an ER forward trafficking signal. The unmasking of an ER retention signal seems unlikely because there were no clear ER retention signal-like motifs present in either GluR1 or GluR2 (29Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Google Scholar). On the other hand a forward trafficking signal has also been described in the intracellular domain of certain potassium channels (20Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Google Scholar) and provides a potential novel mode of regulation of receptor numbers on the plasma membrane. The proposal of an ER forward trafficking signal in the extracellular domain of GluR1 is provocative because the machinery regulating export from the ER is thought to be concentrated mainly in the cytosolic fraction, not in the lumen of the ER. However, in principle transport receptors could recognize luminal domains of membrane receptors as hypothesized for the selective transport of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules out of the ER (32Spiliotis E.T. Manley H. Osorio M. Zuniga M.C. Edidin M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 841-851Google Scholar). Narp, which clusters AMPA receptors via interactions with extracellular domains (12O'Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Neuron. 1999; 23: 309-323Google Scholar, 33Tsui C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Barnes C. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Google Scholar), is one protein that might interact with AMPA receptors in the ER lumen and facilitate their export. Another intriguing candidate for this function is stargazin, which is necessary for the trafficking of AMPA receptor to the plasma membrane (34Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Google Scholar). Interestingly, non-neural cells (i.e. HEK 293 cells and COS cells) do not express Narp (33Tsui C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Barnes C. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Google Scholar) or stargazin (34Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Google Scholar, 35Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett F.S. II Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Google Scholar), indicating that different AMPA receptor-interacting targeting proteins must exist in these cells. In summary, we have presented evidence that the extreme N terminus of GluR1, specifically the IQI motif at amino acids 7–9, is necessary for its normal trafficking out of the ER. Identical (in GluR2) or similar (VQI in GluR4) NTD motifs exist in other AMPA receptor subunits, suggesting that the same trafficking mechanisms likely apply to these subunits. It will be interesting in future studies to determine the mechanism by which this trafficking signal functions. As the mutations that disrupt ER export of glutamate receptor subunits did not detectably inhibit the formation of subunit oligomers, we favor the hypothesis that the IQI motif engages in a distinct protein interaction of the receptor ectodomain that is required for ER export. On the other hand we cannot rule out more subtle effects of the IQI sequence on heteromer formation itself, which might not be detectable by co-immunoprecipitation analysis of assembly and might secondarily affect the exposure of trafficking signals present in the cytoplasmic domain. In either case the present studies define a distinct sequence in the ectodomain of ionotropic glutamate receptors that functions as a novel anterograde membrane trafficking signal.

https://openalex.org/W2073602994,"FP prostanoid receptors have been identified as two isoforms named FPA and FPB. We have shown that the FPB isoform, but not the FPA, activates β-catenin-mediated transcription. We now report that the mechanism of this FPB-specific activation of β-catenin signaling occurs in two steps. The first is a conditioning step that involves an agonist-independent association of the FPBreceptor with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase followed by constitutive internalization of a receptor complex containing E-cadherin and β-catenin. This constitutive internalization conditions the cell for subsequent β-catenin signaling by increasing the cellular content of cytosolic β-catenin. The second step involves agonist-dependent activation of Rho followed by cell rounding. Because of the conditioning step, this agonist-dependent step results in a stabilization of β-catenin and activation of transcription. Although stimulation of the FPA isoform activates Rho and induces cellular shape change, it does not activate β-catenin signaling, because the FPA does not undergo constitutive internalization and does not condition the cell for β-catenin signaling. The cellular conditioning described here for the FPB illustrates the potential of the receptor to alter the signaling environment of a cell even in the absence of agonist and has general significance for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. FP prostanoid receptors have been identified as two isoforms named FPA and FPB. We have shown that the FPB isoform, but not the FPA, activates β-catenin-mediated transcription.

Prostaglandin F2α(PGF2α) 1The abbreviations used are: PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α; Tcf, T-cell factor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; IP, immunoprecipitation; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. is an important autacoid that regulates a variety of physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, intraocular pressure, and regression of corpus luteum. PGF2α is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenases and binds to FP prostanoid receptors to initiate its signaling cascade. FP receptors are in the family of prostanoid receptors, which in turn are in the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other prostanoid receptors include the EP, DP, IP, and TP receptors, which mediate, respectively, the actions of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin D2, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. The prostanoid receptor family also includes additional EP receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) and alternative mRNA splice variants of the EP1, EP3, TP, and FP receptors. The FP receptor splice variants are designated FPA and FPB and are identical except for their intracellular carboxyl-terminal domains. Thus, the FPB isoform is basically a truncated version of the FPA isoform, which lacks the last 46 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. Both receptor isoforms are coupled to Gq and can activate phosphatidylinositol signaling followed by the activation of protein kinase C. In addition both isoforms activate Rho, a member of the Ras family of small GTPases. The activation of Rho by FPA and FPB receptor isoforms leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase and the induction of cellular shape change involving the retraction of filopodia, cell rounding, and aggregation (1Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Google Scholar). Unexpectedly the reversal of this Rho-mediated shape change was found to differ markedly between the two isoforms following the removal of agonist (2Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Google Scholar). Thus, 1 h after the removal of PGF2α, FPA-expressing cells return to their original cellular morphology, whereas FPB-expressing cells remain rounded and still show evidence of Rho-mediated signaling, including the presence of actin stress fibers and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase. Even 16 h after the removal of PGF2α, FPB-expressing cells are still rounded. In addition we have found that stimulation of FPB-expressing cells with PGF2α produces a marked activation of Tcf/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation, which is not observed in FPA-expressing cells (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). We have recently documented another fundamental difference between these FP receptor isoforms (4Srinivasan D. Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 219-224Google Scholar). We have found that the FPAisoform undergoes a classic agonist-induced and clathrin-dependent internalization, whereas the FPB isoform undergoes an agonist-independent constitutive internalization that does not involve clathrin. We now report a molecular mechanism that we believe links the constitutive agonist-independent internalization of the FPB isoform with the selective activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by the FPB isoform. A key observation is that agonist-induced Tcf/β-catenin transcriptional activation by the FPBisoform was blocked by inhibition of Rho-mediated cellular shape change. Furthermore, we have found an association of the FPB isoform, but not the FPA isoform, with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which may explain its agonist-independent constitutive internalization. We hypothesize that constitutive internalization of the FPB isoform involving PI3K conditions FPB-expressing cells to subsequent agonist-induced Tcf/β-catenin signaling by increasing the cellular content of cytosolic β-catenin. HEK-293 cells stably expressing FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms (1Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Google Scholar), as well as FLAG-tagged FPA- and FPB-expressing cell lines (5Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358Google Scholar), were generated and cultured as described previously. Cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO or water), or 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma) for 15 min, or 40 μg/ml C3-toxin for 48 h at 37 °C. Then cells were incubated at 37 °C with either vehicle (sodium carbonate, 0.002% final) or 1 μm PGF2α(Cayman Chemical) for the times indicated in the figures. Cells were scraped and sonicated in a lysis buffer as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed, and the pellet (particulate fraction) was solubilized with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) and then centrifuged again to remove insoluble debris. For immunoprecipitation (IP), samples (200–300 μg of protein) were rotated at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h, or with anti-E-cadherin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) for 16 h, or with anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h, all at a dilution of 1:100. For the E-cadherin and β-catenin IPs, 10 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and rotated for another hour. Samples were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated in 3% nonfat milk with 1:1,000 dilutions of either anti-PI3K p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 2 h or a mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies to phospho-serine (Sigma) and phospho-threonine (Sigma) for 16 h (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). The membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 3% nonfat milk containing 1:10,000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Sigma) or anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma). The immunoblots were then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). To verify amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with 1:10,000 dilutions of either anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-E-cadherin, or anti-β-catenin antibody for 16 h in 3% nonfat milk under the same conditions as described above. For the immunoprecipitations of phospho-GSK-3β, cells were scraped into a lysis buffer as described previously (6Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar), and 100 μg of protein was electrophoresed then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and were washed and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in 0.5% nonfat milk containing either anti-phospho-GSK-3β antibody (#9336, Cell Signaling) or anti-GSK-3β antibody (G22320, Transduction Laboratories) as previously described (6Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). All antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Membranes were washed three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 0.5% nonfat milk for GSK-3β antibodies and then with a 1:10,000 dilution of the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. To ensure equal loading of proteins, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-GSK-3β antibodies under the same conditions as described above. The resulting films were scanned, and quantitation was performed as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 100 nmwortmannin for 15 min at 37 °C followed by stimulation with either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or 1 μmPGF2α for 1 h. Cells were then scraped in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and rotated for 20 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, samples were rotated with 500 μg of protein with anti-PI3K p85 for 2 h followed by the addition of 10 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for an additional hour. Samples were then washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with wash buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA followed by incubation with 0.1 mg/mll-α-phosphatidylinositol (Avanti polar lipids) in buffer containing 880 μm cold ATP with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 20 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 80 μl. To terminate the incubation, 20 μl of 8m HCl was added to the samples, and then the lipids were extracted with 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and centrifuged (300 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. The lower organic phases were removed and applied to an LK6D silica gel 60-Å TLC plate (Whatman). TLC plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (30:23.5:5.65:1, v/v) followed by drying and visualization by autoradiography using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 100 nmwortmannin for 15 min at 37 °C followed by stimulation with either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or 1 μmPGF2α for 1 h. They were then trypsinized, centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min, and resuspended at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in ice-cold MES buffer (2Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Google Scholar). [3H]PGF2α binding was performed using 2.5 nm [3H]PGF2α (AmershamBiosciences) as previously described (2Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the assays were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass filters using a cell harvester (M-24R, Brandel) (2Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Google Scholar). Cells were split and grown in six-well plates containing 22-mm round glass coverslips for 3–4 days. To evaluate agonist-dependent internalization, the cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of a 1:500 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibodies in vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or a 1:500 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibodies in 1 μm PGF2α for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies as previously described (4Srinivasan D. Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 219-224Google Scholar). The cells were then examined by scanning confocal microscopy as described previously (4Srinivasan D. Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 219-224Google Scholar). Cells were split and grown in six-well plates containing 22-mm round glass cover slips for 3–4 days. Cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO or water) or inhibitors, 100 nmwortmannin for 15 min, or 40 μg/ml C3-toxin for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or 1 μm PGF2αfor 1 h and were rapidly washed and fixed with methanol/acetone (7:3, v/v). The fixed cells were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of antibody to β-catenin in 3% bovine serum albumin and were then washed and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in 0.1% nonfat milk. Nuclei were stained with 0.05 nm/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy, as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). Cells, grown in six-well plates, were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 μg/well of either the TOP flash or FOP flash reporter plasmids (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO or water), 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min, or 40 μg/ml C3-toxin for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C with either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or 1 μm PGF2α for 1 h and were rapidly washed three times each with 1 ml/well Opti-MEM and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of Opti-MEM containing 250 μg/ml Geneticin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Cell extracts were prepared using the Luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar) using 10 μg of protein per sample. Measurements were corrected for background activity by subtraction of the FOP flash values from the corresponding TOP flash values. Cells were cultured in 6-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and pretreated either with vehicle (water) or 40 μg/ml C3-toxin for 48 h at 37 °C followed by preincubation with 3 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (AmershamBiosciences) for 16 h. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or 1 μmPGF2α for 1 h at 37 °C in culture media containing 10 mm LiCl. Assays were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol, and cells were scraped and added to 1.5 ml of chloroform/water (1:0.5, v/v). Total [3H]inositol phosphates were then determined by anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (5Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PGF2α can activate Tcf/β-catenin signaling in FPB-expressing cells but not in FPA-expressing cells (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). This selective activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by the FPB isoform was associated with an agonist-mediated increase in cytoplasmic β-catenin and a decrease in its phosphorylation status. Decreased phosphorylation stabilizes β-catenin levels by preventing its degradation and thereby promotes nuclear translocation and Tcf transcriptional activation. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the decrease in β-catenin phosphorylation following stimulation of the FPB receptor were unclear. One possible mechanism leading to decreased phosphorylation of β-catenin would involve the sequential activation of PI3K and Akt resulting in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Phosphorylation of GSK-3 inhibits its kinase activity and decreases β-catenin phosphorylation. The potential involvement of PI3K with FPB-mediated signaling was, therefore, explored in HEK cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged FPA and FPBreceptors that were treated with 1 μm PGF2αand then examined by a combination of immunoblotting with antibodies to p85 PI3K (Fig. 1, A andB) and measurement of PI3K activity (Fig. 1C). FLAG-tagged FP-expressing cell lines were selected as reported previously (5Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358Google Scholar) that had comparable levels of expression based on agonist-stimulated IP formation and on the radioligand binding (e.g. FPA, 3.56 ± 0.04 pmol/mg of protein; FPB, 2.15 ± 0.17 pmol/mg of protein). For the immunoblotting experiments the particulate fractions of cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies (M2) to the FLAG epitope. As shown in the upper panels of Fig. 1A, the p85 subunit of PI3K co-immunoprecipitated with the FPB receptor isoform but not with the FPAisoform. Interestingly the association of PI3K with the FPBisoform was disrupted by treatment with PGF2α indicating a preferential interaction with the unstimulated receptor. Thelower panels of Fig. 1A show that similar amounts of the FLAG-tagged FPA and FPB receptors were expressed in these cells and could be immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 antibodies. We then used wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, to see if the association of the p85 subunit with the FPB receptor was influenced by its kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, pretreatment of FPB-expressing cells with 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min significantly decreased the co-immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit with the FPBreceptor in the absence of PGF2α treatment. As in Fig. 1A, treatment with 1 μm PGF2αfor 1 h decreased the association of PI3K with the FPBreceptor both under control conditions and following pretreatment with wortmannin. PI3K activity was then determined under the same conditions as those used for the experiments in Fig. 1B, and the results are shown in Fig. 1C. PI3K activity was greater in FPB-expressing cells as compared with FPA-expressing cells and was decreased ∼50% in FPB-expressing cells after treatment with 1 μm PGF2α for 1 h. As expected, pretreatment with wortmannin decreased the PI3K activity in both vehicle-treated FPB cells and in cells treated with 1 μm PGF2α for 1 h. In summary, it appears that PI3K activity is required for an interaction with the FPB receptor and may, in fact, be induced by this interaction. This is supported by the observation that treatment of FPB-expressing cells with PGF2α decreases PI3K activity while at the same time decreasing its interaction with the receptor. It has been reported that the endocytosis of E-cadherin is regulated by Rac1 and that this may involve the activation of PI3K (7Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Google Scholar, 8Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that the endocytosis of E-cadherin involves a clathrin-independent mechanism (9Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Google Scholar). Recently we have found that the FPB receptor isoform undergoes an agonist-independent constitutive internalization that is also clathrin-independent, whereas, the FPA isoform undergoes agonist-induced internalization that is clathrin-dependent (4Srinivasan D. Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 219-224Google Scholar). Given the association of PI3K with the FPB isoform (shown in Fig. 1) we were interested in the potential role of PI3K with respect to the agonist-independent constitutive internalization of the FPB isoform. For these experiments HEK cells stably expressing the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms were pretreated with either vehicle or 100 nm wortmannin followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 μm PGF2α. Cell lines expressing wild type FP receptors were selected as reported previously (5Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358Google Scholar) that had comparable levels of expression based on agonist-stimulated IP formation and on the radioligand binding (e.g. FPA, 3.55 ± 0.28 pmol/mg of protein; FPB, 4.09 ± 0.49 pmol/mg of protein). Receptor desensitization and internalization were then assessed, respectively, by the whole cell binding of [3H]PGF2α(Fig. 2A) and by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with PGF2αresulted in a 50% decrease in [3H]PGF2αbinding in both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells (2Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Google Scholar). Interestingly pretreatment with wortmannin, alone, increased [3H]PGF2α binding in FPB cells, but not in FPA cells. This sensitization of [3H]PGF2α binding following wortmannin pretreatment, although slight, was statistically significant and was obtained consistently and repeatedly in FPB cells, but not in FPA cells. Fig. 2B shows the results of immunofluorescence microscopy of the FLAG-tagged FPA and FPB receptor isoforms using live cell labeling of cell surface receptors (4Srinivasan D. Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 219-224Google Scholar). A comparison of panels a andb shows that the FPA isoform is localized primarily on the cell surface membrane in vehicle-treated FPA cells and that following treatment with PGF2α the receptor undergoes extensive internalization. A comparison of panels c and d shows that pretreatment of FPA cells with wortmannin did not affect this pattern of receptor localization. In contrast, examination ofpanels e and f shows that the FPBisoform is localized both intracellularly and on the cell surface regardless of PGF2α treatment. This, as we have previously reported, reflects constitutive agonist-independent internalization of the FPB isoform. Comparison ofpanels e and g further shows that pretreatment with wortmannin reduced the intracellular localization of the FPB isoform in vehicle-treated FPB-expressing cells; this suggests that inhibition of PI3K blocked the constitutive agonist-independent internalization of the FPB isoform. This is consistent with the sensitization of [3H]PGF2α binding observed above following pretreatment of the FPB cells with wortmannin. The interaction of E-cadherin with β-catenin is well established (10Daniels D.L. Spnik K.E. Weis W.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown additional interaction between E-cadherin and PI3K (8Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Google Scholar). Having established an association between PI3K and the FPBreceptor (Fig. 1) and an effect of wortmannin on FPBreceptor localization (Fig. 2), we sought to determine the effects of wortmannin on the localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin in FPB-expressing HEK cells. Fig. 3 shows representative immunoblots (A) and the pooled densitometric analyses (B) for the expression of membrane associated (particulate) E-cadherin and β-catenin and for the expression of cytosolic β-catenin following pretreatment of FPA- and FPB-expressing cells with 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min. As we have previously reported, the expression of β-catenin is higher in FPB-expressing cells as compared with FPA-expressing cells in both the particulate and cytosolic fractions (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). We now show that the expression of particulate E-cadherin is also higher in FPB-expressing cells. Fig. 3B shows that wortmannin pretreatment of vehicle-treated FPB cells slightly, but significantly, increased the expression of membrane-associated (particulate) E-cadherin and β-catenin, while simultaneously decreasing the expression of cytosolic β-catenin. These increases in membrane-associated E-cadherin and β-catenin are very similar to the sensitization of [3H]PGF2α binding to the FPBreceptors observed in Fig. 2A following pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. As noted above, PI3K has recently been found to bind E-cadherin (8Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Google Scholar). The immunoblot shown in Fig. 3C confirms this interaction by showing co-immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit of PI3K with E-cadherin in both FPA- and FPB-expressing HEK cells. This figure also shows that PGF2α treatment of FPB-expressing cells increased the co-immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit with E-cadherin suggesting that PGF2αtreatment, which we have shown in Fig. 1C to inhibit PI3K activity, increases its association with E-cadherin. This conclusion is corroborated by the effects of the wortmannin pretreatment of vehicle-treated FPB cells, which also increased the co-immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit with E-cadherin. Notably, such corresponding changes were not observed in the FPA-expressing cells. One of the most pronounced effects of the treatment of FPB-expressing cells with PGF2α is a dramatic reorganization of the β-catenin as evidenced by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to β-catenin (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows this effect in which the localization of β-catenin is green and the nuclear staining of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is blue. Thus, a comparison ofpanels e and f shows that treatment with PGF2α causes a marked increase in β-catenin immunofluorescence in regions of cell to cell contact. A comparison ofpanels a and b shows that a corresponding reorganization of β-catenin does not occur in FPA-expressing cells after treatment with PGF2α. Pretreatment with wortmannin was used to determine the possible influence of PI3K activity on this PGF2α-induced reorganization of β-catenin. Comparison of panels e and g shows that wortmannin pretreatment of vehicle-treated FPB cells produced a slight increase in β-catenin immunofluorescence in regions of cell to cell adhesion. However, as shown by comparing panels g andh, wortmannin pretreatment of FPB-expressing cells did not have any major effect on the PGF2α-induced reorganization of β-catenin. Stabilization of β-catenin expression and the promotion of Tcf transcriptional activation involves the decreased phosphorylation of β-catenin and is directly influenced by the activity of GSK-3β. The activity of GSK-3β, in turn, is a function of its state of phosphorylation, and it is known that phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 9 inhibits its kinase activity (11Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of phospho-GSK-3β and phospho-β-catenin (Fig. 5A) and direct measurement of Tcf transcriptional activation (Fig. 5B) following pretreatment of FPB-expressing cells with wortmannin were, therefore, used to assess the potential role of PI3K on the PGF2α-induced activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of FPB-expressing cells with 1 μm PGF2α for 1 h increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (panel a) and was accompanied by a marked reduction in phosphorylation of cytosolic β-catenin (panel c). On the other hand, in FPA-expressing cells treatment with PGF2α had no apparent effect on the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (panel a), and there was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of cytosolic β-catenin (panel c). It would be expected, therefore, that following treatment with PGF2α the degradation of β-catenin would be favored in FPA-expressing cells, whereas, the stabilization of β-catenin and potential activation of transcription would be favored in FPB-expressing cells. In fact, as shown in Fig. 5B, this is what was found when transcriptional activation was measured with the use of the Tcf-responsive luciferase reporter gene. Thus, luciferase activity was stimulated ∼3-fold in PGF2α-treated FPB-expressing cells, whereas it was essentially unaffected in FPA-expressing cells as shown previously (3Fuj"

However, the molecular basis for alcohol modulation of 5-HT3receptor function has not been determined. Here we report that point mutations of the arginine at amino acid 222 in the N-terminal domain of the 5-HT3A receptor can alter the EC50 value of the 5-HT concentration-response curve. Some point mutations at amino acid 222 resulted in spontaneous opening of the 5-HT3A receptor channel and an inward current activated by ethanol in the absence of agonist. Among these mutant receptors, the amplitude of the current activated by ethanol in the absence of agonist was correlated with the amplitude of the current resulting from spontaneous channel openings, suggesting that the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol in the absence of agonist is, at least in part, dependent on the preexisting conformational equilibrium of the receptor protein. On the other hand, point mutations that conferred greater sensitivity to ethanol potentiation of agonist-activated responses were less sensitive or insensitive to ethanol in the absence of agonist. For these receptors, the magnitude of the potentiation of agonist-activated responses by ethanol was inversely correlated with the EC50values of the 5-HT concentration-response curves, suggesting that these mutations may modulate ethanol sensitivity of the receptor by altering the EC50 value of the receptor.

Initial molecular cloning studies identified a subunit, the 5-HT3A receptor, from different mammalian species (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1054-1062PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of this superfamily, the 5-HT3A receptor consists of a large N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TM), and a large intracellular domain (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies have detected the expression at high levels of the 5-HT3Areceptor subunit in the hindbrain, especially in the nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area (3Tecott L.H.

Several lines of evidence suggest that 5-HT3 receptors may play an important role in alcohol preference and reward mechanisms (9Grant K.A.

Recent clinical studies have provided evidence that ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, can reduce alcohol intake in early onset alcoholics (18Johnson B.A. Ait-Daoud N. Psychopharmacology. 2000; 149: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Johnson B.A. Roache J.D. Ait-Daoud N. Zanca N.A. Velazquez M. Psychopharmacology. 2002; 160: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ethanol action on 5-HT3 receptor function are not fully understood. On the cellular level, the potentiation of 5-HT3 receptor-mediated responses by ethanol was found to be inversely dependent on agonist concentration. The potentiation increased with decreasing agonist concentrations and was not observed in the presence of high agonist concentrations (16Yu D. Zhang L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Weight F.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1010-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lovinger D.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 122: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that ethanol slowed the desensitization rate of the current activated by 5-HT and increased maximal amplitude of current activated by DA, a partial agonist of the 5-HT3 receptor, suggesting that ethanol may act on channel gating through increasing the probability of channel opening (21Zhou Q. Verdoorn T.A. Lovinger D.M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Lovinger D.M. Sung K.W. Zhou Q. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Many recent investigations into the molecular mechanism of alcohol action have focused on GABAA and glycine receptors (23Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P.

Point mutations of several specific amino acids located in the second and third TMs of glycine and GABAA receptors have been shown to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol, suggesting that these residues may be crucial for the allosteric modulation of receptor function by ethanol. However, mechanistic studies of ethanol action in the absence of agonist have not been reported for ligand-gated ion channels. In addition, although some of the point mutations that alter the sensitivity of GABAA and glycine receptors to ethanol have been also found to be sensitive to ethanol in the absence of agonist (23Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the interrelationship between ethanol responses in the absence of agonist and ethanol potentiation of agonist-activated responses of these receptors remains unclear. Nevertheless, such studies have not been reported for 5-HT3 receptors. A previous study in our laboratory suggested that the N terminus of a chimeric nicotinic-serotonergic receptor may be involved in the mediation of ethanol sensitivity of that protein (16Yu D. Zhang L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Weight F.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1010-1016PubMed Google Scholar). However, that study did not provide information on the molecular sites that alter the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol. Here, we report that substitutions of an arginine (Arg) with a series of amino acid residues at 222 in the N-terminal domain, immediately preceding TM1 of the 5-HT3A receptor, can alter receptor sensitivity to ethanol and the EC50 value of the 5-HT concentration-response curve. Further, detailed analyses suggest that the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol in the absence and presence of agonist may be mediated through different molecular processes. Some of this work has been presented previously in preliminary forms (26Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Weight F.F. Alc. Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 58AGoogle Scholar, 27Hosoi M. Moradel E.M. Hu X.-Q. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Weight F.F. Zhang L. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2001; 27: 600Google Scholar). Point mutations of a cloned mouse 5-HT3A receptor were introduced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The authenticity of the DNA sequence through the mutation sites was confirmed by double strand DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Complementary RNA (cRNA) was synthesized in vitro from a linearized template cDNA with a mMACHINE RNA transcription kit (Ambion Inc.). The oocytes of matureXenopus laevis frogs were isolated as described previously (28Zhang L. Oz M. Weight F.F. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each oocyte was injected with a total of 20 ng of RNA in 20 nl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and was incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After incubation for 2–5 days, the oocytes were studied at 20–22 °C in a 90-μl chamber. The oocytes were superfused with modified Barth's solution at a rate of ∼6 ml/min. Agonists and antagonists were diluted in the bathing solution and applied to the oocytes for a specified time, using a solenoid valve-controlled superfusion system (Automate Scientific). Membrane currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage-clamp at a holding potential of −70 mV, using a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data were routinely recorded on a chart recorder (Gould 2300S). Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. To determine [3H]5-HT binding, we used the single-oocyte binding method (29Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, oocytes injected with the cRNA of the wild type (WT) and mutant 5-HT3A receptors were prescreened by two-electrode voltage-clamp at −70 mV. Oocytes with current amplitudes from 4 to 6 μA in response to 100 μm5-HT were selected and held individually by suction at the end of a Pasteur pipette tip. The oocyte was first incubated at 20–22 °C for 30 s in 300 nm [3H]5-HT solution (specific activity = 20 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and then rinsed for 6 s in 150 ml of ice-cold modified Barth's bathing solution to remove free [3H] ligands from the oocyte surface. The nonspecific binding was determined by incubation in 300 μm unlabeled 5-HT. The specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. Each sample is the average from three or four oocytes, and each data point is the average from at least three or four separate experiments. The radioactivity (cpm) of each sample was determined in a 1409 DSA Wallac liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The association and dissociation rate constants were calculated using the following equation. kon=kobs−koff/[C]Equation 1 k obs is the observed rate constant (s−1), determined from fitting a one-phase exponential association equation: Y = Y max(1 − e −kX), [C] is the concentration of radioligand used, and k off is the dissociation rate constant. K d(BC50), B max, andk off were determined by equilibrium and competitive binding data using Prism Software (GraphPad). Statistical analysis of concentration-response curves was performed using the following form of the Hill equation. I=Imax1+(EC50/[A])nEquation 2 I is the peak current at a given concentration of agonist A, I max is the maximal response, EC50 is the half-maximal concentration, andn is the slope factor (apparent Hill coefficient). Data were statistically compared by the unpaired t test or ANOVA analysis. Correlation analysis was carried out using nonparametric regression or linear regression (Statistica, StatSoft). Although molecular cloning has identified two subtypes of 5-HT3 receptors, 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 30Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), the 5-HT3A receptor is thought to be an essential component of all serotonin-gated ion channels. Fig.1 A shows three consecutive arginine residues at 220, 221, and 222 of the 5-HT3Areceptor. These arginines, which are highly conserved across 5-HT3A receptors from different species, were predicted by computational modeling to be important structural elements for activation of the 5-HT3 receptor (31Aprison M.H. Galvez-Ruano E. Lipkowitz K.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of these arginines, each of the residues (positions 220–222) was replaced with alanine. The R221A mutant receptor was not functional (data not shown), indicating that the arginine at 221 is critical for activation of the 5-HT3 receptor. In contrast, the R220A and R222A mutant receptors were functional when expressed inXenopus oocytes. The maximal amplitudes of currents activated by 5-HT were not significantly different among the WT, R220A, and R222A mutant receptors (p > 0.05; TableI). However, the alanine substitution at amino acid 222, but not at 220, significantly decreased the EC50 value of the 5-HT concentration-response curve (Fig.1 B; Table I). Next, we examined whether the R222A mutation alters the sensitivity of the receptor to 2-methyl-5-HT (2-Met-5-HT), a partial agonist of the 5-HT3 receptor. Fig. 1 Bshows that the R222A mutation also significantly shifted the 2-Met-5-HT concentration-response curve to the left. The EC50 values of the 5-HT and 2-Met-5-HT concentration-response curves for the R222A mutant receptors were approximately 70- and 14-fold lower, respectively, than those of the WT 5-HT3A receptor (n = 6; p < 0.01). The EC50 value and the Hill coefficient for 2-Met-5-HT were 13 ± 0.4 μm and 1.8, respectively, for the WT receptors, and 0.9 ± 0.2 μm and 1.6, respectively, for the R222A receptors. The R222A mutation increased the efficacy of 2-Met-5-HT from 45 ± 3% to 99 ± 6% of the maximal 5-HT-activated response; these values were significantly different (unpaired t test, p < 0.001,n = 5–7). To determine whether the R222A mutation affects receptor binding, we conducted receptor-binding experiments using a single-oocyte ligand-binding method described previously (29Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The time constants of [3H]5-HT association were 9.1 ± 1.3 s for the WT receptors and 7.2 ± 1.1 s for the R222A receptors, and the dissociation rates were 0.9 ± 0.3 s for the WT receptors and 0.8 ± 0.1 s for the R222A receptors; these values were not significantly different (unpairedt test, p > 0.6). Fig. 1 Cillustrates receptor-binding data for the WT and R222A mutant 5-HT3A receptors. The 5-HT concentration-response curves of 0.3 μm [3H]5-HT binding for the WT receptors (open circles) and for the R222A mutants (solid circles) are superimposed. The values of BC50 and the Hill coefficient were 0.67 ± 0.07 μm and 1.8 ± 0.1, respectively, for the WT 5-HT3A receptors and 0.52 ± 0.06 μm and 1.7 ± 0.1, respectively, for the R222A mutant receptors; these values were not significantly different (unpaired t test,p > 0.1). These results suggest that the R222A mutation decreases the EC50 of 5-HT3A receptor through modulation of receptor gating. To understand the structure-function role of the amino acid residue at 222 of the 5-HT3A receptor, the arginine at 222 was replaced by various amino acids and the function of each mutant receptor was examined by a two-electrode voltage-clamp in Xenopusoocytes. Except for R222K (Lys), a positively charged amino acid residue, the other point mutations at 222 significantly decreased the EC50 value of the 5-HT concentration-response curve by 5–100-fold (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 D). The values of EC50, Hill coefficient, andI max for 5-HT are given in Table I. It should be noted that the effect of the R222A mutation appeared to be site-specific because replacing an arginine with an alanine at 220 (R220A) did not significantly alter the sensitivity of the receptor to 5-HT (Fig. 1 D; Table I).Table ISummary of the properties of the WT and mutant 5-HT3A receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytesReceptor5-HT EC50Hill slopeI maxμmμmWT1.58 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.5R220A1.30 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.4R222A0.02 ± 0.01*2.1 ± 0.2*4.5 ± 0.6R222E0.04 ± 0.02*1.5 ± 0.14.6 ± 0.4R222I0.06 ± 0.01*1.4 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.1*R222Q0.07 ± 0.01*1.2 ± 0.35.6 ± 1.3R222G0.09 ± 0.01*1.2 ± 0.13.9 ± 0.2R222F0.09 ± 0.01*0.9 ± 0.1*1.2 ± 0.3*R222D0.13 ± 0.01*1.9 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.4R222T0.30 ± 0.01*1.6 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.5*R222N0.32 ± 0.01*1.5 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.5R222H0.60 ± 0.3*1.3 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.3R222K2.10 ± 0.4*1.7 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.6The average values of EC50, Hill coefficient (n), and I max of the 5-HT concentration-response curves are given for each receptor as mean ± S.E.

Whereas ethanol at 100 mm did not induce detectable current (Fig. 2 A) in cells injected with cRNAs of the WT or R222K 5-HT3Areceptors, 100 mm ethanol activated an inward current in cells expressing mutant receptors replaced with Gly and Phe at position 222. In Fig. 2 B, the inward current activated by 200 mm ethanol for the mutant receptors was normalized and presented as percentage of the maximal response activated by 5-HT (Fig.2 B). In the cells expressing the mutant receptors replaced with Phe, Ile, Gly, Gln, and Asp at 222, 200 mm ethanol activated an inward current in the absence of agonist; however, R220A, R222A/T/E/N/H/K, and WT receptors were less sensitive or insensitive to this concentration of ethanol in the absence of agonist. On average, the order of magnitude of the agonist-independent effect by 200 mm ethanol for the mutant receptors was: Phe (13 ± 1.1%) > Ile (9.5 ± 0.6%) > Gly (7.3 ± 1.2%) > Gln (5.0 ± 1.1%) > Asp (4.9 ± 1.1%) > Ala (1.0 ± 0.4%) > Thr (0.53 ± 0.2%) > Glu (0.43 ± 0.1%) = Asn (0.2 ± 0.2%) = His (0.1 ± 0.05%) = Lys (0 ± 0%) = WT (0 ± 0%). The inward currents induced by ethanol appeared to be mediated through the mutant 5-HT3A receptors because MDL-72222 (MDL), a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, inhibited the currents activated by ethanol in cells expressing R222G receptors (Fig. 2 C). In these cells, both MDL and another selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, LY 278,584 (LY), potently reduced the amplitude of the inward current activated by ethanol in the absence of agonist in a concentration-dependent manner over a concentration range from 0.1 to 300 nm (Fig. 2 D). The IC50 values of MDL and LY inhibition were 6.7 ± 0.3 and 11 ± 1 nm, respectively; the slope factors were 1.3 ± 0.2 and 1.2 ± 0.1, respectively; and the maximal values of inhibition were 86 ± 6 and 79 ± 5%, respectively. To study further the mechanism of MDL inhibition, we examined the effect of 10 nm MDL on the inward current activated by various concentrations of ethanol (Fig. 2 E). In cells expressing R222G receptors, MDL at 10 nm reduced the amplitude of inward current induced by ethanol at concentrations of 30, 60, 100, and 200 mm by 63 ± 8, 59 ± 5, 65 ± 8, and 60 ± 6%, respectively. These values were not significantly different (p > 0.2, ANOVA,n = 5), suggesting that the inhibition by MDL is independent of ethanol concentration. These results indicate that some point mutations at 222 of the 5-HT3A receptor can increase the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol in the absence of agonist. Previous studies have reported that point mutations in the TM domains of nicotinic acetylcholine α7 and GABAA receptors can result in spontaneously opening or constitutively active channels (32Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2542-2551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine whether point mutations at 222 of 5-HT3Areceptors can induce spontaneously active channels, we applied MDL, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, to cells expressing WT and mutant 5-HT3A receptors. Fig.3 A shows that, as a result of MDL inhibiting spontaneous channel opening, 300 nm MDL (300 nm) induced outward current in cells expressing R222G or R222F mutants, but not in cells expressing WT or R222K receptors. The order (Fig. 3 B) of the average amplitude of the outward current activated by MDL (300 nm) for those mutant receptors was: R222F (Phe) > R222I (Ile) > R222Q (Gln) > R222G (Gly) > R222D (Asp) > R222A (Ala) > R222N (Asn) = R222T (Thr) = R222E (Glu). In cells expressing WT (Arg-222), R222H, R222K, and R220A receptors, MDL (300 nm) did not activate detectable outward current. Because the amino acid residues at 222 of the WT (Arg-222), R222K, and R222H are positively charged, this result suggests that the positive charge at 222 may be critical for stabilizing the receptor channels in a closed state. The amplitude of the outward current activated by 300 nm MDL (Fig. 3 C) was significantly correlated with the amplitude of the current activated by 200 mm ethanol (SR = 0.96;p < 0.003, nonparametric regression, Statistica), indicating that the magnitude of the ethanol-induced inward current in the absence of agonist correlates with the magnitude of the spontaneous openings of the mutant ion channels. Next, we examined whether or not point mutations of Arg-222 can affect the ethanol sensitivity of 5-HT responses of 5-HT3A receptors. The trace records in Fig. 4 illustrate the effect of ethanol at 100 and 200 mm on the 5-HT responses of WT, R222K, R222E, or R222A mutant receptors. The inward currents were activated by 5-HT at the EC5 concentration for that receptor. In cells expressing the WT receptors, ethanol potentiated the inward currents activated by 5-HT. The magnitude of the potentiation by ethanol decreased in cells expressing the R222K receptors. On the other hand, the magnitude of the potentiation by ethanol increased in cells expressing the R222E or R222A receptors. Thus, the 5-HT responses of these receptors are differentially sensitive to ethanol. As shown above, the WT and mutant 222 receptors could be differentially sensitive to ethanol in the absence and presence of agonist. To determine the effects of mutations at 222 on ethanol modulation of the 5-HT3A receptors, we compared the ethanol-induced inward current in the absence of agonist with ethanol potentiation of 5-HT responses for the WT and mutant 5-HT3Areceptors. As shown in Fig.5 A, ethanol-activated current for the mutant R222F/I/G/Q/D receptors was concentration-dependent over a concentration range of 10–200 mm. In contrast, Fig. 5 B shows that the mutant R220A, R222A/E/N/T/H/K, and WT receptors were insensitive or relatively insensitive to ethanol concentrations up to 200 mm in the absence of agonist. In view of these results, we divided the WT and mutant receptors into two groups based on their sensitivity to ethanol in the absence of agonist. Group 1 included the receptors in which ethanol activated inward current in the absence of agonist. Group 2 included receptors in which ethanol did not activate significant inward current in the absence of agonist. On the other hand, we also found that the ethanol sensitivity of 5-HT-activated responses differed for the group 1 and group 2 receptors. Fig.5 C shows that ethanol, at concentrations from 10 to 200 mm, did not significantly affect the amplitude of current activated by low concentrations (EC5) of 5-HT in cells expressing the group 1 receptors, whereas Fig. 5 D shows that ethanol significantly enhanced responses activated by 5-HT at EC5 concentrations in cells expressing the group 2 receptors (p < 0.01). To determine whether the ethanol-induced inward current in the absence of agonist correlates with ethanol potentiation of agonist responses, we compared the sensitivity of the WT and mutant 5-HT3A receptors to ethanol in the absence or presence of 5-HT (Fig. 5 E). The result in Fig. 5 E indicates that these receptors clearly differed in their sensitivity to ethanol in the absence and presence of agonist. There was no correlation between ethanol-induced inward current in the absence of agonist and ethanol potentiation of agonist responses (Fig. 5 E; R = −0.41,p = 0.1, linear regression, n = 13). To gain insight into the structure-function relationship of the point mutations at 222, we used correlation analysis to compare the magnitudes of the direct action of ethanol and the ethanol potentiation with isoelectric point (pI) (34Lehninger A.L.

The parasite is adapted to survive in these very different host environments by producing upon entering its new environment distinct protective surface coats of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; aq.HF, 48% aqueous hydrogen fluoride; ES-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; ES-MS-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry; GARP, glutamic acid and alanine-rich protein; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; aq.HF, 48% aqueous hydrogen fluoride; ES-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; ES-MS-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry; GARP, glutamic acid and alanine-rich protein; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.-anchored glycoprotein. The bloodstream form trypanosome is covered with variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), and the large repertoire of VSG genes allows the parasite to evade the mammalian immune system by antigenic variation (1Cross G.A.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 283-291Google Scholar, 2Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Google Scholar, 3Vanhamme L. Pays E. McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 338-343Google Scholar). In the tsetse, the trypanosome differentiates to the procyclic form, sheds its VSG coat and produces a new layer of glycoprotein. In Trypanosoma brucei, the procyclic and epimastigote stage glycoproteins belong to the procyclin family composed mainly of repeat sequences (4Mowatt M.R. Clayton C.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 7: 2838-2844Google Scholar, 5Roditi I. Carrington M. Turner M. Nature. 1987; 325: 272-274Google Scholar, 6Roditi I. Schwarz H. Pearson T.W. Beechroft R.P. Liu M.K. Richardson J.P. Buhring H.J. Pleiss J. Bulow R. Williams R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 737-746Google Scholar). There are two types of procyclin termed “EP” and “GPEET,” which differ in their repeat sequences (7Treuman A. Zitzman N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Google Scholar, 8Butikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Google Scholar, 9Acosta-Serrano A. Cole R.N. Mehlert A. Lee M.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29763-29771Google Scholar). The procyclins provide a highly acidic protease-resistant coat that is proposed to help the parasite survive in the harsh environment of the tsetse fly gut. It has recently been shown that the non-repetitive N-terminal domains of T. brucei procyclins are cleaved during exposure to the tsetse, whereas the majority of the protein remains stable (10Acosta-Serrano A. Vassella E. Liniger M. Renggli C.K. Brun R. Roditi I. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1513-1518Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that the procyclins function to protect the parasite surface from digestive enzymes. Extensive structural characterization of the procyclins has revealed an unusually large and complex GPI anchor (7Treuman A. Zitzman N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Google Scholar, 8Butikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Google Scholar, 11Ferguson M.A.J. Murray P. Rutherford H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 51-55Google Scholar), which may also be important for parasite survival. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) portion of the GPI anchor contains al-glycerolipid and is acylated on the 2-hydroxyl of the inositol ring. The latter feature makes it resistant to the action of phospholipase C, PI-phospholipase C (7Treuman A. Zitzman N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Google Scholar).In Trypanosoma congolense, the corresponding procyclic surface coat is comparatively uncharacterized. In 1993, two groups (12Bayne R.A. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Google Scholar,13Beechcroft R.P. Roditi I. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 285-294Google Scholar) independently described the identification of a major surface antigen on procyclic T. congolense. A gene encoding this protein was cloned by differential screening of a procyclicT. congolense cDNA library and named GARP for glutamate and alanine-rich protein (12Bayne R.A. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Google Scholar). GARP is one of at least three major surface glycoconjugates in T. congolense (14Butikofer P. Vassella E. Boschung M. Renggli C.K. Brun R. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 7-16Google Scholar), and it contains no repeat sequences and shares no homology with T. brucei procyclins. However, the molecules are thought to be functionally equivalent because they share stage specificity, surface disposition, and immunodominance. Furthermore, the introduction of GARP into procyclin-deficient T. brucei restored the ability of the null mutant to establish heavy infection in the tsetse mid-gut (15Ruepp S. Kurath U. Renggli C.K. Brun R. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 151-156Google Scholar).Southern analysis of DNA from one strain of T. congolensehas shown that multiple GARP genes exist at two distinct loci (16Rangarajan D. Harvey T.I. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 281-290Google Scholar). At the first locus, GARP1, there is a single gene (gA), whereas locus GARP2 exhibits allelic variation with ten GARP genes at one allele and six at the other allele. The sequences of six of the GARP2 genes (gB1–6) have been reported (16Rangarajan D. Harvey T.I. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 281-290Google Scholar) and are highly conserved (Fig. 1).Immunogold electron microscopy has shown dense packing of GARP on theT. congolense cell surface (12Bayne R.A. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Google Scholar), but little is known regarding the structure of the glycoprotein and its GPI anchor. Here, we set out to purify and characterize T. congolense GARP. Using a combination of mass spectrometry techniques along with enzymatic and chemical treatments, we have determined the partial structure of GARP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureT. congolense TREU 1457 procyclic/epimastigote cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 10% serum plus (JRH Bioscience) at 27 °C. Cultures were maintained by diluting into fresh medium, ensuring a concentration of a least 1 × 106cells/ml−1.Purification of GlycoconjugatesT. congolense (1010 cells) were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was extracted twice with 10 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8 v/v). After centrifugation, the pellet was dried under a stream of N2 and extracted twice in 10 ml of 5% 1-propanol in 100 mm ammonium acetate (Solvent A). The extract was centrifuged (15700 × g, 10 min) and loaded at 5 ml/h−1onto an octyl-Sepharose column (15 × 1 cm) preequilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 20 ml of Solvent A and eluted at 10 ml/h−1with a 120-ml linear gradient from Solvent A to 60% 1-propanol in water. Fractions (1 ml) were collected. To separate GARP from co-eluting glycolipids, peak fractions were applied to a longer octyl-Sepharose column (35 × 1 cm) and eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient from 10% 1-propanol in 100 mmNH4Ac to 40% 1-propanol. The separation of GARP from co-eluting glycolipids was followed by dot blotting as described below. Small-scale octyl-Sepharose chromatography of a tryptic digest of GARP was performed on a 1-ml column eluted with a 40-ml gradient from Solvent A to 60% 1-propanol.Dot Blot Analysis of Column FractionsAliquots (1 μl) of the octyl-Sepharose fractions were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Membranes were then probed with either anti-GARP rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the GARP peptide sequence or a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against an unknown carbohydrate epitope (12Bayne R.A. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:5000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three times in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 5 min for each wash. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Scottish Antibody Production Unit, Lanarkshire, United Kingdom) were diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before washing as described above. The immunoprobed dots were detected using ECL-Plus detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot AnalysisSamples of GARP and glycoinositol phospholipids were resolved on polyacrylamide mini-gels (12–15%) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a semi-dry blot apparatus (Hoefer) at 20 mA/gel. GARP and glycoinositol phospholipids bound to the membrane were detected as described above for the immunoprobing of dot blots.Periodate Silver Staining of SDS-PAGE GelsGARP-containing SDS-PAGE gels were stained with periodate silver according to a previously described method (17Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Google Scholar, 18Hitchcock P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 685-688Google Scholar). Gels were fixed overnight in ethanol, acetic acid, and water (40:5:55 v/v) and then oxidized in 0.7% (w/v) sodium periodate dissolved in fixing solution for 15 min with gentle agitation. Gels were then washed three times in 500 of ml water before incubating in silver nitrate solution, which was made fresh by adding 1 ml of 0.2 g/ml−1 AgNO3dropwise to a mixture of 5.6 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and 0.4 ml of c.NH4O, diluting with 17 ml of water and mixing gently for 15 min. Gels were then washed three times in 500 ml of water and developed with 200 ml of 0.05 mg/ml−1 citric acid, 0.1% (v/v) formaldehyde.Enzymatic and Chemical CleavagesMild Acid HydrolysisGARP was treated with 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min at 100 °C. After hydrolysis, samples were dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in water.Aqueous Hydrogen Fluoride (aq.HF) DephosphorylationDried samples were treated with 50 μl of 48% aq.HF at 0 °C for 48 h before freeze-drying to remove the aq.HF. Samples were then dried twice from 50 μl of water to remove residual HF.Tryptic DigestsFor in-gel digests, GARP was localized by staining with Sypro Ruby and processed according to a method described previously (19Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). For off-blot tryptic digests, GARP was localized by immunostaining of adjacent lanes with anti-GARP antibodies. The unstained GARP-containing nitrocellulose band was cut into 1-mm2 pieces, and sufficient 1% n-octyl glucoside in 20 mm NH4HCO3 was added to cover the nitrocellulose pieces. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 30–50 μg/ml−1. The samples were incubated overnight at 30 °C on a shaking platform.Off-blot Release and Extraction of GARP PIA 500-pmol aliquot of purified GARP was run on SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto PVDF membrane. The band containing GARP and a negative control band with no protein were excised and deaminated with 800 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and 800 μl of fresh 1 m NaNO2 at 37 °C for 3 h. The PVDF membrane was washed three times with 0.5 ml of water and then extracted three times with 0.5 ml of water-saturated butan-1-ol with vortexing for 20 min followed by 10 min of sonication. The combined butanol extracts were dried, resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol 4:1 (v/v), and applied to a small (100–200 μl) Silica gel (Si60, Merck) column prewashed with 10 volumes of chloroform/methanol 4:1 (v/v). The column was then washed with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol 4:1 (v/v), and the PIs were subsequently eluted in 10 volumes of chloroform/methanol 1:4 (v/v) for analysis by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS).ES-MS and ES-MS-MSNegative ion electrospray mass spectra were recorded on either a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole instrument or a Micromass Q-Tof2 instrument. Samples were infused in chloroform/methanol 1:4 at either 5 μl/min−1 (Quattro Ultima) or using a nanospray tip (Q-Tof2). The capillary/tip and cone voltages were 2.7 kV and 50 V (Quattro Ultima) or 900 V and 40 V (Q-Tof2). Daughter ion ES-MS-MS spectra were recorded on the Q-Tof2 with a collision energy of 45 V.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass SpectrometryPositive ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra of GARP were acquired on an ABI Voyager DE-STR instrument in linear mode using sinapinic acid as the matrix. Tryptic digests of GARP (aliquots of 0. 5 μl) were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix for analysis by positive ion reflectron mode, MALDI-TOF.Composition AnalysisThe carbohydrate and inositol contents of purified GARP were determined from GARP, transferred to PVDF membrane by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted using fresh transfer buffers. The GARP band was excised from the PVDF membrane along with bands directly above and below the GARP band as negative controls. The PVDF strips were placed in 2-ml glass Reacti-Vials (Pierce) containing 250 μl of 4 mtrifluoroacetic acid in 25% methanol and incubated at 100 °C for 4 h. The PVDF strips were removed, and the hydrolysates were dried in a SpeedVac and redried twice from 50 μl of water to remove residual trifluoroacetic acid. The products were redissolved in 100 μl of water containing [1,2,3,4,5,6-2H]myo-inositol andscyllo-inositol internal standards, and samples were transferred to capillary tubes for standard inositol and monosaccharide analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (20Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-230Google Scholar).CONCLUSIONSBased on the data described in this paper, we can propose a partial structure for T. congolense GARP (Fig. 5). The model proposes that GARP has a GPI anchor similar to that of T. brucei procyclin but with a higher degree of unsaturation in the fatty acid attached to the inositol ring. In contrast to procyclin, GARP does not contain a highly modified GPI anchor rich in poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats. Instead, GARP contains two large Man and Gal-rich oligosaccharides linked via phosphodiester bonds to two Thr residues. Thus, GARP contains some features of procyclin together with features described in the Leishmania proteophosphoglycans (31Ilg T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 489-497Google Scholar, 32Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24073-24081Google Scholar),T. cruzi glycoprotein 72 (33), and Entamoeba histolytica proteophosphoglycans (46Moody-Haupt S. Patterson J.H. Mirelman D. McConville M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 409-420Google Scholar), namely Ser/Thr-linked phosphoglycan chains. The fundamental differences between procyclin structure and GARP structure in terms of post-translational modifications calls into question the relevance of the rescue of procyclin-deficient T. brucei procyclic cells withGARP genes (15Ruepp S. Kurath U. Renggli C.K. Brun R. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 151-156Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect GARP to be processed similar to procyclin and to bear a highly substituted GPI anchor but no phosphoglycan chains when expressed in T. brucei and to bear little resemblance to GARP expressed in T. congolense. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the surface ofT. congolense cells invariably are glycan-specific (12Bayne R.A. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Google Scholar, 13Beechcroft R.P. Roditi I. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 285-294Google Scholar), and the large phosphothreonine-linked Man and Gal-rich oligosaccharides probably include the epitopes involved. If so, these or related structures appear to be present on the recently described protease-resistant surface molecule of procyclic T. congolense, which also binds these monoclonal antibodies (14Butikofer P. Vassella E. Boschung M. Renggli C.K. Brun R. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 7-16Google Scholar). Judging from monoclonal antibody binding, these carbohydrate epitopes are present on trypanosomes early and late in tsetse infection but are usually absent from those in established mid-gut infections (14Butikofer P. Vassella E. Boschung M. Renggli C.K. Brun R. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 7-16Google Scholar). The functional significance of these glycans is presently unclear.Figure 5Model of GARP structure.

The separation of GARP from co-eluting glycolipids was followed by dot blotting as described below. Small-scale octyl-Sepharose chromatography of a tryptic digest of GARP was performed on a 1-ml column eluted with a 40-ml gradient from Solvent A to 60% 1-propanol.Dot Blot Analysis of Column FractionsAliquots (1 μl) of the octyl-Sepharose fractions were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Membranes were then probed with either anti-GARP rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the GARP peptide sequence or a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against an unknown carbohydrate epitope (12Bayne R.A. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:5000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three times in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 5 min for each wash. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Scottish Antibody Production Unit, Lanarkshire, United Kingdom) were diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before washing as described above.

https://openalex.org/W2028754801,"A major challenge in protein folding is to identify and quantify specific structural determinants that allow native proteins to acquire their unique folded structures. Here we report the engineering of a 52-residue protein (Ala-14) that contains exclusively alanine residues at the hydrophobic a andd positions of a natural heptad-repeat sequence. Ala-14 is unfolded under normal solution conditions yet forms a parallel three-stranded α-helical coiled coil in crystals. Ala-14 trimers in the solid state associate with each other through the pairing of polar side chains and formation of an extended network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds. In contrast to the classical view that local intramolecular tertiary interactions dictate the three-dimensional structure of small single-domain proteins, Ala-14 shows that long range intermolecular interactions can be essential in determining the metastable alanine-zipper structure. A similar interplay between short range local and longer range global forces may underlie the conformational properties of the growing class of natively unstructured proteins in biological processes.

The classical view of protein folding posits that local secondary and tertiary interactions promote the association of cooperative structural elements in a process of sequential stabilization to form a limited set of transient intermediates and finally the native state (1–12). The current theory emphasizes the role of the free energy landscape of a polypeptide chain in driving rapid and efficient folding into a unique well defined structure (13Bryngelson J.D. Onuchic J.N. Socci N.D. Wolynes P.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 167-195Google Scholar, 14Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Google Scholar, 15Pande V.S. Grosberg A. Tanaka T.

Sali A. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 331-339Google Scholar). In any description of protein folding, a major challenge is to identify specific structural determinants that guide the folding process. Although considerable progress has been achieved toward understanding how compact single-domain proteins fold (1–12), the factors that specify and stabilize larger and more extended protein complexes remain largely undefined despite their critical importance in the complex environment inside a living cell. We report here a new alanine-zipper structure that undergoes a native folding transition only during crystallization. A network of long range solvent-mediated interactions is observed in the 1.3-Å x-ray crystal structure of this alanine-zipper trimer that appears to directly control its folding into a helical trimer structure. Plasmid pAla14 encoding Ala-14 was derived from pLpp56 (Ref. 18Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1101-1112Google Scholar). The sequence Cys-Gly-Gly was added to the N terminus of Ala-14 to produce Ala-14N. Similarly, Gly-Gly-Cys was added to the C terminus of Ala-14 to produce Ala-14C. The sequences Cys-Gly-Gly and Gly-Gly-Cys were added at the N and C termini, respectively, of Ala-14 to generate Ala-14NC. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen). Cells were grown at 20 °C in LB media to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm and induced with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 10 h. Cells were lysed by glacial acetic acid on ice. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged (35,000 × g for 30 min) to separate the soluble fraction from inclusion bodies. The soluble fraction containing denaturing Ala-14 was dialyzed into 5% acetic acid overnight at 4 °C. Proteins from the soluble fraction were purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Waters, Inc.) on a Vydac C-18 preparative column (Hesperia, CA) using a water-acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. The molecular weights of each peptide were confirmed by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). To produce the disulfide-linked Ala-14SOS protein (see Fig. 2C), the reduced Ala-14N, Ala-14C, and Ala-14NC peptides were mixed and incubated in redox buffer (1 mm oxidized glutathione, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 1 mm EDTA) for 3 days at 4 °C at a total protein concentration of 40 mg/ml. This treatment was followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification as described above. The designed Ala-14SOS protein with disulfides between Ala-14N and the N terminus of Ala-14NC and between Ala-14C and the C terminus of Ala-14NC was analyzed by proteolysis with trypsin and mass spectrometry. In the oxidized sample, the disulfide-bonded homodimers of the CGGSSNAK and ADNAAGGC fragments were observed. In the reducing sample, the masses of these homodimers disappear and new masses appear, corresponding to the individual fragments. A 25-mg/ml stock of Ala-14 was prepared in water. The best diffracting crystals grew at 4 °C from 1 μl of the stock added to 1 μl of the reservoir buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 1.3m sodium citrate) and allowed to equilibrate against the reservoir buffer. The crystals belong to the space group P1 (a = 21.84 Å, b = 26.94 Å,c = 45.80 Å; α = 88.05°, β = 84.95°, γ = 87.56°) and contain three monomers in the asymmetric unit. Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred into cryosolution containing the reservoir buffer and 15% glycerol, harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the X25 beamline at the Brookhaven National Laboratory using a Brandeis B4 CCD detector. Reflection intensities were integrated and scaled with the programs Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the Ala-7 trimer (20Liu J. Cao W. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 877-888Google Scholar) as a search model in the program AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). Electron density map interpretation and model building were done with the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The structure of Ala-14 was refined at 1.5-Å resolution using the program CNS 1.0 (Ref. 23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The isotropic CNS model was further refined at 1.3-Å resolution using restrained anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms with the program SHELX97 (Ref. 24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Google Scholar). The final model was verified using simulated annealing omit maps. All main-chain torsional angles fall within the helical region of a Ramachandran plot. The conformations of the majority of the residues are well defined with the exception of the two most N-terminal residues of chains A and C and the side chains of Lys-5B, Lys-19C, and Gln-46B. Superhelical parameters for the Ala-14 and Lpp-56 trimer structures were obtained by fitting the Cα backbones to a supercoil parameterization suggested by Crick (25Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Google Scholar). Root mean square deviations were calculated using the program CNS 1.0 (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Surface areas were calculated with a 1.4-Å radius probe with CNS 1.0 (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Buried surface areas were calculated from the difference of the accessible side-chain surface areas of the trimer structure and of the individual helical monomers. Atomic solvation energy was calculated using the method of Eisenberg and McLachlan (26Eisenberg D. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Google Scholar). The net solvation energies were derived by subtracting the energies of the component α helices from the energy of the trimer structure. The three most N-terminal residues and the most C-terminal residue of Ala-14 were omitted from the calculation to minimize end effects. Circular dichroism spectra were acquired on an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter as described previously (27Shu W. Ji H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5378-5385Google Scholar). The measurements of [θ]222 were carried out on 3-mg/ml solutions of protein at 0 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl. A [θ]222 value of −36,000 degrees cm2dmol−1 was taken to correspond to 100% helix (28Luo P.Z. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Google Scholar). Thermal melts were performed on 3 mg/ml-protein solutions in the same buffer by measuring ellipticity at 222 nm in 1 °C steps with a 2-min equilibration time and a 30-s integration time. All melts were reversible. Superimposable folding and unfolding curves were observed, and >95% of the signal was regained upon cooling. Analytical ultracentrifugation measurements were performed on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (29Shu W. Ji H. Lu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1839-1845Google Scholar). Protein solutions were loaded at initial concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mg/ml and analyzed at rotor speeds of 35,000 and 38,000 rpm for Ala-14 and 22,000 and 25,000 rpm for Ala-14SOS at 4 °C. The outer membrane lipoprotein is the most abundant protein of E. coli containing a trimeric α-helical coiled-coil domain (Lpp-56) that is embedded between the outer membrane and the periplasmic peptidoglycan (18Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1101-1112Google Scholar). Classical coiled-coil proteins share a characteristic seven-amino acid repeat containing bulky hydrophobic side chains at the first (a) and fourth (d) positions (30Hodges R.S. Sodek J. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 299-310Google Scholar, 31Parry D.A.D. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 1017-1024Google Scholar, 32Lupas L. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Lpp-56 reveals that this coiled-coil trimer has an unusual feature: three alanines occupying successive a and dpositions form a local structure we refer to as an alanine zipper (18Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1101-1112Google Scholar). In previous studies, we showed that four additional alanine layers can be stably incorporated into the triple-helical structure despite the fact that each alanine layer is destabilizing significantly relative to large hydrophobic groups (20Liu J. Cao W. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 877-888Google Scholar). Because alanine has relatively low hydrophobicity, the effect generally considered to be an important determinant of protein stability (33Kellis Jr., J.T. Nyberg K. Sali D. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 784-786Google Scholar, 34Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Google Scholar, 35Matthews B.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 249-278Google Scholar), we surmised that van der Waals packing interactions within the –CH3 groups are insufficient to specify and sustain an extended alanine-zipper conformation under physiological conditions. To explore the limits of three-dimensional structure formation in the absence of strong hydrophobic stabilization, we engineered an alanine-zipper protein called Ala-14 by the complete substitution of each bulky hydrophobic amino acid at the a and d positions of the Lpp-56 heptad-repeat sequence with alanine (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the high resolution features of the interfacial alanine side-chain packing, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the Ala-14 peptide at 1.3-Å resolution (Fig. 1B). The Ala-14 structure was refined to a conventional R-factor of 15.0% with a freeR-factor of 20.9% and root mean square deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles of 0.010 Å and 2.0°, respectively (Table I). Ala-14 forms a parallel triple-stranded α-helical structure with novel and unique features (Fig. 1, C and D). The superhelix creates a cylinder that is ∼18-Å wide and ∼74-Å long. An approximate 3-fold axis of symmetry coincides with the superhelical axis. The alanine side chains at the a and dpositions point into the center of the trimer, forming a nonpolar core at the interface of the three α-helices. Cross-sectional layers containing alanine at the a positions alternate with layers containing alanine at the d positions. Residues at positionse and g pack against alanines at d anda, respectively, to complete the hydrophobic core. Interhelical salt bridges and charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds form with high frequency between charged or polar side chains at theg position of one heptad and at the e position of a preceding or succeeding heptad.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP1Resolution (Å)50–1.3Measured reflections153,880Unique reflections23,835Redundancy (fold)3.8 (3.4)aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (1.30–1.32 Å).I/ς(I)14.4 (10.8)aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (1.30–1.32 Å).Completeness (%)93.6Rsym(%)bRsym = ΣhΣi‖Ih,i − 〈Ih,i〉‖ / Σh Σi Ih,i for the intensity (I) of i observations of reflection h.4.7RefinementResolution range (Å)50–1.3ReflectionsWorking21,483Test2,352Nonhydrogen protein atoms1,052Water molecules186R-factor (%)cR-factor = Σ‖Fobs −Fcalc‖ / Σ‖Fobs‖, whereFobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structural factors, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The Ala-14 trimer shows a classical acute knobs-into-holes packing characteristic of parallel triple-stranded coiled coils (25Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Google Scholar, 36Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Google Scholar). At both the a and d layers, the Cα–Cβ bond of each alanine knob makes an acute angle (∼60°) with the Cα–Cαvector at the base of the recipient hole among four residues on a neighboring helix. This similar geometric packing at positionsa and d is a distinguishing structural feature of trimer conformation (36Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Google Scholar). In 13 of 14 a and dlayers, the dihedral angles ψ and φ of the alanine backbones are approximately −40 and −70, corresponding to the α-helix region of Ramachandran space (37Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Google Scholar). The alanine residues in the C-terminal mostd layer assume dihedral angles near 160 and −70 and adopt an extended conformation. These end effects cause the superhelix to be locally underwound, and five coordinated water molecules are observed to be anchored to the Ala-48B backbone carbonyl in the core structure. An interplay between alanine side-chain packing and backbone conformation can be discerned in the trimer structure as dramatic changes in the twist of individual helices and the helix-helix spacing. The superhelical parameters (radius R0, pitch ω0, and a-position Cα phase angle φ) for the Ala-14 and Lpp-56 trimers are as follows:R0 = 5.1 Å, ω0 = 99 residues/turn, and φ = 13.1° for Ala-14;R0 = 6.1 Å, ω0 = 115 residues/turn, and φ = 16.8° for Lpp-56. The alanine backbone deviation from classical coiled coils can be described as a localized unwinding of the superhelix (decrease in ω0), decrease in the phase angle φ, and decrease in the supercoil radiusR0. As a result, the backbones of the three helices in the Ala-14 trimer are more highly curved and wrap more tightly around the superhelical axis, producing a very close spacing between adjacent helices (8.8 Å). This type of helix contact may indeed correspond to an optimal geometry for a novel class of tight helix-helix association in proteins (38Gernert K.M. Surles M.C. Labean T.H. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2252-2260Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Ala-14 has only ∼20% helix content at 3 mg/ml protein concentration in neutral pH phosphate-buffered saline at 0 °C as determined by CD (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, Ala-14 lacks a “folded” base line at low temperatures and displays a broad noncooperative thermal unfolding transition (Fig. 2B). Sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicate that Ala-14 exists as a monomer, even at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Strikingly, there is no apparent increase in the α-helical content and/or the thermal stability of Ala-14 in the presence of 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 1.3 m sodium citrate (crystallization conditions) relative to phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0. Taken together, these data indicate that the Ala-14 peptide lacks intermolecular association and forms a mix of intramolecular helix and coil under native folding conditions in solution. To assess the role of the monomer-trimer equilibrium of Ala-14 on its folding in aqueous solution, we generated a covalently linked Ala-14 trimer whose stability is concentration-independent. In this single-chain version of the protein denoted Ala-14SOS, the three Ala-14 strands are connected by short disulfide-bonded peptide linkers (Fig. 2C). The helical CD signal observed in Ala-14SOS is comparable, and the thermal stability is identical to that found in the isolated Ala-14 peptide (Fig. 2). In contrast to what is commonly found in other coiled-coil models, the stability of Ala-14 is insensitive to its molecularity. Thus, the Ala-14 peptide is largely unfolded in solution, notwithstanding that the high resolution crystal structure of the Ala-14 trimer shows specific tertiary packing among helices. This conclusion is in accord with the predicted loss of ∼15.6 kcal/mol in net hydrophobic stabilization energy of the triple-helical structure associated with alanine substitutions (26Eisenberg D. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Google Scholar) and the notion that the –CH3 side chain is too short to form stable nonpolar clusters (39Marqusee S. Robbins V.H. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5286-5290Google Scholar). What interactions might then explain the precise native-like assembly of Ala-14 helical trimers in the solid state? One clue comes from the observation that crystals of the Ala-14 peptide have exceptionally low values of solvent content (26.5%) and crystal volume/unit of protein molecular mass (1.70 Å3/dalton). The crystal structure displays a distinctive packing arrangement in which layers of parallel triple helices are situated closely along the helical axis with respect to each other (Fig. 3A). In the direction of the helical axis, there is little space between the C-terminal end of one triple-helical molecule and the N-terminal end of the next (Fig. 3B). This compact arrangement makes it possible to create sufficient intertrimer contacts to stabilize the crystal lattice. In effect, the lattice provides helix-terminating interactions that anchor the ends of successive triple helices in the crystal. Residues Ser-1B, Ser-2B, Asn-3A, Asn-3B, Asn-3C, Ala-4A, Lys-5A, Asp-7B, Gln-14B, Lys-19B, Asn-28A, Ser-32A, Asp-33A, Lys-38B, Asp-39B, Arg-47A, Asp-49A, Asp-49B, Asn-50A, Asn-50C, Ala-51A, and Ala-51C are positioned such that favorable hydrogen-bonded interactions involving the polar side chain and main chain atoms and structured water molecules can occur between the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of neighboring triple helices (Fig. 4, Lys-5A/Asn-50A*). A major problem in helix formation is the lack of hydrogen-bonding partners for exposed terminal amide protons and carboxyl oxygens (40Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Google Scholar). The helix capping and solvation of the ends presumably account in part for the presence of a high resolution molecular structure in the Ala-14 trimer under crystallization conditions.Figure 4Intertrimer helix capping.

Red spheres represent bound water molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A second unique feature of Ala-14 in the crystalline state is the presence of continuous strips of intertrimer interactions along the helical axis. These appear to be critical in determining the compact lateral assembly of Ala-14 trimers (Fig. 5A). The network of extended interstrand connections among peptide atoms and ordered water molecules includes the following: (i) 2 salt bridges and 16 charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds between the adjacent triple helices/trimer (Fig. 5,B–E, Asp-12C/Arg 31C* and Arg-43C/Ser-11B*) and (ii) water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions between polar or charged side chains and backbone carbonyl or amide groups also occur frequently (Fig. 5, A and C–E). Of the 186 water molecules added in the crystal structure, 154 (82%) are involved in direct interactions (within 3.25 Å) with the peptide. The averageB-factor value of the structured water molecules, 28.2 Å2, is not much higher than the 21.3 Å2 B-factor of protein side-chain atoms. The hydration of the Ala-14 trimer seems to be dominated by its involvement in water-mediated interchain hydrogen bonds. The combination of specific intertrimer electrostatic interactions with capping effects at the helix termini suffices to lock a labile Ala-14 solution structure into a defined native state in the crystal. Proteins acquire their spatial structures under the influence of a manifold of noncovalent interactions among backbone and side-chain atoms including the hydrophobic effect, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonds and other electrostatic interactions. Whereas the relative importance, selectivity, and context dependence of these forces remain imperfectly understood, the burial of hydrophobic surfaces is thought to play a major role in governing protein architecture and folding, at least in relatively small protein folds (3Bryson J.W.

Ala-14 provides a striking example of how a native structure can still form once this localized driving force has been severely attenuated. In contrast to proposals that solvent-exposed electrostatic interactions contribute only marginally to protein stability, we find that an array of weak polar interactions distributed along the chain can impose sufficient conformational constraints to stabilize the alanine-zipper trimer. Buried alanine side chains provide a small van der Waals component to the thermodynamic stability of the alanine-zipper trimer. The residual enthalpic interactions among the core Ala side chains are not sufficient to maintain the alanine-zipper fold in solution. Our finding that the covalently tethered Ala-14 trimer analog fails to form a triple-helical structure in solution indicates that alanine-zipper formation is not solely opposed by the loss of translational conformational entropy. It would appear that favorable enthalpy contributions from residual van der Waals packing, backbone hydrogen-bonding, and the network of solvent interactions guide and stabilize the formation of the alanine-zipper structure during crystallization. The precision of this process is reflected by the high resolution of the crystal structure (1.3 Å) with low temperature factors (16.6 and 28.9 Å2 for protein and solvent atoms, respectively). This process of triple-helical assembly in the crystalline state is to our knowledge the first example of stabilization of a native state directed by long range intermolecular rather than short range intramolecular interactions. It is tempting to speculate that extended solvent-mediated interactions such as what we describe here mediate the assembly of the coiled-coil rod of myosin to form filaments in muscle. There is growing evidence that a class of proteins referred to as intrinsically unstructured proteins are unfolded and devoid of native tertiary structure under normal solution conditions yet can self-assemble into highly organized aggregates that play a causative role in the pathogenesis of human diseases including Alzheimer's and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (45Wright P.E.

Understanding the fundamental nature of the mechanism of such large-scale assembly processes is a critical step in the development of strategies to prevent and treat these incurable diseases. By analogy with Ala-14, long range intermolecular interactions might entail formation of solvent-mediated interactions that promote assembly of the proteins into oligomeric fibrils.

https://openalex.org/W2060091413,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a multifunctional factor known to influence proliferation and function of a variety of cells. The actions of EGF are mediated by EGF receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, including stimulation of phospholipase Cγ and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Generally, agonist-mediated Ca2+ mobilization involves both Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+influx activated by store depletion (i.e. capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ influx). However, the role of capacitative Ca2+ entry in EGF-mediated Ca2+mobilization is still largely unknown. In this study, we compared [Ca2+]i signals elicited by EGF with those induced by agents (the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol and thapsigargin (Tg)) known to activate capacitative Ca2+entry. Unlike carbachol and Tg, EGF (5 nm) elicited a transient [Ca2+]i signal without a plateau phase in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and also failed to accelerate Mn2+ entry. Repletion of extracellular Ca2+ to cells stimulated with EGF in the absence of Ca2+ elicited an increase in [Ca2+]i, indicating that EGF indeed stimulates Ca2+ influx. However, the influx was activated at lower EGF concentrations than those required to stimulate Ca2+ release. Interestingly, the phospholipase C inhibitorU73122 completely inhibited Ca2+ release induced by both EGF and carbachol and also reduced Ca2+ influx responsive to carbachol but had no effect on Ca2+ influx induced by EGF. EGF-induced Ca2+ influx was potentiated by low concentrations (<5 ng/ml) of oligomycin, a mitochondrial inhibitor that blocks capacitative Ca2+ influx in other systems. Transient expression of the hTRPC3 protein enhanced Ca2+influx responsive to carbachol but did not increase EGF-activated Ca2+ influx. Both EGF and carbachol depleted internal Ca2+ stores. Our results demonstrate that EGF-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores does not activate capacitative Ca2+ influx. Rather, EGF stimulates Ca2+ influx via a mechanism distinct from capacitative Ca2+ influx induced by carbachol and Tg.

Our results demonstrate that EGF-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores does not activate capacitative Ca2+ influx. Rather, EGF stimulates Ca2+ influx via a mechanism distinct from capacitative Ca2+ influx induced by carbachol and Tg. Gq protein-coupled receptor mediated intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in non-excitable cells is usually divided into two phases (i.e.an initial rapid rise followed by a sustained plateau). The initial rise in [Ca2+]i is mainly a result of Ca2+ release from the internal stores, whereas the sustained plateau phase is a result of subsequent Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar). Release of Ca2+from the internal stores may be induced either by activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PLC, phospholipase C; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Tg, thapsigargin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2; PKC, protein kinase C. receptors or by inhibition of the Mg2+, Ca2+-ATPase on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Production of IP3 and activation of IP3 receptors occur after stimulation of either Gq protein-coupled receptor-phospholipase C (PLC) β or receptor tyrosine kinase-PLCγ pathways. The nature of the coupling between depletion of the internal store Ca2+contents and subsequent activation of Ca2+ influx, as well as the molecular identity of the Ca2+ entry channels, is still unknown. A capacitative Ca2+ influx model (also referred to as the depletion-activated or store-operated Ca2+ influx model) has been proposed and widely accepted (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar). The basic concept of this model is that the fall of the Ca2+ contents in the internal stores provides a full and sufficient signal to activate Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar, 3Elliott A.C. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 73-93Google Scholar). Thus theoretically capacitative Ca2+ influx in the cells is determined by the extent of Ca2+ depletion in the internal stores and is independent of the means employed to deplete the internal store Ca2+. Numerous studies have demonstrated in different cell types that depletion of internal store Ca2+ either by activation of the G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway or by inhibition of the ER Ca2+ pump stimulates capacitative Ca2+ influx (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar, 3Elliott A.C. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 73-93Google Scholar, 4Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Google Scholar, 5Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Google Scholar, 6Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Google Scholar). The cellular actions of epidermal growth factor (EGF) are mediated by activation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase cascades, which leads to a number of signaling events, including activation of PLCγ and mobilization of [Ca2+]i (reviewed in Refs. 7Meisenhelder J. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 57: 1109-1122Google Scholar, 8Carpenter G. Wahl M.I. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 69-171Google Scholar). However, whether capacitative Ca2+ influx pathways are involved in [Ca2+]isignaling by EGF has not yet been determined. In our previous study in a human salivary cell line (HSY), we have shown that EGF causes a transient [Ca2+]i signal that is distinct from the response to activation of the G protein-coupled muscarinic receptor (9Zhang B.-X Yeh C.-K Hymer T.K. Lifschitz M.D. Katz M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1024-C1033Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that EGF does not activate capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ influx; rather, EGF stimulates Ca2+ influx by alternative mechanisms distinct from capacitative influx. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin (Tg) was purchased from Sigma/RBI (Natick, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, EGTA, trypsin-EDTA, and Opti-MEM were from Invitrogen. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), carbachol, U73122, oligomycin, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The HSY cell line was originally established by Yanagawa et al. (10Yanagawa T. Hayashi Y. Nagamine S. Yashida H. Yura Y. Sato M. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1986; 51: 187-195Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. James Turner (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cells were plated at a density of about 2 × 104cells/cm2 in 100-mm culture dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. Cells were grown to near confluence at 72 h and were then harvested with 0.05% trypsin-0.02% EDTA for [Ca2+]i measurements. [Ca2+]i was determined by spectrofluorometric measurements in cell suspensions. HSY cells were loaded with 1.2–1.5 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 (PBS) at 37 °C for 30–45 min with gentle shaking (9Zhang B.-X Yeh C.-K Hymer T.K. Lifschitz M.D. Katz M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1024-C1033Google Scholar). Loaded cells were washed with fresh buffer to remove the extracellular dye and resuspended in PBS at a density of 2.5–5 × 105cells/ml. The [Ca2+]i signals were measured in suspensions of cells after stimulation with various agents at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i signals in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ were assayed using cells washed with and resuspended in Ca2+-free PBS (i.e. PBS containing 200 μm EGTA instead of 1 mm CaCl2). In cells initially suspended in Ca2+-free medium, Ca2+ influx was measured upon subsequent repletion of extracellular Ca2+ (2 mm). A basal Ca2+ entry occurred in nonstimulated cells. All measurements of Ca2+ influx in HSY cell suspensions exposed to stimulatory agents were accompanied by parallel determinations of basal Ca2+ influx (i.e. the Ca2+ influx observed when extracellular Ca2+ was replenished to nonstimulated cell suspensions maintained in Ca2+-free solution). The amplitude of basal Ca2+ influx in our studies averaged 0.3 units of 340/380 fluorescence ratio, and in each experiment reported basal Ca2+ influx has been subtracted. Excitation ratio of 340/380 was measured with a PTI Delta Scan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) using 340 and 380 nm wavelengths for excitation and 510 nm for emission (9Zhang B.-X Yeh C.-K Hymer T.K. Lifschitz M.D. Katz M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1024-C1033Google Scholar). Changes of [Ca2+]i were measured and indexed by the alterations in the fluorescence ratio of 340/380. The full-length human TRPC3 (hTRPC3) was subcloned into the pIRESneo (Clontech) mammalian expression vector at the EcoRI site (6Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed in HSY cells grown to 40–50% confluence in 100-mm plates. The cells were washed with Opti-MEM once and incubated with pIRESneo (1.7 μg) or an equimolar amount of pIRESneo-hTRPC3 DNA with the LipofectAMINE plus system (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM for 3 h. At the end of 3 h of transfection, Opti-MEM was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were continuously cultured for 24 h and then harvested with trypsin-EDTA for [Ca2+]i measurement. The transfection efficiency of HSY cells was 30% as determined by using the green-fluorescent-protein vector (Clontech). Data from multiple experiments are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of single comparisons was determined using Student's t test. Multiple comparisons were performed using two-factor analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Cramer multiple comparison tests. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, stimulation of HSY cells in suspension with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol induced a rapid rise in [Ca2+]ifollowed by a sustained plateau phase (Fig. 1). This pattern of Ca2+mobilization resembled the typical [Ca2+]i response to Gqcoupled receptor activation (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar). Presumably, the initial rapid increase of [Ca2+]i mainly represented Ca2+ release from the internal stores, and the sustained plateau indicated capacitative Ca2+ influx activated by the depletion of internal store Ca2+. Thapsigargin (Tg), a specific inhibitor of the ER Ca2+ pump, caused a similar [Ca2+]i response, as observed with muscarinic receptor activation, although the rate of the initial rise was slower (Fig. 1). Compared with the biphasic [Ca2+]i response to carbachol and Tg, EGF, which activates receptor tyrosine kinase pathways and PLC γ (7Meisenhelder J. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 57: 1109-1122Google Scholar), generated a very different [Ca2+]i signal in HSY cells (Fig. 1). The [Ca2+]i response to EGF (5 nm) peaked ∼45–60 s after EGF stimulation and then gradually decayed toward the baseline (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the [Ca2+]i signal of EGF lacked the capacitative Ca2+ influx to sustain the elevated plateau phase. The lack of capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ entry after EGF stimulation was further demonstrated by the experiments shown in Fig. 2. Carbachol and Tg are agents used most often to activate capacitative Ca2+ influx in various cells (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar) including HSY cells (9Zhang B.-X Yeh C.-K Hymer T.K. Lifschitz M.D. Katz M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1024-C1033Google Scholar). We thus used carbachol and Tg to stimulate capacitative Ca2+ influx in HSY cells and compared their effects with that of EGF. The rate of Mn2+entry, as measured by the quenching of cellular Fura-2 fluorescence after addition of Mn2+, has been used as a measure of capacitative Ca2+ influx (11Sage S.O. Merritt J.P. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Biochem J. 1989; 258: 923-926Google Scholar). Compared with the basal Mn2+ quenching signal recorded in the absence of any agonists (Fig. 2a), stimulation of the cells with EGF (5 nm) before Mn2+ addition had no measurable effect on the rate of Mn2+ entry (Fig. 2b). In contrast, prior stimulation of the cells with carbachol (100 μm) or Tg (10 nm) dramatically increased the rate of Mn2+ entry (Fig. 2, c and d), indicating the activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx. These results demonstrated that, unlike carbachol and Tg, EGF did not activate capacitative Ca2+ entry in HSY cells. A unique feature of capacitative Ca2+ entry is that depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores provides the necessary and sufficient signal for activation (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar, 3Elliott A.C. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 73-93Google Scholar). PLC-mediated generation of IP3 and subsequent IP3 receptor activation are required for Ca2+ release (i.e.depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores) by both carbachol and EGF (12Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Google Scholar). It is also known that inhibition of PLC and Ca2+ release results in blockade of capacitative Ca2+ influx (13Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar). To determine whether EGF induces Ca2+ influx in HSY cells and, if so, whether the EGF-responsive Ca2+ influx is capacitative entry, we investigated the effects of EGF, carbachol, and Tg on Ca2+release and influx in the absence and presence of the pharmacological PLC inhibitor U73122 (14Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from the internal stores was measured in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas Ca2+ influx was subsequently observed after extracellular Ca2+ repletion. As shown in Fig. 3, stimulation of HSY cells with EGF (5 nm), carbachol (100 μm), and Tg (10 nm) induced Ca2+ release as well as Ca2+ influx (dark traces). Pretreatment withU73122 (5–10 μm, 2–10 min) completely blocked both EGF- and carbachol-mediated Ca2+ release from the internal stores (Fig. 3, a and b, light traces). The same treatment also dramatically inhibited the subsequent Ca2+ influx in carbachol-stimulated cells (Fig. 3b, light trace). However, pretreatment withU73122 failed to inhibit the Ca2+ influx in EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3a, light trace). Treatment withU73122 also reduced Tg-mediated Ca2+ release and the corresponding Ca2+ influx, indicating that Tg-mediated Ca2+ release from the internal stores was partially dependent on PLC in HSY cells (Fig. 3c, light trace). These results demonstrated that EGF-responsive Ca2+ influx was insensitive to PLC inhibition by U73122 and thus independent of Ca2+ release (i.e. depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores). The relationship between EGF-responsive Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx in HSY cells was further assessed by comparing the effects of increasing concentrations of EGF on Ca2+release versus influx (Fig. 4). Ca2+ release and influx in response to increasing concentrations of carbachol and Tg were also measured to demonstrate the relationship between Ca2+release (i.e. depletion of internal stores) and capacitative entry. With increasing concentrations of carbachol and Tg, the amplitudes of Ca2+ release and subsequent Ca2+influx were enhanced accordingly (Fig. 4, B andC). No Ca2+ influx occurred after Ca2+ repletion if the cells were treated with carbachol and Tg at concentrations (10−7 and 10−10m, respectively) insufficient to produce Ca2+release from internal stores (Fig. 4, B and C). For both carbachol and Tg, the concentrations of agonist required for half-maximal Ca2+ release and influx were equivalent (carbachol, 8.3 × 10−6m; Tg, 2.0 × 10−9m) (Fig. 4, B andC). These data suggested that carbachol and Tg-responsive Ca2+ influx was coupled to Ca2+ release from the internal stores. In contrast, EGF stimulated Ca2+ influx over a range of concentrations distinct from that required to induce Ca2+release. At low concentrations (5 × 10−12–2.5 × 10−11m), EGF triggered Ca2+influx even in the absence of Ca2+ release from internal stores; activation of Ca2+ release required higher concentrations of EGF (≥5 × 10−11m) (Fig. 4A). The concentration of EGF required for half-maximal release (2.6 × 10−10m) was 8-fold higher than that required for half-maximal influx (3.0 × 10−11m) (Fig. 4A). Theoretically, the capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway should be activated after Ca2+ release at higher concentrations of EGF. Thus, we would expect substantial increases in Ca2+ influx to coincide with the progressive rise in Ca2+ release produced by EGF added at concentrations of 5 × 10−11–10−9m. However, over this concentration range, the amplitude of Ca2+ influx remained essentially constant (Fig. 4A). The lack of additional Ca2+ influx at higher concentrations of EGF indicated that EGF-responsive Ca2+ release from internal stores might not activate capacitative Ca2+ entry. Moreover, the Ca2+ influx observed at low concentrations of EGF in the absence of Ca2+ release from the internal stores may not be capacitative Ca2+ influx. It is still controversial whether activation of Ca2+ entry is graded (i.e. so that even a small decrease in free Ca2+ in the ER can produce a small increase in depletion-activated Ca2+ entry) or involves a threshold, in which case a fall in ER Ca2+ below a critical level triggers Ca2+ influx (4Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Google Scholar, 5Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Google Scholar). In HSY cells treated with carbachol and Tg, the relationship between Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx demonstrated by the dose-response curves in Fig. 4 indicated that any small amount of Ca2+ release from internal stores was accompanied by a subsequent influx of Ca2+ upon repletion of extracellular Ca2+. Thus, our results did not support the existence of a minimal threshold of Ca2+ release from internal stores for activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (Fig. 4, B andC). Previous studies have demonstrated that capacitative Ca2+entry is regulated by mitochondria (15Cho J.H. Balasubramanyam M. Chernaya G. Gardner J.P. Reeves J.P. Dargis P.G. Christian E.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 971-980Google Scholar, 16Gamberucci A. Innocenti B. Fulceri R. Banhegyi G. Giunti R. Pozzan T. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23597-23602Google Scholar). A number of mitochondrial inhibitors, including oligomycin, have been shown to block capacitative Ca2+ influx in other systems (15Cho J.H. Balasubramanyam M. Chernaya G. Gardner J.P. Reeves J.P. Dargis P.G. Christian E.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 971-980Google Scholar, 16Gamberucci A. Innocenti B. Fulceri R. Banhegyi G. Giunti R. Pozzan T. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23597-23602Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of oligomycin on Ca2+ release and influx responsive to EGF, carbachol, and Tg in HSY cells. Incubation of HSY cells with oligomycin (1–50 ng/ml) had little or no effect on EGF-, carbachol-, or Tg-mediated Ca2+ release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). After repletion of extracellular Ca2+, Ca2+ influx in EGF-stimulated cells was dramatically inhibited by 50 ng/ml oligomycin (>70% inhibition; Fig. 5B). However, similar treatment with oligomycin (50 ng/ml) only modestly inhibited carbachol and Tg-stimulated capacitative Ca2+ influx (∼40%; Fig. 5B). Complete inhibition of EGF responsive Ca2+influx was observed at 100 ng/ml oligomycin, whereas much higher concentrations of oligomycin (5–10 μg/ml) were required to eliminate carbachol or Tg stimulated Ca2+ influx in HSY cells (data not shown). Interestingly, at low concentrations (1 and 5 ng/ml) of oligomycin, Ca2+ influx was actually increased in EGF-stimulated HSY cells (Fig. 5B). These experiments suggested that in HSY cells, the effects of oligomycin on EGF-stimulated Ca2+ influx were significantly distinct from the concentration-dependent inhibitory action of this agent on carbachol- and Tg-responsive Ca2+ influx (i.e. capacitative entry). Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (17He X. Wu X. Baum B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1062-1069Google Scholar, 18Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Google Scholar, 19Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Google Scholar). We compared the effects of PKC activation on Ca2+ influx responses to EGF, carbachol, and Tg. Ca2+ release in HSY cells suspended in Ca2+-free PBS was induced by EGF, carbachol, or Tg. During the course of decay of the [Ca2+]isignal to the basal level, HSY cells were incubated with 100 nm PMA for 2–3 min to activate PKC, and then Ca2+ influx was triggered by extracellular Ca2+repletion. The results in Fig. 6demonstrated that PMA treatment largely inhibited Ca2+influx in both EGF- and carbachol-stimulated HSY cells (Fig. 6,a and b). These data indicated that the EGF-responsive non-capacitative Ca2+ influx, like the carbachol-responsive capacitative Ca2+ influx, was inhibited by PKC activation. Surprisingly, however, the Ca2+ influx in Tg-stimulated HSY cells was not affected by PMA treatment (Fig. 6c). Expression of TRPC3 and other transient receptor potential proteins has been shown to increase capacitative and/or other agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry in various cell types (6Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Google Scholar). We tested the effect of overexpression of hTRPC3 protein in HSY cells on EGF- and carbachol-responsive Ca2+ entry. If EGF-responsive Ca2+ mobilization involved capacitative pathways, the Ca2+ influx induced by EGF would be enhanced by hTRPC3 overexpression. The results showed that hTRPC3 transfection did not alter EGF- and carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ release measured in Ca2+-free PBS (Fig. 7). Carbachol-mediated Ca2+ influx after extracellular Ca2+ repletion was increased in hTRPC3-transfected cells (Fig. 7b), indicating an enhanced capacitative Ca2+ influx (340/380 ratios: hTRPC3 1.15 ± 0.02versus vector 0.92 ± 0.03; p = 0.017,n = 8 measurements). In contrast, hTRPC3 transfection did not affect EGF-responsive Ca2+ influx (Fig. 7a) (340/380 ratios: hTRPC3 0.57 ± 0.02versus vector 0.53 ± 0.01; p = 0.529,n = 5 measurements). These results indicated that transfection of hTRPC3 in HSY cells enhanced muscarinic receptor-activated Ca2+ entry but not EGF-mediated, Ca2+ release-independent Ca2+ influx. Ca2+ depletion of the internal stores is critical for activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry. We therefore examined the effect of EGF on internal Ca2+ stores. Tg-responsive Ca2+ release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was used to index the Ca2+ content in the internal stores (9Zhang B.-X Yeh C.-K Hymer T.K. Lifschitz M.D. Katz M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1024-C1033Google Scholar). In HSY cells, 10 nm Tg was sufficient to cause complete depletion of internal store Ca2+ because further addition of Tg (10 nm) did not evoke additional Ca2+ release (Fig. 8A). The cells were stimulated with EGF (5 nm) or carbachol (100 μm) in Ca2+-free PBS to deplete internal stores. After the [Ca2+]i signal induced by EGF or carbachol decayed to basal level, Tg (10 nm) was added to discharge the entire internal Ca2+ store. Under these conditions, Tg still evoked a small Ca2+ release from the internal store (Fig. 8, B and C), indicating incomplete internal store depletion by both EGF and carbachol. Although both EGF and carbachol depleted the internal store to a similar extent, only carbachol activated capacitative Ca2+ influx. Although the link between receptor tyrosine kinase pathway-mediated PLC γ activation and Ca2+ mobilization is well established, the role of capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ entry in EGF-induced [Ca2+]i signaling has not previously been clarified. The present study provides novel evidence that capacitative Ca2+ entry is not activated after EGF stimulation of PLC γ and Ca2+ release from the internal stores in HSY cells, where EGF-responsive Ca2+ influx occurred in the absence of Ca2+ release from the internal stores (Figs. 3 and 4). It has been shown in Rat-1 fibroblasts and HeLa cells that the [Ca2+]i transient caused by EGF resulted from rac-dependent Ca2+ influx (20Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Qiu R.-G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. De Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Google Scholar). Rac is a small G protein belonging to the rho subfamily of ras-related proteins (21Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382Google Scholar). Introduction of the dominant-negative rac protein in Rat-1 fibroblasts and HeLa cells abolished EGF-mediated Ca2+ mobilization but did not affect other elements of EGF signaling, such as EGF receptor autophosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Because EGF activation of PLC γ does not involve rac, it is likely that EGF-responsive Ca2+influx in these two cell types is independent of PLC γ activation and Ca2+ release from the internal stores. In HSY cells, EGF-mediated Ca2+ influx occurred at low concentrations of EGF in the absence of Ca2+ release (Fig. 4) and was not blocked by the PLC inhibitor U71322 (Fig. 3). Whether the EGF-responsive Ca2+ influx observed in HSY cells is also rac-dependent as reported in Rat-1 fibroblasts and HeLa cells (20Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Qiu R.-G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. De Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Google Scholar) is currently under investigation. The main difference in EGF-induced [Ca2+]i signaling between HSY and Rat-1 or HeLa cells is that at higher concentrations, EGF also induces PLC-dependent Ca2+ release from the internal stores in HSY cells (Figs. 3 and 4). However, both the present study with HSY cells and the previous study with Rat-1 and HeLa cells (20Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Qiu R.-G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. De Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Google Scholar) demonstrate that EGF does not stimulate capacitative Ca2+ influx, which is activated by G protein-coupled receptors in these cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7; Ref. 20Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Qiu R.-G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. De Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Google Scholar). The coupling between the fall of Ca2+ content in the internal store and activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx has been the subject of extensive studies. Soluble messengers activating Ca2+ entry have been extracted and partially purified from mammalian cells and yeast (22Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Google Scholar, 23Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Google Scholar, 24Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Google Scholar). However, the soluble messenger hypothesis will probably not be accepted without definitive identification of the messenger(s). The conformational coupling model suggests that the conformational alteration of IP3receptors induced by the fall of Ca2+ in the internal stores causes direct interaction of the IP3 receptors with the Ca2+ influx pathway, resulting in activation of Ca2+ entry (25Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Google Scholar, 26Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Google Scholar). Although not consistent with the results from studies of IP3 receptor knock-out cells (27Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Google Scholar,28Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Google Scholar), the conformational coupling model has recently gained support from a number of studies from different laboratories (29Kiselyov K. Mignery G. Zhu M.X.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1652-1654Google Scholar) has been shown to enhance capacitative Ca2+ influx and capacitative Ca2+ influx-linked cell functions (40Singh B.B. Zheng C. Liu X. Lockwich T. Liao D. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1652-1654Google Scholar). A direct interaction between IP3 receptors and transient receptor potential proteins has been suggested to be essential for activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx (29Kiselyov K. Mignery G. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Google Scholar, 30Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Google Scholar, 31Boulay G. Brown D.M.

However, the elimination of IP3 receptors in DT40 lymphocytes (28Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Google Scholar) and T cells (27Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Google Scholar) did not prevent activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry by Tg, although both PLC β- and γ-mediated Ca2+ release and influx were abolished (28Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Google Scholar). These studies indicate a distinction between the cellular events involved in capacitative Ca2+influx responsive to Tg and activation of PLC pathways. We also observed that treatment of HSY cells with PMA abolished carbachol- but not Tg-mediated capacitative Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6). The reason for the differences between carbachol- and Tg-mediated capacitative Ca2+ entry in HSY and other cells (27Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Google Scholar, 28Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Google Scholar) has not yet been determined. It may relate to the different mechanisms of Ca2+ release from internal stores employed by carbachol and Tg. Incomplete depletion of internal Ca2+stores by carbachol (Fig. 8c) may also contribute to the differences between carbachol- and Tg-mediated capacitative Ca2+ entry in HSY cells (Fig. 6). Arachidonic acid has been shown to activate Ca2+ influx by a non-capacitative mechanism (41Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Google Scholar). Moreover, capacitative Ca2+ influx and arachidonic acid-activated Ca2+influx exhibit mutual antagonism in human embryonic kidney cells (41Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Google Scholar,42Luo D.J. Broad L.M. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20186-20189Google Scholar). Mutual antagonism between EGF-mediated Ca2+ influx and capacitative Ca2+ influx could also occur in HSY cells. Accordingly, in the presence of EGF-mediated Ca2+ influx, capacitative Ca2+ influx would be inhibited even though EGF depletes the internal store Ca2+ (Fig. 8b). In summary, the present study provides direct evidence that EGF-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in HSY cells does not involve capacitative Ca2+ influx pathways. The EGF-responsive Ca2+ influx occurs via a mechanism that is independent of the EGF effect on internal store Ca2+ and is distinct from the capacitative Ca2+ influx induced by carbachol and Tg. We appreciate Dr. Richard Lin's help in the experiment involving hTRPC3 transient expression and Shuko Lee's assistance with statistical analysis."

Vesicular transport plays an essential role in the intracellular transport of macromolecules like proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides. Upon arrival at the target organelle, a vesicle fuses with the organelle membrane and releases its aqueous contents into the lumen, or the outside of the cell in the case of exocytosis. The mechanisms of all intracellular membrane fusion events in eucaryotic cells are considered to be founded on the so-called “SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TP, tonoplast; PM, plasma membrane; Mt, mitochondria; R18, octadecylrhodamine B; PL, phospholipid; ANTS, 1-aminonaphthalene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid; DPX, N,N′-p-xylylenebis(oyridinium bromide; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TP, tonoplast; PM, plasma membrane; Mt, mitochondria; R18, octadecylrhodamine B; PL, phospholipid; ANTS, 1-aminonaphthalene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid; DPX, N,N′-p-xylylenebis(oyridinium bromide; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid hypothesis,” proposed by Rothman et al.

Small GTPases of the Rab/Ypt family and tethering factors play roles in vesicle tethering and docking interactions (5Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Google Scholar, 6Sönnichsen B.

Cell. 2002; 2: 377-378Google Scholar). Thereafter, the pairing of vesicular and target membrane-SNAREs occurs, which should result in tight docking and facilitate fusion (9Hughson F.M. Curr.

It is generally accepted that intracellular membrane fusion requires the tethering and pairing of some protein factors. Several studies have shown that membrane protein-dependent fusion without the tethering or pairing of fusion factors can occur in intracellular membranes, by utilizing artificial membranes. Rat liver Golgi membranes (18Pécheur E.I. Martin I. Bienvenüe A. Ruysschaert J.-M. Hoekstra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3936-3942Google Scholar), reticulocyte endocytic vesicles (19Vidal M.

Rat liver ER membranes fused with liposomes at lower pH, dependent on a 50-kDa glycoprotein in ER membrane (22Corazzi L. Monni M. Placidi M. Roberti R. J. Membr.

The Golgi apparatus of perforated CHO-K1 fibroblasts fused with liposomes in an ATP-dependent manner (24Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Google Scholar). Sea urchin exocytotic granules fused with liposomes as well as themselves in a Ca2+ ion-dependent and NEM-sensitive manner (25Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Google Scholar). It is sufficient for these fusogenic peptides to reside on only one of the two membranes to cause fusion, like viral fusion peptides. The peptides that mediate fusion with artificial membranes would also be involved in intracellular fusion processes and the trafficking of membrane proteins and lipids. However, except for the fusogenic 50-kDa glycoprotein of rat liver ER (22Corazzi L. Monni M. Placidi M. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 53-63Google Scholar, 23Monni M. Roberti R. Corazzi L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2020-2027Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanism of fusion induced by such peptides and most of them have not yet been identified, whereas much information about SNAREs, Rab/Ypts, and various other factors has been accumulated during the last decade. Such a peptide-dependent fusogenic activity was also found in plant Golgi membranes isolated from mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) hypocotyls, by lipid mixing and content leakage assays in a cell-free system utilizing fluorescence probes. In the present study, the effect of divalent cations was examined. The results suggest that the fusion to an intermediate prior to pore opening and the subsequent processes are mediated by different components of the fusion system of plant Golgi apparatus. Solutions of purified soybean asolectin (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) were made in chloroform. Lipids were dried into thin films under N2. The lipids were suspended in 10 mm Mes-Tris (pH 7.2) containing 135 mm KCl (K-buffer), and sonicated with a bath-type sonicator, which produces small unilamellar vesicles (26Hauser H.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 1049-1055Google Scholar). Seeds of the mung bean (V. radiata L.) were hydrated in tap water and cultivated in darkness at 29 °C for 2.5 days. Excised hypocotyl sections (150 g fresh weight) were homogenized in 300 ml of 0.25 m sorbitol, 50 mm Mops-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1.5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.4% (w/v) casein, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 mm K2S2O5. The 10,000–150,000 × g microsomal pellet was suspended in sorbitol suspension buffer containing 0.25 m sorbitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mmMes-Tris (pH 7.3), then loaded on top of discontinuous sucrose-density gradients consisting of 10/18/26/32/40% (w/w) sucrose in 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mmMes-Tris (pH 7.3), and centrifuged for 2 h at 90,000 ×g. The tonoplast (TP)-enriched fraction at the 0.25m sorbitol/10%, ER at the 18/26%, Golgi at the 26/32%, and plasma membrane (PM) plus mitochondria (Mt) at the 32/40% sucrose interfaces were collected and diluted with K-buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT, then centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 20 min. All membrane vesicles were finally suspended in K-buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT. The procedures for the membrane preparation were conducted on ice or at 4 °C. Isolated membranes were used for the experiments without freezing or stored at −80 °C. Protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The marker enzyme assays in the presence of 0.015% (w/v) Triton X-100, the lipid extraction, and the analysis were performed as described (27Yoshida S. Kawata T. Uemura M. Niki T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 152-160Google Scholar, 28Yoshida S. Kawata T. Uemura M. Niki T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 161-166Google Scholar, 29Takeda Y. Kasamo K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 38-48Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels, as described (29Takeda Y. Kasamo K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 38-48Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to electrophoretic transfer on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunostaining was performed essentially as described by Herman et al.(30Herman E.M. Li X. Su R.T. Larsen P. Hsu H. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1313-1324Google Scholar). For the preparation of asolectin liposomes containing octadecylrhodamine B (R18) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), dissolved in an ethanolic stock solution, was premixed with the lipids in chloroform to give a final concentration of 4 mol % to total lipids. Golgi membranes labeled with R18 were prepared as follows; 5 mg of protein of Golgi membrane was suspended in 5 ml of K-buffer, 75 nmol of R18 was added to the suspension, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h in the dark. Unincorporated R18 was removed on a Sephadex G-75 column (19Vidal M. Hoekstra D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17823-17829Google Scholar, 31Hoekstra D. Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar), equilibrated with K-buffer. The final concentration of R18 in Golgi membranes was evaluated by solubilization with chloroform/methanol/0.1 n HCl and measuring R18 fluorescence (31Hoekstra D. Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar), and estimated to be 6–7 mol % with respect to total membrane lipids. Lipid mixing of membranes was assayed by de-quenching of R18 fluorescence incorporated in asolectin liposomes or Golgi membranes (31Hoekstra D. Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar). 0.2 μmol of phospholipid (PL) of asolectin liposomes containing R18 or 0.4 mg of protein of Golgi membranes labeled with R18 was incubated in a fluorescence cuvette in K-buffer. The reaction was initiated by the injection of R18-free membrane vesicles (0.4 mg of protein) or R18-free liposomes (0.4 μmol of PL), respectively. The final volume was 2 ml. The changes in fluorescence were monitored at 37 °C with a spectrofluorophotometer (model RF-5300PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. Finally, Triton X-100 was added with a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v). Asolectin liposomes were made in a solution of 41 mm calcein (Sigma) or 25 mm1-aminonaphthalene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) (Molecular Probes) in K-buffer. Unencapsulated calcein was removed as described by Kobayashi and Pagano (24Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Google Scholar), except that the dialysis was done against K-buffer. At such a high concentration, self-quenching of calcein can occur (24Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Google Scholar). Unencapsulated ANTS was removed using a Sephadex G-75 column. In content leakage assays, asolectin liposomes encapsulating calcein (0.4 μmol of PL) or ANTS (0.2 μmol of PL) were incubated in a fluorescence cuvette in K-buffer, and then membrane vesicles (0.4 mg of protein for calcein, 0.2 mg for ANTS) were added to initiate the reaction. The final volume for the incubations was 2 ml. In the ANTS assay, 20 mm N,N′-p-xylylenebis(oyridinium bromide) (DPX) (Molecular Probes) was pre-included in the reaction mixture. The changes in fluorescence intensity were monitored at 37 °C. Finally, Triton X-100 was added (final 0.2%, w/v). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 520 nm for calcein and 386 and 515 nm for ANTS, respectively. In both the lipid mixing and the content leakage assays, in most cases, the fluorescence intensity at time 0 was set at 0%, and that after addition of Triton X-100, at which the infinite and/or maximum probe dilution should occur, was taken as 100% for the scale calibration. Golgi membranes were incubated with trypsin (1:5, w/w, trypsin:membrane protein) at 37 °C for 20–30 min, and then soybean trypsin inhibitor (1.5-fold of trypsin) was added. For the control sample, trypsin and the inhibitor mixed beforehand were added. Golgi membranes were incubated in 10 mm Mes-Tris (pH 7.2) containing 1 m KCl and stood for 15 min on ice, then utilized for assays. The amount of KCl in the incubation mixture for the fusion assays was adjusted to give the same final concentration (135 mm). NEM-treated Golgi membranes were prepared by incubation in K-buffer containing 1 mm NEM for 15 min on ice, and then stopped by subsequent addition of 2 mm DTT. The control was prepared by the addition of a mixture of NEM and DTT. Note that control samples for treatments with trypsin and NEM produced the same results as untreated samples. Golgi membranes were heated at 90 °C for 5–10 min, and then kept on ice until measurements. Organelle membranes were fractionated from mung bean hypocotyl cells utilizing discontinuous sorbitol/sucrose gradient centrifugation. Assays using marker enzymes were performed to characterize the prepared membrane fractions. UDPase activity was used as a Golgi marker (27Yoshida S. Kawata T. Uemura M. Niki T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 152-160Google Scholar, 28Yoshida S. Kawata T. Uemura M. Niki T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 161-166Google Scholar, 32Briskin D.W. Leonald R.T. Hodges T.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 542-558Google Scholar). NADH-cytochrome c reductase insensitive to antimycin A and cytochrome c oxidase were employed as markers for the ER and Mt, respectively (32Briskin D.W. Leonald R.T. Hodges T.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 542-558Google Scholar). VO4-inhibited K+-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity at pH 6.5 was used as a PM marker, and NO3-inhibited Mg2+-ATPase activity at pH 8.0 as a TP marker (33Gallagher S.R. Leonard R.T. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1335-1340Google Scholar). TableI shows that these marker enzymes were most active in their original membrane fractions.Table IEnzymatic activities of various membrane fractionsMembrane fractionsATPase activityUDPaseNADH cytochrome creductaseCytochrome c oxidaseVO4-inhibited (pH 6.5)NO3-inhibited (pH 8.0)μmol mg−1 protein min−1 (relative activity)Microsomal pellet0.120.070.560.820.30TP0.09 (0.47)0.30 (1.00)0.03 (0.26)0.07 (0.03)0.01 (0.02)ER0.10 (0.53)0.06 (0.20)0.71 (0.61)2.62 (1.00)0.03 (0.06)Golgi0.16 (0.84)0.07 (0.23)1.17 (1.00)1.51 (0.58)0.05 (0.11)PM + Mt0.19 (1.00)0.03 (0.10)0.34 (0.29)0.28 (0.11)0.47 (1.00)Means of at least three different preparations are shown.

Relative activities are also given in parentheses for fractionated membranes. As shown in Fig. 1, the membrane fractions were also characterized by immunoblotting with specific antibodies: VM23, a TP marker (34Maeshima M. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1248-1254Google Scholar), and PM H+-ATPase were most abundant in their original fractions. BiP, an ER marker (35Hatano K. Shimada T. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 344-351Google Scholar), was abundant in both the ER and Golgi fractions, but slightly more so in the ER fraction. JIM 84, a Golgi marker (36Hawes C. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 395-401Google Scholar), antibody stained several polypeptide bands of over 60–200 kDa, most of which were most abundant in the Golgi fraction. TP can be obtained in high purity by sorbitol/sucrose density gradient centrifugation (28Yoshida S. Kawata T. Uemura M. Niki T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 161-166Google Scholar). The ER and Golgi fractions showed considerable cross-contamination, and the latter also contained PM. We tried several methods for the fractionation. However, it proved difficult to prepare a Golgi membrane-enriched fraction with higher purity from mung bean. Nevertheless, it could be concluded that these organelle membranes were most abundant in their own fractions. Fig.2 shows the fusion of asolectin liposomes containing 4 mol % R18 with various membranes. The incorporation of R18 into membranes results in a concentration-dependent self-quenching of the fluorescence (31Hoekstra D. Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar). An increase in fluorescence intensity should indicate a release from self-quenching of the probe caused by the mixing of lipids in membranes upon fusion. Thus, R18 can be used as a probe for membrane fusion (19Vidal M. Hoekstra D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17823-17829Google Scholar, 22Corazzi L. Monni M. Placidi M. Roberti R. J. Membr.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 654-667Google Scholar, 39Maier O. Oberle V. Hoekstra D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 3-18Google Scholar). Additions of membranes of the Golgi, ER, and PM plus Mt fractions resulted in de-quenching of fluorescence, whereas the fluorescence only slightly increased on incubation with TP. The de-quenching of R18 fluorescence may have occurred as a result of the fusion of the liposomes and these membranes. Initial rates and fluorescence (%) at 10 min of de-quenching were determined to characterize the fusion kinetics. The initial rate was calculated from the slope of the steepest part at time = 0. Because the de-quenching signals of R18 were noisy, 0 and 100% fluorescence were determined from the means of fluorescence intensity of the last 1–5 s and 1–2 min after the addition of the substrates, respectively. Fluorescence (%) values during the fusion reaction were obtained from the means of the previous and the last 10 s at the indicated time. The initial rate would reflect the net fusogenic activity, and the extent of fusion/lipid mixing, the ratio of vesicles available for fusion, could be evaluated and compared from the fluorescence (%). TableII summarizes the analytical results of the de-quenching curves shown in Fig. 2. The fusion efficiencies of both initial rate and fluorescence (%) at 10 min were highest in the Golgi fraction, and considerably low in the TP fraction. In the case of the ER and PM plus Mt fractions, de-quenching was distinctly observed, but to less of an extent than in the Golgi. The relative efficiencies in Table II are nearly in good agreement with the levels of the Golgi markers, UDPase activity in particular, in the fractions (Fig. 1, TableI).Table IIKinetic analysis of fluorescence dequenching upon fusion of R18-incorporated liposomes and membranes from various fractionsMembranesInitial rateFluorescence%Golgi4.00 (1.00)25.6 (1.00)ER1.59 (0.40)14.0 (0.55)PM + Mt1.25 (0.31)10.0 (0.39)TP0.19 (0.05)1.9 (0.07)The initial rate (%/min) and fluorescence (%) at time = 10 min were determined from the dequenching curves in Fig. 2. Relative values are also given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The initial rate (%/min) and fluorescence (%) at time = 10 min were determined from the dequenching curves in Fig. 2. Relative values are also given in parentheses. In most cases, the increase of fluorescence upon fusion was nearly exponential within the first 15 min. However, it tended to increase slowly as well as steadily after 15 min (data not shown). As the de-quenching curves could not be necessarily exponentially fitted, thereafter, we adopted the fluorescence (%) at 15 min to evaluate and compare the extent of fusion/lipid mixing. The effects of various treatments were examined. As shown in Fig.3 A, the incubation of Golgi membranes in 1 m KCl solution did not affect the de-quenching. However, the trypsin treatment and heating completely abolished it. These results suggest the involvement of (an) integral protein(s) in Golgi membranes, and a dilution of lipid upon membrane fusion rather than a spontaneous transfer of the probes to unlabeled membranes. Incubation with NEM did not affect the de-quenching either, indicating no contribution by cysteine residues. The fusion occurred upon the mere mixing of the liposomes and biological membranes, and did not require any cytosolic proteins or nucleotides such as ATP, GDP, and GTP. The assays were performed in buffer containing 135 mm KCl. As shown in Fig. 3 B, substitution of NaCl for KCl in the reaction mixture rendered nearly the same results, whereas the fusion efficiencies were reduced by ∼40–60% when 0.25 msucrose or mannitol was utilized as an osmotic stabilizer instead of KCl. The screening of charges on the membrane surface by the cations would be effective in increasing membrane fusion. It was found that divalent cations could influence the membrane fusion. As shown in Fig.4 A, when MgSO4(0.1–5 mm) was added to the reaction mixture, the fusion was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. The utilization of MgCl2 instead of MgSO4 produced the same results (data not shown), indicating that Mg2+ions caused the increase in de-quenching of R18. The divalent cations were not necessarily indispensable for the fusion because the addition of EDTA had no effect. As shown in Table III, other divalent cations also enhanced the de-quenching with the exception that Hg2+ ions were inhibitory, whereas the same concentration of monovalent cations did not. The initial rate was more markedly enhanced by divalent cations than the extent of fusion/lipid mixing (fluorescence, %). Because the de-quenching was only slightly increased by the presence of divalent cations in the case of trypsin-treated and heated Golgi membranes (Table III), the increase in fusion caused by the divalent cations would be the result of the increased activity of the fusion protein(s) in the system for the most part, although a slight passive transfer of R18 and/or spontaneous fusion might have occurred. De-quenching curves of trypsin-treated samples in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+ ions are subtracted from the curves of untreated to remove the effects at long time of slowly increasing fluorescence. The resultant curves are shown in Fig.4 B, indicating that the fusion was distinctly enhanced by the divalent cations.Table IIIEffect of divalent and monovalent cation chlorides on the kinetic characteristics of lipid mixing of R18-incorporated liposomes and Golgi membranesGolgi membranesCation ClsInitial rateFluorescence (%) at 15 minRelative efficiencyUntreatedNone (control)1.00aThe specific mean value ± S.D.

The fluorescence of the reaction mixture before and after the addition of Triton X-100 was not affected by the cations tested. The lipid composition of the membranes remained unchanged under that condition in the presence of these cations, although slight self-digestion of PLs by endogenous membrane-bound phospholipase D (29Takeda Y. Kasamo K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 38-48Google Scholar, 40Yoshida S. Uemura M. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 807-812Google Scholar) occurred in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, but the total PL content remained unchanged (data not shown). Divalent cations have a marked effect to reduce negative electrostatic potential on the membrane surface, which leads to a decrease in aquatic and electrostatic repulsive forces between membranes. The effect at 1 mm of divalent cations on the enhancement of fusion was greatest in the following order: Mn2+ > Ca2+> Mg2+ >/≈ Ba2+ ≈ Sr2+ (TableIII). This order is the same as that of the association constants for the phosphatidylglycerol complexes, and the enhancement by the divalent cations was in proportion to the constants (41Lau A. McLaughlin A. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 645: 279-292Google Scholar). The divalent cations with the higher association constant would bind more tightly to the surfaces of both biological membranes and liposomes, and more effectively reduce the repulsive forces. Therefore, it is considered that the fusion peptide(s) of the fusion system on Golgi membranes is more accessible to liposomes in the presence of divalent cations, and would not be directly activated by them. In other words, the substrate concentration of the protein(s) was raised by the divalent cations, which should result in an increase of fusogenic activity. Exceptionally, the de-quenching was markedly decreased by Hg2+ ions, suggesting that the fusogenic activity of the peptide(s) was directly inhibited by Hg2+ ions. Although divalent cations like Mg2+ and Ca2+ions alone can adhere and fuse lipid bilayers, especially ones composed of substantial amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (42Ellens H.

Fig. 5 shows the results of content leakage assays utilizing calcein (A) and ANTS/DPX (B and C). They can be used for monitoring fusion processes of artificial membranes and biological membranes (24Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Google Scholar, 47Ulrich A.S. Otter M. Glabe C.G.
