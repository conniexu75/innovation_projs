https://openalex.org/W2077903723,"Glycosylation is often regarded as being restricted to proteins confined to the cell surface or within the lumen of intracellular organelles. Here we show that the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor Sp1 bears multiple O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) monosaccharide residues. The lectin wheat germ agglutinin specifically inhibits the transcriptional activation but not the DNA binding function of Sp1. Furthermore, many other RNA polymerase II transcription factors also bear terminal GlcNAc residues, whereas most nuclear proteins, including RNA polymerase I and III transcription factors tested, do not. In some cases, only a subset of the polypeptide species within a particular family of closely related RNA polymerase II factors appears to be glycosylated. Our findings raise the possibility that O-linked GlcNAc residues play a role in the mechanism or regulation of transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2023491365,"Protein-DNA cross-linking of cultured Drosophila cells has shown that, in vivo, prior to the induction of heat shock, there is approximately one molecule of RNA polymerase II associated with the promoter region of the major heat shock gene, hsp70. Here, we show that this promoter-associated RNA polymerase II molecule is transcriptionally engaged and has formed a nascent RNA chain of approximately 25 nucleotides in length, but is apparently arrested at that point and unable to penetrate further into the hsp70 gene without heat induction. The detection of a post-initiation RNA polymerase complex on the promoter region of the inactive gene suggests that there is a transcriptional control mechanism that acts at a step early in transcript elongation."

https://openalex.org/W2077576885,"The mammalian cerebral cortex is organized into columns of cells with common functional properties. During embryogenesis, cortical neurons are formed deep, near the lateral ventricles, and migrate radially to their final position. This observation led to the suggestion that the cortex consists of radial, ontogenetic units of clonally related neurons. In the experiments reported here, this hypothesis was tested by studying cell lineage in the rat cortex with a retroviral vector carrying the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene, which can be easily visualized. Labeled, clonally related cortical neurons did not occur in simple columnar arrays. Instead, clonally related neurons entered several different radial columns, apparently by migrating along different radial glial fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1979202944,"We have genetically reverted HIS4 initiator codon mutants in yeast and identified three unlinked genes, sui1, sui2, and SUI3 (suppressors of initiator codon mutants), which when mutated confer the ability to initiate at HIS4 despite the absence of an AUG start codon. Molecular and biochemical characterization shows that SUI3 encodes the beta-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-2. SUI3 suppressor genes contain single base changes at a Zn(II) finger motif. This motif is present in a cDNA sequence encoding the human eIF-2 beta gene product. Mutations in SUI3 suppressor alleles change amino acids that are conserved in the yeast and human motifs. Protein sequence analysis shows that a mutant beta-subunit allows initiation at a UUG codon in the absence of an AUG start codon at HIS4. Taken together, these data implicate a nucleic acid-binding domain of eIF-2 as an important component of the ""scanning"" ribosome that participates in recognition of a start codon."

https://openalex.org/W1533853543,"Using site-directed mutagenesis we have created an altered calmodulin in which Gln-3 and Thr-146 have both been replaced by cysteines. We have reacted this protein with the bifunctional reagent, bismaleimidohexane, forming an intramolecular cross-link between the two cysteines. In the crystal structure of native calmodulin alpha-carbons at positions 3 and 146 are 37 A apart. In the bismaleimidohexane cross-linked protein these atoms can be no more than 19 A apart, and model building studies indicate that there is probably a bend in the central helix of calmodulin. A second modified calmodulin was generated by cleaving the central helix of the cross-linked protein at Lys-77 with trypsin. In this molecule, the two lobes of calmodulin are joined solely by the bismaleimidohexane cross-link, which bridges Cys-3 and Cys-146. Vm and Kact values for activation of myosin light chain kinase activity by the cross-linked and cross-linked/trypsinized proteins are not significantly different from those for the control protein. This result indicates that one role for the central helix may be to serve as a flexible tether between the calmodulin lobes. This is consistent with a model calmodulin-enzyme complex in which the central helix is bent, and the two lobes exert a concerted effect. A detailed model of this type has been proposed for the calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase complex (Persechini, A. and Kretsinger, R.H. (1988) J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., in press)."
https://openalex.org/W2028674823,"The role proteoglycans play in tumor formation was examined by measuring the tumorigenicity of proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants in nude mice. When 107 cells were injected subcutaneously, mutants with less than about 15% of the wild-type level of proteoglycan synthesis did not produce tumors. Mutants defective in the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans also did not form tumors, whereas mutants with altered chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were tumorigenic. Tumors arose from mixtures of wild-type and nontumorigenic mutant cells and contained both cell types, suggesting that wild-type cell proteoglycans enabled mutant cells to survive. The failure of heparan sulfate-deficient mutants to form tumors depended on the ability of the host to mount a B cell-mediated immune reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2052019122,"Ingestion of the excitotoxic cycad seed amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine may be responsible for the neuronal degeneration associated with Guam amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism-dementia in man. However, the basis for the central neurotoxicity of beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine has been unclear, as it lacks the omega acidic (or equivalent electronegative) moiety characteristic of other excitatory amino acids. beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine produced neurotoxic and neuroexcitatory effects in murine cortical cell cultures only when physiological concentrations of bicarbonate were available in the extracellular bathing medium. Bicarbonate may interact noncovalently with beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine to produce, in combination, a molecular configuration that activates glutamate receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2033799707,"The intron of the 23S rRNA gene of D. mobilis is excised from the pre-23S RNA at specific sites in vivo and subsequently ligated to form a stable circular RNA, with a normal 5'-3' phosphodiester bond, containing the entire intron sequence; 95% of this RNA codes for a protein of 194 amino acids that can be expressed in E. coli. Crude cell extracts from D. mobilis also induce a two-step slicing reaction in vitro, producing the same circular intron RNA but a low yield of ligated exons. Cleavage depends on the RNA structure adjacent to the cleavage site and yields a 3'-terminal phosphate. Splicing is enhanced by GTP, but does not require divalent metal ions. The cleavage and exon-splicing reactions resemble those found for tRNA introns in eukaryotes and a possible structural rationale for this similarity is considered together with its possible implications for the origin of eukaryotic rRNA and tRNA introns."
https://openalex.org/W2128108834,"An expression plasmid incorporating the structural gene for the large subunit of a cyanobacterial ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, but not the gene for its complementary small subunit, directs the synthesis of large subunits in Escherichia coli. This provides a means for obtaining a preparation of large subunits completely devoid of small subunits, which is not otherwise achievable. In extracts, these large subunits were found predominantly in the form of octamers, but intersubunit interactions were weaker than in the holoenzyme, which contains eight small subunits as well as eight large subunits, and tended to be broken by procedures which separated octamers from lower oligomers and monomers. However, partial purification by anion-exchange chromatography was possible. The large subunits recognized the reaction-intermediate analog, 2'-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, thus enabling measurement of catalytic site concentrations, but the binding was much weaker than to the holoenzyme. E. coli-produced large subunits catalyzed carboxylation with a kcat of 1% of that of the holoenzyme and the substrate affinities were 3- to 5-fold weaker. They also assembled with heterologous small subunits isolated from spinach ribulose-P2 carboxylase with a 100-fold increase in catalytic activity under standard assay conditions. Since catalysis can proceed in their absence, the small subunits cannot be directly involved in the catalytic chemistry. Their stimulative influence upon catalysis must be exerted by conformational means."

https://openalex.org/W1544833181,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is regulated by EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation and by phorbol ester-stimulated, protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) mediated phosphorylation at identified sites. The EGF receptor contains additional phosphorylation sites including a prominent phosphothreonine and several phosphoserines which account for the majority of phosphate covalently bound to the receptor in vivo. We have identified three of these sites in EGF receptor purified from 32P-labeled A431 cells. The major phosphothreonine was identified as threonine 669 in the EGF receptor sequence. Phosphoserine residues were identified as serines 671 and 1046/1047 of the EGF receptor. Two other phosphoserine residues were localized to tryptic peptides containing multiple serine residues located carboxyl-terminal to the conserved protein kinase domain. The amino acid sequences surrounding the three identified phosphorylation sites are highly conserved in the EGF receptor and the protein products of the v-erb B and neu oncogenes. Analysis of predicted secondary structure of the EGF receptor reveals that all of the phosphorylation sites are located near beta turns. In A431 cells phosphorylation of the serine residues was dependent upon serum. In mouse B82 L cells transfected with a wild type human EGF receptor. EGF increased the 32P content in all tryptic phosphopeptides. A mutant EGF receptor lacking protein tyrosine kinase activity was phosphorylated only at threonine 669. Regulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at these threonine and serine residues may influence aspects of receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1549924584,"The peptide pheromone, cCF10, which induces aggregation and high frequency plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis cells carrying the tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCF10, was isolated and its structure determined. The molecular weight of cCF10 is 789, and its amino acid sequence is H-Leu-Val-Thr-Leu-Val-Phe-Val-OH. Pheromone activity, as determined by a clumping induction assay, was detectable at a concentration of 2.5 x 10(-11) M. A peptide of the same sequence as that of the cCF10 produced by S. faecalis cells was synthesized by the liquid-phase method. The synthetic pheromone showed biological activity and chromatographic behavior that was identical to that of the cCF10 of bacterial origin. When the response of S. faecalis cells to various concentrations of synthetic cCF10 was monitored by measuring both the frequency of plasmid transfer and the synthesis of pheromone-inducible antigens, an excellent correlation was observed between donor ability and the appearance of a 150-kilodalton protein that appears to be involved in formation of mating aggregates. The dose-response data in the range of concentrations where the amount of pheromone became limiting (10(-11)-10(-12) M) were consistent with the notion that as few as one or two molecules per donor cell may be sufficient to induce a mating response."
https://openalex.org/W1498266611,"The involvement of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) in insulin action has been investigated in an in vitro system. Insulin receptors that have been purified by wheat germ lectin chromatography and either tyrosine-agarose chromatography, sucrose density centrifugation, or insulin-Sepharose chromatography have been co-inserted into phospholipid vesicles with different purified G proteins. The results of these studies indicate that a specific insulin-promoted phosphorylation of two G proteins, Go and Gi, can occur in these phospholipid vesicles. Bovine retinal transducin is a poor substitute for Go and Gi, being only weakly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, and bovine brain Gs is not a substrate. The phosphorylation of Gi and Go occurs primarily on the alpha-subunits. Under optimal conditions, about one alpha o- or alpha i-subunit is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue for every two beta-subunits of the insulin receptor, suggesting a 1:1 interaction between these G proteins and the heterotetrameric (alpha 2 beta 2) insulin receptor molecular. The inactive (GDP-bound) form of the alpha-subunits appears to be the preferred substrate, with the phosphorylation being significantly reduced in alpha o and alpha i upon the binding of guanosine 5′-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) and completely eliminated in the pure alpha-GTP gamma S complex of transducin. The Gi and Go proteins also cause an enhancement of the insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. This enhancement is a reflection of an increased incorporation of the insulin receptor into lipid vesicles which is induced by these G proteins. Taken together these results provide evidence for the interactions of G proteins with the insulin receptor in a lipid milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1569800624,"In order to determine whether translocation of intracellular glucose transporters to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation accounts entirely for the increase in glucose transport, a method was developed to measure the relative amount of transporter at the cell surface. Glycoproteins at the cell surface, including the glucose transporter, were labeled by oxidation with galactose oxidase and then reduction by borotritide at 4 degrees C; subsequently the glucose transporter was isolated by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in transporter at the cell surface. Under the same conditions, the rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was increased 11-fold. These results both provide further evidence that translocation of the glucose transporter occurs in response to insulin and indicate that it does not account for the full stimulation. Most likely, insulin also increases the intrinsic activity of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1570822537,"A method involving labeling to isotopic steady state and modeling of the tricarboxylic acid cycle has been used to identify the respiratory substrates in lettuce embryos during the early steps of germination. We have compared the specific radioactivities of aspartate and glutamate and of glutamate C-1 and C-5 after labeling with different substrates. Labeling with [U-14C]acetate and 14CO2 was used to verify the validity of the model for this study; the relative labeling of aspartate and glutamate was that expected from the normal operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. After labeling with 14CO2, the label distribution in the glutamate molecule (95% of the label at glutamate C-1) was consistent with an input of carbon via the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase reaction, and the relative specific radioactivities of aspartate and glutamate permitted the quantification of the apparent rate of the fumarase reaction. CO2 and intermediates related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle were labeled with [U-14C]acetate, [1-14C] hexanoate, or [U-14C]palmitic acid. The ratios of specific radioactivities of asparate to glutamate and of glutamate C-1 to C-5 indicated that the fatty acids were degraded to acetyl units, suggesting the operation of beta-oxidation, and that the acety-CoA was incorporated directly into citrate. Short-term labeling with [1-14C]hexanoate showed that citrate and glutamate were labeled earlier than malate and aspartate, showing that this fatty acid was metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle rather than the glyoxylate cycle. This was in agreement with the flux into gluconeogenesis compared to efflux as respiratory CO2. The fraction of labeled substrate incorporated into carbohydrates was only about 5% of that converted to CO2; the carbon flux into gluconeogenesis was determined after labeling with 14CO2 and [1-14C]hexanoate from the specific radioactivity of aspartate C-1 and the amount of label incorporated into the carbohydrate fraction. It was only 7.4% of the efflux of respiratory CO2. The labeling of alanine indicates a low activity of either a malic enzyme or the sequence phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase/pyruvate kinase. After labeling with [U-14C]glucose, the ratios of specific radioactivities indicated that the labeled carbohydrates contributed less than 10% to the flux of acetyl-CoA. The model indicated that the glycolytic flux is partitioned one-third to pyruvate and two-thirds to oxalacetate and is therefore mainly anaplerotic. The possible role of fatty acids as the main source of acetyl-CoA for respiration is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1606902643,"Abstract Nitrate reductase, encoded by the nar operon in Escherichia coli, is produced only under anaerobic conditions and induced to its maximum level in the presence of nitrate. The anaerobic expression of the nar operon depends on the fnr gene product (Fnr), and the stimulation of anaerobic expression by nitrate requires the narL gene product (NarL). Distinct regulatory domains within the nar promoter are involved in these two responses. The specific locations of the sequences required for these two regulatory mechanisms were identified by analysis of a detailed set of deletions extending into the regulatory region of the nar operon from the 5' end. A region located around -55 base pairs (bp) from the transcriptional start site and immediately upstream from the presumed RNA polymerase binding site was required for the response to Fnr and anaerobic conditions. A base sequence no longer than 27 bp, located at about -200 bp, was essential for the stimulation by nitrate coupled with NarL. This NarL-specific sequence was equally effective if positioned 10 or 11 bp further upstream or downstream from its wild type position. However, it was ineffective if positioned 4, 6, or 14 bp or greater distances either upstream or downstream. Apparent autoregulation by active nitrate reductase occurred in all 5'-deletion constructions which retained the Fnr response, indicating that this regulatory phenomenon involves sequences located no further than -64 bp from the transcription start site."
https://openalex.org/W2162777274,"We have determined that parasite entry into host cells can be influenced by cell polarity using a DNA probe to quantitate the infection of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas' disease. Confluent MDCK cells are polarized, with their plasma membrane separated by tight junctions into two domains, apical and basolateral. We show that T. cruzi forms corresponding to the insect infective stages (metacyclics) and the vertebrate blood stages (trypomastigotes) enter confluent MDCK cells preferentially through their basolateral domains. Sparsely plated MDCK cells are less polarized and are better infected than confluent cells. Scanning electron microscopy showed that 92% ± 4% of the parasites entered at the edges of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543712339,"The expression and developmental regulation of the alpha and beta subunits of the guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins, Gi and Go, were examined in rat atria and ventricles. Protein levels were determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis using affinity purified monospecific antibodies. Northern blot and dot blot analyses were used to characterize and quantitate relative amounts of mRNA encoding these G protein subunits. The concentrations of Go alpha, Gi alpha, and beta subunit protein were found to be greater in adult atrial than in adult ventricular membranes (5.2-, 1.5-, and 2.8-fold, respectively). A corresponding 3.4-fold difference in Go alpha mRNA level was also observed, as well as a 1.3-fold difference in Gi alpha-3 mRNA level. No difference was seen between the amount of beta, Gi alpha-1, Gi alpha-2 mRNA in adult atria and adult ventricles. Comparison of neonatal and adult tissues revealed a developmental decrease in ventricular Gi alpha protein and Gi alpha-2 mRNA levels (70 and 47%, respectively). Developmental decreases were also observed in the amount of mRNA encoding beta and Go alpha in ventricles (47 and 61%, respectively), and beta and Gi alpha-2 in atria (40 and 36%, respectively), while a developmental increase in atrial Gi alpha-3 mRNA levels was observed (57%). These results demonstrate differences in the expression of G protein subunits in rat atria and ventricles, as well as regulation of the levels of these subunits during cardiac development."
https://openalex.org/W1556753095,"We have previously shown that recombinant murine interferon-gamma, rIFN-gamma, and recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha, rIL-1 alpha, induce differentiation of murine pre-B-like cell line 70Z/3, a finding associated with stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange across the plasma membrane. The present study was designed to test whether the enhanced Na+/H+ exchange is mediated by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. The results show that two structurally different peptides, rIFN-gamma and rIL-1 alpha, induce identical patterns of transient translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the membranes. The increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C activity was first detected 20 min after exposure to the lymphokines. This activity peaked at 30 min and was back to baseline by 2 h. At each time point, the increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C activity corresponded to a decrease in the activity of protein kinase C in the cytoplasmic fraction. The total cellular activity (cytosol + membrane) remained the same. Two series of experiments were carried out to test the role of protein kinase C in mediating the lymphokine-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange. In the first, the effects of rIFN-gamma and rIL-1 alpha on cytoplasmic pH were measured in the presence of a protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, H-7. In the second, rIFN-gamma- and rIL-1 alpha-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization was determined in cells containing decreased protein kinase C activity. Under both experimental conditions, lymphokine-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization was not attenuated. These results indicate that, although both rIFN-gamma and rIL-1 alpha cause association of protein kinase C with membranes, activation of protein kinase C is not required for rIFN-gamma or rIL-1 alpha to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange across the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1583447738,"Abstract NMR spectroscopy of 13C-labeled human low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been employed to characterize the lysine (Lys) residues in apo B-100. Reductive methylation with [13C]formaldehyde converts up to two-thirds of the Lys to the dimethylamino derivative; this pool of Lys is exposed at the surface of the LDL particle. The [13C]dimethyl-Lys which are visualized exhibit resonances at chemical shifts of 42.8 and 43.2 ppm (pH 7.6) indicating that they exist in two different microenvironments; this is a reflection of the native conformation of apo B associated with lipid, because the labeled, reduced, and alkylated protein gives a single resonance when dissolved in 7 M guanidine hydrochloride. The pH dependences of the Lys chemical shifts indicate that the two types of Lys titrate with different pK values; Lys have a pK of 8.9, while Lys have a pK of 10.5. About 53 active Lys and 172 normal Lys are exposed on the surface of LDL with the remaining 132 Lys which are present in the human apo B-100 molecule being buried and unavailable for methylation. Addition of paramagnetic ions indicates that the active and normal Lys have different exposures to the aqueous phase; apparently this is a reflection of folding of the apo B molecule. The relative involvement of active and normal Lys in binding of apo B-100 to the LDL receptor on fibroblasts was explored by measuring the decrease in receptor binding as a function of the degree of methylation of the two types of Lys. Upper limits of 21 active and 31 normal Lys in the entire apo B-100 molecule are involved in the binding of LDL to the receptor. It is likely that these Lys are located in domains of apo B which contain clusters of basic amino acid residues and also bind heparin. If the sequence corresponding to apo B-48 (residues 1-2151) which does not bind to the receptor is excluded, then the above limits are halved; an upper limit of 10 active Lys may be particularly involved in receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W1569324951,"The Mr approximately 540,000 dimeric actin gelation protein, actin-binding protein (ABP), has previously been shown in human platelets to link actin to membrane glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) (Fox, J. E. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11970-11977; Okita, J. R., Pidard, D., Newman, P. J., Montgomery, R. R., and Kunicki, T. J. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 317-321). We have examined further the interaction between ABP and GPIb. Platelet extracts were depleted of ABP by precipitation with anti-ABP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); in resulting precipitates, ABP monomer is complexed with GPIb in a 5:1 molar ratio. The ABP.GPIb complex is resistant to chaotropic solvents but dissociated by the ionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate. Treatment of intact platelets with the ionophore A23187 activates a Ca2+-dependent protease which cleaves the Mr approximately 270,000 ABP subunit into three fragments of Mr 190,000, 100,000, and 90,000; the latter fragment is derived from the Mr 100,000 fragment. Anti-ABP mAbs coprecipitated GPIb with the Mr 100,000 and 90,000 fragments, but not with the Mr 190,000 fragment which contains the ABP self-association site. In the reciprocal experiment, anti-GPIb antibodies co-precipitated only the Mr 100,000 and 90,000 ABP fragments. Actin also co-precipitated with the Mr 100,000 and 90,000, but not with the Mr 190,000 ABP fragment. The anti-ABP mAb that precipitated the Mr 100,000-90,000 GPIb-binding ABP fragment recognizes a trypsin cleavage fragment of ABP that binds actin filaments in vitro. These findings establish that both the GPIb-binding site and actin-binding sites are in the same region of the ABP monomer. Because of the extended bipolar conformation of the ABP molecule, the data suggest that the GPIb.actin-binding region is located remote from the self-association, or dimerization, site of the ABP subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1562667733,"Manduca sexta hemolymph lipid transfer particle (LTP) is a very high density lipoprotein (d = 1.23 g/ml) containing 14% lipid and 5% carbohydrate. Each of three apoprotein components, apoLTP-I (Mr approximately 320,000), apoLTP-II (Mr = 85,000), and apoLTP-III (Mr = 55,000), is glycosylated. Carbohydrate analysis revealed the presence of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine in a ratio of 4.5:1. A native Mr greater than 670,000 was determined by pore limiting gradient gel electrophoresis. Lipid analysis of LTP revealed the presence of phospholipid, diacylglycerol (DAG), free fatty acid, and triacylglycerol. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against LTP were obtained. Anti-LTP serum was employed in experiments which indicated the presence of LTP in larval and adult animals and confirmed that LTP was unrelated to other M. sexta hemolymph proteins and lipoproteins. A quantitative lipid transfer assay measuring facilitated DAG exchange between isolated M. sexta lipoproteins was established. The level of LTP-catalyzed exchange of DAG increased linearly with increasing time and protein during the initial phase of the reaction. Inclusion of anti-LTP serum in the assay inhibited facilitated DAG exchange. Experiments designed to determine if the LTP holoprotein is required for transfer or if a component of LTP is the active principle were performed. Incubation of [3H]DAG labeled high density lipophorin with substrate amounts of LTP resulted in incorporation of labeled DAG into LTP. Subsequent incubation of [3H]DAG-labeled LTP with unlabeled lipophorin resulted in exchange of DAG and the appearance of labeled DAG in lipophorin. Nitrocellulose-bound LTP apoproteins did not facilitate DAG exchange, and pretreatment of LTP with detergents resulted in loss of transfer activity. Extraction of LTP lipids with ethanol/ether also resulted in loss of activity. The results suggest that the lipid component of LTP may be important in the transfer reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1599169969,"We have described a human tumor T cell line, IARC 301, which constitutively expresses high affinity interleukin 2 (IL2) receptors, and showed that after binding to its receptors, IL2 is endocytosed and degraded. Here we present evidence that IL2 down-regulates its own high affinity receptors. Within 1 h, IL2 induces a 60% decrease in surface receptor expression. In order to maintain this down-regulation, IL2 concentration must be high enough for the receptors to be saturated throughout the incubation. The effect of IL2 on the kinetics of receptor internalization was investigated with two approaches. First, the initial rate of IL2 internalization was measured, and no difference could be detected whether the receptors were saturated with IL2 or only partially occupied. Second, the initial rate of surface receptor decay was followed and found to be significantly decreased in the presence of IL2. Although the half-life of IL2 receptors is very short in the absence of IL2, t 1/2 approximately 65 min, suggesting that these receptors are constantly endocytosed, it can still be reduced to t 1/2 approximately 25 min when the receptors are saturated with ligand. This suggests that occupied receptors are internalized faster than and independently from free receptors. The difference in internalization rates can explain the observed receptor down-regulation."

Genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that the expression of AFB1-4-hydroxylase is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon locus and suggested that different cytochrome P-450 isozymes catalyze AFB1-4-hydroxylase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities. We have now examined lysates from mammalian cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing expressible cytochrome P1-450 or P3-450 cDNAs for their ability to metabolize AFB1 to AFM1. Our results show that cytochrome P3-450 cDNA specifies AFB1-4-hydroxylase. This is the first direct assignment of a specific cytochrome P-450 to an AFB1 detoxification pathway. This finding may have relevance to the dietary modulation of AFB1 hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1541798822,"The Bacillus subtilis hom gene, encoding homoserine dehydrogenase (L-homoserine:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.3) has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The B. subtilis enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli is sensitive by inhibition by threonine and allows complementation of a strain lacking homoserine dehydrogenases I and II. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that the hom stop codon overlaps the start codon of thrC (threonine synthase) suggesting that these genes, as well as thrB (homoserine kinase) located downstream from thrC, belong to the same transcription unit. The deduced amino acid sequence of the B. subtilis homoserine dehydrogenase shows extensive similarity with the C-terminal part of E. coli aspartokinases-homoserine dehydrogenases I and II; this similarity starts at the exact point where the similarity between E. coli or B. subtilis aspartokinases and E. coli aspartokinases-homoserine dehydrogenases stops. These data suggest that the E. coli bifunctional polypeptide could have resulted from the direct fusion of ancestral aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase. The B. subtilis homoserine dehydrogenase has a C-terminal extension of about 100 residues (relative to the E. coli enzymes) that could be involved in the regulation of the enzyme activity."

These two isozymes, with 11 amino acid substitutions between them, are similar in their Km values for GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and Kcat values for this conjugation reaction. The human GSH S-transferase 2-2, however, is a more active GSH peroxidase than transferase 1-1 toward cumene hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide. Our results indicate that different members of a GSH S-transferase gene family with limited amino acid substitutions have different with limited amino acid substitutions have different but overlapping substrate specificities. We propose that accumulation of single amino acid replacements may be an important mechanism for generating diversity in GSH S-transferases with various xenobiotic substrates. In situ chromosomal hybridization results show that the GSH transferase Ha genes are located in the region of 6p12."

The antiproliferative activity of the hybrid protein in vitro was greatly increased compared with either interferon-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-beta alone, and both antiviral activity and cytotoxic effect were retained in the hybrid protein. The hybrid protein may have potential clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W1571003781,"The ability of angiotensin II to down-regulate its receptor was tested on rat hepatocytes in primary culture for 4 h. Angiotensin II treatment decreased [3H]angiotensin II specific binding in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The effect was maximum with 1 microM angiotensin II and after 2 h. There was a decrease in the maximum number of binding sites (56% of control) with no significant effect on the apparent dissociation constant. The down-regulation was blocked by the angiotensin II antagonist [Val4,Ile7]angiotensin III and was not induced by other hormones (e.g. vasopressin, norepinephrine, or glucagon) or by 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate or A23187 ionophore. The decrease in angiotensin II receptors resulted in correlated decreases in the potency of angiotensin II to activate phosphorylase or lower glucagon-induced cAMP accumulation. However, high concentrations of the agonist were still able to elicit maximal responses in both parameters. Down-regulation of the receptor was not dependent upon active Gi, since it was still observed after ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of Gi by pertussis toxin. The above results indicate that the down-regulation of the hepatic angiotensin II receptor induced by its agonist is homologous and does not involve Gi, Ca2+, or protein kinase C. The correlation of receptor loss with decreases in the potency of angiotensin to activate phosphorylase and inhibit glucagon-induced cAMP accumulation is consistent with the idea that a single receptor population regulates two different messengers, i.e. calcium and cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1939273684,"The cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex is a component of the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol-8 within the cytoplasmic membrane and the reduction of molecular oxygen to water along with the concomitant generation of a proton-motive force across the membrane. Previous studies have established that the oxidase is composed of one copy of each of two subunits (I and II), and contains four heme prosthetic groups. The hydropathy profiles of the amino acid sequences suggest that each subunit has multiple transmembrane-spanning helical segments. The goal of the current work is to obtain experimental information about which portions of the two polypeptide chains are facing the cytoplasm. This is part of an effort to determine the topological folding of the two subunits across the membrane. A number of random gene fusions were generated in vitro which encode hybrid proteins in which the amino-terminal portion is provided by one of the two subunits of the oxidase, and the carboxyl-terminal portion is beta-galactosidase. Studies from other systems have indicated that the only hybrid proteins which will manifest high beta-galactosidase specific activity and be membrane-bound will be those where the fusion junction is in a region of the cytochrome polypeptides facing the cytoplasm. Fusions were obtained in eight positions within subunit I and 11 positions within subunit II. These identified four cytoplasmic-facing regions within subunit II, consistent with its hydropathy profile showing eight transmembrane helices. The data with subunit I are less conclusive."
https://openalex.org/W1523643475,"The length of the prereplicative period after stimulation of quiescent WI-38 cells is prolonged in proportion to the length of time the cells are incubated prior to serum addition. Previous results from this laboratory have shown that this prolongation does not result from a delay in the induction of events which occur during the G0/G1 transition (i.e. c-fos or c-myc expression) (Owen, T., Cosenza, S., Soprano, D. R., and Soprano, K. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262 15111-15117). It was the goal of the present studies to examine the expression of other growth-associated genes known to be induced and maximally accumulate later in G1 to identify genes whose expression is coupled to entry into S rather than mitogenic stimulation. In order to do this, the temporal pattern of expression of a variety of growth-associated genes (thymidine kinase, p53, 2A9/calcyclin, ornithine decarboxylase, 4F1/vimentin, and c-Ha-ras) was studied in WI-38 cells stimulated either 12 days or 26 days after plating. We report that the time of induction and maximum accumulation of each of these transcripts, with the exception of c-Ha-ras, was delayed in the 26-day cell group for 10 h, a period of time approximately equal to the length of delay in entry of these cells into S. Thus the expression of these particular genes would appear to be closely coupled in time and sequence to the entry of cells into S. These results suggest that the prolongation of the prereplicative period in WI-38 cells is located in early G1, following the events leading to c-fos and c-myc induction but prior to the induction and maximum accumulation later in G1 of other growth-associated genes such as ornithine decarboxylase and 4F1/vimentin. In addition, these results provide molecular evidence for a definitive programmed order of gene expression during the progression of cells out of G0 through G1 to S."

Later subcultures (greater than 4th passage) produce increasing amounts of t-PA antigen, consisting of a major Mr 110,000 and a minor Mr 68,000 form as well as increasing amounts of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen, consisting of a minor Mr 95,000 and major Mr 54,000 form. All of the major plasminogen activator forms were purified to homogeneity from 72 h serum-free conditioned media (3 liters, 1-1.8 x 10(9) cells) by a combination of immunoaffinity and gel filtration chromatography. Typically, 4th to 6th passage cultures produced/secreted t-PA-type proteins consisting of an inactive Mr 110,000 (220 IU/mg) and active Mr 68,000 (76,500 IU/mg) form representing about 39 and 8%, respectively, of the total starting sodium dodecyl sulfate stable t-PA activity, and u-PA-type proteins consisting of an inactive Mr 95,000 (700 IU/mg) and active Mr 54,000 (81,000 IU/mg) form representing about 9 and 38%, respectively, of the total starting sodium dodecyl sulfate stable u-PA activity. The isolated Mr 68,000 t-PA and Mr 54,000 u-PA proteins, exist only as two-chain forms in the absence of aprotinin and as mixtures of single- and two-chain proteins in the presence of aprotinin.

https://openalex.org/W1604383624,"DNA polymerase alpha from Drosophila melanogaster embryos is a multisubunit enzyme complex which can exhibit DNA polymerase, 3′—-5′ exonuclease, and DNA primase activities. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) inhibition of DNA polymerase activity in this complex is time dependent and exhibits saturation kinetics. Inhibition can be reversed by incubation with an excess of a primary amine unless the PLP-enzyme conjugate is first reduced with NaBH4. These results indicate that PLP inhibition occurs via imine formation at a specific site(s) on the enzyme. Results from substrate protection experiments are most consistent with inhibition of DNA polymerase activity by PLP binding to either one of two sites. One site (PLP site 1) can be protected from PLP inhibition by any nucleoside triphosphate in the absence or presence of template-primer, suggesting that PLP site 1 defines a nucleotide-binding site which is important for DNA polymerase activity but which is distinct from the DNA polymerase active site. PLP also inhibits DNA primase activity of the DNA polymerase alpha complex, and primase activity can be protected from PLP inhibition by nucleotide alone, arguing that PLP site 1 lies within the DNA primase active site. The second inhibitory PLP-binding site (PLP site 2) is only protected from PLP inhibition when the enzyme is bound to both template-primer and correct dNTP in a stable ternary complex. Since binding of PLP at site 2 is mutually exclusive with template-directed dNTP binding at the DNA polymerase active site, PLP site 2 appears to define the dNTP binding domain of the active site. Results from initial velocity analysis of PLP inhibition argue that there is a rate-limiting step in the polymerization cycle during product release and/or translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1518165346,"The interactions of proteins with their immobilized ligands in an electrically charged microenvironment were studied. The binding of lectins to erythrocytes and to affinity matrices was used as a model system. Lectins bind and agglutinate erythrocytes in the presence of at least 10 mM NaCl or 1 mM CaCl2, but not in deionized water. The salt dependence of the agglutination process is due to the ability of salts to provide counterions neutralizing the forces of repulsion between the electrostatic charges of similar sign present on the erythrocyte cell surface and on the lectins. The same salt dependence is observed for the binding of lectins to affinity matrices. These observations are the basis of a protein separation process coined affinity-repulsion chromatography in which the electrostatic charges present, or purposely introduced, on affinity matrices are exploited and allow the elution, by electrostatic repulsion, of proteins carrying electrostatic charges of the same sign as that of the matrix. In this process, proteins are loaded on the affinity matrix in a salt solution and eluted with deionized water. Affinity-repulsion chromatography has been successfully applied here to the isolation of several lectins. Its physicochemical basis, merits, and potential applications are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1597180760,"Expression of the ompC gene coding for an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli is regulated by a transcriptional activation mechanism that requires the ompR gene product that acts on nucleotide sequences located upstream of the -35 and -10 regions of the ompC promoter. Using an ompC-lacZ fusion gene, the orientation of the cis-acting upstream sequence (OmpR-binding site) with respect to the canonical -35 and -10 regions (RNA polymerase-binding site) was changed. The ompC gene was activated in an OmpR-dependent manner even when the upstream sequence was in the reverse orientation with respect to the -35 and -10 regions, providing that these two DNA elements were aligned stereospecifically on the DNA helix. Evidence is presented that the upstream sequence can increase the transcription efficiency of the ompC promoter in a manner relatively independent of its orientation with respect to the -35 and -10 regions."
https://openalex.org/W1575800008,"We have identified the site of tyrosine sulfation in an insect secretory protein, yolk protein 2 of Drosophila melanogaster. Yolk proteins were purified from [35S]sulfate-labeled flies, and yolk protein 2 was separated from yolk protein 1 and yolk protein 3 by preparative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After digestion of yolk protein 2 with trypsin and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, the sulfate label was recovered in two distinct sulfopeptides which, however, had identical NH2-terminal sequences and contained 3 tyrosine residues each. After chymotryptic digestion of the two tryptic sulfopeptides, the sulfate label was recovered in one sulfopeptide which contained a single tyrosine residue. NH2-terminal sequencing showed that this tyrosine residue corresponded to tyrosine 172 of the yolk protein 2 precursor (Hung, M.-C., and Wensink, P. C. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 164, 487-492) in the sequence Glu-Thr-Thr-Asp-Tyr(S)-Ser-Asn-Glu-Glu. This insect tyrosine sulfation site is very similar to the known vertebrate tyrosine sulfation sites in terms of amino acid composition and secondary structure.

GP2-PL and GP3-PL inhibited [3H]GDP binding to p21 competitively. Incubation of p21 with GP2-PL and GP3-PL followed by reduction with NaBH4 resulted in 40 and 50% loss of [3H]GDP binding activity, respectively, whereas the addition of excess GDP completely protected p21 from the inactivation. The tryptic digest of p21 which was modified with GP2-PL or GP3-PL in the presence or absence of protective GDP and subsequently reduced by NaBH4 was analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The profile of the effluent monitored by the fluorescence from the pyridoxyl moiety showed the existence of peptides which were specifically labeled only in the absence of GDP. Structural analyses of these peptides allowed us to identify the labeled residue as Lys-16. These results suggest that Lys-16 is located in the guanine nucleotide binding site, close to the beta- or gamma-phosphate group of the nucleotide."

The ""endosomes"" were prepared from dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (1 mg), diphtheria toxin (0.25 mg), and lysozyme (2.25 mg) in water at pH 8.4. The method used for preparing large unilamellar vesicles was adapted from the procedure of Shew and Deamer (Shew, R. L., and Deamer, D. W. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 816, 1-8). Efficiencies of trapping (typically 45-75%) and separation from untrapped proteins (typically 95-100%) were assessed by fluorescamine assays conducted before and after column chromatography and in the presence and absence of Tergitol Nonidet P-40. Intramembranous photolabeling revealed that diphtheria toxin inserts into the vesicle bilayer when the pH is dropped to 4; surface labeling revealed that the same treatment leads to exposure of diphtheria toxin at the trans surface of the vesicles. Release of toxin to the solution was not detected under the experimental conditions employed (i.e. with nicked or unnicked toxin, +/- exogenous trypsin, pH 4 or 8.4). Preliminary results indicate that this model system will be a valuable tool for elucidating the pathway by which the ADP ribosyltransferase domain of diphtheria toxin gains access to the cytoplasmic compartment of cells after endosomal uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1551738436,"Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification in the trans Golgi that has been found in all animal species studied. In the preceding paper (Baeuerle, P. A., Lottspeich, F., and Huttner, W. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14925-14929), we have identified the site of tyrosine sulfation in an insect secretory protein, yolk protein 2 (YP2) of Drosophila melanogaster. In the present report, tyrosine sulfation of this protein was examined after expression in a heterologous mammalian cell system. Mouse fibroblasts, transfected with Drosophila YP2 genomic DNA inserted into the eucaryotic expression vector pSV2, secreted the fly protein in sulfated form. Analyses of Drosophila YP2 produced by the mouse cells showed that the features of sulfation of this protein were identical to those previously determined for YP2 isolated from flies. YP2 secreted from mouse fibroblasts was found to be exclusively sulfated on tyrosine residues. The stoichiometry of tyrosine sulfation was approximately 1 mol of sulfate/mol of YP2. Sulfate was linked to the same tyrosine residue as in YP2 isolated from flies, tyrosine 172. These results show that essential parameters of the tyrosine sulfation reaction are very similar in insects and mammals and thus highly conserved in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1566565575,"The chemical forms of inorganic carbon, CO2 or HCO3-, incorporated during photosynthesis in photoautotrophic Euphorbia characias cell suspension cultures were determined in experiments using 13CO2 and a mass spectrometry technique. From the equations of the CO2 hydration reaction, a kinetic model was first developed, and the effect of photosynthesis on the external CO2 concentration was simulated. It was predicted from this model that CO2 and HCO3- uptakes could be differentiated by recording only the CO2 variation rate in the external medium, successively in absence then in presence of an exogenous carbonic anhydrase activity. The results obtained with either CO2-grown or air-grown photoautotrophic cells were in good agreement with the model and demonstrated that CO2 was the sole species taken up during photosynthesis. In addition no accumulation of inorganic carbon within the cells was observed in the light. Similarly, in dark, CO2 was the only species released by respiration in the external medium."
https://openalex.org/W1587235593,"This is part of a series of two papers on gene regulation in Bacillus subtilis rRNA-tRNA operons that contain large clusters of tRNA genes. The preceding paper (Vold, B.S., Okamoto, K., Murphy, B.J., and Green, C.J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14480-14484) investigates the rrnB operon containing 21 tRNA genes, and this paper investigates a B. subtilis rRNA-tRNA operon containing 16 tRNA genes and a minor 5 S rRNA. Hybridization studies suggest this minor 5 S rRNA occurs as a single copy in the B. subtilis 168 genome. S1 nuclease mapping indicates that this minor 5 S rRNA gene has its own promoter. No promoters have been found immediately 5' to any of the major 5 S rRNA species in B. subtilis rRNA operons. S1 mapping of the spacer region between the 23 S and minor 5 S rRNA revealed that the maturation of the 23 S rRNA in this operon may arise from an unusual processing mechanism. S1 nuclease mapping experiments suggest the existence of a promoter element immediately upstream of the last gene, for tRNA(Leu CAA), in the operon. A precursor leucine tRNA resulting from transcription of this last tRNA gene was observed in Northern hybridizations, and the amounts of this precursor increased during sporulation. A single terminator-like element is located just upstream of this last tRNA gene; however, S1 nuclease mapping experiments suggest that some read-through transcription occurs. Thus, all 16 tRNA genes are under control of the upstream 16 S rRNA promoters and the minor 5 S rRNA promoter. However, the last tRNA gene is primarily under the control of its own unique promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1606675740,"Biochemical as well as immunochemical studies were carried out to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the hormonal regulation of nuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunits in ovaries from estrogen-treated hypophysectomized rats. Photoaffinity labeling of nuclear extracts with 8-azido-[32P]cAMP and electrophoretic analysis showed the existence of three variants of the regulatory subunit RI and of a 52,000-dalton RII variant (RII-52) in ovarian nuclei of estrogen-primed hypophysectomized rats. After follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation, an additional variant of RII (RII-51, Mr = 51,000) was detected in nuclei. The cytosolic RII-54 variant (Mr = 54,000) could not be identified in nuclei by photoaffinity labeling. The FSH-mediated appearance of the nuclear RII-51 variant was accompanied by an approximate 2-fold increase of nuclear catalytic subunit activity. Using quantitation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we identified a marked FSH-mediated increase of nuclear RII variant(s) and confirmed the increase of nuclear catalytic subunit levels. Furthermore, morphometric analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic antigen density by immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated a cell-specific modulation by FSH of RII and C subunit density. In granulosa cells, both nuclear as well as cytoplasmic RII density was increased by FSH, whereas catalytic subunit density was increased in the nuclear area only. In thecal cells, FSH increased only the nuclear catalytic subunit density. These results provide biochemical as well as immunochemical evidence for a cell-specific FSH regulation of nuclear RII and catalytic subunit levels which may be involved in the molecular events responsible for the FSH-mediated differentiation of the rat ovary."
https://openalex.org/W1579977879,"Abstract Processing of multimeric precursor tRNAs from Bacillus subtilis by the catalytic RNA component of RNase P was studied in vitro. Previous studies on processing by either Escherichia coli or B. subtilis RNase P-RNA utilized monomeric or dimeric substrates. In the experiments described here, a multimeric precursor tRNA containing six complete tRNA sequences and the partial sequence of a seventh were used. One species did not encode the 3'-terminal CCA sequence and the partial tRNA lacked 3' nucleotides and could form only a 3-base pair instead of a 7-base paired aminoacyl stem. Two species had the potential for forming extended base-paired aminoacyl stems. Processing was studied under varied ionic conditions. Chemical sequencing of the products showed that the RNase P-RNA cleavage produced the proper mature 5' termini for all of the six complete tRNA species, but no 5'-cleavage of the partial species was observed. At suboptimal ionic concentrations, the two species capable of forming extended base-paired aminoacyl stems were not observed. Thus, encoding of the 3'-CCA in a tRNA species is not critical for processing, but the formation of an aminoacyl stem with more than 3 base pairs is necessary. Particularly noteworthy was the observation that all species of the multimeric precursor could be processed at significantly lower ionic conditions than monomeric precursors used previously by ourselves and others. However, a single precursor species produced from the multimeric precursor could also be processed at the same lower ionic conditions as the multimeric precursor. This demonstrates that precursor tRNA species can differ widely in their ionic requirements for processing and that, to a large extent, the optimal conditions of MgCl2 or NH4Cl are a function of the substrate which is used."
