Three research groups have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptional changes accompanying development of vertebrate embryos (see the Perspective by Harland). Wagner et al. sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 90,000 cells throughout zebrafish development to reveal how cells differentiate during axis patterning, germ layer formation, and early organogenesis. Farrell et al. profiled the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of embryonic cells and applied a computational approach to construct a branching tree describing the transcriptional trajectories that lead to 25 distinct zebrafish cell types. The branching tree revealed how cells change their gene expression as they become more and more specialized. Briggs et al. examined whole frog embryos, spanning zygotic genome activation through early organogenesis, to map cell states and differentiation across all cell lineages over time. These data and approaches pave the way for the comprehensive reconstruction of transcriptional trajectories during development.

Young et al. used a light-scattering approach for accurate mass determination of proteins as small as 20 kDa (see the Perspective by Lee and Klenerman). Movies of protein complex association and dissociation were analyzed to extract biophysical parameters from single molecules and assemblies without labeling. Using this approach, the authors determined in vitro kinetics of fibril and aggregate growth and association constants for a complex protein-glycoprotein assembly.

This makes it possible to repolymerize true virgin material for repeated use. Zhu et al. developed a polymer based on a five-membered ring cyclic monomer derived from γ-butyrolactone that could be produced at ambient temperature and mild conditions (see the Perspective by Sardon and Dove). The high-molecular-weight polymer exhibited high crystallinity and thermal stability. However, at hot enough conditions, or at lower temperatures in the presence of a zinc chloride catalyst, the polymer could be returned to its starting monomers and thus recycled into new material.

However, two magnitude-5 earthquakes recently occurred in South Korea during EGS site development. Grigoli et al. and Kim et al. present seismic and geophysical evidence that may implicate the second of these earthquakes, which occurred in Pohang, as an induced event. The combination of data from a local seismometer network, well logs, satellite observations, teleseismic waveform analysis, and stress modeling leads to the assessment that the earthquake was probably or almost certainly anthropogenically induced. The possibility remains that the earthquake occurred coincidentally at the EGS site location, but the aftershock distribution and other lines of evidence are concerning for future development of this geothermal resource.

https://openalex.org/W2802593879,"A selective autophagy receptor identified Autophagosomes engulf and degrade cellular components in lysosomes. Degradation of ribosomes is called ribophagy and is an important source of nutrients. Using a recently reported method to isolate lysosomes, Wyant et al. profiled the dynamics of the lysosomal proteome under different nutrient conditions (see the Perspective by Nofal and Rabinowitz). The protein NUFIP1 is an autophagy receptor for ribosomes during starvation-induced ribophagy. NUFIP1 shuttles out of the nucleus and targets its ribosome cargo directly by binding to an autophagosome protein. Loss of NUFIP1 means failure to provide sufficient nucleotides during starvation and, therefore, loss of cells under low nutrient conditions. Science , this issue p. 751 ; see also p. 710"

However, direct measurements between neurons that participate in a learning process are difficult to obtain. Choi et al. developed the “dual-eGRASP” technique to identify synaptic connections between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. This method could label two different sets of synapses so that their convergence on the same dendrites would be quantified. After contextual fear conditioning in mice, the number and size of spines were increased on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. Science , this issue p. 430"
https://openalex.org/W2799448805,"Genomic association studies of common or rare protein-coding variation have established robust statistical approaches to account for multiple testing. Here we present a comparable framework to evaluate rare and de novo noncoding single-nucleotide variants, insertion/deletions, and all classes of structural variation from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Integrating genomic annotations at the level of nucleotides, genes, and regulatory regions, we define 51,801 annotation categories. Analyses of 519 autism spectrum disorder families did not identify association with any categories after correction for 4,123 effective tests. Without appropriate correction, biologically plausible associations are observed in both cases and controls. Despite excluding previously identified gene-disrupting mutations, coding regions still exhibited the strongest associations. Thus, in autism, the contribution of de novo noncoding variation is probably modest in comparison to that of de novo coding variants. Robust results from future WGS studies will require large cohorts and comprehensive analytical strategies that consider the substantial multiple-testing burden. This study presents a framework to evaluate rare and de novo variation from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The work suggests that robust results from WGS studies will require large cohorts and strategies that consider the substantial multiple-testing burden."
https://openalex.org/W2951427191,"Multiple methods have been developed to estimate narrow-sense heritability, h2, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in unrelated individuals. However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods has not yet been performed, leading to confusion and discrepancy in the literature. We present the most thorough and realistic comparison of these methods to date. We used thousands of real whole-genome sequences to simulate phenotypes under varying genetic architectures and confounding variables, and we used array, imputed, or whole genome sequence SNPs to obtain ‘SNP-heritability’ estimates. We show that SNP-heritability can be highly sensitive to assumptions about the frequencies, effect sizes, and levels of linkage disequilibrium of underlying causal variants, but that methods that bin SNPs according to minor allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium are less sensitive to these assumptions across a wide range of genetic architectures and possible confounding factors. These findings provide guidance for best practices and proper interpretation of published estimates. This analysis compares methods for estimating the heritability and genetic architecture of complex traits using whole-genome data. The results provide guidance for best practices and proper interpretation of published heritability estimates."

The question of how they move in rhythmic oscillations has puzzled scientists for centuries. Lin and Nicastro used cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the activity states of individual dynein motors with respect to their locations within beating flagella. They observed an asymmetric distribution of dynein activity and the switching of conformations of dyneins and their regulators between opposite sides of active flagella. The results confirm the switching aspect of the prevailing “switch-point” hypothesis but change the view with respect to how dynein activities are coordinated to drive flagellar motility.

Kunkel et al. , Fadel et al. , and Lange et al. achieved this so-called distributed entanglement in a particularly challenging setting: an ensemble of many cold atoms (see the Perspective by Cavalcanti). In all three studies, the entanglement was first created within an atomic cloud, which was then allowed to expand.

https://openalex.org/W3098970098,"Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled particles. In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, highly entangled states containing thousands of particles have been generated, outnumbering any other physical system by orders of magnitude. The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental particle-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical particles, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems. Here we present the generation of entanglement between two spatially separated clouds by splitting an ensemble of ultracold identical particles. Since the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable particles for quantum information applications."
https://openalex.org/W2800336448,"Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) control organismic development in higher eukaryotes through epigenetic gene repression1-4. PRC proteins do not contain DNA-binding domains, thus prompting questions regarding how PRCs find their target loci 5 . Here we present genome-wide evidence of PRC2 recruitment by telomere-repeat-binding factors (TRBs) through telobox-related motifs in Arabidopsis. A triple trb1-2, trb2-1, and trb3-2 (trb1/2/3) mutant with a developmental phenotype and a transcriptome strikingly similar to those of strong PRC2 mutants showed redistribution of trimethyl histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27me3) marks and lower H3K27me3 levels, which were correlated with derepression of TRB1-target genes. TRB1-3 physically interacted with the PRC2 proteins CLF and SWN. A SEP3 reporter gene with a telobox mutation showed ectopic expression, which was correlated with H3K27me3 depletion, whereas tethering TRB1 to the mutated cis element partially restored repression. We propose that telobox-related motifs recruit PRC2 through the interaction between TRBs and CLF/SWN, a mechanism essential for H3K27me3 deposition at a subset of target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2802415313,"Metastasis is the migration of cancerous cells from a primary tumor to other anatomical sites. Although metastasis was long thought to result from monoclonal seeding, or single cellular migrations, recent phylogenetic analyses of metastatic cancers have reported complex patterns of cellular migrations between sites, including polyclonal migrations and reseeding. However, accurate determination of migration patterns from somatic mutation data is complicated by intratumor heterogeneity and discordance between clonal lineage and cellular migration. We introduce MACHINA, a multi-objective optimization algorithm that jointly infers clonal lineages and parsimonious migration histories of metastatic cancers from DNA sequencing data. MACHINA analysis of data from multiple cancers shows that migration patterns are often not uniquely determined from sequencing data alone and that complicated migration patterns among primary tumors and metastases may be less prevalent than previously reported. MACHINA's rigorous analysis of migration histories will aid in studies of the drivers of metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2802507063,"Prions are protein-based infectious agents that autocatalytically convert the cellular prion protein PrPC to its pathological isoform PrPSc. Subsequent aggregation and accumulation of PrPSc in nervous tissues causes several invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. Prions can infect recipient cells when packaged into endosome-derived nanoparticles called exosomes, which are present in biological fluids such as blood, urine, and saliva. Autophagy is a basic cellular degradation and recycling machinery that also affects exosomal processing, but whether autophagy controls release of prions in exosomes is unclear. Our work investigated the effect of autophagy modulation on exosomal release of prions and how this interplay affects cellular prion infection. Exosomes isolated from cultured murine central neuronal cells (CAD5) and peripheral neuronal cells (N2a) contained prions as shown by immunoblotting for PrPSc, prion-conversion activity, and cell culture infection. We observed that autophagy stimulation with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly inhibited exosomal prion release. In contrast, inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the autophagy protein Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) greatly increased the release of exosomes and exosome-associated prions. We also show that a difference in exosomal prion release between CAD5 and N2a cells is related to differences at the level of basal autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy modulation can control lateral transfer of prions by interfering with their exosomal release. We describe a novel role of autophagy in the prion life cycle, an understanding that may provide useful targets for containing prion diseases.

The impact of autophagy on exosomal release of prions is not known. In this work, we address the link between autophagy, exosomes and release of prion infectivity in two different cell culture models. Persistently prion-infected ScCAD5 cells are used as neuronal cells of CNS origin; ScN2a cells represent peripheral nervous system neuronal cells. Upon stimulating autophagy using rapamycin, we found a decrease in exosomal release and exosome-associated prions. On the other hand, disruption of the autophagic machinery by knocking out Atg5 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology resulted in increased release of exosomes and increase in exosome-associated PrPSc. Similarly, inhibition of autophagy using wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) enhanced the secretion of exosomes and of exosomal PrPSc. In summary, our work shows that autophagy modulation controls exosomal release and, consequently, secretion of prions in exosomes. These findings help to better understand how autophagy can control cellular prion infection, not only via regulation of autophagosomal-lysosomal prion clearance but also by controlling exosomal release of prions. To study the effect of autophagy on exosomal release of prions, we used two prion-infected cell culture models. The murine cell lines ScCAD5 (CNS, catecholaminergic/neuronal) and ScN2a (peripheral nervous system, neuroblastoma/neuronal) are both persistently infected with the mouse-adapted scrapie prion strain 22L (59Gilch S.

Exosomes isolated from cell culture media of ScCAD5 and ScN2a cells were characterized as shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, respectively. The protein markers for exosomes flotillin-1, Alix, Tsg101, CD63, CD9, and HSC70 were detected in isolated exosomes from both cell lines using immunoblotting (Figs. 1D and 2D). The purity of isolated exosomes was confirmed by lack of Golgi (GM130), mitochondrial (Bcl2), and nuclear (nucleoporin p62) contaminants (Figs. 1D and 2D). Transmission EM (TEM) imaging of exosomal preparations showed vesicles with approximate diameters from 80 to 150 nm, and the morphology of vesicles was consistent with the previously reported cup shape of exosomes (Figs. 1A and 2A) (61Coleman B.M.

To address in these cell models the role of exosomes in the release of prion proteins (both cellular and pathological isoforms) into the extracellular milieu, exosomes isolated from cell-free culture media of ScCAD5 and ScN2a cells were subjected to proteinase K digestion, and then both nontreated (−PK) and treated (+PK) fractions were analyzed in immunoblot for PrP using the monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 4H11. As expected, total PrP (−PK) and PrPSc (+PK) were detected in exosomes, which confirms the packaging of both PrP isoforms into exosomes in these cell lines (Figs. 1B and 2B). For further characterization of the exosomes, we analyzed the fractionation of 100,000 × g exosome isolate in a continuous sucrose gradient. As expected, the exosomes reside in fractions with density ranged from 1.13 to 1.18 g/ml (Figs. 1E and 2E). This fraction’s density range has been previously reported to contain the exosomes, which indicates the high purity of our exosome isolates (23Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A.

Interestingly, both total PrP and PrPSc were enriched in the same density gradient fractions as the exosomes, indicating that secreted PrPSc may be associated with the exosomes in both cell lines (Figs. 1E and 2E). Of note, some PrPSc was found in the collected pellets at all steps of the differential centrifugation (2,000 × g and 10,000 × g), indicating a considerable amount of PrPSc released into the culture media in both cell lines (Fig. S1, A and B).Figure 2Characterization of exosomes isolated from N2a/ScN2a cells.

Due to the lack of efficacious pesticides, crop rotations, and resistant potato cultivars against the disease, we investigated whether biological control can serve as an alternative approach. In this study, multiple Bacillus species were isolated from healthy potato tubers, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Ba01 was chosen for further analyses based on its potency against the potato common scab pathogen Streptomyces scabies. Ba01 inhibited the growth and sporulation of S. scabies and secreted secondary metabolites such as surfactin, iturin A, and fengycin with potential activity against S. scabies as determined by imaging mass spectrometry. In pot assays, the disease severity of potato common scab decreased from 55.6 ± 11.1% (inoculated with S. scabies only) to 4.2 ± 1.4% (inoculated with S. scabies and Ba01). In the field trial, the disease severity of potato common scab was reduced from 14.4 ± 2.9% (naturally occurring) to 5.6 ± 1.1% after Ba01 treatment, representing evidence that Bacillus species control potato common scab in nature."

Creating a series of mutants of both CtBP1 and CtBP2, we tested the hypothesis that the crystallographically observed interdimer pairing stabilizes the solution tetramer. MALS data confirmed that these mutants disrupt both CtBP1 and CtBP2 tetramers, with the dimer generally remaining intact, providing the first stereochemical models for tetrameric assemblies of CtBP1 and CtBP2. The crystal structure of a subtle destabilizing mutant suggested that small structural perturbations of the hinge region linking the substrate- and NAD-binding domains are sufficient to weaken the CtBP1 tetramer.

CtBP co-transcriptional function is important in normal embryogenesis, as it is a regulator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and is integral in proper fetal cell differentiation. Knockout experiments in mice reveal distinct roles for CtBP1 and CtBP2 in development, with the loss of CtBP2 embryonically lethal, whereas CtBP1-null mice are small but the majority survive (6Hildebrand J.D.

Alternate splice forms of CtBP1 and -2 also have nonnuclear roles, including membrane trafficking (7Corda D. Colanzi A. Luini A.

Here, we present multi-angle light scattering (MALS) data showing that the predominant form of CtBP1 and CtBP2 when bound to NAD(H) is tetrameric, with tetramers forming even in the absence of the full C terminus. Moreover, our mutant data provide strong evidence that the solution tetramer is very similar to the tetrameric assembly observed within crystals of the minimal dehydrogenase domains for both CtBP1 and CtBP2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the CtBP1 A123V mutant reported here suggests that small perturbations in the flexible hinge region are capable of destabilizing the CtBP tetramer. We investigated the oligomeric state of CtBP1 and CtBP2 using MALS linked with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Our initial experiments were carried out using the minimal dehydrogenase domain constructs that we had previously used for crystallization, CtBP1(28–353) and CtBP2(31–364) (37Hilbert B.J.

In contrast with a previous report (30Madison D.L. Wirz J.A. Siess D. Lundblad J.R. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-induced multimerization of the co-repressor CtBP1 relies on a switching tryptophan.J. Biol.

SEC-MALS results for CtBP oligomerization as a function of NADH concentration are shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1. Fitting of the molecular mass dependence on NADH concentration (see “Experimental procedures”) yields an EC50 value for the effect of NADH promoting tetramer formation of about 275 nm for CtBP1(28–353) and 180 nm for CtBP2(33–364) (Table 1). The EC50 value will probably be similar to the dissociation constant for NADH binding; however, the linkage between NADH binding and tetramer assembly suggests that the dimeric and tetrameric forms of CtBP will bind NADH with different affinities, precluding accurate estimates of dissociation constants with the present data.Figure 2Dependence of MALS-determined CtBP molecular masses as a function of NAD(H) concentration (see Table 1, Table 2). The approximate molecular masses expected for a pure dimer (left) and tetramer (right) are indicated. The data were fit with Prism version 7 (see “Experimental procedures”). A, MALS-measured M¯w values for the crystallized constructs of CtBP1 and CtBP2 as a function of NADH concentration. In the absence of NADH, the M¯w of CtBP1(28–353) of 62 kDa indicates a mixture of monomer and dimer, and this value rises to 128 kDa, consistent with about 46% tetramer, in the presence of 10 μm NADH. For CtBP2(31–364), the M¯w of 106 kDa is consistent with a mixture of mostly dimer and about 18% tetramer, which rises to about 50% tetramer in the presence of 10 μm NADH. B, MALS-determined M¯w values for the constructs CtBP1(28–440) and CtBP2(31–445) with the full C terminus as a function of NADH and NAD+. (These experiments were carried out in triplicate; error bars are shown but are often smaller than the data point shown.) In the absence of coenzyme, CtBP1 has an M¯w, consistent with about 15% tetramer, whereas CtBP2 has an M¯w, consistent with about 30% tetramer. These values rise to 61 and 66% tetramer in the presence of 10 μm NAD+ for CtBP1 and CtBP2, respectively, and to 79 and 75% tetramer in the presence of 10 μm NADH for CtBP1 and CtBP2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 1Molecular mass values as a function of NAD(H) concentration for crystallized constructsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The MALS molecular mass estimates indicate heterogeneous mixtures, corresponding primarily to dimers and tetramers of CtBP, but also monomers in some cases. Given that light scattering provides weight average molecular mass estimates ( M¯w) (39Van Holde, K. E., (1971) Physical Biochemistry, pp. 43 and 191, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJGoogle Scholar), one can calculate approximate fractions of dimers and tetramers, assuming those are the only species contributing to the light scattering (see “Experimental procedures”). Based on these assumptions, CtBP2(31–364) is ∼18% tetramer in the absence of NADH and rises to about 47% tetramer in the presence of 10 μm NADH. In contrast, CtBP1(28–353) appears to be a mixture of monomer and dimer in the absence of NADH but is about 46% tetramer in the presence of 10 μm NADH. Our findings of significant tetramer formation in the absence the full C terminus contrast with an earlier report (30Madison D.L. Wirz J.A. Siess D. Lundblad J.R.

Our results show that both assemble with masses indicative of predominantly tetramers in the presence of micromolar levels of NADH (Fig. 2B and Table 2). Assuming a simple mixture of dimers and tetramers, CtBP2(31–445) in the absence of added NADH is about 29% tetramer and plateaus to 75% tetramer at micromolar levels of NADH. CtBP1(28–440) shows only 15% tetramer in the absence of added NADH, but this plateaus to 79% tetramer with sufficient NADH. Thus, in agreement with Madison et al. (30Madison D.L. Wirz J.A. Siess D.

Our results also suggest that the affinity of CtBP1 for NADH is slightly higher in constructs with the C terminus (EC50 ∼50 nm) compared with those lacking the final ∼85 residues (EC50 ∼275 nm); however, for CtBP2, the differences are smaller (EC50 ∼180 nm versus ∼110 nm).Table 2Molecular mass values as a function of NAD(H) concentration for full C-terminal constructs (experiments carried out in triplicate) Open table in a new tab We also investigated the effect of NAD+ on CtBP tetramer formation (Fig. 2B). For CtBP1(28–440), we observed an EC50 for NAD+ of 140 nm compared with NADH of 50 nm. For CtBP2(31–445), the EC50 values are almost identical for NAD+ (98 nm) and NADH (107 nm). Notable from the curves in Fig. 2B are steeper slopes for NADH-dependent tetramer assembly compared with the slopes for NAD+ assembly, which is reflected in the fitted Hill coefficients (Table 2). This suggests potentially greater cooperativity in NADH-linked assembly of CtBP, which could be relevant for the response of CtBP to coenzyme binding.

https://openalex.org/W2802285815,"Protein kinase A (PKA) is a broad-spectrum Ser/Thr kinase involved in the regulation of several cellular activities. Thus, its precise activation relies on being localized at specific subcellular places known as discrete PKA signalosomes. A-Kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) form scaffolding assemblies that play a pivotal role in PKA regulation by restricting its activity to specific microdomains. Because one of the first signaling events observed during mammalian sperm capacitation is PKA activation, understanding how PKA activity is restricted in space and time is crucial to decipher the critical steps of sperm capacitation. Here, we demonstrate that the anchoring of PKA to AKAP is not only necessary but also actively regulated during sperm capacitation. However, we find that once capacitated, the release of PKA from AKAP promotes a sudden Ca2+ influx through the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper, starting a tail-to-head Ca2+ propagation that triggers the acrosome reaction. Three-dimensional super-resolution imaging confirmed a redistribution of PKA within the flagellar structure throughout the capacitation process, which depends on anchoring to AKAP. These results represent a new signaling event that involves CatSper Ca2+ channels in the acrosome reaction, sensitive to PKA stimulation upon release from AKAP."
https://openalex.org/W2802472403,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumours that lack expression of oestrogen, and progesterone receptors, and do not overexpress the HER2 receptor represent the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, which is characterised by the resistance to therapy in frequently relapsing tumours and a high rate of patient mortality. This is likely due to the resistance of slowly proliferating tumour-initiating cells (TICs), and understanding molecular mechanisms that control TICs behaviour is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we present our novel findings, indicating that an intrinsically catalytically inactive member of the Eph group of receptor tyrosine kinases, EPHB6, partially suppresses the epithelial–mesenchymal transition in TNBC cells, while also promoting expansion of TICs. Our work reveals that EPHB6 interacts with the GRB2 adapter protein and that its effect on enhancing cell proliferation is mediated by the activation of the RAS-ERK pathway, which allows it to elevate the expression of the TIC-related transcription factor, OCT4. Consistent with this, suppression of either ERK or OCT4 activities blocks EPHB6-induced pro-proliferative responses. In line with its ability to trigger propagation of TICs, EPHB6 accelerates tumour growth, potentiates tumour initiation and increases TIC populations in xenograft models of TNBC. Remarkably, EPHB6 also suppresses tumour drug resistance to DNA-damaging therapy, probably by forcing TICs into a more proliferative, drug-sensitive state. In agreement, patients with higher EPHB6 expression in their tumours have a better chance for recurrence-free survival. These observations describe an entirely new mechanism that governs TNBC and suggest that it may be beneficial to enhance EPHB6 action concurrent with applying a conventional DNA-damaging treatment, as it would decrease drug resistance and improve tumour elimination."

In the liver, fibrosis caused by viral hepatitis, alcohol, or obesity can lead to liver failure and increase the likelihood for liver cancer (3Tsochatzis E.A. Crossan C. Longworth L. Gurusamy K.

However, fibrosis occurs also in many other tissues such as kidney, heart, and lungs and leads to organ failure due to functional impairment. The major cell type responsible for pathological ECM production is the myofibroblast, which can be described as a contractile, collagen I-producing, fibroblastoid cell, characterized mostly by high expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA; gene name, ACTA2) (4Hinz B. Myofibroblasts.Exp. Eye Res. 2016; 142 (26192991): 56-7010.1016/j.exer.2015.07.009Google Scholar). The biology of myofibroblasts is complex, because apparently many different precursor populations are able to differentiate into myofibroblasts, including tissue-resident fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which may result in different subtypes of myofibroblasts with different biological properties. The extent to which each progenitor population contributes to myofibroblasts in disease is debated and might be dependent on the tissue as well as on the stimulus. Recently, vascular mesenchymal stem cell-like cells (MSC) were described as critically important myofibroblast precursors in different murine fibrosis models (5Kramann R. Schneider R.K. DiRocco D.P. Machado F. Fleig S. Bondzie P.A. Henderson J.M. Ebert B.L. Humphreys B.D. Perivascular Gli1+ progenitors are key contributors to injury-induced organ fibrosis.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16 (25465115): 51-6610.1016/j.stem.2014.11.004Google Scholar). This originally small population, present in all vascularized tissues, expands strongly during disease and gives rise to a large share of the differentiated myofibroblasts. Moreover, the elimination of this population strongly reduces the development of kidney and heart fibrosis. It is important therefore to understand the mechanisms that trigger the differentiation of MSC into myofibroblasts. In vitro, TGFβ can induce myofibroblast differentiation of MSC derived from adipose or prostate tissue, as characterized by αSMA and collagen I expression (6Desai V.D. Hsia H.C. Schwarzbauer J.E.

TGFβ signaling is complex and can be divided into a canonical part that is dependent on the Smad2/3/4 transcription factors and a less characterized noncanonical part, which includes activation of the small Rho GTPase RhoA (8Massagué J.

How TGFβ signaling activates RhoA, how ROCK is controlling F-actin formation, and how SRF-MRTF synergizes with Smad2/3/4 canonical signaling is not well-understood.

To increase the understanding of the molecular pathways underlying fibrotic disease, we set out to investigate how TGFβ-induced myofibroblast differentiation is regulated in the pathophysiologically relevant precursor population of MSC. Importantly, we tested how the Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 affect MSC differentiation into the myofibroblast and which signal transduction pathways are involved downstream of Rho GTPases. Our results indicate important roles for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in controlling TGFβ-induced expression of the myofibroblast differentiation marker αSMA in MSC but showed surprisingly little effect on the regulation of col1a1 mRNA. TGFβ-induced regulation of αSMA expression depended on contraction, but independently of cofilin, in contrast to previous suggestions. These data give important insights into myofibroblast differentiation of a disease-relevant progenitor population, which may help to find novel treatments preventing fibrosis in different tissues. Standard preparations of primary mouse MSC are contaminated with other cell types at low passage numbers and prone to senescence upon longer passaging, leaving only a small window for experimentation. We therefore established a spontaneously immortalized murine MSC line from bone-derived MSC. After 58 passages, the MSC line showed high expression of the murine MSC surface markers CD105, CD44, and Sca1, whereas no contaminating hematopoietic cells expressing CD45 or macrophages expressing CD11b could be detected by FACS (Fig. 1A). Light microscopy revealed a fibroblast-like triangular cell morphology similar to primary MSC (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the MSC showed efficient differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts in the respective differentiation media (Fig. 1C). Moreover, no differentiation into these cell types was detectable under normal growth conditions. These data indicate that the established MSC line displays major hallmarks of primary MSC at least up to passage 58. Further experiments were carried out with cells from passage 42 to 47. TGFβ promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, characterized by expression of αSMA and collagen I. MSC are assumed to behave similarly but have to date been tested only for αSMA expression in response to TGFβ1. Treatment of our MSC line with TGFβ1 indeed resulted in effective up-regulation of both αSMA and col1a1 mRNA after 24 h (Fig. 2, A and B). To investigate the dependence of this differentiation on canonical Smad-related TGFβ signaling, we established MSC lines lacking Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 using lentiviral CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing and confirmed the absence of respective proteins by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). Deletion of Smad2 or Smad3 alone showed little effect, but ablation of the Smad4 gene effectively abrogated TGFβ-induced expression of αSMA or col1a1 (Fig. 2, D–F). Basal expression of αSMA and col1a1 was not significantly altered by the loss of Smad4. These results demonstrate an essential role for canonical Smad4-dependent TGFβ signaling for myofibroblast differentiation of MSC, whereas Smad2 or Smad3 are not required and probably have redundant functions, in line with earlier observations in other cell types. Treatment of MSC with TGFβ resulted in increased phosphorylation of Smad2 and the Rho GTPase downstream effectors MLC2 (in particular RhoA but also Rac1 and Cdc42), Pak1 (Rac1 and Cdc42), and Pak4 (Cdc42), suggesting that TGFβ induces Rho GTPase activation in parallel with canonical TGFβ signaling (Fig. S7). Kinetic analysis indicated a high and significant activation of Smad2, PAK1, and Pak4 after 24 h and of MLC2 after 2 h. To analyze the functional role of basal and TGFβ-induced Rho GTPase signaling in the TGFβ-induced myofibroblast differentiation of MSC, we established MSC lines lacking RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Although RhoA and Cdc42 were efficiently deleted, the loss of Rac1 protein was not complete, indicating the presence of a minor amount of nonrecombined cells (Fig. 3A). This was most likely because of the severely reduced growth of Rac1-null MSC, giving nonrecombined cells a competitive advantage in the polyclonal cell mixture (data not shown). MSC suppressed for RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 expression showed morphologies similar to fibroblastoid cells lacking these Rho GTPase genes (Fig. 3B). Time-lapse migration assays revealed that Rac1-null MSC are hardly motile, whereas the long, thin extensions of Cdc42-null cells seen in still images (Fig. 3B) were observed to rupture during migration, leaving behind small patches of cytoplasm on cell tracks (Movies 1–4). RhoA-null MSC were also more elongated than WT cells, and at least a subpopulation of cells displayed extended rear edges. With respect to their differentiation potential, we found that the loss of Rho GTPases did not prevent or induce the differentiation of MSC to adipocytes or osteoblasts (Fig. S6). Furthermore, none of the Rho GTPase KO MSC lines showed altered phosphorylation of Smad2 after 24-h treatment with TGFβ (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting normal activation of TGFβR kinase activity, crucial for both canonical and noncanonical signaling. TGFβ-induced expression of αSMA was significantly decreased in RhoA KO and Cdc42 KO MSC after 24-h stimulation, whereas the loss of Rac1 increased basal αSMA expression strongly (Fig. 4A). With respect to -fold change, only Cdc42 KO resulted in a significantly reduced induction (Table S1). After 3-day TGFβ treatment, the protein levels of αSMA were significantly lower in RhoA KO and Cdc42 KO cells compared with WT MSC, whereas no clear difference was detectable in Rac1 KO MSC (Fig. 4, B and C). To check whether constitutively active Rho GTPase mutants show effects opposite to the KO, we overexpressed fast-cycling mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (35Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Specific contributions of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 to Dbl transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (10438546): 23633-2364110.1074/jbc.274.33.23633Google Scholar) in MSC and tested the effect on TGFβ-induced αSMA expression. Fast-cycling mutants (fcRho GTPases) are able to cycle between a GDP-bound and a GTP-bound form but are mostly in the GTP-bound form. Lentiviral transduction of MSC resulted in a high percentage of fast-cycling mutant expressing cells, as determined by co-expressed EGFP (Fig. S9, A and B). fcRhoA increased TGFβ-induced αSMA (Fig. S9, E and F), thus showing opposite effects than KO of RhoA, while fcRac1 prevented TGFβ-induced αSMA expression. fcCdc42 MSC behaved similar to control cells, suggesting that although a basal Cdc42 activity is required for myofibroblast activation, superactivation of Cdc42 is not having an extra effect. Surprisingly, the deletion of RhoA in MSC showed no influence on TGFβ-induced col1a1 mRNA expression (Fig. 4D), although RhoA is reportedly required for collagen 1 expression in fibroblasts (12Ni J. Dong Z. Han W. Kondrikov D. Su Y. The role of RhoA and cytoskeleton in myofibroblast transformation in hyperoxic lung fibrosis.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2013; 61 (23517783): 26-3910.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.03.012Google Scholar). The loss of Rac1 or Cdc42 resulted in slightly reduced col1a1 levels after 1-day stimulation (Fig. 4D). However, after 3-day stimulation, the deletion of Cdc42 did not cause any change in col1a1 mRNA expression (Fig. 4E). Following analysis of the cellular and secreted collagen 1 protein, both RhoA KO and Cdc42 KO MSC displayed an intracellular accumulation of cellular collagen 1 (Fig. 4, F and G). Moreover, secreted collagen 1 was significantly reduced in the supernatant of Cdc42-null MSC (Fig. 4, F and H). These data indicate that both RhoA and Cdc42 are required for TGFβ-induced αSMA expression, whereas Rac1 plays an inhibitory role. They furthermore suggest a role for RhoA and Cdc42 in collagen I secretion but no or only a minor role in the regulation of col1a1 mRNA. To identify changes in downstream components of Rho GTPase signaling that might correlate with the defective induction of αSMA, we first analyzed F-actin levels by quantifying cell staining with fluorescently labeled phalloidin. TGFβ treatment of control MSC induced a clear increase in F-actin in control but not in in RhoA KO and Cdc42 KO MSC (Fig. 5A and Fig. S1). Rac1 KO MSC, on the other hand, showed increased levels of F-actin in both the presence and absence of TGFβ (Fig. S1). These changes in F-actin correlated with changes in pMLC2, which is a marker for cell contraction (Fig. 5B). MSC expressing fcRhoA showed increased TGFβ-induced pMLC2, while fcRac1 and fcCdc42 MSC showed no significant changes (Fig. S9, C and D). ADF/cofilin family members are important regulators of F-actin by severing it and promoting depolymerization with cofilin-1 (cofilin) as the major form in nonmuscle tissues. Cofilin is known to be inactivated by phosphorylation downstream of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. However, we could not detect any significant changes in cofilin phosphorylation in MSC lacking these Rho GTPases after 24 h of treatment with TGFβ (Fig. 5C and Fig. S2). p38, ERK, and JNK are described as phosphorylated and activated by noncanonical TGFβ signaling (36Zhang Y.E. Non-Smad signaling pathways of the TGF-β family.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 (27864313): a02212910.1101/cshperspect.a022129Google Scholar). Testing pERK and pp38 after 24 h of TGFβ treatment, no significant TGFβ-dependent stimulation and no Rho GTPase-dependent alteration were detectable (Fig. 5, D and E, and Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, the p54 isoform of pJNK was increased in untreated and TGFβ-treated Cdc42 KO MSC, whereas RhoA KO cells showed no change (Fig. 5, F and G, and Fig. S2). In fibroblasts, actin polymerization promotes nuclear translocation of the transcription factor MRTFa, which induces expression of both αSMA and collagen 1 (10Luchsinger L.L. Patenaude C.A.

In MSC, TGFβ treatment increased the formation of F-actin stress fibers over 24 h, visualized by fluorescent LifeAct (Fig. S8). We therefore investigated whether this pathway plays a related role in MSC. Inhibition of actin polymerization in MSC by latrunculin abrogated basal αSMA as well as induced αSMA expression and caused a partial reduction of TGFβ-induced col1a1 expression (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, jasplakinolide, which stabilizes F-actin, dramatically increased basal αSMA levels (Fig. 6A), but TGFβ treatment did not result in a further increase in αSMA. By contrast, jasplakinolide did not affect basal col1a1 expression and even inhibited the TGFβ1-induced increase of col1a1 (Fig. 6B). Actin polymerization downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 is prominently promoted by the Arp2/3 complex and downstream of RhoA by formins of the mDia family. To probe the role of Arp2/3-mediated F-actin formation during myofibroblast differentiation, we deleted Arpc2, which is an essential component of the Arp2/3 complex (13Gournier H. Goley E.D. Niederstrasser H. Trinh T. Welch M.D. Reconstitution of human Arp2/3 complex reveals critical roles of individual subunits in complex structure and activity.Mol.

Although Arpc2 was efficiently deleted (Fig. 6C), we did not observe an alteration in TGFβ-induced expression of αSMA or col1a1 (Fig. 6, D and E). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cofilin targeting strongly increased stress fiber formation and αSMA levels but did not affect inducibility of αSMA by TGFβ1 (Fig. 6, F and G), confirming the notion that cofilin is not required for the TGFβ-induced increase of αSMA (Figs. 5C and 6G). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the cofilin gene however did not affect col1a1 expression (Fig. 6H). Downstream of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, LIMK inhibits cofilin by phosphorylation. Loss of LIMK should therefore decrease cofilin phosphorylation, increase cofilin activity, decrease F-actin, and decrease αSMA, at least if one assumes that cofilin expression is unaltered. LIMK KO were made, and frameshifts in the coding region of the respective genes (LIMK1 and LIMK2) were confirmed by sequencing of the genomic PCR fragments (Fig. S3A). Paradoxically, loss of LIMK1 increased basal and TGFβ-induced expression of αSMA, whereas LIMK2 KO had no influence (Fig. 6, I and J). Interestingly, only LIMK2 KO reduced pCofilin levels, indicating that LIMK2, but not LIMK1, is crucial for cofilin phosphorylation in MSC (Fig. 6L). LIMK1 KO, on the other hand, resulted in an increase of pCofilin, implying increased activation of LIMK2. Indeed, double knockout of LIMK1 and LIMK2 restored αSMA levels to that of WT cells (Fig. 6K). Conceivably, the deletion of LIMK1 was overcompensated by LIMK2, which was rescued by the additional deletion of LIMK2. Correspondingly, LIMK1 KO increased and LIMK2 or LIMK1/2 KO decreased F-actin in MSC (Fig. S3, B and C). LIMK deletion did not influence TGFβ-induced col1a1 expression (Fig. 6M). Finally, deletion of the MRTFa gene, confirmed by genomic sequencing of the targeted genomic region (Fig. S3), blocked TGFβ induction of αSMA but had no influence on col1a1 mRNA (Fig. 6, N and O). Deletion of MRTFa did not interfere with the differentiation of MSC to adipocytes or osteoblasts (Fig. S6). These data demonstrate that Arp2/3 complex-independent but F-actin/MRTFa-dependent signaling is crucial for TGFβ-induced αSMA expression in MSC. However, F-actin/MRTFa signaling is again dispensable for the stimulation of col1a1 expression by TGFβ. Moreover, Rho-GTPase–dependent regulation of ADF/cofilin activity is not essential for the TGFβ-induced expression of αSMA. To understand the relationship between TGFβ-induced cell contraction, F-actin distribution, and αSMA expression, we inhibited cell contraction directly by blebbistatin and indirectly by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or KO of contraction-promoting Rho GTPase effectors. Blebbistatin strongly reduced F-actin levels and prevented TGFβ-induced αSMA expression but did not affect col1a1 expression (Fig. 7, A, B, and E). Similarly, inhibition of the RhoA effectors ROCK1 and ROCK2 by Y27632 inhibited stress fiber formation and effectively reduced TGFβ-induced αSMA expression but not col1a1 expression (Fig. 7, C, D, and E). Individual knockout of ROCK1 and ROCK2 showed a partial reduction of pMLC2, F-actin, and αSMA, whereas the combined deletion of ROCK1 and ROCK2 had a stronger effect, indicating redundancy between ROCK1 and ROCK2 (Fig. 7, F, G, and I–K, and Fig. S4A). The combined deletion of ROCK1 and ROCK2 did not interfere with the differentiation of MSC to adipocytes or osteoblasts (Fig. S6). Aside from ROCK, the Cdc42 effectors MRCKα and MRCKβ are also reported to regulate cell contraction in a fashion similar to ROCK. However, deletion of these genes showed little influence on pMLC2, F-actin, or αSMA (Fig. 7, F, H, and L–N, and Fig. S5A), indicating that Cdc42 affects cell contraction in MSC in a nonclassical manner. Importantly, none of the manipulations described above led to a significant change in basal or TGFβ-induced col1a1 mRNA, corroborating that the regulation of αSMA and col1a1 expression in MSC is distinct (Figs. S4B and S5B). This study on the TGFβ-induced differentiation of MSC to myofibroblasts revealed several surprising findings (Fig. S10). First, it shows that TGFβ-induced expression of αSMA and collagen 1 are differentially regulated in MSC, in contrast to fibroblasts. Secondly, it indicates that Rac1 and Cdc42 control TGFβ-induced αSMA expression in an opposite manner and independent of Arp2/3 complex–mediated actin polymerization. Thirdly, it demonstrates that the regulation of cofilin activity is not important for TGFβ-induced αSMA expression, contrary to earlier expectations. Fourthly, the data suggest that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 control αSMA expression by a contraction-dependent pathway. Finally, this study reveals that Cdc42 and RhoA affect cytoplasmic retention and secretion of collagen I in MSC. Although MRTFa is required for collagen I expression in lung fibroblasts and in myofibroblasts derived from scleroderma (10Luchsinger L.L. Patenaude C.A. Smith B.D.

On the other hand, canonical Smad4-dependent TGFβ signaling was essential for both collagen I as well as αSMA expression. This fits with an earlier report on mesangial cells showing that Smad4 is required for TGFβ-induced collagen I expression (15Tsuchida K. Zhu Y. Siva S. Dunn S.R. Sharma K. Role of Smad4 on TGF-β-induced extracellular matrix stimulation in mesangial cells.Kidney Int. 2003; 63 (12753287): 2000-200910.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00009.xGoogle Scholar). It is well-known that the regulation of TGFβ-dependent genes is strongly context-dependent and cell type–specific (8Massagué J. TGFβ signalling in context.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22992590): 616-63010.1038/nrm3434Google Scholar). Synergistic interaction of MRTFa with Smad4 signaling at the collagen I promoter is required in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (10Luchsinger L.L. Patenaude C.A. Smith B.D.

WT MSC will therefore be resistant to fibrosis-inhibiting drugs targeting the RhoA/ROCK/MRTFa pathway. It will be interesting to investigate why MSC do not require MRTFa activation for col1a1 expression. It is possible that MRTFa removes an inhibitory transcription factor or epigenetic mark from the col1a1 gene locus in fibroblasts but not in MSC. Such a mechanism was found in genes for master regulators of embryonic stem cell differentiation, where the Smad3-binding factor TRIM33 disables repressive histone marks (16Xi Q. Wang Z.

Introduction of this col1a1 gene inhibitory signal to MSC will make their collagen I expression dependent on the activation of RhoA/ROCK/MRTFa. This could increase the efficiency of ROCK inhibitors as antifibrotic drugs. ROCK inhibitors such as fasudil show some efficacy in mouse and rat models of fibrosis (17Knipe R.S. Tager A.M. Liao J.K. The Rho kinases: critical mediators of multiple profibrotic processes and rational targets for new therapies for pulmonary fibrosis.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67 (25395505): 103-117Google Scholar), but no reports on clinical efficacy in humans have been published up to now. Polymerization and depolymerization of F-actin and thus MRTFa activation is not only regulated by RhoA but also by Rac1 and Cdc42 (18Ridley A.J.

It was therefore expected that deletion of Rac1 or Cdc42 might decrease MRTFa-dependent αSMA expression by reducing Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization or by increasing actin depolymerization via reduced phosphorylation of cofilin.

However, the mechanisms underlying the teratogenic effects of Hg are not well understood. Imprinting genes are emerging regulators for fetal development subjecting to environmental pollutants impacts. In this study, we examined the association between preconceptional Hg exposure and the alteration of DNA methylation of imprinting genes H19, Meg3, and Peg3 in human sperm DNA. Methods A total of 616 men, aged from 22 to 59, were recruited from Reproductive Medicine Clinic of Maternal and Child Care Service Center and the Urologic Surgery Clinic of Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences during April 2015 and March 2016. Demographic information was collected through questionnaires. Urine was collected and urinary Hg concentrations were measured using a fully-automatic double-channel hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer. Methylation of imprinting genes H19, Meg3 and Peg3 of sperm DNA from 242 participants were examined by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Spearman’s rank and multivariate regression analysis were used for correlation analysis between sperm DNA methylation status of imprinting genes and urinary Hg levels. Results The median concentration of Hg for 616 participants was 9.14μg/l (IQR: 5.56–12.52 μg/l; ranging 0.16–71.35μg/l). A total of 42.7% of the participants are beyond normal level for non-occupational exposure according to the criterion of Hg poisoning (≥10 μg/L). Spearman’s rank analysis indicated a negative correlation between urinary Hg concentrations and average DNA methylation levels of imprinted genes H19 (rs = −0.346, p <0.05), but there was no such a correlation for Peg3 and Meg3. Further, we analyzed the correlation between methylation level at individual CpG site of H19 and urinary Hg level. The results showed a negative correlation between urinary Hg concentrations and three out of seven CpG sites on H19 DMR, namely CpG2 (rs = −0.137, p <0.05), CpG4 (rs = −0.380, p <0.05) and CpG6 (rs = −0.228, p <0.05). After adjusting age, smoking, drinking, intake of aquatic products and education by multivariate regression analysis, the results have confirmed the correlation as mentioned above. Conclusions Mercury non-occupational environmental exposure in reproductive-aged men was associated with altered DNA methylation outcomes at imprinting gene H19 in sperm, implicating the susceptibility of the developing sperm for environmental insults."
https://openalex.org/W2799801818,"Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) resistance among arthropod species is a model for understanding the molecular adaptations in response to insecticide exposures. Previous studies reported that DDT resistance may involve one or multiple detoxification genes, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), esterases, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, or changes in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. However, the possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes associated with DDT resistance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R remains poorly understood. In this study, the majority of the resulting miRNAs discovered in small RNA libraries from 91-R and the susceptible control strain, 91-C, ranged from 16–25 nt, and contained 163 precursors and 256 mature forms of previously-known miRNAs along with 17 putative novel miRNAs. Quantitative analyses predicted the differential expression of ten miRNAs between 91-R and 91-C, and, based on Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, these ten miRNAs putatively target transcripts encoding proteins involved in detoxification mechanisms. RT-qPCR validated an inverse correlation between levels of differentially-expressed miRNAs and their putatively targeted transcripts, which implies a role of these miRNAs in the differential regulation of detoxification pathways in 91-R compared to 91-C. This study provides evidence associating the differential expression of miRNAs in response to multigenerational DDT selection in Drosophila melanogaster and provides important clues for understanding the possible roles of miRNAs in mediating insecticide resistance traits."

To investigate the differences of organic acid metabolism in fruits of these two species, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed. Our results showed that temporal changes of two main organic acids exhibited different trends in these two species. Transcriptome sequencing of developing C. humilis and C. glandulosa fruits systematically revealed 6,594 differentially expressed genes. Compared with C. humilis, the expression levels of 3,469 and 3,125 genes were up- and down-regulated in C. glandulosa, respectively, including one PEPC gene, 12 malic acid metabolism genes, 25 citric acid cycle genes, and 194 NAD/NADP metabolism genes. The correlation analysis and principal component analysis of gene expression, enzymatic activity and organic acid content showed that differences in the expression of genes encoding the NAD-malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH) and NADP-malate enzyme (NADP-ME) contributed substantially to the observed differences in organic acid accumulation of two species.

In hepatocytes, for example, delivery of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–associated cholesterol for bile acid synthesis or secretion into bile facilitates cholesterol elimination from the body (anti-atherogenic effect), whereas delivery for esterification and subsequent incorporation into apolipoprotein B–containing atherogenic lipoproteins (e.g. very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)) enhances cholesterol secretion into the systemic circulation (pro-atherogenic effect).

Relative contributions of L-FABP, SCP-2/SCP-x, or both to hepatic biliary phenotype of female mice.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 588 (26541319): 25-32Google Scholar). Given the inability of mammalian systems to metabolize the steroid nucleus, conversion of hydrophobic cholesterol to more water-soluble bile acids and solubilization of cholesterol by these detergents, followed by excretion into bile, represents a major mechanism for cholesterol elimination from the body. A homeostatic balance between cholesterol intake/de novo synthesis and cholesterol elimination is central to the development of atherosclerosis. Despite the significant role of intracellular cholesterol transfer proteins such as SCP-2 in regulating the expression of genes involved in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis (17Martin G.G. Atshaves B.P. Landrock K.K. Landrock D. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. Loss of L-FABP, SCP-2/SCP-x, or both induces hepatic lipid accumulation in female mice.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 580 (26541319): 41-4910.1016/j.abb.2015.10.018Google Scholar), the direct role of these proteins in modulating atherogenesis has not been examined to date. Based on our earlier studies, where transient overexpression of SCP2 led to increased flux of cholesterol from HDL to bile, we speculated an anti-atherogenic role for SCP2 (14Wang J. Bie J. Ghosh S. Intracellular cholesterol transport proteins enhance hydrolysis of HDL-CEs and facilitate elimination of cholesterol into bile.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57 (27381048): 1712-171910.1194/jlr.M069682Google Scholar). To directly address this hypothesis, in this study we examined the effects of SCP2/SCPx deficiency on the development of Western diet–induced atherosclerosis in the LDLR−/− background. Contrary to the expected increase in diet-induced atherosclerosis, a dramatic attenuation of lesion development was noted in mice lacking SCP2/SCPx. Data are presented to indicate that a significant decrease in dietary cholesterol absorption in the intestine as well as in hepatic VLDL secretion by SCP2/SCPx deficiency collectively represent the mechanism underlying the observed attenuation of plasma lipid levels and, consequently, the reduction in Western diet–induced atherosclerosis in LDLR−/− mice. Intracellular cholesterol-binding proteins facilitate delivery of cholesterol to appropriate organelles for subsequent metabolism, and we have demonstrated earlier that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SCP2 increases the flux of cholesterol from HDL to bile and feces, indicative of a potential anti-atherogenic role of this protein (14Wang J. Bie J. Ghosh S. Intracellular cholesterol transport proteins enhance hydrolysis of HDL-CEs and facilitate elimination of cholesterol into bile.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57 (27381048): 1712-171910.1194/jlr.M069682Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 1A, deficiency of SCP2/SCPx (LS) dramatically reduced diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions in LDLR−/− mice. Compared with LDLR−/− mice, the lesion area in the aortic arch in LS mice was significantly reduced in both males (37.31 ± 7.79 versus 6.85 ± 5.47, p < 0.0001) and females (29.77 ± 4.43 versus 14.09 ± 6.62, p < 0.011). Similar trends were seen when total aortic lesion areas in LS mice were compared (Fig. 1C) (males 19.15 ± 2.87 versus 3.31 ± 2.16, p < 0.0001; females 13.35 ± 2.68 versus 6.41 ± 2.36, p < 0.0001). The aortic root represents another anatomical site of plaque development, and changes in plaque area at this site were also examined using H&E-stained aortic root sections. Consistent with the en face analyses shown in Fig. 1, a significant reduction in the area occupied by the plaque in the aortic root was noted in LS mice (Fig. 2, A and B). To evaluate changes in plaque characteristics, if any, Masson’s trichrome–stained aortic root sections were analyzed to determine the percentage of necrotic area. A significant reduction in plaque necrosis was seen in LS mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are considered a reliable marker of whole-body lipid homeostasis, and elevated levels associated with development of atherosclerosis are either the result of increased uptake of dietary lipids or enhanced hepatic secretion of pro-atherogenic ApoB–containing VLDL. SCP2 deficiency significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels in LS mice (1747.38 ± 670.62 versus 543.00 ± 144.57, p < 0.0001 in males and 1424.33 ± 205.1 versus 966.83 ± 214.97, p = 0.0118 in females; Fig. 3A). Furthermore, comparison of changes in percent total cholesterol associated with non-HDL or HDL fractions showed that the observed reduction in plasma cholesterol was primarily determined by reduction in non-HDL cholesterol or cholesterol associated with LDL and VLDL fractions (86.15 ± 11.93 versus 71.55 ± 5.85, p = 0.0077 in males and 91.42 ± 1.44 versus 85.95 ± 2.04, p = 0.0003 in females, Fig. 3B). In contrast, there was a small but statistically significant increase in the percentage of cholesterol associated with the HDL fraction (13.85 ± 11.93 versus 28.45 ± 5.85, p = 0.0077 in males and 8.58 ± 1.44 versus 14.05 ± 2.04, p = 0.0003 in females; Fig. 3B). To facilitate a direct demonstration of the effects of SCP2 deficiency on cholesterol distribution between plasma lipoprotein fractions, the data are also represented after normalization to total cholesterol levels observed in LDLR−/− mice of the same sex. Significant reduction in non-HDL cholesterol is apparent in LS mice of both sexes (87.31 ± 32.41 versus 39.27 ± 11.04, p = 0.0014 in males and 91.39 ± 11.45 versus 60.78 ± 6.31, p = 0.0002 in females; Fig. 3C). It is noteworthy that, in WD-fed LDLR−/− mice, >90% plasma cholesterol is associated with the non-HDL fraction (18Huszar D. Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Feeley R. Arai T. Fairchild-Huntress V. Donovan M.J. Tall A.R. Increased LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice with attenuated expression of scavenger receptor B1.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20 (10764675): 1068-107310.1161/01.ATV.20.4.1068Google Scholar). A strong positive correlation was obtained between the total lesion area and plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. 3D). Plasma triglyceride levels were also significantly reduced in male LS mice (471.88 ± 292.22 versus 121.75 ± 48.20, p = 0.0016; Fig. 3E), but this decrease did not reach statistical significance in female mice (411.33 ± 268.1 versus 225.67 ± 139.25, p = 0.1631). Although total lesions increased with increasing plasma triglyceride levels, this correlation did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that global SCP2 deficiency–mediated attenuation of plasma lipids likely underlies the observed decrease in atherosclerotic lesions in LS mice. Diet-induced hypercholesterolemia underlies the development of atherosclerosis in this model of Western diet–induced atherosclerosis in LDLR−/− mice. Therefore, any reduction in absorption of dietary cholesterol is likely to affect the development of atherosclerosis. To examine whether SCP2 deficiency–mediated changes in intestinal cholesterol absorption represent the mechanism underlying the observed reduction in plasma lipids as well as atherosclerosis, the appearance of orally administered [3H]cholesterol in plasma was monitored under conditions where tissue uptake of absorbed cholesterol is prevented by tyloxapol-mediated inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. A significant reduction in plasma DPM was seen in SCP2−/− mice (286.23 ± 60.58 versus 180.81 ± 11.43, p = 0.007 in males and 236.11 ± 71.06 versus 169.68 ± 35.09, p = 0.036 in females; Fig. 4A). These data suggest that SCP2/SCPx deficiency leads to reduced intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol, resulting in attenuation of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Although absorption of cholesterol occurs via NPC1L1, intestinal cells secrete cholesterol along with phytosterols back into the lumen via ABCG5/G8. Furthermore, cholesterol absorption is not uniform along the length of the intestine. Expression of NPC1L1 or ABCG5 and ABCG8 along the intestine was evaluated in WT and SCP2−/− mice to determine the effects SCP2 deficiency. Although no significant difference was noted in the expression of NPC1L1, there was a significant reduction in the expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the distal P4 segment of the intestine of SCP2−/− mice (Fig. 4B). Consistent with global deficiency of SCP2 in these mice, no expression of SCP2 protein was noted along the length of the intestine, i.e. segments P1 through P4 (Fig. 4C). Because the mice used in this study have a global deficiency of SCP2/SCPx, to directly assess the effects of SCP2 deficiency in intestinal cells on cholesterol absorption/uptake, SCP2 was knocked down in the human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 using SCP2-specific siRNA. A concentration-dependent decrease in SCP2 mRNA was noted, along with maximum reduction in SCP2 protein seen at the highest siRNA concentration tested (Fig. 4D). Cholesterol uptake was monitored in HT-29 cells transfected with either scrambled or SCP2 siRNA. A time-dependent increase in cholesterol uptake was seen, and this increase was significantly attenuated when SCP2 was knocked down with siRNA (Fig. 4E). These data indicate that deficiency of SCP2 in intestinal epithelial cells limits cholesterol absorption and likely represents the mechanism underlying the observed reduction in plasma lipids and attenuated atherosclerosis in LS mice. Upon WD feeding, increased absorbed lipids are repackaged in the liver and secreted as pro-atherogenic lipoprotein VLDL. Therefore, in addition to the effects of altered lipid absorption, changes in secretion of pro-atherogenic lipoproteins from the liver are also likely to modify plasma lipids and the downstream development of atherosclerosis. Time-dependent accumulation of VLDL-associated triglycerides in the plasma compartment following inhibition of lipoprotein lipase is routinely used to evaluate hepatic VLDL secretion. To examine whether SCP2 deficiency affects hepatic VLDL secretion, we monitored plasma triglyceride levels in WT and SCP2−/− mice following tyloxapol-mediated inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. As shown in Fig. 5A, triglyceride secretion rates calculated from the plasma triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in SCP2−/− mice (12.05 ± 0.73 versus 7.46 ± 1.03, p = 0.0021). These data suggest that SCP2 deficiency attenuates pro-atherogenic VLDL secretion from the liver. Because the mice used in these studies lack SCP2 in all tissues, to confirm the effects of SCP2 deficiency on VLDL/triglyceride secretion from hepatocytes, direct secretion of triglycerides as well as cholesteryl ester into the incubation medium from primary hepatocytes isolated from WT or SCP2−/− mice was assessed. Secretion of [3H]oleic acid–labeled triglycerides (Fig. 5B) as well as cholesteryl esters (Fig. 5C) by SCP2/SCPx-deficient hepatocytes was significantly reduced, confirming the reduction in hepatic secretion rates observed in vivo. Reduced secretion of VLDL could potentially lead to hepatic accumulation of lipids, and therefore morphological changes in the livers of WD-fed LDLR−/− and LS mice were compared. Significant lipid accumulation was noted in livers from WD-fed LDLR−/− mice compared with LS mice, indicating that SCP2 deficiency does not lead to increased accumulation of lipids in the liver (Fig. 6A). Lack of SCP2 expression in livers form LS mice was confirmed by almost undetectable levels of Scp2 mRNA in LS mice (Fig. 6B). Consistent with lack of lipid accumulation in the liver, no significant difference in the expression of lipogenic genes (namely, ApoB, Fas, Srebp-1c, and Srebp-2) was noted between livers from WT and SCP2−/− mice (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that SCP2/SCPx deficiency leads to reduced VLDL secretion from liver/hepatocytes and that SCP2 deficiency likely leads to reduced plasma lipids by not only limiting intestinal absorption but also by decreasing hepatic VLDL secretion. Furthermore, SCP2 deficiency also reduces WD-induced lipid accumulation in the liver without any significant change in expression of genes involved in lipogenesis. An imbalance between forward transport of cholesterol to peripheral tissues and its return to the liver for final elimination underlies accumulation of lipid-laden macrophage foam cells within the artery wall. Although the data presented above provide strong evidence for SCP2 deficiency–mediated reduction in plasma lipids because of intestinal lipid absorption as well as hepatic lipid secretion, the effects of SCP2 deficiency on reverse flux of cholesterol from macrophages to the liver and final elimination in bile were also monitored to examine any direct effects of SCP2 deficiency on these processes. Changes, if any, in the uptake of modified LDL by macrophages from WT or SCP2−/− were examined, and, as shown in Fig. 7A, no apparent difference in Oil Red O–stained neutral lipid was seen in WT control and SCP2−/− macrophages before or after incubation with acetylated LDL (AcLDL). Consistently, although there was an increase in total cellular cholesterol upon loading with AcLDL in both genotypes, there was no significant difference in total cellular cholesterol mass between WT and SCP2−/− macrophages before or after loading (Fig. 7B). The observed lack of difference in the expression of SR-A (Fig. 7C) further suggests that SCP2 deficiency does not affect the uptake of modified LDL. When efflux of cholesterol from AcLDL-loaded macrophages was measured, a small but significant reduction in cholesterol efflux was observed in LS macrophages. An increase in cholesterol efflux capacity is associated with reduction in the development of atherosclerosis, and this observed reduction in cholesterol efflux from SCP2−/− macrophages suggests that SCP2 deficiency in macrophages may not be the major underlying mechanism for the observed decrease in atherosclerosis in LS mice. Final elimination of cholesterol from the body, required to maintain whole-body cholesterol homeostasis and limit development of atherosclerosis, occurs via biliary or nonbiliary routes. To evaluate the effects of SCP2 deficiency on modulating cholesterol elimination from the body, secreted bile acids and cholesterol were monitored in gall bladder bile and normalized to total biliary phospholipid content. Deficiency of SCP2/SCPx did not affect biliary bile acid (Fig. 8A) or free cholesterol (Fig. 8B) secretion. Although increased biliary elimination of cholesterol from the body as bile acids or free cholesterol is generally viewed as anti-atherogenic, a dramatic reduction in atherosclerosis with no change in biliary bile acids or cholesterol in LS mice points to a possible limited contribution of the cholesterol elimination pathway to the observed attenuation of atherosclerosis by deficiency of SCP2/SCPx in these global knockout mice. While recognizing the role of extracellular trafficking of cholesterol in the progression of atherosclerosis, Billheimer and Reinhart (19Billheimer J.T. Reinhart M.P. Intracellular trafficking of sterols.Subcell. Biochem. 1990; 16 (2238007): 301-33110.1007/978-1-4899-1621-1_10Google Scholar) argued more than 3 decades ago for a major role of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, possibly by regulating transport of cholesterol back to the liver from the peripheral tissues and secretion into the bile. Although ample evidence exists for defining the role of SCP2/SCPx in modulating hepatic cholesterol/bile acid metabolism, the data presented here describe, for the first time, the dramatic anti-atherogenic (>80% decrease) effects of SCP2/SCPx deficiency in athero-susceptible LDLR−/− mice. Furthermore, SCP2/SCPx deficiency led to a significant reduction in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels despite consumption of a high-fat, high-cholesterol–containing Western diet. Consistently, we demonstrate that SCP2/SCPx deficiency reduces absorption of cholesterol in the intestine and attenuates VLDL secretion from the liver, identifying SCP2 as a potential therapeutic target to modulate dyslipidemia and its downstream adverse effects. Dyslipidemia is central to the development of atherosclerotic plaques, and LDLR−/− mice develop atherosclerosis only after a dietary challenge with a high-fat, high-cholesterol–containing Western diet. Therefore, the contribution of dietary lipids to overall dyslipidemia is paramount in this model of atherogenesis. Sterol carrier protein–like activity was described in the rat intestine by Kharroubi et al. (20Kharroubi A. Wadsworth J.A. Chanderbhan R. Wiesenfeld P. Noland B. Scallen T. Vahouny G.V. Gallo L.L. Sterol carrier protein2-like activity in rat intestine.J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29 (3379341): 287-292Google Scholar), and the widespread distribution of SCP2-like protein in the intestine was thought to be related to the potential transfer functions in all phases of cholesterol processing. Wouters et al. (21Wouters F.S. Markman M. de Graaf P. Hauser H. Tabak H.F. Wirtz K.W. Moorman A.F. The immunohistochemical localization of the non-specific lipid transfer protein (sterol carrier protein-2) in rat small intestine enterocytes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259 (7488641): 192-19610.1016/0005-2760(95)00163-7Google Scholar) confirmed the expression of SCP-2 in rat small intestine enterocytes and, based on the intracellular distribution, suggested that this protein may play a role in the intracellular processing of absorbed lipids. The data presented here show that SCP2/SCPx deficiency significantly reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption and that siRNA-dependent knockdown of SCP2 in human intestinal epithelial cells leads to a significant reduction in cholesterol accumulation, indicating that intestinal SCP2 regulates the uptake of dietary cholesterol and is likely responsible for the reduced plasma lipids in LS mice. Future development of an intestine-specific SCP2 knockout will facilitate the direct confirmation of this hypothesis. Reduction in cholesterol absorption is used as a clinical intervention, and supplementation with ezetimibe reduced plasma cholesterol by 32%, leading to a reduction in atherosclerosis by 52–59% in LDLR−/− mice (22Basso F.

Our results further reveal that the α–β interface in the inhibited state is highly sensitive to manipulation, with a single substitution interfering with complex formation. We also discover that residues at the α–β interface whose substitution has previously been shown to cause a mutator phenotype in Escherichia coli (i.e. S39F-α2 or E42K-α2) are impaired only in their activity regulation, thus linking this phenotype with the inability to allosterically down-regulate RNR.

Spectrophotometry was used to measure the color of 40 teeth heated at temperatures of 100, 200, and 400°C for 60 min. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform extraction and quantified by real-time quantitative PCR using the Quantifier human DNA quantification kit. Preliminary results indicated an association of higher temperature with changes in colorimetric variables and a decrease in DNA concentrations. A significant positive correlation was found between luminosity values and DNA concentration (r = 0.4727, p = 0.0128) and between chromaticity a* values and DNA concentration (r = 0.4154, p = 0.0250).

The TruSight One sequencing panel currently covers 12 Mb of genomic content, including 4813 genes associated with a clinical phenotype. When only a limited number of cells are available, whole genome amplification (WGA) is required prior to DNA target capture techniques such as the TruSight One panel. In this study, we compared 4 different WGA methods in combination with the TruSight One sequencing panel to perform single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping starting from 3 micro-manipulated cells. This setting simulates clinical settings such as day-5 blastocyst biopsy for Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT), liquid biopsy of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cancer-cell profiling. Bulk cell samples were processed alongside these WGA samples to serve as a performance reference. Target coverage, coverage uniformity and SNP calling accuracy obtained using any of the WGA, is inferior to the results obtained on bulk cell samples. However, results after REPLI-g come close. Compared to the other WGA methods, the method using REPLI-g WGA results in a better coverage of the targeted genomic regions with a more uniform read depth. Consequently, this method also results in a more accurate SNP calling and could be considered for clinical genotyping of a limited number of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2800925225,"The neurons that form the mammalian neocortex originate from progenitor cells in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ). Newborn neurons are multipolar but become bipolar during their migration from the germinal layers to the cortical plate (CP) by forming a leading process and an axon that extends in the intermediate zone (IZ). Once they settle in the CP, neurons assume a highly polarized morphology with a single axon and multiple dendrites. The AMPK-related kinases SadA and SadB are intrinsic factors that are essential for axon formation during neuronal development downstream of Lkb1. The knockout of both genes encoding Sad kinases (Sada and Sadb) results not only in a loss of axons but also a decrease in the size of the cortical plate. The defect in axon formation has been linked to a function of Sad kinases in the regulation of microtubule binding proteins. However, the causes for the reduced size of the cortical plate in the Sada-/-;Sadb-/- knockout remain to be analyzed in detail. Here we show that neuronal cell death is increased and the number of neural progenitors is decreased in the Sada-/-;Sadb-/- CP. The reduced number of progenitors is a non-cell autonomous defect since they do not express Sad kinases. These defects are restricted to the neocortex while the hippocampus remains unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W2801937645,"Motivated by the capabilities of modern radiotherapy techniques and by the recent developments of functional imaging techniques, dose painting by numbers (DPBN) was proposed to treat tumors with heterogeneous biological characteristics. This work studies different DPBN optimization techniques for virtual head and neck tumors assessing tumor response in terms of cell survival and tumor control probability with a previously published tumor response model (TRM). Uniform doses of 2 Gy are redistributed according to the microscopic oxygen distribution and the density distribution of tumor cells in four virtual tumors with different biological characteristics. In addition, two different optimization objective functions are investigated, which: i) minimize tumor cell survival (OFsurv) or; ii) maximize the homogeneity of the density of surviving tumor cells (OFstd). Several adaptive schemes, ranging from single to daily dose optimization, are studied and the treatment response is compared to that of the uniform dose. The results show that the benefit of DPBN treatments depends on the tumor reoxygenation capability, which strongly differed among the set of virtual tumors investigated. The difference between daily (fraction by fraction) and three weekly optimizations (at the beginning of weeks 1, 3 and 4) was found to be small, and higher benefit was observed for the treatments optimized using OFsurv. This in silico study corroborates the hypothesis that DPBN may be beneficial for treatments of tumors which show reoxygenation during treatment, and that a few optimizations may be sufficient to achieve this therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2802630673,"The largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease ever started in West Africa in December 2013; it created a pressing need to expand the workforce dealing with it. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the experiences of volunteers from the European Union who worked in deployable laboratories in West Africa during the outbreak. This study is part of the EMERGE project. We assessed the experiences of 251 volunteers with a 19-item online questionnaire. The questions asked about positive aspects of volunteering such as learning new skills, establishing a new path in life, and changing life values. Other questionnaire subjects were the compliance to follow-up measures, the extent to which volunteers felt these measures restricted their daily activities, the fear of stigmatization, and worries about becoming infected or infecting their families. The volunteers reported positive effects that reached far beyond their daily work, such as changes in life priorities and a greater appreciation of the value of their own lives. Although the volunteers did not feel that temperature monitoring restricted their daily activities, full compliance to temperature monitoring and reporting it to the authorities was low. The volunteers did not fear Ebola infection for themselves or their families and were not afraid of stigmatization. With respect to the burden on the families, 50% reported that their family members were worried that the volunteer would be infected with Ebola virus. Altogether, the positive experiences of the volunteers in this study far outweigh the negative implications and constitute an important argument for inspiring people who intend to join such missions and for motivating the hesitant ones."

https://openalex.org/W2800983580,"Introduction Intercultural competence (IC) is an important skill to be gained from higher education. However, it remains unclear what IC means to students and what factors might influence their definitions of IC. The aim of the current study was to qualitatively assess how students at one higher education institution in the USA define IC and to quantitatively test for relationships among IC components and various demographic characteristics, including intercultural experience and study context. A further aim was to descriptively compare the IC definitions from the US sample with the definitions obtained from another sample of university students in Germany. Materials and methods A purposive sample of n = 93 undergraduate, second semester students at Dickinson College, USA, participated in the study by completing an online questionnaire. The qualitative data were content-analyzed to define the dimensions of IC. The quantitative data were cluster-analyzed to assess the multivariate relationships among the IC components and the demographic characteristics of the sample. Results The most important dimensions of IC were Knowledge, External Outcomes (interaction, communication), and Attitudes (respect, tolerance) according to the US sample. The most frequently chosen dimensions of IC differed between both samples: Knowledge was chosen by the sample in the USA while External Outcomes was chosen by the sample in Germany. Relative to the US sample, significantly more students chose Attitudes, External Outcomes, and Intrapersonal Skills in the sample in Germany. The relationships among IC components and demographic characteristics were only weak in the US sample. A person with IC was rated as Open-minded and Respectful by students who lived predominantly in the USA or Tolerant and Curious by those who lived outside the USA for at least six months. Discussion The current results suggest that students residing in two countries (USA or Germany) define IC using similar dimensions. However, IC definitions may depend on the intercultural experience and the current global discourse. Longitudinal studies with representative samples are required to assess how IC definitions change over time."
https://openalex.org/W2799358544,"Unlike the mRNAs of their eukaryotic hosts, many RNAs of viruses lack a 5′ m7GpppN cap and the 3′ polyadenosine tail, and yet they are translated efficiently. Plant RNA viruses, in particular, have complex structures within their mRNA UTRs that allow them to bypass some cellular translation control steps. In the 3′ UTR of maize necrotic streak virus (MNeSV), an I-shaped RNA structure (ISS) has been shown to bind eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4F and to mediate viral translation initiation. A 5′–3′ RNA “kissing-loop” interaction is required for optimal translation. However, the details of how the 3′ ISS mediates translation initiation are not well understood. Here, we studied the binding of the 3′ ISS with eIFs. The eIF4A–eIF4B complex was found to increase binding affinity of eIF4F with the 3′ ISS by 4-fold (from KD = 173 ± 34 nm to KD = 48 ± 11 nm). Pre-steady–state analysis indicated that the eIF4A–eIF4B complex increased the RNA association rate and decreased the dissociation rate in an ATP-independent manner. Furthermore, our findings suggest that eIF4F could promote binding of the 3′ ISS with the MNeSV 5′UTR, enhancing the long-distance kissing-loop interaction. However, the association of the 5′UTR with the 3′ ISS–eIF4F complex did not increase 40S ribosomal subunit binding affinity. These quantitative results suggest a stepwise model in which the first committed step is eIF4F binding to the 3′ ISS, followed by an interaction with the 5′UTR and subsequent 40S ribosomal subunit binding. Unlike the mRNAs of their eukaryotic hosts, many RNAs of viruses lack a 5′ m7GpppN cap and the 3′ polyadenosine tail, and yet they are translated efficiently. Plant RNA viruses, in particular, have complex structures within their mRNA UTRs that allow them to bypass some cellular translation control steps. In the 3′ UTR of maize necrotic streak virus (MNeSV), an I-shaped RNA structure (ISS) has been shown to bind eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4F and to mediate viral translation initiation.

https://openalex.org/W2801614576,"Epithelial cell-adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane protein that regulates cell cycle progression and differentiation and is overexpressed in many carcinomas. The EpCAM-induced mitogenic cascade is activated via regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of EpCAM by ADAM and γ-secretases, generating the signaling-active intracellular domain EpICD. Because of its expression pattern and molecular function, EpCAM is a valuable target in prognostic and therapeutic approaches for various carcinomas. So far, several immunotherapeutic strategies have targeted the extracellular domain of EpCAM. However, targeting the intracellular signaling cascade of EpCAM holds promise for specifically interfering with EpCAM's proliferation-stimulating signaling cascade. Here, using a yellow fluorescence protein-tagged version of the C-terminal fragment of EpCAM, we established a high-content screening (HCS) of a small-molecule compound library (n = 27,280) and characterized validated hits that target EpCAM signaling. In total, 128 potential inhibitors were initially identified, of which one compound with robust inhibitory effects on RIP of EpCAM was analyzed in greater detail. In summary, our study demonstrates that the development of an HCS for small-molecule inhibitors of the EpCAM signaling pathway is feasible. We propose that this approach may also be useful for identifying chemical compounds targeting other disorders involving membrane cleavage-dependent signaling pathways."

Therefore, knowledge about the molecular determinants of hybrid performance (HP) in the field can be used to devise better performing hybrids to address the demands for sustainable increase in yield. Here, we propose and test a classification-driven framework that uses metabolic profiles from in vitro grown young roots of parental lines from the Dent × Flint maize heterotic pattern to predict field HP. We identify parental analytes that best predict the metabolic inheritance patterns in 328 hybrids. We then demonstrate that these analytes are also predictive of field HP (0.64 ≥ r ≥ 0.79) and discriminate hybrids of good performance (accuracy of 87.50%). Therefore, our approach provides a cost-effective solution for hybrid selection programs."
https://openalex.org/W2801932259,"On 25 April, hundreds of astronomers around the world got their hands on one of the biggest data dumps in the history of astronomy: the exact positions, motions, brightnesses, and colors of 1.3 billion stars in and around the Milky Way, gathered during the first 2 years of operation by the European Space Agency9s €750 million Gaia satellite, launched in 2013. The data—Gaia9s second release—will fuel an explosion of studies about the structure of the Milky Way. The trove of stellar positions from Gaia will sharpen our picture of the galaxy9s spiral structures, and the data on stellar motions will allow astronomers to wind the clock backward and see how the galaxy evolved over the past 13 billion years. Gaia9s color and brightness information, meanwhile, will help astronomers classify stars by composition and pin down where different types are born."

https://openalex.org/W2799509917,"In 1894, gold prospectors digging up a peat bog in Yekaterinburg, Russia, unearthed something bizarre: a carved wooden idol 5 meters long, with a recognizably human head—mouth open in a perfect o—and covered front and back with mysterious carvings. For more than a century, the statue was displayed as a curiosity in a Siberian museum, assumed to be at most a few thousand years old. This week, a paper published in the journal Antiquity argues that the statue was crafted 11,600 years ago, making it one of the world9s oldest examples of monumental art. The idol also shows that large-scale, complex art emerged in more than one place—and that it was the handiwork of hunter-gatherers and not, as was once assumed, of later farming societies."

Mines continue to kill or maim dozens each year, and in rural areas, they keep villagers who fled during the conflict from returning home. To tackle the scourge, Colombia has committed to ridding itself of land mines by 2021. But so far, only 11% of an estimated 52 square kilometers littered with mines has been cleared. The going is slow because in Colombia, the FARC and other armed groups crafted improvised explosive devices from PVC pipes, plastic soda bottles, and other low-tech containers that can9t be found with metal detectors. Colombia9s rugged terrain, wet climate, and lush forests also make demining a stiff challenge. Physicists and engineers are now testing new methods for finding land mines, seeking to speed up the process of finding and disarming these weapons."

Before long, the roof of the box yawned open and a weather balloon took off into the sunny afternoon, instruments dangling. The entire launch was triggered with the touch of a button, 5 kilometers away at an office of the National Weather Service (NWS). The flight was smooth, just one of hundreds of twice-daily balloon launches around the world that radio back crucial data for weather forecasts. But most of those balloons are launched by people; the robotic launchers, which are rolling out across Alaska, are proving to be controversial. NWS says the autolaunchers will save money and free up staff to work on more pressing matters. But representatives of the employee union question their reliability, and say they will hasten the end of Alaska9s remote weather offices, where forecasting duties and hours have already been slashed."
