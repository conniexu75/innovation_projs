https://openalex.org/W1989990468,"Over the past two decades, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have received much attention because their extraordinary properties are promising for numerous applications. Many of these properties depend sensitively on SWCNT structure, which is characterized by the chiral index (n,m) that denotes the length and orientation of the circumferential vector in the hexagonal carbon lattice. Electronic properties are particularly strongly affected, with subtle structural changes switching tubes from metallic to semiconducting with various bandgaps. Monodisperse 'single-chirality' (that is, with a single (n,m) index) SWCNTs are thus needed to fully exploit their technological potential. Controlled synthesis through catalyst engineering, end-cap engineering or cloning strategies, and also tube sorting based on chromatography, density-gradient centrifugation, electrophoresis and other techniques, have delivered SWCNT samples with narrow distributions of tube diameter and a large fraction of a predetermined tube type. But an effective pathway to truly monodisperse SWCNTs remains elusive. The use of template molecules to unambiguously dictate the diameter and chirality of the resulting nanotube holds great promise in this regard, but has hitherto had only limited practical success. Here we show that this bottom-up strategy can produce targeted nanotubes: we convert molecular precursors into ultrashort singly capped (6,6) 'armchair' nanotube seeds using surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation on a platinum (111) surface, and then elongate these during a subsequent growth phase to produce single-chirality and essentially defect-free SWCNTs with lengths up to a few hundred nanometres. We expect that our on-surface synthesis approach will provide a route to nanotube-based materials with highly optimized properties for applications such as light detectors, photovoltaics, field-effect transistors and sensors."

https://openalex.org/W2070416595,"The planet is experiencing an ongoing global biodiversity crisis. Measuring the magnitude and rate of change more effectively requires access to organized, easily discoverable, and digitally-formatted biodiversity data, both legacy and new, from across the globe. Assembling this coherent digital representation of biodiversity requires the integration of data that have historically been analog, dispersed, and heterogeneous. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a software package developed to support biodiversity dataset publication in a common format. The IPT’s two primary functions are to 1) encode existing species occurrence datasets and checklists, such as records from natural history collections or observations, in the Darwin Core standard to enhance interoperability of data, and 2) publish and archive data and metadata for broad use in a Darwin Core Archive, a set of files following a standard format. Here we discuss the key need for the IPT, how it has developed in response to community input, and how it continues to evolve to streamline and enhance the interoperability, discoverability, and mobilization of new data types beyond basic Darwin Core records. We close with a discussion how IPT has impacted the biodiversity research community, how it enhances data publishing in more traditional journal venues, along with new features implemented in the latest version of the IPT, and future plans for more enhancements."

https://openalex.org/W1996505939,"Type-Iax supernovae (SN Iax) are stellar explosions that are spectroscopically similar to some type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at maximum light, except with lower ejecta velocities. They are also distinguished by lower luminosities. At late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from other SN, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-mass elements) suggests a physical connection to normal SN Ia. These are not rare; SN Iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal SN Ia rate. The leading models for SN Iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are ""less successful"" cousins of normal SN Ia, where complete disruption is observed. Here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of the type-Iax SN 2012Z in deep pre-explosion imaging. Its luminosity, colors, environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the Galactic helium nova V445 Puppis, suggest that SN 2012Z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting from a helium-star companion. Observations in the next few years, after SN 2012Z has faded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernova was actually the explosive death of a massive star."
https://openalex.org/W2158229562,"The central circadian clock within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) plays an important role in temporally organizing and coordinating many of the processes governing cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in synchrony with the daily light/dark cycle which may contribute to endogenous cancer prevention. Bioenergetic substrates and molecular intermediates required for building tumor biomass each day are derived from both aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and lipid metabolism. Using tissue-isolated human breast cancer xenografts grown in nude rats, we determined that circulating systemic factors in the host and the Warburg effect, linoleic acid uptake/metabolism and growth signaling activities in the tumor are dynamically regulated, coordinated and integrated within circadian time structure over a 24-hour light/dark cycle by SCN-driven nocturnal pineal production of the anticancer hormone melatonin. Dim light at night (LAN)-induced melatonin suppression disrupts this circadian-regulated host/cancer balance among several important cancer preventative signaling mechanisms, leading to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in the host and runaway aerobic glycolysis, lipid signaling and proliferative activity in the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2103142570,"Current diagnosis and treatment of movement impairment post-stroke is based on the subjective assessment of select movements by a trained clinical specialist. However, modern low-cost motion capture technology allows for the development of automated quantitative assessment of motor impairment. Such outcome measures are crucial for advancing post-stroke treatment methods. We sought to develop an automated method of measuring the quality of movement in clinically-relevant terms from low-cost motion capture. Unconstrained movements of upper extremity were performed by people with chronic hemiparesis and recorded by standard and low-cost motion capture systems. Quantitative scores derived from motion capture were compared to qualitative clinical scores produced by trained human raters. A strong linear relationship was found between qualitative scores and quantitative scores derived from both standard and low-cost motion capture. Performance of the automated scoring algorithm was matched by averaged qualitative scores of three human raters. We conclude that low-cost motion capture combined with an automated scoring algorithm is a feasible method to assess objectively upper-arm impairment post stroke. The application of this technology may not only reduce the cost of assessment of post-stroke movement impairment, but also promote the acceptance of objective impairment measures into routine medical practice."
https://openalex.org/W1965837566,"Quantum simulation - the use of one quantum system to simulate a less controllable one - may provide an understanding of the many quantum systems which cannot be modeled using classical computers. Impressive progress on control and manipulation has been achieved for various quantum systems, but one of the remaining challenges is the implementation of scalable devices. In this regard, individual ions trapped in separate tunable potential wells are promising. Here we implement the basic features of this approach and demonstrate deterministic tuning of the Coulomb interaction between two ions, independently controlling their local wells. The scheme is suitable for emulating a range of spin-spin interactions, but to characterize the performance of our setup we select one that entangles the internal states of the two ions with 0.82(1) fidelity. Extension of this building-block to a 2D-network, which ion-trap micro-fabrication processes enable, may provide a new quantum simulator architecture with broad flexibility in designing and scaling the arrangement of ions and their mutual interactions. To perform useful quantum simulations, including those of intriguing condensed-matter phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, an array of tens of ions might be sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W1983922226,"DNA sequences are translated into protein coding sequences and then further assigned to protein families in metagenomic analyses, because of the need for sensitivity. However, huge amounts of sequence data create the problem that even general homology search analyses using BLASTX become difficult in terms of computational cost. We designed a new homology search algorithm that finds seed sequences based on the suffix arrays of a query and a database, and have implemented it as GHOSTX. GHOSTX achieved approximately 131–165 times acceleration over a BLASTX search at similar levels of sensitivity. GHOSTX is distributed under the BSD 2-clause license and is available for download at http://www.bi.cs.titech.ac.jp/ghostx/. Currently, sequencing technology continues to improve, and sequencers are increasingly producing larger and larger quantities of data. This explosion of sequence data makes computational analysis with contemporary tools more difficult. We offer this tool as a potential solution to this problem."
https://openalex.org/W2086272179,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in the urine are mainly released from cells of the nephron and can therefore provide information on kidney function. We here evaluated the presence of vesicles expressing the progenitor marker CD133 in the urine of normal subjects and of patients undergoing renal transplant. We found that EV expressing CD133 were present in the urine of normal subjects, but not of patients with end stage renal disease. The first day after transplant, urinary CD133+ EVs were present at low levels, to increase thereafter (at day 7). Urinary CD133(+) EVs significantly increased in patients with slow graft function in respect to those with early graft function. In patients with a severe pre-transplant vascular damage of the graft, CD133(+) EVs did not increase at day 7. At variance, the levels of EVs expressing the renal exosomal marker CD24 did not vary in the urine of patients with end stage renal disease or in transplanted patients in respect to controls. Sorted CD133(+) EVs were found to express glomerular and proximal tubular markers. These data indicate that urinary CD133(+) EVs are continuously released during the homeostatic turnover of the nephron and may provide information on its function or regenerative potential."
https://openalex.org/W2007656488,"Oviposition is induced upon mating in most insects. Ovulation is a primary step in oviposition, representing an important target to control insect pests and vectors, but limited information is available on the underlying mechanism. Here we report that the beta adrenergic-like octopamine receptor Octβ2R serves as a key signaling molecule for ovulation and recruits protein kinase A and Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive kinase II as downstream effectors for this activity. We found that the octβ2r homozygous mutant females are sterile. They displayed normal courtship, copulation, sperm storage and post-mating rejection behavior but were unable to lay eggs. We have previously shown that octopamine neurons in the abdominal ganglion innervate the oviduct epithelium. Consistently, restored expression of Octβ2R in oviduct epithelial cells was sufficient to reinstate ovulation and full fecundity in the octβ2r mutant females, demonstrating that the oviduct epithelium is a major site of Octβ2R’s function in oviposition. We also found that overexpression of the protein kinase A catalytic subunit or Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive protein kinase II led to partial rescue of octβ2r’s sterility. This suggests that Octβ2R activates cAMP as well as additional effectors including Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive protein kinase II for oviposition. All three known beta adrenergic-like octopamine receptors stimulate cAMP production in vitro. Octβ1R, when ectopically expressed in the octβ2r’s oviduct epithelium, fully reinstated ovulation and fecundity. Ectopically expressed Octβ3R, on the other hand, partly restored ovulation and fecundity while OAMB-K3 and OAMB-AS that increase Ca2+ levels yielded partial rescue of ovulation but not fecundity deficit. These observations suggest that Octβ2R have distinct signaling capacities in vivo and activate multiple signaling pathways to induce egg laying. The findings reported here narrow the knowledge gap and offer insight into novel strategies for insect control."
https://openalex.org/W1995750200,"The ability to maintain an appropriate physical distance (i.e., interpersonal distance) from others is a critical aspect of social interaction and contributes importantly to real-life social functioning. In Study 1, using parent-report data that had been acquired on a large number of individuals (ages 4–18 years) for the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange and the Simons Simplex Collection, we found that those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; n = 766) more often violated the space of others compared to their unaffected siblings (n = 766). This abnormality held equally across ASD diagnostic categories, and correlated with clinical measures of communication and social functioning. In Study 2, laboratory experiments in a sample of high-functioning adults with ASD demonstrated an altered relationship between interpersonal distance and personal space, and documented a complete absence of personal space in 3 individuals with ASD. Furthermore, anecdotal self-report from several participants confirmed that violations of social distancing conventions continue to occur in real-world interactions through adulthood. We suggest that atypical social distancing behavior offers a practical and sensitive measure of social dysfunction in ASD, and one whose psychological and neurological substrates should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2000691301,"Background Although whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci complex) are an important pest of cotton in Pakistan, its taxonomic diversity is poorly understood. As DNA barcoding is an effective tool for resolving species complexes and analyzing species distributions, we used this approach to analyze genetic diversity in the B. tabaci complex and map the distribution of B. tabaci lineages in cotton growing areas of Pakistan. Methods/Principal Findings Sequence diversity in the DNA barcode region (mtCOI-5′) was examined in 593 whiteflies from Pakistan to determine the number of whitefly species and their distributions in the cotton-growing areas of Punjab and Sindh provinces. These new records were integrated with another 173 barcode sequences for B. tabaci, most from India, to better understand regional whitefly diversity. The Barcode Index Number (BIN) System assigned the 766 sequences to 15 BINs, including nine from Pakistan. Representative specimens of each Pakistan BIN were analyzed for mtCOI-3′ to allow their assignment to one of the putative species in the B. tabaci complex recognized on the basis of sequence variation in this gene region. This analysis revealed the presence of Asia II 1, Middle East-Asia Minor 1, Asia 1, Asia II 5, Asia II 7, and a new lineage “Pakistan”. The first two taxa were found in both Punjab and Sindh, but Asia 1 was only detected in Sindh, while Asia II 5, Asia II 7 and “Pakistan” were only present in Punjab. The haplotype networks showed that most haplotypes of Asia II 1, a species implicated in transmission of the cotton leaf curl virus, occurred in both India and Pakistan. Conclusions DNA barcodes successfully discriminated cryptic species in B. tabaci complex. The dominant haplotypes in the B. tabaci complex were shared by India and Pakistan. Asia II 1 was previously restricted to Punjab, but is now the dominant lineage in southern Sindh; its southward spread may have serious implications for cotton plantations in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2023743256,"Rhizosphere competence of bacterial inoculants is assumed to be important for successful biocontrol. Knowledge of factors influencing rhizosphere competence under field conditions is largely lacking. The present study is aimed to unravel the effects of soil types on the rhizosphere competence and biocontrol activity of the two inoculant strains Pseudomonas jessenii RU47 and Serratia plymuthica 3Re4-18 in field-grown lettuce in soils inoculated with Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IB or not. Two independent experiments were carried out in 2011 on an experimental plot system with three soil types sharing the same cropping history and weather conditions for more than 10 years. Rifampicin resistant mutants of the inoculants were used to evaluate their colonization in the rhizosphere of lettuce. The rhizosphere bacterial community structure was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total community DNA to get insights into the effects of the inoculants and R. solani on the indigenous rhizosphere bacterial communities. Both inoculants showed a good colonization ability of the rhizosphere of lettuce with more than 106 colony forming units per g root dry mass two weeks after planting. An effect of the soil type on rhizosphere competence was observed for 3Re4-18 but not for RU47. In both experiments a comparable rhizosphere competence was observed and in the presence of the inoculants disease symptoms were either significantly reduced, or at least a non-significant trend was shown. Disease severity was highest in diluvial sand followed by alluvial loam and loess loam suggesting that the soil types differed in their conduciveness for bottom rot disease. Compared to effect of the soil type of the rhizosphere bacterial communities, the effects of the pathogen and the inoculants were less pronounced. The soil types had a surprisingly low influence on rhizosphere competence and biocontrol activity while they significantly affected the bottom rot disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2165533198,"Throughout the Amazon region, the age of forests regenerating on previously deforested land is determined, in part, by the periods of active land use prior to abandonment and the frequency of reclearance of regrowth, both of which can be quantified by comparing time-series of Landsat sensor data. Using these time-series of near annual data from 1973–2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from 1984–2010 for south of Santarém (Pará state) and 1984–2011 near Machadinho d’Oeste (Rondônia state), the changes in the area of primary forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarém and Machadinho d’Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6–15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a) the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under protection, including areas of regrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2019874100,"As the only flying mammal, bats harbor a number of emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which cause severe diseases in humans and other mammals yet result in no clinical symptoms in bats. As the master regulator of the interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays a central role in innate antiviral immunity. To explore the role of bat IRF7 in the regulation of the IFN response, we performed sequence and functional analysis of IRF7 from the pteropid bat, Pteropus alecto. Our results demonstrate that bat IRF7 retains the ability to bind to MyD88 and activate the IFN response despite unique changes in the MyD88 binding domain. We also demonstrate that bat IRF7 has a unique expression pattern across both immune and non-immune related tissues and is inducible by double-strand RNA. The broad tissue distribution of IRF7 may provide bats with an enhanced ability to rapidly activate the IFN response in a wider range of tissues compared to other mammals. The importance of IRF7 in antiviral activity against the bat reovirus, Pulau virus was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of IRF7 in bat cells resulting in enhanced viral replication. Our results highlight the importance of IRF7 in innate antiviral immunity in bats."
https://openalex.org/W2055004859,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates cellular responses to a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. ILK is involved in cell-matrix interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and cell signaling. ILK signaling has also been implicated in oncogenesis and progression of cancers. However, its role in the innate immune system remains unknown. Here, we show that ILK mediates pro-inflammatory signaling in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ILK in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages selectively blocks LPS-induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). ILK is required for LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and transcriptional induction of TNF-α. The modulation of LPS-induced TNF-α synthesis by ILK does not involve the classical NF-κB pathway, because IκB-α degradation and p65 nuclear translocation are both unaffected by ILK inhibition. Instead, ILK is involved in an alternative activation of NF-κB signaling by modulating the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536. Furthermore, ILK-mediated alternative NF-κB activation through p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation also occurs during Helicobacter pylori infection in macrophages and gastric cancer cells. Moreover, ILK is required for H. pylori-induced TNF-α secretion in macrophages. Although ILK-mediated phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 is independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway during LPS stimulation, upon H. pylori infection this event is dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Our findings implicate ILK as a critical regulatory molecule for the NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling pathway, which is essential for innate immune responses against pathogenic microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2089074690,"Atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis are essential pathological features of atrial fibrillation. Recently, adiponectin has become a protein of interest due to its beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of atrial structural remodeling and signaling pathways evoked by adiponectin remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effect of globular adiponectin (gAcrp) on angiotensin II-induced atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis in neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the preventive effect of gAcrp, transfection of cells with siRNA was used to suppress the mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and its downstream adaptor protein APPL1. Non-silencing-Cy-3 labelled siRNA was used to determine transfection efficiency using fluorescence microscopy. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and procollagen type1 α-1, hypertrophy marker and fibrosis one, respectively, was detected by real-time PCR. Furthermore, the expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt was detected by western blotting. In addition, nuclear p65 translocation activity was analyzed by EMSA supershift assay. Our results showed that AdipoR1 and the adaptor protein APPL1 mediated the protective effects of gAcrp. In addition, the function of adiponectin and phosphorylation of AMPK were prominently diminished by inhibition of PI3K. Furthermore, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription was diminished by the specific inhibition of AMPK. Taken together, AMPK pivotally interacts with NF-κB and PI3K, mediating the cardioprotective effect of adiponectin, and may serve as a therapeutic target for preventing atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our present study suggests that gAcrp could ameliorate AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in rat atrial cells, which is mediated by the activation of AMPK signaling pathways. APPL1 and AdipoR1 are the key factors involved in the downstream of gAcrp approach."
https://openalex.org/W2039238655,"Most pre-clinical analgesic efficacy assays still involve nociceptive testing in rodents. This is despite concerns as to the relevance of these tests for evaluating the pain-preventative properties of drugs. More appropriate methods would target pain rather than nociception, but these are currently not available, so it remains unknown whether animal pain equates to the negatively affective and subjective/emotional state it causes in humans. Mouse cancer models are common despite the likelihood of substantial pain. We used Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) testing, assessments of thermal hyperalgesia and behaviour to determine the likelihood that MBT-2 bladder cancer impacts negatively on mouse welfare, such as by causing pain. There was no CPP to saline, but morphine preference in tumour bearing mice exceeded that seen in tumour-free controls. This occurred up to 10 days before the study end-point alongside reduced body weight, development of hyperalgesia and behaviour changes. These effects indicated mice experienced a negative welfare state caused by malaise (if not pain) before euthanasia. Due to the complexity of the assessments needed to demonstrate this, it is unlikely that this approach could be used for routine welfare assessment on a study-by-study basis. However, our results show mice in sufficiently similar studies are likely to benefit from more intensive severity assessment and re-evaluation of end-points with a view to implementing appropriate refinements. In this particular case, a refinement would have been to have euthanased mice at least 7 days earlier or possibly by provision of end-stage pain relief. CPP testing was found to be a helpful method to investigate the responses of mice to analgesics, possibly on a subjective level. These findings and those of other recent studies show it could be a valuable method of screening candidate analgesics for efficacy against cancer pain and possibly other pain or disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2161572093,"The question of whether species’ origins influence invasion outcomes has been a point of substantial debate in invasion ecology. Theoretically, colonization outcomes can be predicted based on how species’ traits interact with community filters, a process presumably blind to species’ origins. Yet, exotic plant introductions commonly result in monospecific plant densities not commonly seen in native assemblages, suggesting that exotic species may respond to community filters differently than natives. Here, we tested whether exotic and native species differed in their responses to a local community filter by examining how ant seed predation affected recruitment of eighteen native and exotic plant species in central Argentina. Ant seed predation proved to be an important local filter that strongly suppressed plant recruitment, but ants suppressed exotic recruitment far more than natives (89% of exotic species vs. 22% of natives). Seed size predicted ant impacts on recruitment independent of origins, with ant preference for smaller seeds resulting in smaller seeded plant species being heavily suppressed. The disproportionate effects of provenance arose because exotics had generally smaller seeds than natives. Exotics also exhibited greater emergence and earlier peak emergence than natives in the absence of ants. However, when ants had access to seeds, these potential advantages of exotics were negated due to the filtering bias against exotics. The differences in traits we observed between exotics and natives suggest that higher-order introduction filters or regional processes preselected for certain exotic traits that then interacted with the local seed predation filter. Our results suggest that the interactions between local filters and species traits can predict invasion outcomes, but understanding the role of provenance will require quantifying filtering processes at multiple hierarchical scales and evaluating interactions between filters."

GOGAT enzyme occurs in two distinct forms that use NADH (NADH-GOGAT) or Fd (Fd-GOGAT) as electron carriers. The goal of the present study was to characterize wheat Fd-GOGAT genes and to assess the linkage with grain protein content (GPC), an important quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes.We report the complete genomic sequences of the three homoeologous A, B and D Fd-GOGAT genes from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and their localization and characterization. The gene is comprised of 33 exons and 32 introns for all the three homoeologues genes. The three genes show the same exon/intron number and size, with the only exception of a series of indels in intronic regions. The partial sequence of the Fd-GOGAT gene located on A genome was determined in two durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cvs Ciccio and Svevo, characterized by different grain protein content. Genomic differences allowed the gene mapping in the centromeric region of chromosome 2A. QTL analysis was conducted in the Svevo×Ciccio RIL mapping population, previously evaluated in 5 different environments. The study co-localized the Fd-GOGAT-A gene with the marker GWM-339, identifying a significant major QTL for GPC.The wheat Fd-GOGAT genes are highly conserved; both among the three homoeologous hexaploid wheat genes and in comparison with other plants. In durum wheat, an association was shown between the Fd-GOGAT allele of cv Svevo with increasing GPC - potentially useful in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W1990695557,"Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of amyloidoses are not well understood, the interaction between amyloid proteins and cell membranes is thought to play a role in several amyloid diseases. Amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin (β2m), associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), have been shown to cause disruption of anionic lipid bilayers in vitro. However, the effect of lipid composition and the chemical environment in which β2m-lipid interactions occur have not been investigated previously. Here we examine membrane damage resulting from the interaction of β2m monomers and fibrils with lipid bilayers. Using dye release, tryptophan fluorescence quenching and fluorescence confocal microscopy assays we investigate the effect of anionic lipid composition and pH on the susceptibility of liposomes to fibril-induced membrane damage. We show that β2m fibril-induced membrane disruption is modulated by anionic lipid composition and is enhanced by acidic pH. Most strikingly, the greatest degree of membrane disruption is observed for liposomes containing bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) at acidic pH, conditions likely to reflect those encountered in the endocytic pathway. The results suggest that the interaction between β2m fibrils and membranes of endosomal origin may play a role in the molecular mechanism of β2m amyloid-associated osteoarticular tissue destruction in DRA."

https://openalex.org/W2167419428,"Subsurface sediments of the Sonora Margin (Guaymas Basin), located in proximity of active cold seep sites were explored. The taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities were investigated from 1 to 10 meters below the seafloor. Microbial community structure and abundance and distribution of dominant populations were assessed using complementary molecular approaches (Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, 16S rRNA libraries and quantitative PCR with an extensive primers set) and correlated to comprehensive geochemical data. Moreover the metabolic potentials and functional traits of the microbial community were also identified using the GeoChip functional gene microarray and metabolic rates. The active microbial community structure in the Sonora Margin sediments was related to deep subsurface ecosystems (Marine Benthic Groups B and D, Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group, Chloroflexi and Candidate divisions) and remained relatively similar throughout the sediment section, despite defined biogeochemical gradients. However, relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal dominant lineages were significantly correlated with organic carbon quantity and origin. Consistently, metabolic pathways for the degradation and assimilation of this organic carbon as well as genetic potentials for the transformation of detrital organic matters, hydrocarbons and recalcitrant substrates were detected, suggesting that chemoorganotrophic microorganisms may dominate the microbial community of the Sonora Margin subsurface sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2001889610,"Many aquatic plant and seagrass species are widespread and the origin of their continent-wide ranges might result from high gene flow levels. The response of species when extending northwards since the Last Glacial Maximum can be opposed to the structuring of their populations that survived glaciation cycles in southern regions. The peri-Mediterranean is a complex series of sea basins, coastlines, islands and river deltas with a unique history since the Messinian Crisis that potentially influenced allopatric processes of aquatic life. We tested whether vast ranges across Europe and the peri-Mediterranean of a global seagrass group (Ruppia species complexes) can be explained by either overall high levels of gene flow or vicariance through linking population genetics, phylogeography and shallow phylogenetics. A multigene approach identified haplogroup lineages of two species complexes, of ancient and recent hybrids with most of the diversity residing in the South. High levels of connectivity over long distances were only observed at recently colonized northern ranges and in recently-filled seas following the last glaciation. A strong substructure in the southern Mediterranean explained an isolation-by-distance model across Europe. The oldest lineages of the southern Mediterranean Ruppia dated back to the period between the end of the Messinian and Late Pliocene. An imprint of ancient allopatric origin was left at basin level, including basal African lineages. Thus both vicariance in the South and high levels of connectivity in the North explained vast species ranges. Our findings highlight the need for interpreting global distributions of these seagrass and euryhaline species in the context of their origin and evolutionary significant units for setting up appropriate conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2042409963,"The spinal dorsal horn comprises heterogeneous populations of interneurons and projection neurons, which form neuronal circuits crucial for processing of primary sensory information. Although electrophysiological analyses have uncovered sensory stimulation-evoked neuronal activity of various spinal dorsal horn neurons, monitoring these activities from large ensembles of neurons is needed to obtain a comprehensive view of the spinal dorsal horn circuitry. In the present study, we established in vivo calcium imaging of multiple spinal dorsal horn neurons by using a two-photon microscope and extracted three-dimensional neuronal activity maps of these neurons in response to cutaneous sensory stimulation. For calcium imaging, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based calcium indicator protein, Yellow Cameleon, which is insensitive to motion artifacts of living animals was introduced into spinal dorsal horn neurons by in utero electroporation. In vivo calcium imaging following pinch, brush, and heat stimulation suggests that laminar distribution of sensory stimulation-evoked neuronal activity in the spinal dorsal horn largely corresponds to that of primary afferent inputs.

These results provide a clue to understand neuronal processing of sensory information in the spinal dorsal horn."
https://openalex.org/W2087389024,"Alcohol intoxication results in neuronal apoptosis, neurodegeneration and manifest with impaired balance, loss of muscle coordination and behavioral changes. One of the early events of alcohol intoxication is mitochondrial (Mt) dysfunction and disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis. The mechanisms by which alcohol causes Mt dysfunction, disrupts cellular redox homeostasis and triggers neurodegeneration remains to be further investigated. Proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) plays critical roles in regulating Mt biogenesis and respiration, cellular antioxidant defense mechanism, and maintenance of neuronal integrity and function. In this study, we sought to investigate whether alcohol causes Mt dysfunction and triggers neurodegeneration by suppressing PGC-1α expression. We report that ethanol suppresses PGC-1α expression, and impairs mitochondrial function and enhances cellular toxicity in cultured neuronal cell line and also in human fetal brain neural stem cell-derived primary neurons. Moreover, we report that cells over-expressing exogenous PGC-1α or treated with Rolipram, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, ameliorate alcohol-induced cellular toxicity. Further analysis show that ethanol decreases steady-state intracellular cAMP levels, and thus depletes phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), the key transcription factor that regulates transcription of PGC-1α gene. Accordingly, we found PGC-1α promoter activity and transcription was dramatically repressed in neuronal cells when exposed to ethanol, suggesting that ethanol blunts cAMP→CREB signaling pathway to interfere with the transcription of PGC-1α. Ethanol-mediated decrease in PGC-1α activity results in the disruption of Mt respiration and function and higher cellular toxicity. This study might lead to potential therapeutic intervention to ameliorate alcohol-induced apoptosis and/or neurodegeneration by targeting PGC-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2127493974,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include storage, voiding and post-micturition symptoms, featuring many urological diseases. Storage symptoms are the most frequent among these and associated with overactive bladder and non-bacterial bladder inflammation such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Gap junction, a key regulator of hyperactive conditions in the bladder, has been reported to be involved in pathological bladder inflammation. Here we report involvement of gap junction in the etiology of storage symptoms in bladder inflammation. In this study, cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis was adapted as a model of bladder inflammation. Cyclophosphamide-treated mice showed typical storage symptoms including increased urinary frequency and reduced bladder capacity, with concurrent up-regulation of connexin 43 (GJA1), one of the major gap junction proteins in the bladder. In isometric tension study, bladder smooth muscle strips taken from the treated mice showed more pronounced spontaneous contraction than controls, which was attenuated by carbenoxolone, a gap junction inhibitor. In voiding behavior studies, the storage symptoms in the treated mice characterized by frequent voiding were alleviated by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid, another gap junction inhibitor. These results demonstrate that cyclophosphamide-induced mouse model of cystitis shows clinical storage symptoms related with bladder inflammation and that gap junction in the bladder may be a key molecule of these storage symptoms. Therefore, gap junction in the bladder might be an alternative therapeutic target for storage symptoms in bladder inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2018676993,"The mesopelagic zone is a visual scene continuum in which organisms have developed various strategies to optimize photon capture. Here, we used light microscopy, stereology-assisted retinal topographic mapping, spectrophotometry and microspectrophotometry to investigate the visual ecology of deep-sea bioluminescent sharks [four etmopterid species (Etmopterus lucifer, E. splendidus, E. spinax and Trigonognathus kabeyai) and one dalatiid species (Squaliolus aliae)]. We highlighted a novel structure, a translucent area present in the upper eye orbit of Etmopteridae, which might be part of a reference system for counterillumination adjustment or acts as a spectral filter for camouflage breaking, as well as several ocular specialisations such as aphakic gaps and semicircular tapeta previously unknown in elasmobranchs. All species showed pure rod hexagonal mosaics with a high topographic diversity. Retinal specialisations, formed by shallow cell density gradients, may aid in prey detection and reflect lifestyle differences; pelagic species display areae centrales while benthopelagic and benthic species display wide and narrow horizontal streaks, respectively. One species (E. lucifer) displays two areae within its horizontal streak that likely allows detection of conspecifics' elongated bioluminescent flank markings. Ganglion cell topography reveals less variation with all species showing a temporal area for acute frontal binocular vision. This area is dorsally extended in T. kabeyai, allowing this species to adjust the strike of its peculiar jaws in the ventro-frontal visual field. Etmopterus lucifer showed an additional nasal area matching a high rod density area. Peak spectral sensitivities of the rod visual pigments (λmax) fall within the range 484-491 nm, allowing these sharks to detect a high proportion of photons present in their habitat. Comparisons with previously published data reveal ocular differences between bioluminescent and non-bioluminescent deep-sea sharks. In particular, bioluminescent sharks possess higher rod densities, which might provide them with improved temporal resolution particularly useful for bioluminescent communication during social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2160214677,"Objective Anemia is associated with high mortality and poor prognosis after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Increased red cell distribution width (RDW) is a strong independent predictor for adverse outcomes in ACS. The common underlying mechanism for anemia and increased RDW value is iron deficiency. It is not clear whether serum iron deficiency without anemia affects left ventricular (LV) performance after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated the prognostic value of serum iron concentration on LV ejection fraction (EF) at 6 months and its relationship to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score in post MI patients. Methods We recruited 55 patients who were scheduled to undergo primary coronary balloon angioplasty after AMI and 54 age- and sex-matched volunteers. Serum iron concentration and interleukin-6 levels were measured before primary angioplasty. LVEF was measured by echocardiography at baseline and after 6 months. TIMI risk score was calculated for risk stratification. Results Serum iron concentration was significantly lower in those in whom LVEF had not improved ≥10% from baseline (52.7±24.1 versus 80.8±50.8 µg/dl, P = 0.016) regardless of hemoglobin level, and was significantly lower in the AMI group than in the control group (62.5±37.7 versus 103.0±38.1 µg/dl, P<0.001). Trend analysis revealed that serum iron concentration decreased as TIMI risk score increased (P = 0.002). In addition, lower serum iron concentrations were associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Multiple linear regression showed that baseline serum iron concentration can predict LV systolic function 6 months after primary angioplasty for AMI even after adjusting for traditional prognostic factors. Conclusion Hypoferremia is not only a marker of inflammation but also a potential prognostic factor for LV systolic function after revascularization therapy for AMI, and may be a novel biomarker for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1999629339,"The purpose of the experiments was to analyse the spatial cueing effects of the movements of soccer players executing normal and deceptive (step-over) turns with the ball. Stimuli comprised normal resolution or point-light video clips of soccer players dribbling a football towards the observer then turning right or left with the ball. Clips were curtailed before or on the turn (-160, -80, 0 or +80 ms) to examine the time course of direction prediction and spatial cueing effects. Participants were divided into higher-skilled (HS) and lower-skilled (LS) groups according to soccer experience. In experiment 1, accuracy on full video clips was higher than on point-light but results followed the same overall pattern. Both HS and LS groups correctly identified direction on normal moves at all occlusion levels. For deceptive moves, LS participants were significantly worse than chance and HS participants were somewhat more accurate but nevertheless substantially impaired. In experiment 2, point-light clips were used to cue a lateral target. HS and LS groups showed faster reaction times to targets that were congruent with the direction of normal turns, and to targets incongruent with the direction of deceptive turns. The reversed cueing by deceptive moves coincided with earlier kinematic events than cueing by normal moves. It is concluded that the body kinematics of soccer players generate spatial cueing effects when viewed from an opponent's perspective. This could create a reaction time advantage when anticipating the direction of a normal move. A deceptive move is designed to turn this cueing advantage into a disadvantage. Acting on the basis of advance information, the presence of deceptive moves primes responses in the wrong direction, which may be only partly mitigated by delaying a response until veridical cues emerge."
https://openalex.org/W2140199302,"Fossil fuels are consumed so rapidly that it is expected that the planet resources will be soon exhausted. Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternative and inexpensive new technologies to produce sustainable fuels, for example biodiesel. In addition to hydrolytic and esterification reactions, lipases are capable of performing transesterification reactions useful for the production of biodiesel. However selection of the lipases capable of performing transesterification reactions is not easy and consequently very few biodiesel producing lipases are currently available. In this work we first isolated 1,016 lipolytic microorganisms by a qualitative plate assay. In a second step, lipolytic bacteria were analyzed using a colorimetric assay to detect the transesterification activity. Thirty of the initial lipolytic strains were selected for further characterization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 23 of the bacterial isolates were Gram negative and 7 were Gram positive, belonging to different clades. Biofuel production was analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography and revealed that 5 of the isolates produced biofuel with yields higher than 80% at benchtop scale. Chemical and viscosity analysis of the produced biofuel revealed that it differed from biodiesel. This bacterial-derived biofuel does not require any further downstream processing and it can be used directly in engines. The freeze-dried bacterial culture supernatants could be used at least five times for biofuel production without diminishing their activity. Therefore, these 5 isolates represent excellent candidates for testing biofuel production at industrial scale."
https://openalex.org/W2069813859,"We reported pearl oyster Pinctada fucata cDNA and genomic characterization of a new homeobox-containing protein, PfMSX. The PfMSX gene encodes a transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus. Analyses of PfMSX mRNA in tissues and developmental stages showed high expressions in mantle or D-shaped larvae. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) PfMSX binded to MSX consensus binding sites in the 5' flanking region of the Pif promoter. In co-transfection experiment PfMSX transactivated reporter constructs containing Pif promoter sequences, and mutation of the MSX-binding sites attenuated transactivation. A knockdown experiment using PfMSX dsRNA showed decreased Pif mRNA and unregular crystallization of the nacreous layer using scanning electron microscopy. Our results suggested that PfMSX was a conserved homeodomain transcription factor gene, which can activate Pif gene expression through MSX binding site, and was then involved in the mineralization process in pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. Our data provided important clues about mechanisms regulating biomineralization in pearl oyster."
https://openalex.org/W2013257507,"Estrogen influences memory formation and insulin sensitivity. Meanwhile, glucose utilization directly affects learning and memory, which are modulated by insulin signals. Therefore, this study investigated whether or not the effect of estrogen on memory is associated with the regulatory effect of this hormone on glucose metabolism. The relative expression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in the hippocampus of rats were evaluated by western blot. Insulin level was assessed by ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR, and spatial memory was tested by the Morris water maze. Glucose utilization in the hippocampus was measured by 2-NBDG uptake analysis. Results showed that ovariectomy impaired the spatial memory of rats. These impairments are similar as the female rats treated with the ERβ antagonist tamoxifen (TAM). Estrogen blockade by ovariectomy or TAM treatment obviously decreased glucose utilization. This phenomenon was accompanied by decreased insulin level and GLUT4 expression in the hippocampus. The female rats were neutralized with hippocampal insulin with insulin antibody, which also impaired memory and local glucose consumption. These results indicated that estrogen blockade impaired the spatial memory of the female rats. The mechanisms by which estrogen blockade impaired memory partially contributed to the decline in hippocampal insulin signals, which diminished glucose consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2032453861,"Background Temnospondyls are one of the earliest radiations of limbed vertebrates. Skeletal remains of more than 190 genera have been identified from late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic rocks. Paleozoic temnospondyls comprise mainly small to medium sized forms of diverse habits ranging from fully aquatic to fully terrestrial. Accordingly, their ichnological record includes tracks described from many Laurasian localities. Mesozoic temnospondyls, in contrast, include mostly medium to large aquatic or semi-aquatic forms. Exceedingly few fossil tracks or trackways have been attributed to Mesozoic temnospondyls, and as a consequence very little is known of their locomotor capabilities on land. Methodology/Principal Findings We report a ca. 200 Ma trackway, Episcopopus ventrosus, from Lesotho, southern Africa that was made by a 3.5 m-long animal. This relatively long trackway records the trackmaker dragging its body along a wet substrate using only the tips of its digits, which in the manus left characteristic drag marks. Based on detailed mapping, casting, and laser scanning of the best-preserved part of the trackway, we identified synapomorphies (e.g., tetradactyl manus, pentadactyl pes) and symplesiomorphies (e.g., absence of claws) in the Episcopopus trackway that indicate a temnospondyl trackmaker. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis shows that the Episcopopus trackmaker progressed with a sprawling posture, using a lateral-sequence walk. Its forelimbs were the major propulsive elements and there was little lateral bending of the trunk. We suggest this locomotor style, which differs dramatically from the hindlimb-driven locomotion of salamanders and other extant terrestrial tetrapods can be explained by the forwardly shifted center of mass resulting from the relatively large heads and heavily pectoral girdles of temnospondyls."
https://openalex.org/W2093927908,"Objective To analyze the relationship between primary health care utilization and extended health insurance coverage under the Seguro Popular (SP) among Mexican indigenous people. Methodology A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Mexican National Nutrition Survey 2012 (n = 194,758). Quasi-experimental matching methods and nonlinear regression probit models were used to estimate the influence of SP on primary health care utilization. Results 25% of the Mexican population reported having no health insurance coverage, while 59% of indigenous versus 35% of non-indigenous reported having SP coverage. Health problems were reported by 13.9% of indigenous vs. 10.5% of non-indigenous; of these, 52.8% and 57.7% respectively, received primary health care (p<0.05). Economic barriers were the most frequent reasons for not using primary health care services. The probability of utilizing primary health care services was 11.5 percentage points higher (p<0.01) for indigenous SP affiliates in comparison with non-indigenous, in similar socioeconomic conditions. Conclusion Socioeconomic conditions, not ethnicity per-se, determine whether people utilize primary health care services. Therefore, SP can be conceived as a public policy strategy which acts as a social buffer by enhancing health care utilization regardless of ethnicity. Further analysis is required to explore the potential gaps as a result of SP coverage among socially vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W1998754618,"Modulation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) has been shown to have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and several other physiological responses relevant to the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The importance of bradykinin and its receptors in mediating these responses is well documented, but the role of tissue kallikrein-1, the protease that generates bradykinin in situ, is much less understood. We developed and tested DM199, recombinant human tissue kallikrein-1 protein (rhKLK-1), as a potential novel therapeutic for T2D. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies suggest that DM199 increases whole body glucose disposal in non-diabetic rats. Single-dose administration of DM199 in obese db/db mice and ZDF rats, showed an acute, dose-dependent improvement in whole-body glucose utilization. Sub-acute dosing for a week in ZDF rats improved glucose utilization, with a concomitant rise in fasting insulin levels and HOMA1-%B scores. After cessation of sub-acute dosing, fasting blood glucose levels were significantly lower in ZDF rats during a drug wash-out period. Our studies show for the first time that DM199 administration results in acute anti-hyperglycemic effects in several preclinical models, and demonstrate the potential for further development of DM199 as a novel therapeutic for T2D."

This study was conducted to determine the influence of smoking and bilirubin levels on the risk of lung cancer in the Severance cohort study.This study included 68,676 Korean who received a health examination at Severance Health Promotion Center from 1994 to 2004. Serum bilirubin measurements within normal range were divided into tertiles whereas smoking states were divided as never-smokers, former smokers and current smokers. A diagnosis of lung cancer was coded as occurring based on the report from the National Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards model.At the end of the study period, 240 patients (men: 181, women: 59) developed lung cancer. Compared to those with bilirubin levels ≥ 1.0 mg/dL, HRs (95% CI) for lung cancer were 2.8 (1.8-4.2) for subjects having bilirubin levels from 0.2 to 0.7 mg/dL in men. When we stratified our analysis by smoking status, bilirubin consistently showed a protective effect on the risk of lung cancer on both never- and current smokers. Current smokers having bilirubin levels from 0.2 to 0.7 mg/dL had a risk of lung cancer by 6.0-fold higher than never-smokers with bilirubin levels ≥ 1.0 mg/dL in men.In this large prospective study, higher baseline bilirubin level in the normal range was associated with low risk of lung cancer. Smoking and low bilirubin levels were cumulatively associated with a higher risk of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1992829400,"Tumor is characterized by extensive heterogeneity with respect to its microenvironment and its genetic composition. We extend a previously developed monoclonal continuous spatial model of tumor growth to account for polyclonal cell populations and investigate the interplay between a more proliferative and a more invasive phenotype under different conditions. The model simulations demonstrate a transition from the dominance of the proliferative to the dominance of the invasive phenotype resembling malignant tumor progression and show a time period where both subpopulations are abundant. As the dominant phenotype switches from proliferative to invasive, the geometry of tumor changes from a compact and almost spherical shape to a more diffusive and fingered morphology with the proliferative phenotype to be restricted in the tumor bulk and the invasive to dominate at tumor edges. Different micro-environmental conditions and different phenotypic properties can promote or inhibit invasion demonstrating their mutual importance. The model provides a computational framework to investigate tumor heterogeneity and the constant interplay between the environment and the specific characteristics of phenotypes that should be taken into account for the prediction of tumor evolution, morphology and effective treatment."

All HCV isolates were genotyped by sequencing of the 5′UTR region and newly identified HCV isolates were identified. Specific universal primers targeting 5′UTR region were used for both amplification and sequencing of all isolates that resulted in 244 bp fragment which represent about 80% of 5′UTR region. Most of HCV isolates in this study were genotype 4 (76.4%) where only few isolates were recognized as genotype 1 (19.6%). All results were compared to HCV reference sequences from LOS ALAMOS HCV database, considering only the complete full genomes for the main phylogenetic analysis. Sequences that showed maximum identity (98% –100%) were selected. Most isolates were identical with HCV genotype 4 references. Some isolates were similar to different subtypes of HCV genotypes 4, 1 and 6. Phylogenetic analysis showed resemblance of most isolates to similar ones from the Far East, North America and Egypt. Using sequence Weblogo, Alignment analysis of isolated HCV genotypes 4 and 1 showed 92% and 95.5% nucleotide conservation, respectively. There was no predominant nucleotide in the varied sites, in both genotypes. All isolated sequences were submitted to GenBank database."
https://openalex.org/W1988620942,"The present report describes an animal model for examining the effects of radiation on a range of neurocognitive functions in rodents that are similar to a number of basic human cognitive functions. Fourteen male Long-Evans rats were trained to perform an automated intra-dimensional set shifting task that consisted of their learning a basic discrimination between two stimulus shapes followed by more complex discrimination stages (e.g., a discrimination reversal, a compound discrimination, a compound reversal, a new shape discrimination, and an intra-dimensional stimulus discrimination reversal). One group of rats was exposed to head-only X-ray radiation (2.3 Gy at a dose rate of 1.9 Gy/min), while a second group received a sham-radiation exposure using the same anesthesia protocol. The irradiated group responded less, had elevated numbers of omitted trials, increased errors, and greater response latencies compared to the sham-irradiated control group. Additionally, social odor recognition memory was tested after radiation exposure by assessing the degree to which rats explored wooden beads impregnated with either their own odors or with the odors of novel, unfamiliar rats; however, no significant effects of radiation on social odor recognition memory were observed. These data suggest that rodent tasks assessing higher-level human cognitive domains are useful in examining the effects of radiation on the CNS, and may be applicable in approximating CNS risks from radiation exposure in clinical populations receiving whole brain irradiation."

Microwear patterns between ecologically equivalent placental and marsupial mammals are found to be statistically indistinguishable, indicating that microwear can be used to infer diet across the mammals. Microwear data were compared to body size and molar shearing crest length in order to develop a system to distinguish the diet of mammals. Insectivores and carnivores were difficult to distinguish from herbivores using microwear alone, but combining microwear data with body size estimates and tooth morphology provides robust dietary inferences. This approach is a powerful tool for dietary assessment of fossils from extinct lineages and from museum specimens of living species where field study would be difficult owing to the animal's behavior, habitat, or conservation status."
https://openalex.org/W2083311564,"The availability of high quality resources is an important factor driving community structure and reproductive mode of animals. Parthenogenetic reproduction prevails when resources are available in excess, whereas sexuality correlates with resource shortage. We investigated the effect of resource availability on the community structure of oribatid mites in a laboratory experiment. Availability of food resources was increased by addition of glucose to leaf litter and reduced by leaching of nutrients from leaf litter. Experimental systems were incubated at three different temperatures to establish different regimes of resource exploitation. Community structure of oribatids and numbers of eggs per female were measured over a period of ten months. We expected the density of oribatid mites to decline in the reduced litter quality treatment but to increase in the glucose treatment. Both effects were assumed to be more pronounced at higher temperatures. We hypothesized sexual species to be less affected than parthenogenetic species by reduced resource quality due to higher genetic diversity allowing more efficient exploitation of limited resources, but to be outnumbered by parthenogenetic species in case of resource addition due to faster reproduction. In contrast to our hypotheses, both sexual and parthenogenetic oribatid mite species responded similarly with their densities declining uniformly during incubation. The parthenogenetic Brachychthoniidae and Tectocepheus dominated early in the experiment but were replaced later by parthenogenetic Desmonomata and Rhysotritia. In parthenogenetic species the number of eggs per female increased during the experiment while the number of eggs in sexual females remained constant or decreased slightly; in general, egg numbers were higher in sexual than in parthenogenetic species. The results indicate that for sustaining oribatid mite populations other resources than litter and associated saprotrophic microorganisms are needed. They also indicate that there are two groups of parthenogenetically reproducing species: exploiters of easily available resources and consumers of leaf litter associated resources."

We studied I400V-edited Kv1.1 channels in more detail and found that Kv1.1I400V gave rise to much smaller whole-cell currents than Kv1.1. To elucidate the mechanism behind this current reduction, we conducted electrophysiological recordings on single-channel level and did not find any differences. Next we examined channel surface expression in Xenopus oocytes and HeLa cells using a chemiluminescence assay and found the edited channels to be less readily expressed at the surface membrane.

RNA editing modulates the binding of drugs and highly unsaturated fatty acids to the open pore of Kv potassium channels.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2101-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that both channel versions form functional channel tetramers and coassemble to form “heteromeric” channels of Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V. Several consequences of Kv1.1I400V editing have been described so far. Channel tetramers containing edited Kv1.1I400V subunits have an altered pharmacology and a reduced sensitivity to blockage by highly unsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonic acid or anandamide (9.Decher N. Streit A.K. Rapedius M. Netter M.F. Marzian S. Ehling P. Schlichthörl G. Craan T. Renigunta V. Köhler A. Dodel R.C. Navarro-Polanco R.A. Preisig-Müller R. Klebe G. Budde T. Baukrowitz T. Daut J. RNA editing modulates the binding of drugs and highly unsaturated fatty acids to the open pore of Kv potassium channels.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2101-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using the kainic acid rat epilepsy model, we found that Kv1.1 editing levels are increased in the entorhinal cortices of chronic epileptic rats compared with healthy control animals (10.Streit A.K. Derst C. Wegner S. Heinemann U. Zahn R.K. Decher N. RNA editing of Kv1.1 channels may account for reduced ictogenic potential of 4-aminopyridine in chronic epileptic rats.Epilepsia. 2011; 52: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether seizures influence the editing rates or vice versa. In light of the relevance of Kv1.1 for brain physiology and pathophysiology, it is of great interest to learn more about the regulation of this channel by RNA editing. Here we describe, for the first time, that Kv1.1 RNA editing at the Ile-to-Val site in the central cavity influences channel trafficking, leading to reduced abundance of channels at the cell surface and, therefore, reduced current densities. These findings contribute to the already complex picture of Kv1.1 channel regulation by RNA editing. HEK293, HeLa, and CHO-K1 cells were cultivated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) or, in the case of CHO-K1, Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). For electrophysiological recordings or imaging experiments, cells were grown either on plastic (NUNC) or glass-bottom (WillCo) 35-mm Petri dishes, respectively. At a confluency of 60–70%, cells were transfected with FuGENE6 (Promega) or JetPRIME (Peqlab). For patch clamp and fluorescence imaging experiments, a total amount of 1 µg of cDNA/35-mm dish was used for transfection. Ovarian lobes were obtained from anesthetized Xenopus toads, separated mechanically with forceps, and then incubated for 60–120 min in an OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES) containing 2 mg/ml collagenase. Thus separated, oocytes were washed in ND96 solution (see below) supplemented with sodium pyruvate (275 mg/liter), theophylline (90 mg/liter), and gentamicin (50 mg/liter) and stored in the same solution at 18 °C before and after injection of cRNA. A volume of 50 nl of cRNA solution/oocyte was injected with a NanojectII microinjector (Drummond Scientific). All electrophysiological recordings where performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Whole-cell recordings were performed with an EPC10 amplifier (HEKA) 24–30 h after transfecting a total amount of 1 µg of cDNA/35-mm dish. Series resistance was compensated by 50%. The extracellular solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The intracellular solution was filtrated before use and contained 60 mm KCl, 65 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm K2ATP, 0.2 mm Na2GTP, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Single-channel recordings were carried out in the on-cell configuration with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) in combination with a PCI-MIO 16-XE-10 digitizer (National Instruments) 24–30 h after transfection. Single-channel data were analyzed with software on the basis of LabView (National Instruments) developed in our institute. The abovementioned extracellular solution was used as bath and pipette solution. Pipette resistances were ∼10 mΩ. For a detailed description of Kv1.1 single-channel analyses, see Ref. 9.Decher N. Streit A.K. Rapedius M. Netter M.F. Marzian S. Ehling P. Schlichthörl G. Craan T. Renigunta V. Köhler A. Dodel R.C. Navarro-Polanco R.A. Preisig-Müller R. Klebe G. Budde T. Baukrowitz T. Daut J. RNA editing modulates the binding of drugs and highly unsaturated fatty acids to the open pore of Kv potassium channels.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2101-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings of Xenopus oocytes were conducted on the first or second day after cRNA injection with a TurboTEC-10CD amplifier (Npi) in combination with a Digidata 1200 series (Axon Instruments). Extracellular solution for TEVC recordings (ND96) contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). 3 m KCl was used as intracellular solution. Pipette resistances were between 0.5–1.5 mΩ. Surface expression of Kv1.1 channel constructs was studied using a chemiluminescence-based assay. For wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V, we introduced, after the Gly-200 residue, an HA epitope with the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA into the first extracellular loop of the channel (Fig. 3B, inset). cRNA of HA-tagged channels was injected into Xenopus oocytes, and surface expression was analyzed after 48 h. First, oocytes were incubated in ND96 plus 1% BSA on ice for 30 min to reduce unspecific antibody binding, followed by incubation with primary antibody (rat anti-HA (Roche), 1:100) for 1 h, extensive washing, and incubation with secondary antibody (goat anti-rat-IgG, HRP-coupled (Dianova), 1:500) for 1 h. Oocytes were again washed extensively before they were placed individually into a vial with 20 µl of luminescence substrate (SuperSignal Femto (Thermo Scientific)). Light emission was detected with a GloMax luminometer (Promega). HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using jetPRIME (Peqlab). After 48 h, cells were fixed with 4% PFA (in PBS), washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (in PBS). Cells were stained with a monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody (HA probe (F-7), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed intensely with PBS. As a secondary antibody, an HRP-conjugated antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. After several washing steps with PBS, surface expression was measured in a luminometer (Glomax 20/20, Promega) using a luminogenic substrate (SuperSignal ELISA Femto, Pierce Biotechnology). To quantify the functional expression of Kv1.1, Kv1.1I400V, and Kv1.4 channel proteins, whole oocytes were lysed, and protein extraction was carried out as described previously (11.Rinné S. Renigunta V. Schlichthörl G. Zuzarte M. Bittner S. Meuth S.G. Decher N. Daut J. Preisig-Müller R. A splice variant of the two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1 with only one pore domain reduces the surface expression of full-length TREK-1 channels.Pflügers Arch. 2014; 466: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 oocytes were used for each lysis reaction. The oocytes were homogenized in 400 µl of lysis buffer (NaCl, 150 mm; Tris-HCl, 20 mm; Triton X-100, 1%; protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 10 µl (pH 7.5)). Insoluble material was separated by centrifugation (13,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. 15 µl of the supernatant were mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer, heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by immunoblotting. For the detection of untagged channels, anti-Kv1.1 (Alamone Laboratories) and anti-Kv1.4 primary antibodies (provided by J. Trimmer) were used. The binding of the primary antibodies was detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), respectively, and a chemiluminescent extended duration substrate (SuperSignal WEST Dura, Pierce). Uninjected oocytes were used as negative controls. Band intensities were analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For Western blot analysis in HeLa cells, 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, scratched from the bottom of the dish, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and 200 µl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris base, 50 mm; NaCl, 150 mm; Nonidet P-40, 1%; sodium desoxycholate, 0.25%; EDTA, 1 mm; and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 10 µl (pH 7.4)) was added. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. 16 µl of the protein-containing supernatant was mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer, denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min, and transferred to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For all Western blot analyses, Bradford assays were performed to ensure the loading of equal amounts of total protein. Ponceau S staining after blotting was used to verify correct protein transfer and ensure equal lane loading of Western blot analyses. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 µg of cDNA/dish and, 24 h later, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBS. The short fixation time was selected to prevent permeabilization of cell membranes. Primary antibody (rat anti-HA (Roche)) and secondary antibody (goat anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies)) were diluted 1:100 or 1:500 in PBS, respectively, and the incubation time for each antibody was 1 h. All washing steps were performed with PBS. For live cell imaging, CHO-K1 cells at a confluence of 60% were transfected using FuGENE6 (Promega). For cotransfections with trans-Golgi or ER markers, 1 µg of EGFP-tagged Kv1.1 or Kv1.1I400V cDNA and 0.5 µg of DsRed-tagged marker cDNA were used per dish. Both plasmids, pDsRed monomer trans-medial Golgi marker and pDsRed2 ER marker, were obtained from Clontech. For cotransfection of the edited and the non-edited channel, 1 µg of EGFP-tagged Kv1.1I400V cDNA and 1 µg of DsRed-tagged Kv1.1 cDNA were used. To label lysosomes, the culture medium was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 50 nm LysoTracker (Molecular Probes) 1 h before imaging. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an Axio Observer.Z1 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×60/1.40 oil DIC objective. During live cell imaging, cells were maintained at 37 °C using an objective heater (Bioptechs). For EGFP-tagged constructs, a standard Zeiss filter set (catalog no. 38HE) was used, and for DsRed-tagged constructs, a filter set from AHF Analysentechnik AG (Tübingen, Germany, catalog no. F46-005) was used. Images were taken with a Zeiss 12bit AxioCam MRm camera, and digital images were processed using Zeiss AxioVision software. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; n.s., no significant change). To compare electrophysiological characteristics of Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V, we individually transfected the two channel variants in HeLa cells and performed voltage clamp recordings in the whole-cell configuration. From a resting membrane potential of −80 mV, voltage steps between −70 and +50 mV were applied to activate the channels (Fig. 1A). In terms of kinetics, the current responses of Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V were indistinguishable. Plotting of the current-voltage relationship (I/V), analyzed from the current at the end of each activating voltage step (Fig. 1A, arrow), revealed strong differences between Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V (Fig. 1B). At +50 mV, we found a more than 50% reduction of the peak current densities in cells that were expressing Kv1.1I400V (25 ± 6 pA/pF) compared with Kv1.1-expressing cells (54 ± 7 pA/pF) (Fig. 1C). The conductance-voltage relationship (G/V) was, as described previously (8.Bhalla T. Rosenthal J.J. Holmgren M. Reenan R. Control of human potassium channel inactivation by editing of a small mRNA hairpin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), not changed significantly (Fig. 1D), and, therefore, an altered voltage dependence cannot explain the reduced current amplitudes of Kv1.1I400V. Thus, the reduced current density can result from differences in single-channel behavior, changes in synthesis or stability of the channel protein, or altered intracellular channel transport. With the following set of experiments, we investigated each of these possibilities to identify the mechanism underlying the reduced current density observed for the edited channels. Single-channel recordings were performed in the on-cell configuration from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with cDNA of either Kv1.1 or Kv1.1I400V (Fig. 2A). Using whole-cell current clamp measurements, we determined an average membrane potential of −47 ± 1 mV. Therefore, we could calculate the required holding potential in on-cell recordings to obtain distinct transmembrane potentials of the patch. Upon depolarization from −77 to +53 mV, some patches contained Kv1.1 channels, showing typical single-channel activities (Fig. 2A). In accordance with Kv1.1 single-channel recordings reported previously (12.Koren G. Liman E.R. Logothetis D.E. Nadal-Ginard B. Hess P. Gating mechanism of a cloned potassium channel expressed in frog oocytes and mammalian cells.Neuron. 1990; 4: 39-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13.Stühmer W. Stocker M.

Potassium channels expressed from rat brain cDNA have delayed rectifier properties.FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we observed Kv1.1 channel openings occurring in bursts (Fig. 2A). The overall appearance of Kv1.1I400V single-channel openings was very similar to that of Kv1.1 (Fig. 2A). We carried out a detailed analysis of the single-channel behavior (for a further description, see Ref. 9.Decher N. Streit A.K. Rapedius M. Netter M.F. Marzian S. Ehling P. Schlichthörl G. Craan T. Renigunta V. Köhler A. Dodel R.C. Navarro-Polanco R.A. Preisig-Müller R. Klebe G. Budde T. Baukrowitz T. Daut J. RNA editing modulates the binding of drugs and highly unsaturated fatty acids to the open pore of Kv potassium channels.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2101-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), starting with a comparison of the mean burst durations. Bursts were analyzed from the last 700 ms of 1-s pulses at +53 mV. To allow consistent analysis, single bursts were defined to be separated by closures >10 ms. Brief closures, usually <2 ms, occurred within bursts. The mean burst durations of Kv1.1 (298 ± 54 ms) and Kv1.1I400V (375 ± 92 ms) were not significantly different (Fig. 2B). From the same recordings, we obtained the general open probability (Po) of the channels. There was no significant difference in Po between Kv1.1 (0.65 ± 0.07) and Kv1.1I400V (0.51 ± 0.13) (Fig. 2C). When single-channel amplitudes are plotted versus the transmembrane potential, the single-channel conductance can be determined from the slope of the best fit line (examples are given in Fig. 2D). Single-channel conductances obtained this way were 11.5 ± 1.3 pS for Kv1.1 and 11.8 ± 2.5 pS for Kv1.1I400V. Therefore, the single-channel conductance was also not significantly different for the edited und unedited Kv1.1 channels (Fig. 2E). Summarizing, the single-channel characteristics of Kv1.1 are not influenced by the I400V editing, and changes in single-channel conductivity cannot explain the strongly reduced current amplitudes of Kv1.1I400V. Therefore, we set out to analyze whether the I400V editing alters surface expression of the channels. First, we wanted to verify the effect on current size in Xenopus oocytes to see whether this expression system was suitable to study surface expression. Therefore, Xenopus oocytes were injected with identical cRNA amounts of either Kv1.1 or Kv1.1I400V. 48 h later, we recorded current amplitudes at +40 mV using the TEVC technique. Reminiscent of our findings using HeLa cells (Fig. 1C), the average current amplitude of Kv1.1I400V-expressing oocytes was 63 ± 4% smaller than that of Kv1.1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3A). Next, we performed a surface expression assay. To this end, we introduced the sequence of an HA epitope into the extracellular S1-S2 linker of Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V. The HA-tagged channels thus obtained (Fig. 3B, inset) allow quantification of their surface expression in a luminometric assay. As a control, we performed voltage clamp recordings of the HA-tagged channels to ensure that the introduced epitope does not interfere with channel function (Fig. 3B). The difference in relative current amplitude between Kv1.1-HA and Kv1.1I400V-HA is very similar to that observed using the untagged channels (Fig. 3, A versus B). In the subsequent surface expression assay, Kv1.1I400V-HA channels showed only 45 ± 6% of the relative light units measured for Kv1.1-HA channels (Fig. 3C). Strikingly, the ratios (Kv1.1 versus Kv1.1I400V) of relative light unit reduction in the surface expression assay and the current reduction recorded in TEVC are very similar (Fig. 3, A and B versus C). These data propose a reduced surface expression of edited channels as a reason for the reduction in whole-cell current amplitude. However, it was unclear how the RNA editing of Kv1.1 leads to reduced surface expression of channels. There are basically two mechanisms that could account for this reduction in surface expression: reduced abundance of channel protein or altered intracellular channel trafficking to/from the membrane. We performed Western blot experiments of whole cell protein lysates from oocytes expressing Kv1.1 or Kv1.1I400V using an anti-HA antibody to detect global channel protein expression (Fig. 3D). Both channels were detected as double bands at ∼60 and 65 kDa because of different degrees of glycosylation (Fig. 3D), as described previously (14.Pineda R.H. Knoeckel C.S. Taylor A.D. Estrada-Bernal A. Ribera A.B. Kv1 potassium channel complexes in vivo require Kvβ2 subunits in dorsal spinal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, I400V editing does not alter the glycosylation pattern of Kv1.1 channels. Analysis of band intensities from four different Western blots revealed that there was also no significant difference in the protein amount between Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V (Fig. 3E). These data show that neither protein synthesis nor stability is affected by Kv1.1 editing, therefore suggesting that channel trafficking is altered. Next we addressed the question whether altered forward or backward trafficking is causing the reduced surface expression. Therefore, we incubated the injected oocytes for 24 h with dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that blocks endocytosis and, thus, “backward” trafficking of channels from the membrane. TEVC recordings revealed that dynasore incubation (40 µm) did not antagonize the reduction in current amplitudes observed for the I400V-edited channels (Fig. 4A). This suggests that reduced surface expression of Kv1.1I400V is not due to increased backward trafficking or endocytosis. We also performed experiments in Xenopus oocytes and HeLa cells (Fig. 4, B–E), blocking endocytosis by overexpression of the C-terminal part of the clathrin adaptor protein AP180 (AP180C) (15.Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The experiments performed in Xenopus oocytes using AP180C indicate that Kv1.1I400V has no change in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 4B). The results are virtually the same as those obtained with 40 µm dynasore (Fig. 4, A versus B). Next we performed experiments with AP180C using HeLa cells because endocytosis and the effects of AP180C have been studied previously primarily in mammalian cell lines. Here we studied Kv1.1 with an extracellular HA epitope and performed a luminometric assay detecting for the whole cell population only those Kv1.1 channels present at the plasma membrane. Because AP180C increases Kir2.1 surface expression by blocking channel endocytosis (18.Groves B. Gong Q. Xu Z. Huntsman C. Nguyen C. Li D. Ma D.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18103-18108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we used a Kir2.1 channel with an extracellular HA epitope as a positive control. As expected, the luminometric surface expression assay showed that AP180C increases the surface expression of Kir2.1 (Fig. 4C), whereas surface expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.1I400V was not affected (Fig. 4, D and E). Therefore, all sets of experiments using dynasore and AP180C in"

Aniracetam is believed to be therapeutically useful for enhancing cognition, alleviating anxiety, and treating various neurodegenerative conditions. Physiologically, aniracetam enhances both glutamatergic neurotransmission and long-term potentiation. Previous studies of aniracetam have demonstrated the cognition-restoring effects of acute administration in different models of disease. No previous studies have explored the effects of aniracetam in healthy subjects. We investigated whether daily 50 mg/kg oral administration improves cognitive performance in naïve C57BL/6J mice in a variety of aspects of cognitive behavior. We measured spatial learning in the Morris water maze test; associative learning in the fear conditioning test; motor learning in the accelerating rotarod test; and odor discrimination. We also measured locomotion in the open field test, anxiety through the elevated plus maze test and by measuring time in the center of the open field test. We measured repetitive behavior through the marble burying test. We detected no significant differences between the naive, placebo, and experimental groups across all measures. Despite several studies demonstrating efficacy in impaired subjects, our findings suggest that aniracetam does not alter behavior in normal healthy mice. This study is timely in light of the growing community of healthy humans self-administering nootropic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4241389055,"Background Improved diagnostics for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. However, test developers and investors require market size data to support new product development. This study assessed the served available market for TB diagnostics in Brazil in 2012 and the market segmentation in the public and private sectors. Methods Data were collected on test volumes done in the public and private sectors for the diagnosis of latent and active TB, drug susceptibility testing and treatment follow-up. Tests included were tuberculin skin tests, interferon-gamma releases assays, smear microscopy, solid and liquid cultures, nucleic acid amplification tests and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests. The data were collected by means of an electronic survey via the Brazilian State laboratories and from sales information provided by manufacturers. Test costs for the public sector were calculated using a components approach, while costs for the private sector were based on prices paid by patients. The overall market value (expenditure) for the entire country was calculated using the public sector test costs. Results During 2012, an estimated total of 2.4 million TB diagnostic tests were done in Brazil, resulting in an estimated overall market value of USD 17.2 million. The public sector accounted for 91% of the test volumes and 88% of the market value. Smear microscopy was the most commonly test (n = 1.3 million; 55% of total) at an estimated value of USD 3.7 million. Culture overall (n = 302,761) represented 13% of test volumes and 40% (USD 6.9 million) of the market value. On average, USD 208 was spent on TB diagnostics for every notified TB patient in Brazil, in 2012. Conclusion The TB diagnostics market value in Brazil in 2012 was over USD 17 million. These study results will help test developers to understand the current and potential market for replacement or add-on diagnostic technologies."

To address supply shortages and high safety risks from limited human donors, we recently developed recombinant technology to produce HSA from rice endosperm. To assess the risk potential of HSA derived from Oryza sativa (OsrHSA) before a First-in-human (FIH) trial, we compared OsrHSA and plasma-derived HSA (pHSA), evaluating the potential for an immune reaction and toxicity using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The results indicated that neither OsrHSA nor pHSA stimulated T cell proliferation at 1x and 5x dosages. We also found no significant differences in the profiles of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets between OsrHSA- and pHSA-treated cells. Furthermore, the results showed that there were no significant differences between OsrHSA and pHSA in the production of cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4. Our results demonstrated that OsrHSA has equivalent immunotoxicity to pHSA when using the PBMC model. Moreover, this ex vivo system could provide an alternative approach to predict potential risks in novel biopharmaceutical development."
